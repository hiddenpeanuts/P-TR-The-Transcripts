1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,240
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,400
Hey, we're going on a road trip to route 66,

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,480
to a barren route 66 in France.

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson's along for the ride.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm here, Parle Vue Francais, of course, as usual.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,560
We've done a little French lately, I feel like,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,280
and I'm excited about it.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
I guess really what I'm saying is we did an episode

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,360
about Armageddon, and that's what I'm remembering.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,020
And I actually have another French episode to pitch you guys,

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,680
and I should've done it off mic, but anyway,

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,520
Jason Sheridan is here too.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,400
Jason in first and then do the pitch, yeah.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey, what's going on?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,040
Baron, a ride that's barren in a weird way,

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,040
a barren in an incorrect route 66 kind of way.

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,880
Sure, yes, no, I don't think accuracy is in the picture here.

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,000
Some might say, like the French say,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,120
an attraction so small it's bone.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
Now that's the French.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
That's the right.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,720
There's a lot of top-notch French lately.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,560
What's your pitch?

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,640
Oh, what's your pitch?

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,560
French Street at Universal Hollywood,

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,080
whatever it's called.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,920
That little French street.

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,720
Where it says Mouin Rouge on it.

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,040
Yes, International Street.

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,800
It's got the little car with the sidecar in it.

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,640
You can take a picture in it,

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,960
I think that's on the street too.

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,800
Sure, yeah.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,600
I really like that street, honestly.

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
I've been up there alone a few times

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,440
in the last couple months, and I go,

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,400
you know, this street is a nice little thing here.

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,560
I think it's gonna be gone soon.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,080
I think it'll be replaced by more minions or something.

41
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,240
Well, there was a whole rationale

42
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,440
of what those were and why.

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,160
Supposedly those were backlot style sets

44
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,200
like you can film here,

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,160
and I doubt much of anything ever filmed there.

46
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,960
There's some event spaces over there as well.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,160
VIP lounge, I believe is over that area.

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,320
Yeah, but it is funny that there's just this little themed

49
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,200
country street there.

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,760
With no attractions.

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,680
Right.

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,880
Yeah, it's a confusing zone.

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,760
It's a confusing zone,

54
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,520
and there's other countries represented as well,

55
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,480
and I forget, there's an official name.

56
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,080
Isn't it International?

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,040
Yeah, something like that.

58
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,480
We'll say it on the episode, but I'm just saying.

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,560
We'll lock it down.

60
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
We'll lock it down.

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,080
I was like, we should really do this, I think.

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,920
This is good.

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
This is good content.

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,680
No attractions, we're in.

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
Yeah, no.

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,960
Somehow that became our wheelhouse.

67
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,200
I wanna be the champion of that hidden gem

68
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,720
in Universal Hollywood.

69
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,200
It's like, it feels untouched to me.

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
It feels like one of the last untouched places.

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Yeah, I like it.

72
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,960
And then there's a Mel's Diner right like 20 feet away.

73
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,040
Right, and there's a little bar also by the min,

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
it's right across from the Minions Ride.

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,160
We've talked about that, yeah.

76
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, yeah.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
So you just get like shots.

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Yeah, you could get hammered right across

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,800
from the Minions Ride. You can get hammered.

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,160
Yeah, the bar in Universal Florida

81
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,480
is like a full sit-down restaurant

82
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,800
with like fish and chips and you know,

83
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,520
meat pies or whatever.

84
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,920
And so this one is just like plastic shot glasses to go.

85
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,240
Yeah, so before we ever do the world showcase in Epcot,

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,560
we're gonna do this mini world showcase.

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,080
This little one that you,

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,960
there's no way you've spent time there

89
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,720
unless you're an annual pass holder.

90
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,560
Exactly.

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,480
Milling around depressed because every wave is 50 minutes

92
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,600
somehow despite there being not much to do in that.

93
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,360
There's like four rides in that park.

94
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,480
I guess that's why everybody just.

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,320
Yeah.

96
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,520
I do feel like it ramped up.

97
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,360
You go and just, where are we?

98
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,000
Only Transformers last time I was there was manageable.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
Transformers I got right on,

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,440
but everything else was.

101
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,840
Which works out for you, your favorite ride.

102
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,080
It's a pure ride to Rise of the Resistance.

103
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
The better ride between the two.

104
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,800
Transformers.

105
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,440
Are you fully sticking with that now?

106
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,680
Is that become the story?

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,040
I'd love to completely pick that as my new identity,

108
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,200
but now I'm just saying there's aspects of it.

109
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,120
That's all I'm saying.

110
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,720
But I do really like Transformers.

111
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,160
I still really like it.

112
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,720
I think it's really good.

113
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,480
And it does what I wanted as like a kid with a IP

114
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,440
that I liked.

115
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,200
That's all I'm saying.

116
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,280
So I'm not, I'd love to fully say all the prequels

117
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,760
are the best movies ever.

118
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,240
I'd love to fully say Avatar is going to be

119
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,120
the best movie of all time.

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
And I'd love to say Rise of the Resistance

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
is not as good as Transformers,

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,280
but I'm not completely there.

123
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
You wanna have these edgy opinions.

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,280
Yes, I wanna be an edge Lord like you are.

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,720
But I can't be.

126
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,080
The show's already got an edge Lord.

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,760
Back off, back off the edge.

128
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,040
We went for only room for one on this edge.

129
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,520
Back off with your edgy opinions like Avatar,

130
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,320
the most successful movie of all time is good.

131
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,520
Yes, that's true.

132
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,520
I did see Doctor Strange and the Avatar trailer

133
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,360
got a big cheer in the audience.

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,960
Well now, that seems odd to me because Vice Magazine,

135
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,080
a writer for Vice said that they heard

136
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,480
that somebody laughed at it in the theater.

137
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,480
And that was good enough for them to report

138
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
and print as facts.

139
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,560
Right, right.

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
Excellent journalism.

141
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,880
Well, my report is that people cheered

142
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,880
and somebody yelled, Jake Sully!

143
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
In the theater.

144
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,280
Wow.

145
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,720
Someone being you?

146
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,200
No, unless I had an out of body experience,

147
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,600
which is possible I suppose.

148
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,280
Like I Doctor Strange in the moment,

149
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,000
you know how like when he like hits Spider-Man

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,280
with his whatever magic and like his soul leaves his body,

151
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,040
that's possible where I was like kind of floating

152
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,720
above myself and I went, look at that guy.

153
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
He just yelled Jake Sully and it was me

154
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,680
and I didn't realize it.

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,760
You were avataring into a different body.

156
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,720
Watching yourself, imagine watching yourself

158
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,560
getting to experience the emotion.

159
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,680
That would be really, if it could be a three camera shoot

160
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,560
while I was watching Avatar so I could watch Avatar 2,

161
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,440
then watch a movie about me watching Avatar

162
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,480
and seeing all the times I like was elated,

163
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,600
all the times I would cry, all of that I think would be nice.

164
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,040
Well, you know, like you mentioned Vice Variety,

165
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,240
you know, the big trade magazine pointed out

166
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,560
that adults are going gaga for multiverse movies.

167
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
Oh, well, that's true.

168
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,120
Well, that's another, we can't talk about,

169
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,880
that's gonna open up a whole multiverse of conversation.

170
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Some might say they're going goo goo gaga.

171
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,760
These are grown adults you have to understand.

172
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,920
They have many complicated words at their disposal

173
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,200
and yet you talk to them after they see a multiverse movie

174
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,040
and they're all saying goo goo gaga.

175
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,280
They're all saying goo goo gaga.

176
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
But look, Jason and I are comic fans,

177
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,520
we've lived with multiverses our whole lives.

178
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,560
So, you know, this is no odd unique thing.

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,520
This is a normal Sunday for us.

180
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
Yeah.

181
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,840
You know, dealing with multiverses.

182
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,200
You were way ahead of the, yeah.

183
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
Yeah, it's a bunch of posers now

184
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,480
showing up at the multiverse club.

185
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Right, there was a cartoon 20 years ago

186
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
or 15 years ago already called Turtles Forever

187
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,160
where it was a multiverse of Ninja Turtles.

188
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,360
So, come on.

189
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,120
Come on.

190
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,720
Imagine the idea that's, why is it that suddenly studios

191
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,920
are excited about a mechanism where

192
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,840
we can throw a bunch of casts together?

193
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,080
Yeah, no, I don't know.

194
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
It's not about that.

195
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,080
It's about multi, I just, the studios just earnestly believe

196
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,560
that multiverses are fascinating.

197
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,680
They said this is a new interest of theirs.

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,520
Yeah.

199
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,120
They're into quantum physics, they're into multiverses.

200
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,080
Sure, yeah.

201
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,320
I just love how, again, everyone talks about it

202
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,440
with like politics and world events and stuff

203
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,920
that like in America everyone has like

204
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,080
a three month memory where it's just like,

205
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,560
okay, yeah, multiverse, like some sort of,

206
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,440
maybe all the characters are in one universe

207
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
or multiple universes and they come,

208
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,840
like imagine a dark universe, okay?

209
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
What would that be like?

210
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,480
The dark universe.

211
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,320
Like if the multiverse.

212
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,040
You're saying, how are we not talking about it?

213
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,840
And yet we spit on the dark universe.

214
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,320
If it just circles back around,

215
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,800
like I know there's ones I'm forgetting

216
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,880
where it's like they were trying to make like multi,

217
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,080
like shared universe.

218
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,600
Or shared universe is different than multiple.

219
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,760
But eventually it's just gonna tick back around.

220
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,920
Well, deepfake like Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi

221
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,000
would have met Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp,

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,320
the dark universe stars.

223
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,080
Oh, you think the old mummies would have met the new mummy.

224
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,920
I think there would have been a mummy multiverse movie.

225
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,760
Yeah.

226
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,360
People crying, people in tears.

227
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,720
Because they brought Boris back.

228
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,160
Boris, Brendan and Tom all together in a movie,

229
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,240
I think would have happened.

230
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,880
It still might happen, honestly.

231
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,720
Blah.

232
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
Blah.

233
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
What was that?

234
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
What was that?

235
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,760
I was trying to think,

236
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,200
what does deepfake Carrie Fisher say in Rogue?

237
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,040
What does she say?

238
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,880
She says, blah.

239
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
She says, blah.

240
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,680
Rebellions are built on hope.

241
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,520
Blah.

242
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,040
She's a vampire.

243
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
They fly now.

244
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,880
Blah.

245
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,720
Easy vampire.

246
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,560
Yeah.

247
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
Yeah.

248
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,040
So I think any of that's possible.

249
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,480
How many minutes has it been without Tom?

250
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,680
Without talking about, well, maybe we're,

251
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,520
are we avoiding it?

252
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,360
That's the question.

253
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,200
Well, much like people used to run from their lives

254
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,800
to their second family across the notable highway Route 66.

255
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,640
Wait, what?

256
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,480
Wait, what?

257
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,640
Route 66 is a, you're saying that this was a highway

258
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,080
to cheating to a point of Route 66.

259
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,800
To fleeing your responsibilities and starting life anew,

260
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,240
just driving east on that beautiful road,

261
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
the mother road.

262
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,920
That's what people did.

263
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,280
They, your, Route 66 existed to get people away

264
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,400
from their families?

265
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,720
I think it was a convenient byproduct.

266
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,560
Wait a minute.

267
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,400
You said secret family though.

268
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,000
So that actually to me indicates that people were going

269
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,720
back and forth on Route 66 to go

270
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,400
to their two separate families.

271
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,240
Yeah.

272
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,200
I mean, I think there's a lot of configurations.

273
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,440
Maybe I'm just combining two possible ones.

274
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,400
You hate this road.

275
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,360
This road led only to the death of the American family.

276
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,200
Yeah.

277
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,840
And the Barneys Beannery in West Hollywood.

278
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,880
Yes.

279
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,720
That's what?

280
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,560
That's Route 66.

281
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,320
The end of Route 66, the furthest west

282
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,200
is like where the Barneys Beannery in West Hollywood is.

283
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,160
It's that spot?

284
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah.

285
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
That's strange.

286
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,640
Oh.

287
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,480
Okay.

288
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
You knew this fact already?

289
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,320
I did know this fact.

290
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,640
Life is a highway, I would say.

291
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,760
Life is a highway.

292
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,600
Okay.

293
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,720
So let's talk about today's bad ride.

294
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,640
This is called Cars Road Trip.

295
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,240
And no, this is not something in Cars Land

296
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,560
in California Adventure that you have missed.

297
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,880
No, we haven't done any of those.

298
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,560
And who knows when we will.

299
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,120
We had to make it a priority to talk about

300
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
the weird jammed in Cars attraction

301
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,480
in the worst Disney park, Walt Disney Studios Paris.

302
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,080
I got excited about this when talking about

303
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,640
another horrible attraction from that park, Armageddon.

304
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,840
It's so insane.

305
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,120
I can't underline how insane and weird this park is.

306
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,960
Oh yeah.

307
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,560
And this one, this is essentially a new attraction

308
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,720
though a redress of something they had.

309
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,400
And it's weird, it's just, like I don't want to just,

310
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
hey, we're shitting on it to shit on it.

311
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,680
I find it fascinating.

312
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,520
Yeah, oh yeah.

313
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,120
This is a place that tourists pay to go.

314
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,080
Thousands of people, maybe, maybe less

315
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,160
according to some of the videos I've watched.

316
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,600
Technically, in theory, thousands of people

317
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,880
could go on this attraction every day.

318
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,720
And then you watch a video of it.

319
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,680
Why?

320
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,600
How is this what it came to?

321
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,960
Yeah, I mean, I have a lot of stuff

322
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,320
I'm fascinated by about this.

323
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,800
My initial fascination when they announced it

324
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,680
was the concept art that features an oil tanker

325
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,360
greeting an impending fiery death like it's an old friend.

326
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,240
That's the greatest part of the whole thing.

327
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
It's for sure.

328
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,040
It's the greatest part.

329
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,360
And then what it actually,

330
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,040
the execution is even weirder.

331
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,880
Yeah.

332
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,680
What else?

333
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Walt Disney Studios Park is one of those weird phrases

334
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,720
where it's just like, this is not, this doesn't make sense.

335
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,560
It's like, I think we mentioned when you brought us back

336
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,560
a blip shirts and the back of mine says, proud America.

337
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,400
Not proud American, proud America.

338
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,280
So it's just like a little off.

339
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,120
No one has said this before.

340
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,600
Walt Disney Studios Park, you find odd.

341
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,560
I find it odd because like Walt Disney Studios

342
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,160
would kind of make sense.

343
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,920
But also that's not really what they've called it

344
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,240
in years or if ever.

345
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,720
So it's just kind of weird because it's not a studio.

346
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,200
It's a simulation of a functioning movie studio.

347
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,040
It never was a studio.

348
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,000
It's not the only one of these in the world

349
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,560
where it's called studios

350
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,360
and then there never was a studio.

351
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,960
But what you'll find is I think a new universal studios

352
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,760
location just doesn't have that premise of sound stages

353
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
and we film things here anymore.

354
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,200
They've bailed on that.

355
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,600
But this was a park that was opened in 2002

356
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,000
kind of predicated on and you're gonna see

357
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
the magic of the movies and the magic of big sound stages.

358
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,120
But nothing ever was filmed there.

359
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,040
Nothing will be filmed there.

360
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,400
I guess besides that weird special I found

361
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,680
that ends with a big giant ghost of Cuba Gooding Jr.

362
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,760
Some things for that special were filmed

363
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,560
on the root of this attraction.

364
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,240
But that does not count.

365
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,160
You can't say we're gonna take you to a back lot

366
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,480
and then film things only at the opening of the back lot

367
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,520
and then never again.

368
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,360
That doesn't work.

369
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,200
Right.

370
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,120
Yeah, you found the one thing filmed there

371
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,240
outside of a handful of commercials.

372
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,600
Yeah, this ride.

373
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,760
Fuck it's.

374
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,760
People, when Pixar Pier opened,

375
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,280
we remember the discourse.

376
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,920
People were like, oh come on,

377
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,920
this is obviously 50% done.

378
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,800
It's not fully themed.

379
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,520
They took the California Scream and made it in Credit Coaster.

380
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,440
This is not even, they did an okay job,

381
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,960
but they obviously didn't have the biggest budget.

382
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,280
There's the, this, the in Credit Coaster makes,

383
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
this looked like it's Rise of the Resistance.

384
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,120
As far as-

385
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,360
Far as Transformers.

386
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,760
Far as Transformers is the best ride of all time.

387
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,680
The most emotional ride of all time.

388
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,720
You're speaking in emotions.

389
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,520
Yeah, yeah, emotion wise.

390
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,280
But yeah, like it's so, yeah,

391
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,560
imagine if like they had what feels like,

392
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,160
like what's minus like 50% of the budget,

393
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,040
75% of the budget, 90% less budget.

394
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,360
Like it feels like the cheapest version.

395
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Like imagine California Scream in

396
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,640
and they didn't even put any like static pictures

397
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,800
or they didn't change the mute.

398
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,600
Like it's just a truly like feels like a crazy,

399
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,080
like we had a week to do this.

400
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,840
We can build four things,

401
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,960
pick four things that we can get in here.

402
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,520
That's about all you see.

403
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,960
It is essentially a trip through an empty forest.

404
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,800
Yeah, right.

405
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Where like every, I don't wanna guess on the amount of miles,

406
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,360
but let's say it was a four mile journey.

407
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,520
You see one thing every mile.

408
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,640
Yeah.

409
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,080
And can I just say, I can't put my finger on it.

410
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,480
This forest doesn't sit right with me.

411
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,960
There's something about this woods.

412
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,160
I know it's art of fish.

413
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,680
I mean, I know it's created out of a dirt field.

414
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,280
Well, or, but is it?

415
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,680
I think what maybe,

416
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,640
I don't know what the landscape was like

417
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,480
around Disney studios or around in the Disneyland Paris

418
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,720
area in general,

419
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,160
but I think what's unselling to me

420
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,200
is the possibility that that's just how it came

421
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,440
because it doesn't feel like a magical rivers of America

422
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,680
kind of forest.

423
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,720
It feels like just,

424
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,720
this is the natural wilderness of this plot that they got.

425
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,320
I, okay.

426
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,680
I kind of see that.

427
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,440
It's just, I think it's just some of the trees

428
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,120
are pretty grown in and some of them are pretty low.

429
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,960
Route 66 is very long

430
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,400
and I'm sure there's some sections with woods.

431
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,120
Are you suspicious of low trees?

432
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,960
Is that what you're saying?

433
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,800
I don't know.

434
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,640
It just feels weird.

435
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,480
I'm sorry.

436
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,320
So you're saying like these,

437
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,160
I'm just trying to figure out exactly.

438
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,320
You're talking about like kind of these lower trees here.

439
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,200
Is that what you're saying?

440
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,840
Yeah. I think it's just the,

441
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,640
I think it's the lack of like fake desert.

442
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,440
I mean, you get it at the one point, you get it.

443
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,280
You know what it seems like.

444
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
Adapted thing.

445
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
But I think the most unnerving thing

446
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,640
is the very last set of characters you see appear to be

447
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,880
in the like killing field from Miller's crossing

448
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,960
where like the gangsters take everyone they need to off.

449
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,240
You know what it looks like?

450
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,680
And I'll, we'll talk about the Miller's crossing thing

451
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,720
in a second, but it looks like something like that.

452
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,920
Somebody just planted some Christmas trees

453
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,840
to sort of fill in the trees, like right around here.

454
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,880
So maybe some of the trees were planted.

455
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,080
Like this feels like maybe these were planted

456
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,520
to just make it not feel like there was a gap

457
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,560
between the gravel and the bigger trees.

458
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,480
I'm just saying like why else would it just be

459
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,240
running around a forest unless that's just what they.

460
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,560
I don't think I really have.

461
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,720
I don't think a lot of this forest is artificial.

462
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,920
Like I think I think it'd be more magical

463
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,880
if it wasn't just like.

464
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,480
Yeah, if they were imagineered trees,

465
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,560
they would look like immaculate and cool or something.

466
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,960
This just looks like whatever.

467
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,800
Yeah.

468
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,640
But I think.

469
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,280
It makes it all the stranger that this started at this.

470
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,520
This ride we're talking about is a recent redress

471
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,320
of a back lot tour and it made it really weird

472
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,200
in that back lot tour that well, then if it's a back lot,

473
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,280
why are we just driving through empty featureless forest

474
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,040
for so long with sometimes props sitting next to it?

475
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,280
That's not what a back lot is like.

476
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,680
No.

477
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,480
So yeah, that's the whole thing.

478
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,280
We really, we should have maybe,

479
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,400
we shouldn't have done both things

480
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,640
because there's too much, the original tour and this,

481
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,640
but it is, there's so much confusing stuff

482
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,640
about just the initial version that then compounds

483
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,800
into this even more baffling version.

484
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,640
My argument for addressing any of it now would be,

485
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,000
are we really gonna wanna come back?

486
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,840
I mean, you're doing with it.

487
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,600
Well, I actually haven't looked at the original version.

488
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,200
I'm kind of in the dark.

489
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,320
So we're doing like, yeah, we're, this is the,

490
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,280
we'll do a prequel later maybe.

491
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,120
Okay.

492
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,960
Yeah.

493
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,800
Do we really?

494
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,640
I don't know, I'm not sure.

495
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,000
Do we really want to do a,

496
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,520
let's back up and talk about this awful studio tour.

497
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,600
Your best hope, Scott, is that we just forget.

498
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,440
Yes, that's right.

499
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,760
Because Jason and I forget, which is very possible.

500
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,000
I forget everything these days as I get older.

501
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,880
Yeah, or it's like a Tuesday and you missed a flight

502
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,560
and you're stuck and Mike and I have to do a second gate

503
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,440
because it's like the next day is last Wednesday of the month

504
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,200
and we're just cheering like,

505
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,040
Also, you know what?

506
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,600
French studio tour, French studio tour.

507
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,400
As you know on the show, the longer,

508
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
the more you protest and the more it grows in my brain.

509
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,120
Oh God.

510
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,960
That's the problem.

511
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,720
Okay, so separate.

512
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,520
Well, I'm just saying, I think the way to handle me

513
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,680
and Jason with this type of thing from now on

514
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,320
is when we go, maybe we should have done another topic

515
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,480
and you go, yeah, for sure.

516
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,920
And then I think that won't even register.

517
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,080
If I challenge or go, ugh.

518
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,200
I think that's probably what it is, yeah.

519
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,320
Okay, all right.

520
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,600
Yeah, because an elephant never forgets and neither do I.

521
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,000
Unless you were casually agreed with.

522
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,640
Unless you were casually agreed with.

523
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,320
Oh, well, yeah, it just backs up my greatness.

524
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,720
Then the elephant goes, yeah, it's great.

525
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,560
Yeah, terrific.

526
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,640
Okay, okay, well then where are we?

527
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,040
What do you wanna talk about?

528
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,880
Oh no, we're talking about the cars.

529
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,080
We're talking about cars.

530
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,920
Yeah.

531
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,760
Back lot tour.

532
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,360
Okay, it was an unpleasant tram tour attraction.

533
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,200
Yes.

534
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,120
Which will be its own unpleasant episode now, seemingly.

535
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,440
I don't want to, actually, I don't wanna do it.

536
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,720
Yeah, see, that's what I'm saying.

537
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,200
I think we can do it in five minutes.

538
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,440
Here's what I'm, okay.

539
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,680
It's kind of a mystery to me.

540
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,880
I don't know how I feel about it, you know?

541
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,480
Okay, they built this studio park.

542
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,560
We gotta do, all right, none of these have ever

543
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,800
not had a tram tour.

544
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,240
We have to do a tram tour.

545
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
There's no other option.

546
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
They could not, because also,

547
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,920
that's just gonna flesh out the acreage.

548
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,520
If we make everybody get on a tram

549
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,880
and then we take them somewhere,

550
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,240
now we put that on the map

551
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
and it looks like we've got way more park

552
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,960
than we actually have, because this was the smallest park

553
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,080
ever, truly under, in a 10 minute walk,

554
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,240
you could go from one end to the other,

555
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,720
go all the way to Aerosmith Alley and back.

556
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,000
So tram tour is great.

557
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,960
That's gonna increase the acreage by a lot.

558
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,400
So there was this strange back lot tour open

559
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,440
from 2002 to 2020.

560
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,440
And the main feature of it is that you saw some sets

561
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,600
from the movie, Rain of Fire.

562
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,960
First thing number one, Rain of Fire not filmed there,

563
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,760
filmed in England, but they moved some sets over

564
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,000
and rearranged them like they might've looked.

565
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,920
Okay, now thing number two, anyone tell me,

566
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,360
just off of what you know right now,

567
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,560
any facts about Rain of Fire?

568
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,080
Sure, starring Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale,

569
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,600
post-apocalyptic future where dragons are real

570
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,880
and they've destroyed much of cities and humankind

571
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,760
and conventional weapons don't really work,

572
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,200
I think, against them, so it's a lot of harpoons

573
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,840
and edged weapons, that sort of thing.

574
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,080
You are an expert in Rain of Fire.

575
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,120
Yeah, I've never seen it either.

576
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,440
It was just a slow part of that summer

577
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,480
and Rain of Fire was on trailers played a lot

578
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,040
before movies, before TV shows,

579
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,960
a lot of Access Hollywood extra coverage.

580
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,400
Could you have done any of that?

581
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,520
I think I knew McConaughey, but I think that's about it.

582
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,360
You knew McConaughey.

583
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,200
Dragon, McConaughey.

584
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,000
It's a rare movie where Bale talks like Bale.

585
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's that really thick.

586
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,840
Oh, right.

587
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,080
What are you talking about?

588
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,400
What are you talking about?

589
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,040
The yelling at the through voice.

590
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,360
Whatever his natural accent is.

591
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,200
I have just the briefest clip of the trailer of Rain of Fire,

592
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,680
which might be lodged in your brain,

593
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,360
but it kind of spells out the rules of Rain of Fire.

594
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,360
It makes me, this movie sounds like such bullshit nonsense.

595
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,920
I almost want to watch it.

596
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,000
There's nothing magical about it.

597
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,800
They made it flesh and blood.

598
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,600
You take out their heart, you bring down the beast.

599
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,200
You bring down the beast.

600
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,040
He's sort of flesh and blood.

601
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,240
Bring down the beast.

602
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,600
Swinging a massive axe, as that line is said.

603
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,440
He of course,

604
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,160
Vati McConaughey of course plays Denton Van Zan,

605
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,520
who is a sworn enemy of the dragons.

606
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,360
Denton Van Zan.

607
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,000
Because he watched his mother, Mama Van Zan.

608
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,680
Van Zan, not Van Zant like little Stephen.

609
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,440
No, not related to Stephen Van Zant, no.

610
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,600
Van Zan.

611
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,640
Van Zan.

612
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,560
So dear Mama Van Zan,

613
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,440
he watched get killed by one of the first dragons.

614
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,080
He also, from what I could tell from clips,

615
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,040
he takes time to see.

616
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,920
He explains, they live on ash.

617
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,880
They eat ash.

618
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,000
They eat ash?

619
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,920
They eat ash.

620
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,560
This is the rules of dragons in this movie

621
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,160
that you don't,

622
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,120
they don't shoot fire at you because they're mad at you.

623
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,680
They shoot fire at you to make you into ash

624
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,720
and then eat the ash.

625
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,240
They don't wanna eat you.

626
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,040
They have no interest in meat or muscles or skin.

627
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,920
They want to eat ash.

628
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,160
Well, this sounds like it's really filling out

629
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,400
the studio tour episode if we combine it

630
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,160
with a full rain of fire viewing.

631
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,960
But yeah, you flush it out with a rain of fire watch down.

632
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,360
Is that in any dragon canon for any dragon story

633
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,840
that they eat the ash?

634
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,120
Yeah, rain of fire.

635
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,720
The main dragon canon.

636
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,600
Yeah, or the most important one.

637
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Wow.

638
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,800
I almost like it.

639
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,280
I agree with your question,

640
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,360
but I almost like it the most

641
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,120
because they made up a dragon rule.

642
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,560
They eat ash.

643
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,440
I mean, look, I like the idea of it.

644
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,360
Am I comfortable with it sounding a little bawdy

645
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,280
because we keep saying it so much?

646
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,680
If we think about it.

647
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,440
Oh, you're the one with the dirty mind.

648
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,960
I never, that wouldn't have occurred to me.

649
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,800
Did that occur to you?

650
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,520
So it sounds like somebody with a lisp saying,

651
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,160
we know what it sounds like.

652
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,280
Look, I'm on Twitter.

653
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,400
I see what the perverts write about this type of thing.

654
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,240
I see that.

655
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,840
And so that's what it sounded like to me.

656
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,360
I'm so sorry for.

657
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,560
Eating pushy and eating ash.

658
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,360
Pursing Sarah.

659
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,880
Pushy.

660
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,200
That may be the worst thing I've ever heard, actually.

661
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,280
Eating pushy.

662
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,120
Just pushy.

663
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,080
Well, keep in mind, I'm doing,

664
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,760
this is not, this is McConaughey saying it.

665
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,920
So in the world of Rain of Fire, pushy is its own.

666
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,120
I'm gonna say this because of the Patreon.

667
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,240
Wet ass pushy.

668
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,800
Wet ash pushy.

669
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,120
Ash pushy.

670
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,280
Oh right, wet ash pushy.

671
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,760
Yeah, you're doing that too.

672
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,600
Okay, well.

673
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,840
All right, well, we're really letting it all hang out.

674
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,160
So that's what, so is a tour that taught you about eating ash.

675
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,760
You went to a French field to learn about eating

676
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,840
and how to eat ash.

677
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,200
Like every, every adolescent does.

678
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,760
What was the time in your life?

679
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,680
Basically what this was,

680
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,560
so there were two major tent poles on this tour.

681
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,320
One was that you go to the sets of Rain of Fire,

682
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,160
you see the ash, and you wonder how it was eaten

683
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,280
or will be eaten.

684
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,400
And then, and there's like a fireball

685
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,720
that shoots out at you, not from a dragon.

686
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,080
They didn't even set up like a fake dragon to do it.

687
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,920
Just a fireball comes at you.

688
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,600
You kinda go, whoa.

689
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,960
That is the finale of the tour, is a brief fireball.

690
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,040
In the middle of it is the thing that they kept.

691
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,600
So Rain of Fire sets are gone.

692
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,880
They are ash now.

693
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,800
They're all ash.

694
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,440
That's all gonna be the land used for the redevelopment

695
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,200
of this play that will hopefully will be good

696
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,360
in this frozen and there's rise resistance

697
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
and all that stuff.

698
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,960
What they kept was Catastrophe Canyon,

699
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,160
which is a thing that's been in Florida

700
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,840
or was in Florida for a long time.

701
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,360
It was like there, invented from the ground up,

702
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,400
earthquake kind of thing where that whole tram shakes

703
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,840
and there's a bunch of fire, controlled fire effects,

704
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,320
and then a big flooding.

705
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,840
I always liked that in Florida.

706
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,000
Impressive fun in Florida.

707
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,600
I think they probably did the math.

708
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,360
Well, that is red rocks.

709
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,440
That's fake rocks that are in the realm

710
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,720
of Radiator Springs a little bit.

711
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,400
Kind of the only thing in the realm of Radiator Springs

712
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,120
besides the cast member, besides the characters.

713
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,920
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,760
But all right, that's good.

715
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,160
We don't have to rebuild that.

716
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,640
So maybe from that starting point,

717
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,800
we can make up a whole new cars thing

718
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,280
on the backs of this attraction,

719
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,880
which by the way, the previous, the tram tour,

720
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,760
you ride out, you pass by some props,

721
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,960
you go through Catastrophe Canyon, you come back,

722
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,640
you see the same props you saw.

723
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,680
Then you pass by the line, you watch the people

724
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,480
in the line where you just were.

725
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,040
Then you go watch, then you go look at the ash

726
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,080
and then you come back.

727
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,120
So this is a tour where you see the same things twice,

728
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,480
including the line.

729
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,960
And you have to imagine there was a lot of like

730
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,080
the misery of the people trapped on this tour,

731
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,360
staring down the people in the line

732
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,000
who was looking for like, is this line worth it?

733
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,960
And the people on the tram going, I'm afraid not.

734
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,760
I cannot lie to you, sir.

735
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,800
This is like Johnny Gargano's nightmare

736
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,480
of the being on the Carousel of Progress,

737
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,400
repeating the first few seeds

738
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,120
and then doing the whole show again.

739
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,040
Backing up.

740
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,400
I have to see the 102 Dalmatians car again.

741
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,600
Two, 102 Dalmatians.

742
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,520
Imagine like Space Mountain to Disneyland.

743
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,200
It's so fun when the cars come back in

744
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,680
because like the line and the unloading area is same place.

745
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,480
So you see everyone clapping and excited

746
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,600
how fun that ride was.

747
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,720
I can't wait to get on it.

748
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,920
Imagine everyone would just dower after every like.

749
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,600
Well, we did it.

750
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,200
It was accomplished.

751
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,360
The jet or whatever it is,

752
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,040
there were spaceship rockets back in

753
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,280
and everyone was just like.

754
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,560
I got to sit for a while.

755
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,880
Being on a bench that moves is a novelty.

756
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,520
People in the, why 200 years ago,

757
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,560
this wouldn't have been possible.

758
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,200
If the rocket jet or whatever it is flies back in

759
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,560
and everyone, there's just like a big,

760
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,080
like a big exhale from all the riders.

761
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
And then they come for a cigarette.

762
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,200
Group sigh.

763
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Now, have they changed this effect?

764
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,400
Has there anything other than a group sigh

765
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,800
from this new attraction?

766
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,640
I am not sure.

767
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,960
Let's talk about what happens on this new.

768
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,720
What do you see on Cars Road Trip?

769
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,280
Well, first of all, it was supposed to be,

770
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,320
I think they were gonna call it Route 66,

771
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,360
but that trademark is taken in France.

772
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,920
So they couldn't call it that.

773
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,680
Yes, specifically taken by a group called Tempting Brands

774
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,040
who owns the brands for Route 66,

775
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,640
a company called General Magic,

776
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,680
and then a luxury high-end clothing company

777
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,840
called Marie Antoinette,

778
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,320
which seems questionable that your high-end

779
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,720
like sleepwear and lingerie is named after Marie Antoinette.

780
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,760
What happened at the end for her?

781
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,760
Well, they're grabbing appealing parts

782
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,680
of all of our history of American and European history.

783
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,720
Yeah, just a phrase, Tempting Brands,

784
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,640
that it's got a certain odd,

785
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,240
it's not boring enough as King Feature Syndicate,

786
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,720
but it's got a weirdness to it for sure.

787
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
It's so uneasy.

788
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,560
It's interesting.

789
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,480
It's more interesting than King Feature Syndicate.

790
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,320
Yeah.

791
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,160
There's a name, a soul,

792
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
and yeah, not the actual idea of it.

793
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,680
King Feature Syndicate's so exciting.

794
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,520
They have Beetle Bailey,

795
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,800
but I'm saying Tempting, it sounds more interesting.

796
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
It sounds more intriguing.

797
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
You have to almost have to say,

798
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,200
you can't just say Tempting Brands.

799
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,680
Like you have to say Tempting Brands.

800
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,520
Tempting Brands.

801
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,840
Tempting is a word you have to say.

802
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,800
I guess I just said it boring, but Tempting, Tempting.

803
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,760
So Tempting Brands struck,

804
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,880
so this had to be called Cars Road Trip,

805
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,440
and thus they laid out a bunch of big letters

806
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,640
that say road trip,

807
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,080
and that is what you're greeted by

808
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,040
when you get on the Trant.

809
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,480
Now you're thinking, okay, I'm entering the world of cars,

810
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,480
so is this going to be a race?

811
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,120
Am I gonna climb aboard a car

812
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,080
and experience life from a car's point of view?

813
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,520
And then a slow moving tram pulls up without a face.

814
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,560
It is the way you are on is not an alive car,

815
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,640
which I don't understand.

816
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,200
Maybe you're, I guess we are starting in the human world

817
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,360
and making our way into the cars world.

818
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,040
This is, we're entering the alternate cars dimension

819
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,560
where anything with wheels has a face and eyes.

820
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,320
Is there a Trant, is there,

821
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,000
Scott, you've watched the Cars movies recently, right?

822
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,080
Yeah, they're on a little less these days, mercifully.

823
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,320
Okay. Yeah, there's been a...

824
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Are there trams in the Cars universe?

825
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,120
I don't know if I've seen a tram.

826
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,320
There's logistics there where,

827
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,880
who's the character, Mac, the truck,

828
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,840
the Lightning McQueen sleeps in.

829
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,720
Yeah, he goes into his butt.

830
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,280
See, that's what you, you're tempted to say that.

831
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,560
However, from watching it many times over,

832
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,880
I've learned that his trailer is not, yes.

833
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,120
The truck is only its head.

834
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,040
So anything that removes from the body.

835
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,720
So yeah, unfortunately it is not his butt.

836
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,080
His butt would just be like a tailpipe, I guess.

837
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,920
I actually didn't realize that.

838
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,760
I didn't realize that

839
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,760
because I had the note, their ass catches on fire

840
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,360
at one point in this ride.

841
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,640
Oh, so the tanker is not its body.

842
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,280
Well, we just explained something about, you know what?

843
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,040
Yes, I had the exact same thought

844
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,360
because at the height of the now Cars,

845
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,480
Tastrophe Canyon segments. Cars, Tastrophe Canyon,

846
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,920
which I kinda like.

847
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,760
That's okay. That's okay.

848
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,600
That is, but yeah, I agree.

849
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,640
It has the very convoluted, it has an aftershock.

850
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,280
It's like a freak of nature.

851
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,640
It's a canyon that is an aftershock every minute

852
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,080
is the justification for what's going on.

853
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,160
Oh, really?

854
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah.

855
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,840
Oh, crazy.

856
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,660
It's a nightmare.

857
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,500
It's weird though.

858
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,400
It's a play on, it's a pun of Catastrophe Canyon,

859
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,800
a name that Disney made up.

860
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,640
Yes.

861
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,560
Like why, so it's not like doing the Grand Carzian

862
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,840
or something. Right.

863
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,400
Or it's something that exists.

864
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,200
Right.

865
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,720
It's a parody of, or not a, I guess it's kind of a parody.

866
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,320
It's like doing Walt Drives Knee Studios.

867
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,080
Mm-hmm, which is pretty good too.

868
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,160
That's okay. Yeah. Yeah.

869
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,760
Yeah. That was, that was, that was a,

870
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,380
not a bad thing to produce quickly.

871
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,120
So anyway, what we were saying was

872
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,120
things build to a torrent in Cars, Tastrophe Canyon

873
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,920
to where this tanker truck, who is not Mack,

874
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,240
because he's painted blue. Right.

875
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,600
He is a Dinoco fuel truck,

876
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,340
which is the consistent Pixar gas

877
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,880
going all the way back to Toy Story.

878
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,720
Yes, right, right.

879
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,440
It's the gas station where Woody and Buzz get lost

880
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,680
and used in the Cars, the Cars-iverse.

881
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,760
A Dinoco truck gets lit on fire.

882
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,120
He is on fire, but I guess we explained it.

883
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,800
It isn't his ass.

884
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,260
I get a, anything that attaches to a truck.

885
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,120
So he feels no pain in that moment

886
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
when he gets lit on fire. Right.

887
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,240
Yeah. It is not him.

888
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,000
He's kind of amused.

889
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,800
He's speaking in French.

890
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,240
I couldn't really catch what he was saying.

891
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,400
Yeah. I couldn't really catch what he was saying.

892
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,240
I couldn't really find a translation.

893
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,160
Yeah. Well, if he's French though,

894
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,360
he's always lighting himself accidentally on fire

895
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,640
with his cigarettes.

896
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,160
Yeah. So.

897
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,480
He seems amused though.

898
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,380
Again, the fire doesn't, the fire like starts on his ass.

899
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,080
It's not like the concept, his non-ass, excuse me.

900
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,560
It's not like he's, he's kind of looking at,

901
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,200
and the concept art is looking at the fire and smiling.

902
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,880
The fire kind of happens all around him, but he doesn't see,

903
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,160
he seems kind of amused.

904
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,120
And then the water rushes in and puts everything out.

905
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,640
Because he knows that that's going to happen.

906
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,560
Like, is this him doing an illusion?

907
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Is this a, like lighting yourself on fire

908
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,200
on stage in a magic show?

909
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,600
Oh, right. Yeah.

910
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,560
I guess so.

911
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,480
Is he like, he's like an American expat

912
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,680
sitting at a French like cafe.

913
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,240
And he doesn't even have to order anymore.

914
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,080
They just know him.

915
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,040
So they just bring him his espresso and he has this cigarette

916
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,920
and they light a cigarette and he doesn't even need to,

917
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,040
he just leads the money when he's done.

918
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,960
And they just, they just keep bringing it, you know?

919
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,080
Maybe. So he's, he's out in this French field.

920
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,600
Like this is how he gets his jollies for the day.

921
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,000
This is his routine.

922
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,400
He likes a lot of everything around him to light on fire.

923
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,360
Maybe because when it's all said and done,

924
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,920
he wants to eat some ash.

925
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,200
That's why he's smiling so big being around that fire.

926
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,320
It's like a car dragon.

927
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,400
It's a nod to the Ernest, Ernest Hemingway's book.

928
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,840
I think it's, The Sun Also Rises.

929
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,200
It's about a World War I, like American veteran,

930
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,600
I think just bumming around Paris.

931
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,320
And it's often alluded to in the book,

932
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,720
but they can't come out and say it

933
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,680
because of the time period that like,

934
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,120
his dicks don't work from the war.

935
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,880
So like he's very depressed.

936
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,960
So maybe this is the version.

937
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,280
This is a nod to that.

938
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,600
He's just sitting in the Catastrophe Canyon

939
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,240
waiting to eat ash because his car's dick don't work no more.

940
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,400
The Sun Also Rises, that's the movie with Robert Evans,

941
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,440
Evans is in?

942
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,280
That's right.

943
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,120
Yeah.

944
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,960
It's the kid stays in the picture.

945
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,800
Kid stays in the picture.

946
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,880
So I always think of when I hear the Sun Also Rises,

947
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,720
the Sun Also Rises.

948
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
That's how I think of it.

949
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,640
So why wasn't this like, when they made it as a movie,

950
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,360
it should have been called his dick don't work no more.

951
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,600
Imagine the box office for that.

952
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,440
Or did he produce it?

953
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,520
I'm sorry, he's not in it.

954
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,160
He might've just produced it.

955
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,880
But he's involved enough to have to say it.

956
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,760
Yeah, maybe that's the one where he goes like,

957
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,720
Ava Goddard, I had a fling.

958
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,680
That's like he was producing Sun Also Rises.

959
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,520
I forget.

960
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,340
No, I think he's in it.

961
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,920
I think the producer says the kid stays in it.

962
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,640
No, that's a different movie.

963
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,920
That's the one he's like the Matador or something.

964
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,840
I think he's the, I think there's both fighting.

965
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,680
Oh, well maybe.

966
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,960
Sun Also Rises, there's both fighting.

967
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,120
I will look it up, I don't wanna be wrong.

968
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,960
Okay, you look it up.

969
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,800
You keep going.

970
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,800
I'll read some of the things that happened on this ride.

971
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,960
You get in a tram, it says road trip in big letters.

972
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,120
Then you start moving.

973
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:59,120
And then there's a video that stars Sally the blue car

974
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,720
from Cars and Cruz Ramirez who is in Cars 3.

975
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,240
She speaks English, Sally speaks French.

976
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,160
It's very confusing.

977
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,000
I don't understand.

978
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,760
That's the thing I don't understand in the parks in general

979
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,680
is when is the call made about what should be English

980
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,920
and what should not be?

981
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
I'm always getting confused in all the different

982
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,120
foreign parks sometimes you go, well, that doesn't seem

983
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,840
like they did both language.

984
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,960
Like sometimes, yeah, sometimes it's just,

985
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,680
and like, yeah, sometimes it's just one language

986
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
and you're not sure why.

987
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,040
Like why do they elect that, yes, Cruz Ramirez

988
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,920
will speak English, but Lightning McQueen is French.

989
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,320
And Mater is French.

990
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,680
That's very strange.

991
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,400
Mater very anachronistic.

992
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,480
Yeah, but also funnier.

993
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,840
That is good.

994
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,520
I do like French Mater.

995
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,360
Yes.

996
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,200
That's funny.

997
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,480
I think I wrote, I think he in his little tableau

998
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,800
at the end says, I'm not making this up.

999
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,240
I think he might say significant.

1000
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,640
I have significant in, maybe someone just says significant.

1001
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,360
Is there a Mater short where he's also French

1002
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,480
or it's Larry the Cable Guy doing like French words?

1003
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,200
Not sure.

1004
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,840
My son is, the arbitrary opinions of my son,

1005
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,760
cars short, Mater's tall tales, no.

1006
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,600
Oh really?

1007
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,760
Yeah, no interest.

1008
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,240
And then I might've said before,

1009
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,240
first act of cars gets scared of the tractors.

1010
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,520
There is no second act of cars as far as he knows.

1011
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,600
Straight to the race.

1012
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,920
Often it is only race.

1013
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,560
That's all we do is the big race at the end.

1014
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,800
No cars two or three.

1015
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,640
Zero interest.

1016
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,560
Really?

1017
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,680
I don't understand kids having these opinions

1018
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,800
from the first frame.

1019
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,400
He goes, no, no, no.

1020
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,440
But it's the same characters.

1021
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm as bored by this as I ever by the first one.

1022
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,840
Well, but he knows Paul Newman had passed by that point.

1023
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,480
So you put on the color of money or like road to perdition

1024
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,160
or the sting, he's like clapping along.

1025
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,680
I am not trying any of the new ones.

1026
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,280
We're taking them down the cell.

1027
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,280
I really, I want Jason to have a child just so I can see

1028
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,800
what movies he forces the child to watch at like one

1029
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,640
and a half.

1030
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,440
But Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

1031
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,760
The Sundance Kid.

1032
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,600
Do you want to watch?

1033
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,440
It's a kids movie.

1034
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,840
Do you want to watch The Sun Also Rises?

1035
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,480
Which Jason, you were correct.

1036
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,800
And I was initially correct.

1037
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Robert Evans is in The Sun Also Rises as Pedro Romero.

1038
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,640
Uh oh.

1039
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,560
Oh yeah.

1040
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,240
I'm worried about what that entails.

1041
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,040
Well, that's like the touch of evil.

1042
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,640
Touch of evil where

1043
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,880
Charlton Heston is like a Mexican police officer.

1044
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,720
Yes.

1045
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,680
This is a very common thing up through five years ago.

1046
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,520
Yeah.

1047
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,360
2019?

1048
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,360
The weird, yeah.

1049
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,000
I think I brought this up ages ago,

1050
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,800
but I watched that Russell Crowe Leonardo DiCaprio

1051
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,600
spy movie Body of Lies.

1052
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,600
And Oscar, a younger Oscar Isaac is an Iraqi CIA asset.

1053
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,280
And then Mark Strong from, you know, the Kingsman movies.

1054
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,920
And I think he's the Junker Don in one of the X-Men movies.

1055
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,280
Plays the head of the Jordanian intelligence agency.

1056
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,680
Like, you know, the country of Jordan.

1057
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,520
Right.

1058
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,360
Is Mark Strong juggernaut?

1059
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,600
Is it Mark Strong?

1060
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,280
No, it's Vinnie Jones.

1061
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,120
Oh, it's Vinnie Jones.

1062
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,960
I always mix those two up.

1063
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,240
Vinnie Jones, because he says I'm the juggernaut bitch.

1064
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,080
That's right.

1065
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,920
X-Men The Last Stand.

1066
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,640
Yeah.

1067
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,920
Anyway, stop the conversation dead.

1068
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,760
Okay, so.

1069
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,600
Sorry.

1070
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,800
X-Men The Last Stand kind of underrated.

1071
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,640
Yeah.

1072
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,480
Honestly.

1073
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,320
There you go.

1074
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,140
You got a little more.

1075
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,980
Kelsey Grammer.

1076
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,820
Yes, yeah.

1077
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,640
Of course.

1078
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,480
Oh, that's that one.

1079
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,320
Okay.

1080
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,440
That's the one, wait, I saw that one and have zero memory.

1081
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,320
If we're talking multiverse and characters coming back.

1082
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,160
Oh, we're not.

1083
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,980
We're talking car.

1084
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,820
No, we were.

1085
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,660
I don't remember.

1086
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,500
We bring, make.

1087
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,320
Go ahead.

1088
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,860
Make 70 year old Kelsey Grammer

1089
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,620
put the beast makeup back on.

1090
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,060
That's what I say.

1091
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,380
I want him as beast.

1092
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,180
He's the perfect little casted beast.

1093
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,180
And I want it back.

1094
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,100
I want him back.

1095
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,980
Anyway.

1096
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,820
Sure.

1097
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,040
I've said my piece.

1098
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,060
I have no support from the room.

1099
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,260
All right, get out there.

1100
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,100
Get, if you're listening to this

1101
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,300
and you were working Hollywood,

1102
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,660
you heard what my.

1103
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,980
Kelsey Grammer back at the beast makeup.

1104
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:25,380
So now, so the premise here is that we're doing,

1105
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,040
it's like a kooky sightseeing trip.

1106
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,040
So you see route 66 style oddities, like a big wrench.

1107
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,340
You pass by the big wrench and you go, hmm.

1108
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,500
And it says so big, it's nuts on it.

1109
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,340
Okay.

1110
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,180
All right.

1111
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,460
We did one down.

1112
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,300
Yeah.

1113
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,940
Then you pass by a big lug nut.

1114
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,220
World's largest lug nut.

1115
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,620
World's largest lug nut.

1116
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,180
Our friend, Lightning McQueen and our neighbors,

1117
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,100
Giuseppe and Guido or Luigi and Luigi and Guido.

1118
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,420
They're neighbors to you, not a friend.

1119
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,780
I'm just not that close with either of them.

1120
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,620
They're cool.

1121
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,460
I mean, I.

1122
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,300
And our neighbors.

1123
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,600
I need tires every few years.

1124
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,900
So I see them and make small talk, but.

1125
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,460
They're not, yeah, lightning close.

1126
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,900
You wouldn't have lightning party.

1127
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,900
Yeah.

1128
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,820
And you looking at this, the world's largest lug nut.

1129
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,540
That's gonna, and it's like, all right, it's kind of, yeah.

1130
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,300
It's bigger than me.

1131
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,140
Yeah, but it's not.

1132
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,220
Couldn't fit it in my pocket.

1133
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,100
Not by a long shot, but you're not.

1134
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,540
It's not like the biggest ball of yarn.

1135
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,460
Like that's impressive when you see the big ball of yarn.

1136
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,620
You done the big ball of yarn?

1137
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,020
No, I've seen a picture of it though.

1138
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,740
It seems impressive from the picture.

1139
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,580
Yeah.

1140
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,300
Where is the, are there multiple big balls of yarn?

1141
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,620
Oh, I think at this point,

1142
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,860
there's like probably the most notable one.

1143
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,860
Well, that's an episode.

1144
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,700
Anyway.

1145
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,260
I drove across country.

1146
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,020
I stopped at the, do you know the Continental Divide?

1147
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,340
That's where like, that's the dividing line where like.

1148
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,620
The four states?

1149
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,460
What are we talking about?

1150
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,300
No, I haven't been at the four quarters.

1151
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,620
What is that called, the four corners?

1152
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,460
Yeah.

1153
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:58,260
The Continental Divide, I believe is where,

1154
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,900
west of this water flows west.

1155
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,740
Oh, oh, the directional.

1156
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,300
And east of this water flows east.

1157
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,380
I see.

1158
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,900
It's the dividing line for the way like water systems flow.

1159
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,300
Okay, and you've been?

1160
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,740
Yeah, it's just a, it's just a bunch of,

1161
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,540
it's a painting on a road and a souvenir shop.

1162
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,980
Okay, well we'll do that one too.

1163
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,820
Yes.

1164
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,900
It's coming soon too.

1165
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,860
I bought a, I bought a Roots,

1166
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,100
I have a Roots 66 t-shirt from there.

1167
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,660
It costs like $7.

1168
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,100
It costs like an insanely low amount.

1169
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,500
It feels like sandpaper.

1170
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,820
But doesn't it, well, doesn't it,

1171
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,660
I mean, it hurts you cause it's like sandpaper,

1172
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,020
but it also reminds you of all the torrid affairs

1173
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,840
that this road is.

1174
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,100
Torrid affairs, all those roadside motels,

1175
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,220
God knows what was going on in there.

1176
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,060
In the, in the sand.

1177
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,700
Destroy the road, destroy all roads.

1178
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,500
So they lead only to ruin.

1179
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,980
One family on one side, another family on the other.

1180
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,060
Yeah, so east of this line, you see one family

1181
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,740
and west of this line, you see the other family.

1182
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,780
Exact midpoint between all these people's two families.

1183
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,620
And that midpoint is the only place you can get peace.

1184
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,940
A cup of coffee, some peace and quiet.

1185
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,220
Really uncomfortable t-shirt.

1186
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,460
One family gets one water flow,

1187
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,860
the other family has the water flow the opposite way.

1188
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,500
So, so much of this attraction is quiet,

1189
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,500
like sitting in silence.

1190
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,500
Even though they made little videos for it,

1191
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,500
it's still kind of, maybe there's a little bit of music,

1192
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,780
just dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1193
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,060
Yeah, at least like, like Life is a Highway,

1194
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,740
Rascal Flatts should be playing at least the whole time

1195
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,740
to get the energy up.

1196
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,460
I do, I can report that my son goes nuts

1197
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,420
when Life is a Highway.

1198
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,220
So you have one big thing in common with him.

1199
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,060
Yeah.

1200
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,060
You both go ape shit for Life is a Highway.

1201
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,540
For Rascal Flatts' version.

1202
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,300
The Rascal Flatts' version of Life is a Highway.

1203
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,820
But let me, all right, I have to open up old wounds,

1204
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,700
but I've been obsessed ever since it happened with you

1205
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,020
saying that the dueling piano bar

1206
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,540
should play Life is a Highway at Hell at the Moon.

1207
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,380
Yeah, yeah.

1208
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,860
Now that I'm more familiar with this song,

1209
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,340
there's so many lyrics.

1210
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,460
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

1211
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,220
no one know, do you know?

1212
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,940
Like the people at the dueling piano bar

1213
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,340
are not going to know all of the verses

1214
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,780
of Life is a Highway.

1215
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,940
Yeah, it's a lot, I don't know the lyrics

1216
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,900
to Life is a Highway.

1217
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,740
I'm not 100.

1218
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,220
How can we expect these piano players to?

1219
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,380
Life is a Highway though is a pretty popular song,

1220
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,340
so I don't know, I don't think it's crazy.

1221
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,820
I didn't ask the piano player to play

1222
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,420
the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot Wilco song

1223
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,980
a magazine called Sunset.

1224
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,460
I wasn't going that crazy.

1225
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,540
I think there was a shot.

1226
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,380
An album cut.

1227
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,220
Mm-hmm.

1228
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,060
The great song.

1229
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,900
The magazine called Sunset.

1230
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,340
I know the lyrics to that song, yeah.

1231
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,700
I probably knew that one too.

1232
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,540
Oh, Jason knows it.

1233
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,020
So you're dueling piano.

1234
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,300
Yeah, look, I don't,

1235
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,140
You're dueling Wilco.

1236
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,220
I don't, I, you know, I don't like to give people advice.

1237
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,580
I'm parodying, I don't have children,

1238
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,380
but at some point you're gonna have to introduce

1239
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,540
into the Tom Cochran version.

1240
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,380
Yeah.

1241
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,820
But I think you should wait.

1242
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,740
You can't be expected to go to school without.

1243
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,580
I think you should wait though.

1244
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,420
You know about Tom Cochran.

1245
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,900
You should wait so we can appreciate it, you know?

1246
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,060
Yeah, cause I think that's, yeah,

1247
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,180
it's a little more sophisticated,

1248
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,460
so I think he needs to be a little older, seven, eight, nine,

1249
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,300
before you introduce him to the Tom Cochran.

1250
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,980
Maybe he kicks off middle school by saying,

1251
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,380
hello, peers.

1252
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,500
Did you know that there is a different life as a highway

1253
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,580
besides the one we all grew up with in the Cars films?

1254
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,180
It's a little bit, it's got more of a,

1255
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,540
more of a like a yelp to it, a growl I'd say,

1256
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,180
but equally fun.

1257
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,820
Anyway, let's begin our educational experience anew.

1258
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,980
Look everyone, my dad helped me put the lyrics on this song.

1259
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,180
In all these cities and all these towns,

1260
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,580
in my blood and it's all around.

1261
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,540
Well, there it is.

1262
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,380
Yeah. Great.

1263
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,220
He knows the lyrics.

1264
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,300
So it was not crazy that a piano player

1265
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,300
that plays hit songs would know life as a highway.

1266
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,900
It's also not a piano song in the lead.

1267
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,620
There's no piano in the song.

1268
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,980
Yeah, but that's okay.

1269
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,820
You can do fun piano versions.

1270
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,300
No, you can merge, but I'm saying,

1271
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,940
I think you, it's gotta be such a slam dunk

1272
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,700
to change the genre of the,

1273
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,540
of the song that you're asking for.

1274
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,860
Yeah. I did unfortunately clear out the bar

1275
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,500
because he did play my suggestion

1276
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,700
of Ben Foltz Five's boxing.

1277
00:46:59,020 --> 00:46:59,860
The sad song.

1278
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,700
The piano song.

1279
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,540
The lyrics from Howard Kasell.

1280
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,540
Boxing's been good to me, Howard.

1281
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,140
Yeah.

1282
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,420
Yeah, you're doing piano bark.

1283
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,460
Yeah, we could do it.

1284
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,180
You've got a ton up in the knocking.

1285
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,220
Ben Foltz B-sides, Wilco B-sides.

1286
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,060
What, what?

1287
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:18,900
Yeah, we would have a-

1288
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,460
And life is a highway every 15 minutes.

1289
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,500
Yeah, but Jason has to sing it

1290
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
cause he knows the lyrics.

1291
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,340
Yeah.

1292
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,580
But yeah, there's look,

1293
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,460
are we better than that guy who was playing piano?

1294
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,300
Yes.

1295
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,380
Both of them, right?

1296
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,860
Yeah, both of them.

1297
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:31,700
I feel like there's only one that-

1298
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,500
Was there only one, was it not a dueling?

1299
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,660
I feel like, yeah, they were on their last legs already

1300
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,500
and there was only one piano player

1301
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,380
at the dueling piano bar.

1302
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,380
One of them saw the slip that said life is a highway,

1303
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,780
rolled his eyes and quit.

1304
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,860
Yeah.

1305
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,700
Take this job and shut up.

1306
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,700
I'm outta here.

1307
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,060
All right, we're doing Freebird again.

1308
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:51,420
It's like, don't stop believing Freebird.

1309
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,140
I don't even remember what else he played that night.

1310
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,980
Piano Man.

1311
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,260
I'm sure, yeah, that's gotta be-

1312
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,140
Yeah, Piano Man.

1313
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,940
There was a guitar player though.

1314
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,620
Remember he jumped on the bar?

1315
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,460
No.

1316
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,280
You don't remember that?

1317
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,120
No.

1318
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,020
Do you remember that?

1319
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,100
No, because the special was

1320
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,020
a $3 Sky Vodka

1321
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,300
and I kept ordering doubles.

1322
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,980
I was probably concentrating on what is going to happen

1323
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,900
to my bodily functions.

1324
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,740
Wow, really?

1325
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,380
With all of this blue pumping through me.

1326
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,780
That was exciting, I feel like.

1327
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,220
There was all of a sudden, I turned around,

1328
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,100
there's a man playing guitar behind us

1329
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,740
and I feel like, was it Sweet Child of Mine?

1330
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,580
I'm sure we said it on the episode years ago,

1331
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,100
but it was something like that and he was playing.

1332
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,700
He came from nowhere.

1333
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,980
There might've been a saxophone player too.

1334
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,700
He may not have worked there.

1335
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,140
He was at Carl Strauss with his electric guitar

1336
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,380
and he just plugged in.

1337
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,540
Okay, well consult that episode.

1338
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,940
I have zero memory.

1339
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,780
Listener will do it.

1340
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,620
Listener will do it.

1341
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,440
Tell us.

1342
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,280
For me.

1343
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,100
Okay, let's keep plowing.

1344
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,540
We go to Carstestripy Canyon.

1345
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,940
We've talked about this a little bit.

1346
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,620
A truck with a big smile on his face

1347
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,660
gets surrounded by fire.

1348
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,180
His expression never changes.

1349
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,580
This is where I look, I feel for the Imagineers,

1350
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,420
I would say.

1351
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,940
I don't put any blame.

1352
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,780
Yeah, absolutely.

1353
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,860
You're like, well we gotta try to do something with it.

1354
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,100
I blame whatever, at whatever higher up point

1355
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,780
they were unwilling to release more money

1356
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,340
and at least something that allows the car's face

1357
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,860
to change from smiling to frowning.

1358
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,980
One function in that face to reflect the fact

1359
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,500
that he is surrounded on all sides by fire

1360
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,500
and his butt.

1361
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,580
It is crazy.

1362
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,420
It is crazy.

1363
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,420
It is like the dog meme, this is fine, I guess.

1364
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,820
It's so much like this is fine.

1365
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,820
Maybe it's the French trying to comment on America

1366
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,140
by using our iconography, our central,

1367
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,180
our formerly main road, Route 66.

1368
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,020
It's a tableau of modern America.

1369
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,700
It's actually a very poignant ride if you think of it that way.

1370
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,820
I do think of it that way now.

1371
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,900
So yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

1372
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,020
So it's so funny.

1373
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,140
I don't, obviously everybody who's on this ride

1374
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,860
is bored and doesn't care.

1375
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,380
No one's put two thoughts

1376
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,380
because this ride is so uninteresting,

1377
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,380
but I feel like this should be cars full of laughter.

1378
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,860
Like when you're watching these YouTube videos,

1379
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,500
but no one seems to give a shit.

1380
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,340
No one cares.

1381
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,460
They didn't like the little graphics

1382
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,580
of like other cars based roadside attractions,

1383
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,380
which you don't actually see.

1384
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,220
They didn't really like.

1385
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,060
Yeah, you get a bunch of graphics

1386
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,060
of things you don't get to see.

1387
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,700
The painting, there was kind of a cartoony painting

1388
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,300
of Route 66 on the back of a building you go by.

1389
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,180
Great.

1390
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,020
Yep.

1391
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:34,860
Yep.

1392
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,460
Then you go back by it again.

1393
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,940
The trees are starting to grow in front of the painting.

1394
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,420
This is just, this maybe we should do some episode

1395
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,260
like this where it was like,

1396
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,980
where we try to like put an IP overlay

1397
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,100
and we try to imagine if we had the budget,

1398
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,260
what appears to be this ride's budget for this overlay.

1399
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,500
Like it's like $10,000.

1400
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,500
You have $10,000 to overlay.

1401
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,620
What's the most, let's just say hypothetically

1402
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,340
living with the land, Scott.

1403
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,180
You have $10,000 to overlay IP on living with the land.

1404
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,460
You, all right, 20 bucks.

1405
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,460
Get a CD player, get a speaker,

1406
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,980
speakers to put in the boat

1407
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,700
and start playing the song again.

1408
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,820
How many votes they got?

1409
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,740
Maybe seven, eight.

1410
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,300
All right, so now I have,

1411
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,380
I still have well upwards of $9,000.

1412
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,660
Maybe just press play on the song

1413
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,380
that they actively chose to not use anymore.

1414
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,660
In all these cities, in all these towns.

1415
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,820
No!

1416
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,540
Now they're down, that's an idea.

1417
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,340
Living with the land is not a highway.

1418
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,220
There's a man, how about a magazine called Sunset?

1419
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,740
The Wilco overlay for living with the land.

1420
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,300
Just get a guy playing the songs on it on every car.

1421
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,180
Oh yeah, a little piano, a mini piano.

1422
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,020
Yeah, that's great.

1423
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,940
On every boat.

1424
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,020
Yeah, now we're talking.

1425
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,540
Yeah, and you give suggestions.

1426
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,100
So the first dueling piano boat.

1427
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,940
Yeah.

1428
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:59,700
So Cars, Test, Trophy Canyon happens.

1429
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,820
You see more slides of things you don't get to see.

1430
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,900
You don't get to see the Great Wall of China made of tires.

1431
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,500
And then there's a lot of buildup of that.

1432
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,020
You're quickly informed.

1433
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,620
Oh, Mater's doing art now.

1434
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,580
I haven't seen his art.

1435
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,940
Oh well, maybe we're gonna see his art.

1436
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,940
Here's some pictures of his art and look what he made.

1437
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:21,940
And he made an Eiffel Tower out of car junk.

1438
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,900
And it's called the Eiffel Tower.

1439
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,980
Yeah, it's made out of garbage.

1440
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,420
The woods around it seem like they've been cleared

1441
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,020
or flattened, again, real Miller's Crossing,

1442
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,140
true detective crime scene types.

1443
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,860
Deep forest crime.

1444
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,420
Yeah, you're right.

1445
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,820
It's not a pleasant, lush forest.

1446
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,300
It's a forest you go to handle business

1447
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,660
that you never speak of again.

1448
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,540
He made a fake billboard that says, let's go Buick.

1449
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,540
I guess that's a slight,

1450
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,940
that's like a Let's Go Brandon thing in the car universe.

1451
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,220
Let's go Buick.

1452
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,620
Let's go Buick.

1453
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,020
Brandon becomes Buick.

1454
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:06,220
They all hate the president of cars, president Buick.

1455
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,340
There has not been, yeah,

1456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,740
there's not been a working man's car.

1457
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,260
There's not been a GM car.

1458
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,260
There's not been a Chevrolet car in a while.

1459
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,900
President Maserati, president Buick, president Maybach.

1460
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,380
It's all these rich guys.

1461
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,860
The Eiffel Tower is not that tall.

1462
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,740
You're kinda like K.

1463
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,420
Well, it's impressive that a car did it

1464
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,060
because a car has no arms.

1465
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,900
I guess he did this all with his tongue,

1466
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,980
with his big, fleshy tongue

1467
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,460
that we know all of the cars have

1468
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,540
because lightning breaks a tie at the beginning of Cars 1

1469
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:44,300
by sticking his giant flesh tongue out, which counts,

1470
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,820
which they make you watch in slow motion replays.

1471
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,020
That's so, like,

1472
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,180
That's unpleasant.

1473
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:55,020
If I walk into the family room and the tongue is on,

1474
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,580
I am never happy.

1475
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,420
Yeah, that's.

1476
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,340
Oh, the tongue movie.

1477
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,700
The tongue, tongues it should be called.

1478
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:07,180
If you know a better way to eat ash, I'd like to hear it.

1479
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:11,220
Get her done.

1480
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,660
So, and then you're kinda heading back to home base

1481
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,540
and then Cruz says,

1482
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,100
Route 66 was so much fun.

1483
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,780
And like, are you telling us or are you telling yourself?

1484
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,940
Who are you trying to convince here?

1485
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,580
Yeah, that's kind of like the end of any long road trip

1486
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,140
where you're kind of wiped out.

1487
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,540
And like a few days later, it sets in

1488
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,060
of how good a time you had,

1489
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,140
but you just want to get out of the car.

1490
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,620
Yeah. At the very end of it.

1491
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,140
Yeah, very much so.

1492
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,140
This is weird.

1493
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,580
What a strange, how like.

1494
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,700
So strange, yeah.

1495
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,220
And just like the plight of Paris,

1496
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:52,380
where, you know, there's great new attractions going up

1497
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,540
all around the globe,

1498
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,700
even in this kind of embattled cutback,

1499
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,860
bummer, chapec, Disney times,

1500
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,460
still all of the properties are getting great new attractions.

1501
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,540
And then poor Paris gets cars road trip.

1502
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,540
They get a tanker truck with an on fire, non-butt.

1503
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,620
And that's the, here you go.

1504
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,780
Enjoy, this is your new ride, guys.

1505
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,700
There's one big detail that we have not mentioned

1506
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,020
that I think adds to the absurdity of this attraction.

1507
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,260
So this was announced a while ago,

1508
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:29,460
was originally slated to open summer of 2020.

1509
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,420
Obviously that did not happen.

1510
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:35,220
Instead it opens July of 2021

1511
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,540
with the rest of the parks reopening.

1512
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,740
So this is a brand new attraction.

1513
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,020
The park's been closed for over a year.

1514
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,540
Finally it's opened.

1515
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,580
Yay, it's open.

1516
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,100
We're all going back.

1517
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,060
Oh, there's a new, there's a new thing.

1518
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,140
We gotta go see the new.

1519
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,020
What are we seeing?

1520
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,260
Like just the weirdness of like already,

1521
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:00,100
like those first few times back to theme parks

1522
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,340
after staying at home inside

1523
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,260
were so interesting and bizarre.

1524
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,660
And then to have this weirdo attraction on top of that,

1525
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,500
I can't imagine, you know?

1526
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,220
Well, maybe it benefited from that.

1527
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,940
It's like, well, boy, that was not sitting inside.

1528
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,820
That's true.

1529
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,900
There was no opening of a zoom window anywhere in there.

1530
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,740
Yeah.

1531
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:25,540
One of the ride throughs online I was watching

1532
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,820
and it was very funny.

1533
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,060
It was still when everyone had to wear masks

1534
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,620
outdoors in the parks.

1535
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,620
And you see like an employee

1536
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,260
like walking in front of the camera

1537
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,380
and they kind of like look and see all the cast members

1538
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,860
and they go like,

1539
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,020
and they like pull the mask out of their pocket,

1540
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,980
put it on, because they realized,

1541
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,100
uh-oh, I forgot.

1542
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,060
I'm being photographed.

1543
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,340
Yeah.

1544
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,180
Yeah.

1545
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,980
Did everyone see, this is another recent Paris thing.

1546
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,340
Did everyone see Mickey dancing

1547
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,780
and lighting up the Eiffel Tower?

1548
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,700
I did see that.

1549
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,540
Yeah.

1550
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,360
I did not.

1551
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,200
You didn't see this?

1552
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,040
No.

1553
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,880
The actual Eiffel Tower I'm talking about.

1554
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,700
Oh, okay.

1555
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,540
Not the, not the Eiffel.

1556
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,380
Not the Eiffel Tower.

1557
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,220
No.

1558
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,100
Mickey for some reason is like doing a like

1559
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,260
phantasmic show in front of the actual Eiffel Tower

1560
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,180
and lighting it up.

1561
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,740
And do you know why this was?

1562
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,140
30th anniversary.

1563
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:13,980
Oh, okay.

1564
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,820
Of Paris.

1565
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:15,820
Disneyland Paris.

1566
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,900
When there are a long way from people throwing tomatoes

1567
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:19,980
at Michael Eisner.

1568
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,420
Mickey gets the keys to the Eiffel Tower lighting rig.

1569
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,660
The keys to the rig.

1570
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,500
Yeah.

1571
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,340
So yeah.

1572
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,380
So there is, that was, that's a much more spectacular video

1573
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,940
than anything you'll see here.

1574
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,780
All right.

1575
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,700
So they're doing exciting things in Paris then.

1576
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,620
One-offs of Mickey dancing.

1577
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,620
Mickey, I think honestly, Mickey should do more of this

1578
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,140
dancing in front of like land, world landmarks

1579
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,340
where he lights them up in front of Mount Rushmore

1580
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,340
or Stonehenge, you know?

1581
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,660
So if you want to watch these videos,

1582
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,740
those have like lights.

1583
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,580
Well, they will now.

1584
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,420
Natural, okay.

1585
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,940
So maybe we're going to install lights.

1586
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,100
Yeah, we're going to install lights in some of the places.

1587
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:02,020
It was a grand, Mickey and all the biggest celebrities

1588
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:06,780
in France, Jerry Lewis's heir, the cast of Cuties,

1589
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:13,740
Macron, not Marie Le Pen, no no.

1590
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,020
Wait, Jerry Lewis was at the Eiffel Tower?

1591
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:16,860
Okay.

1592
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,820
Is he, is he still with us?

1593
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:19,660
No, no, he is dead.

1594
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,980
He died of heat.

1595
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,500
That's why I said his heir.

1596
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,340
I was just wondering where you were going with that.

1597
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,540
He did like one last trip of telling everybody

1598
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,380
women aren't funny and then he croaked.

1599
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,420
Oh, God.

1600
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,260
Yeah.

1601
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,700
I'm going to get a few of these in before I wrap up.

1602
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,060
He did a Comedians in Cars, then he croaked.

1603
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:35,900
Yeah.

1604
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,700
He was on Comedians in Cars and then that was it.

1605
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,540
He croaked.

1606
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,140
We're just having coffee in a car, then he croaked.

1607
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:43,980
Mid-episode.

1608
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,700
Jerry Lewis died on an episode.

1609
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,380
Jerry took him to two modern coffee places.

1610
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:53,380
It wasn't like a diner using the same machine for 50 years.

1611
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,780
He served him a full-strength Starbucks coffee

1612
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,060
and it just killed him.

1613
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,940
So too strong.

1614
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,420
Yeah.

1615
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,980
What do we do with this thing?

1616
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,820
I mean, this is just a sitting duck.

1617
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,820
Do we burn it down for insurance money?

1618
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,660
I mean, already.

1619
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,940
It's already burning every day.

1620
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,820
Yeah, yeah.

1621
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,980
So just maybe let it loose one day.

1622
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:11,820
Yeah.

1623
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:15,060
Let that, let that butt fire get out of control

1624
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,020
and it's all ash.

1625
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,820
I think they should take out some of the,

1626
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,700
I think they should just make it worse somehow.

1627
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,540
Take out some of the trees, take out some of the fun signs.

1628
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:27,220
They should make people do the forest clearing.

1629
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,060
Yeah.

1630
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,260
That's what, suddenly you stop the gates open

1631
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,220
and like everybody's handed an axe.

1632
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,140
Everybody.

1633
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,060
Go clear cut.

1634
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:34,900
Oh.

1635
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,260
No tram, no tram.

1636
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,420
Everyone has to walk it.

1637
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,260
Yeah.

1638
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,100
Yeah.

1639
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,260
The tram breaks down maybe.

1640
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,100
Walk trip.

1641
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:41,940
You have to walk back.

1642
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,500
You like, you wait for a little while

1643
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,460
for the French equivalent of AAA.

1644
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,140
It doesn't show up.

1645
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,460
You just start walking.

1646
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,580
Yeah.

1647
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:53,820
And then add some narrative about a secret family

1648
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,220
that you're going to visit

1649
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,900
when you get to the end of the destination.

1650
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,740
That's a Lesna.

1651
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,900
That's, I mean, everyone's got, you know,

1652
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,980
a mistress in France.

1653
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:04,820
Oh yeah.

1654
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,900
That's true.

1655
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,140
They might like that.

1656
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:07,980
They might be happy.

1657
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:08,820
Yeah, no, that's not a big deal.

1658
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,420
That's the novelty of recreating Route 66.

1659
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,820
Imagine that they, there was,

1660
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,020
there's a country where this had to be done.

1661
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,820
You had to travel great distances

1662
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,100
between your secret families.

1663
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:18,940
We're uptight about secret.

1664
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,540
Do you have to pretend you don't have a mistress?

1665
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,380
Jason's uptight about.

1666
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,220
This is a backwards country.

1667
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,460
Jason's uptight about secret families and mistresses here,

1668
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,500
but that's our United States upbringing.

1669
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,340
Yeah.

1670
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,180
It's over there.

1671
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,020
They don't give a shit.

1672
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:29,860
We'd be looser.

1673
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1674
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,460
Couple months in France and we'd all have them.

1675
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,300
Is there a podcast,

1676
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:37,100
the right equivalent podcast emanating from France?

1677
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,020
Do we have like three?

1678
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,860
Oh, maybe.

1679
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,220
Three French doppelgangers

1680
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:46,420
who are not so like uptight about body material.

1681
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,940
They love body material.

1682
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,700
You can hear them light up a real long, gross cigarette.

1683
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,700
Yeah, well you can hear the smoking.

1684
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,540
Packing coughs.

1685
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,140
You can hear the smoking on the mic

1686
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,020
in our French equivalent podcast.

1687
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:03,460
Yeah, they have sex with the mistress's drink.

1688
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,300
Oh my gosh.

1689
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,420
In between talking about Disneyland Paris.

1690
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,380
You guys take it from here.

1691
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:09,420
Give me a moment.

1692
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:15,180
They all sound like Kenan's PRS cargo from all that.

1693
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:21,820
Pretend I am a dragon from the rain of fire.

1694
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,420
It's a different podcast.

1695
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,380
It's not this one.

1696
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,380
We're a little more buttoned up and we do.

1697
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:35,020
We go explore the world whether you ask us to or not,

1698
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,580
whether the attraction is good or not.

1699
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,420
We made it.

1700
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,380
We survived podcast the ride to the second gate.

1701
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:45,980
Cars road trip, we did it by maybe,

1702
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:47,820
have you already forgotten?

1703
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:48,660
Yeah, I don't care.

1704
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,500
Okay, great.

1705
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,740
I don't care about this ride at all.

1706
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,620
Okay, so maybe we don't need to do the tram tour again,

1707
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:57,260
but there are a lot of great other topics

1708
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,940
that we need to jackal here on the second gate.

1709
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,060
Sorry, I got a little brain fart.

1710
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:02,980
I'll edit that out.

1711
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:03,820
Okay, okay, yeah.

1712
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,460
So I was saying podcast the ride, the jackal gate.

1713
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,620
There's a, sorry.

1714
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,460
You did it again.

1715
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,820
Well, what am I saying?

1716
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,140
The jackal gate?

1717
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:12,980
I don't know.

1718
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,820
Why am I saying?

1719
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,180
Is it like a French thing?

1720
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,580
Like an old French movie or something stuck in your head?

1721
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:17,420
I don't think so.

1722
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,980
I think I'm being like,

1723
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,020
I feel like in that moment where I'm saying that word,

1724
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:25,100
I'm being possessed by some other worldly demonic figure.

1725
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,580
I don't know what's making me do it.

1726
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,660
What I'm trying to say is if you keep it tuned here

1727
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,620
to podcast the ride the second gate

1728
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,740
for your three bonus episodes every month,

1729
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,380
there's gonna be a lot of great,

1730
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,900
many great jackals in store.

1731
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,180
What am I, God.

1732
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,740
Oh, that's weird.

1733
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,580
It's entertaining.

1734
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:42,420
Nothing but brain farts.

1735
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,260
I'll edit it out.

1736
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,300
It's entertaining the second gate.

1737
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,140
It's like a video game come to real life.

1738
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:46,980
You know?

1739
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,340
That's yeah, I think that's what we offer here.

1740
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,180
Yeah.

1741
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,500
Yeah, as exciting as if characters

1742
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,780
from the video game realm stepped off the screen

1743
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,900
into your reality.

1744
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,820
Yeah, I think we just need to cool down,

1745
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,780
listen to one of our favorite musical artists,

1746
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,140
Jackal Moore.

1747
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,820
And then we'll be, wait, what am I saying?

1748
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:08,660
Jack, I meant Macklemore.

1749
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,660
Did you mean Macklemore?

1750
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,820
I meant Macklemore.

1751
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,340
You obviously meant Macklemore.

1752
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,180
That's weird.

1753
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,860
Jackal Moore.

1754
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,700
Why did I say that?

1755
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,540
I don't know.

1756
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:18,380
Huh.

1757
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,220
That's what I wanted to know.

1758
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:20,180
I don't know what's coming over us.

1759
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,900
Who knows what's coming down the road

1760
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,780
on podcast The Ride of the Second Gate?

1761
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,820
Only one way to find out.

1762
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,940
Stay subscribed.

1763
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,180
Stay jackal, fuck.
