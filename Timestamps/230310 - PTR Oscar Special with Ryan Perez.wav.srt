1
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,000
A frightened 22-year-old dressed as Snow White!

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And there's the man of the hour, Ryan Perez,

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
who joins the boys for the first ever Oscar special

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:01:01,000
on Podcast The Ride!

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's a wonderful night for podcasts, podcasts, podcasts.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's begin.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The three hosts of Podcast The Ride are me,

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Scott Gardner, Jason Sheridan.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I was driving over and I was like,

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
is anyone going to do it?

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's a wonderful night for podcasts, podcasts.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Should I do it?

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And so I'm so happy.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I wouldn't mind if you did it.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You can still do it if you want.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No, that's fine.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No, I don't want to take the glory.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You can make it a wonderful night

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:27,000
for podcasts.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's wonderful.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's wonderful.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's wonderful.

23
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's wonderful.

24
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:49,660
Resistance the

25
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,000
years.

26
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,920
And then the Schindler's List year, he was like,

27
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,040
I'm not gonna do, I mean, I don't know,

28
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
maybe he already had his fill or whatever,

29
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,860
but like he purposefully sat out a year

30
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,280
where I think it would have been tough

31
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,840
to be super, super funny or upbeat or whatever.

32
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,580
The Schindler's List song would have been

33
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,600
the most difficult job of his life.

34
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,960
He probably tried to crack it though and couldn't do it.

35
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,320
He probably thought about that and then he was like,

36
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,560
ah, I'll give it to Whoopi.

37
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,300
Yeah, there's drafts of a song he was trying to work out

38
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,440
and they were horrendous.

39
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,640
Yes, there were some, I'm sure he got bruised.

40
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,880
Even a blanch at the Hotel Roosevelt,

41
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,200
just like a pen and a pen, just like, what do you think?

42
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,620
It's gonna break me, it's the one I can't do.

43
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,320
I think he will do it one more time.

44
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,280
Okay. I hope so.

45
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,020
Yeah, I could see them in a weird hostless year

46
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,740
being like, well, Billy's open to it

47
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,560
and he's getting up there and one more time for nostalgia.

48
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,240
Yeah, was 2012 the last time he did it?

49
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
The most recent time?

50
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
Oh, I don't know the year.

51
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,120
He says, I've hosted it nine times.

52
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,200
I watched it 2012.

53
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
I think so.

54
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,680
Moment, and even some of that was like,

55
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,320
oh, I don't know if he'd make that joke now.

56
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Like, there was a joke about Jonah Hill dropping some weight

57
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,840
and it cuts to the Moneyball-like people

58
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,160
and you just see he is really not happy.

59
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,440
And fair enough, because it was kind of mean-spirited.

60
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
It didn't really have like a-

61
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,600
Like, lay off the donuts next time.

62
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,720
Yeah, and then he's given, he's tossing a softball,

63
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,200
he's just going up to Scorsese and he's like, oh, Marty.

64
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,680
But that was funny, because there was just like

65
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,120
an uninterested, I'm assuming Scorsese's daughter

66
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,600
sitting next to him and she was an uninterested pre-teen

67
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,360
and I'm like, wait a minute, the math,

68
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,080
is that the one that does the TikToks with him in it now?

69
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,920
Oh yeah, probably.

70
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,880
I think so, yeah.

71
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,560
Oh, I haven't been keeping up with the

72
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,400
Crystal TikTok content.

73
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,280
Oh wait, no, I'm sorry, not Crystal, Scorsese's daughter.

74
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,120
Scorsese's daughter.

75
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,680
Oh right, this I've heard about, okay, okay.

76
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,120
Will do post TikToks and occasionally

77
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,640
she'll get him to be in one.

78
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,000
She'll like, wrap his Christmas gifts in Marvel paper.

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Yes. Like Marvel comics.

80
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,280
Yeah, she'll get his ass.

81
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,040
And as usual, Marty, great sport, great sport about it.

82
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,160
Sure. Yeah.

83
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,680
He probably, he acknowledges it as some new kind of form.

84
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,440
You know, it's like, I gotta help.

85
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,600
Audio visual entertainment.

86
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
It's fun to do audio visual entertainment content,

87
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,640
but you know, yeah, he's probably,

88
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,240
he's probably on some level appreciates it,

89
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,400
that she's a burgeoning little filmmaker, TikTok filmmaker.

90
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,520
Yeah. I don't think so.

91
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,760
I think he probably hates it

92
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,720
and I'm gonna cancel him on Twitter.

93
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,280
Next chance I get.

94
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Nothing I love more than holding him to the fire

95
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,680
every three months when that comes around.

96
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,280
We're all being mean to Marty today.

97
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,840
Since you mentioned Twitter, I have been wondering,

98
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,720
I have been thinking about the Billy Crystal,

99
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,480
like song and dance openings a little bit lately,

100
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,240
because recently there was the thing

101
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,720
that took on the life of its own,

102
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
the Ariana DeBose number at the BAFTAs.

103
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
And I watched it a couple of times

104
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,320
and I talked to Jane about, I'm like,

105
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,160
what are people talking, what is the issue?

106
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
Is this because she's out of breath?

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,240
It's because she kind of delivered one of the lines

108
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,680
and she's like, I think, yeah, it just kind of caught fire.

109
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,040
Like it's just getting roasted on the internet,

110
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,760
but you can see when it cuts to people,

111
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,600
like the older people in the,

112
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,200
like Jamie Lee Curtis is like, she gets it.

113
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,120
Michelle Yeoh gets it.

114
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,880
But like the younger people are just like,

115
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,320
what the hell is this?

116
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,640
Like they don't have the context of Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.

117
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,560
What does she do?

118
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,600
I haven't actually watched it.

119
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm aware that it's been roasted a little bit,

120
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,240
but what is she doing in it?

121
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,080
I mean, the thing that really caught on was she said,

122
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
was it Angela Bassett did the thing?

123
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,760
Angela Bassett did the thing.

124
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,600
Yeah.

125
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,560
Like really, truly just that one line,

126
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,480
slightly breathless saying, Angela Bassett did the thing

127
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,080
is now we're obsessed with this.

128
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
Everyone in the world is obsessed with this

129
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,720
really embarrassing moment.

130
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,840
This, oh my God, what an embarrassing moment.

131
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,360
You look at it, you're like, what?

132
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,640
Like, especially if you're looking at things in the context,

133
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,080
like I've been looking at a few musical numbers,

134
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,760
Oscar numbers in the context of preparing for this show.

135
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,000
And I'm like, this is, there are 9,000 moments like this

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,080
in every single Oscar's opening number ever.

137
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,920
Yeah.

138
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,760
Like.

139
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
Yeah, skin crawling.

140
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,280
There are moments, I've talked about this before on the show.

141
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,000
This comes up in theme park shows a lot,

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,080
but if I am really mortified by something

143
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,280
that the hairs stand up on my arm,

144
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,640
I get embarrassment goosebumps.

145
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,080
Especially the main thing I get it from

146
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,320
is cheesiness in musical numbers.

147
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,160
Yeah.

148
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,360
And it will happen in the next couple hours.

149
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,200
Oh yeah.

150
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,040
Guaranteed.

151
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,160
I guess, so maybe that's the, I should watch this thing

152
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,120
and see if it gives me,

153
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,680
makes the hairs on my arm do anything.

154
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,040
I mean, it's a little corny,

155
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,320
but I feel like award shows have always been a little corny.

156
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,160
You know?

157
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,640
And so I think what the reality is,

158
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
well the thing to blame here is

159
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,040
they probably rehearsed this once, maybe twice,

160
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,840
and they didn't clock,

161
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,680
this was an elaborate dance number,

162
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,760
this is an elaborate costume to get off,

163
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,920
to then run across the stage and then start rapping.

164
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,160
It was probably like,

165
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,680
oh, I don't think the stage manager thought this through.

166
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
Sure, sure.

167
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,560
And just like, if anybody is complaining about this,

168
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,040
maybe, I just assume anyone complaining about it

169
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,800
has not seen Kevin Spacey at the Weird Sports Awards.

170
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah, oh yes, yeah.

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,200
The laureates.

172
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,840
I mean, if you're missing basketball shots

173
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,920
and offending Tony Hawk,

174
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,280
there's no way whatever you're describing is worse.

175
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,400
Well also, Ariana DeVos did the Tonys, I think, last year

176
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,840
and was fantastic.

177
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,560
This is a very extremely capable musical.

178
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
Musical theater pro.

179
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,880
Musical theater performer.

180
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,840
And given the task of a bad song,

181
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,520
like what's, okay yeah, a bad song, what's new?

182
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,360
They're all bad.

183
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,720
There's never been a good musical number,

184
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,680
lyrics-wise, in an award show.

185
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,760
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,320
Which we will prove this evening as we do this for sure.

187
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,800
Ryan, in terms of your Oscar experience,

188
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,080
I don't wanna put the term Oscar fan on you.

189
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,920
Oh please don't.

190
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,040
That doesn't seem right.

191
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,000
So I wanted to poke around what would be better than that.

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,280
I don't know, I mean, it seems like you,

193
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,480
I feel like you have been fascinated by

194
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,480
or engaged with the Oscars at least forever.

195
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
I don't know how you want to calibrate

196
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,480
your Oscar affection or otherwise.

197
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,360
Oh sure, yeah, I think, I mean,

198
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,040
as a byproduct of really loving movies,

199
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,200
you're always interested in the Oscars.

200
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,280
I mean, if you like movies, at least when you're young,

201
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,000
you have a curiosity about them.

202
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,280
I think even as a young person, I learned very early

203
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,600
that the Oscars don't really have a ton to do with movies.

204
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,440
Sure, sure.

205
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,960
Like it's not like your favorite ones

206
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,120
are winning Oscars or whatever.

207
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,120
So that whole, like the competitive element of the Oscars,

208
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,920
I became disenchanted with like very young.

209
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,680
But I watch them every year

210
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,280
and watch them kind of closely every year

211
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,400
because I think they're unfailingly,

212
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,200
it's almost like the State of the Union or something.

213
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,840
They're almost like a bellwether of the climate

214
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,920
of the industry and the political climate at the time

215
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,760
and everything.

216
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,000
And it's also like a weird game show

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,960
where people are winning an award

218
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,080
and have to like pitch themselves

219
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,280
and the rest of their careers at you

220
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,680
over the course of a minute or two.

221
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,480
And so it's just a fascinating,

222
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,920
really high pressure event to watch in terms,

223
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,280
and also just the spectacle and everything too.

224
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,760
But I think they're like,

225
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,680
I like the Oscars in particular.

226
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,200
And award shows, I've never been to one.

227
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
I don't really care to ever go to one,

228
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,720
but to watch them is tremendous fun.

229
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,640
But you can't take it on the surface.

230
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,840
I think people watch them and they say,

231
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,080
well, that Oscars was not entertaining.

232
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,440
But if you watch on a surface level,

233
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,360
they aren't entertaining.

234
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,640
The Oscars do suck pretty much all the time.

235
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,680
But you have to be able to read them.

236
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,120
If you're able to read them and read what's like going on,

237
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,720
they're very fascinating.

238
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,560
Oh, sure.

239
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,360
It's like one part of the text is the ceremony itself,

240
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,000
but everything else happening.

241
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,520
That's why the slap is like the most interesting thing

242
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,320
because it's like, whoa,

243
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,920
like real hostility that maybe you could have guessed

244
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,760
or sensed or whatever suddenly broke through

245
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,320
and it became like a real thing.

246
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
Well, and you had to fill in the back,

247
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,600
not all of the information was there on the stage.

248
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,680
Because when it happened, it was like,

249
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,480
that joke caused that?

250
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,400
We all had to learn that she,

251
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,440
I assume I had to learn that she had alopecia.

252
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,520
I don't track every move of Jada Pinkett Smith

253
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,880
and I don't think Chris Rock does either.

254
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,000
So like, okay, that, wait,

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,480
and he made some jokes that was,

256
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
she was offended by years prior, okay.

257
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,600
Yeah.

258
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,480
Oh, and Will Smith is out of his goddamn mind, okay.

259
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,560
That's also important.

260
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,040
Well, the legitimacy of the moment was in question too.

261
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,480
There was a big debate raging of was it real or not?

262
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,320
I had that thought.

263
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,160
I definitely had that thought.

264
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah.

265
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,320
We were all watching it.

266
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,640
The four of us were all together.

267
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,120
We all processed the slap.

268
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,080
Jane, I feel like called it as real immediately.

269
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,320
Mike, you also did.

270
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,040
I was a real truther the whole time.

271
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,280
And I was on the fence.

272
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,520
I watch fake combat sports regularly.

273
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,360
Well, that's what, yeah,

274
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,000
we were trying to figure out if it was kayfabe,

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,080
but then the sound got real fucked up.

276
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,160
Like when the sound got fucked up,

277
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,440
I feel like that's when I was like.

278
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,080
Yeah, that muddied the entire,

279
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,600
like the slap itself, I feel like,

280
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,280
still could have felt like a bit potentially,

281
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,640
especially if you didn't hear the sound of it,

282
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,560
which was like very raw and clearly injured him.

283
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,080
But then once it cut to that shot,

284
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,920
once it cut to the screaming,

285
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,000
was where like, uh-oh, this would not be happening

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,720
in a bit, I don't think.

287
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,600
It would have been more fun after that.

288
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
If it was a bit, it would have been like a fun thing

289
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,200
at the end there.

290
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,040
Yeah.

291
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,240
Well, because you know, I'm an envelope truther.

292
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,680
I think I. Oh, right.

293
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,520
It would come up.

294
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,760
I think that, and I, and I,

295
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,880
and no one has told me that I have no actual

296
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,000
foundational belief in this,

297
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,680
but I do believe that Kimmel,

298
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,200
known for his pranks occasionally,

299
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,720
staged some kind of prank or whatever with producers,

300
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,160
probably did arrange something that went awry

301
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,280
and the response was bad

302
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,000
and they've not really admitted to it.

303
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,840
That's okay.

304
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,760
I don't have, and I, and no one,

305
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,960
I have no reason to believe this

306
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,200
just beyond my own thinking of it.

307
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,080
So I was already in the mindset of like,

308
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,640
oh, they're going to try it again.

309
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,400
What if this Will Smith thing, another envelope thing,

310
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,920
which is fake in my mind.

311
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,080
Do you, do you, do you have a full theory

312
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,160
that like they sent Warren Beatty out there

313
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,160
with the wrong envelope and just like hung them out to dry?

314
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,240
I think Warren Beatty is probably in on it.

315
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,080
Oh yeah, okay.

316
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,480
And I think there's probably a very small handful

317
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,320
of people that are in.

318
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,280
If this is, if this is.

319
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,120
Right, right.

320
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,320
I'm just wondering what your theory is.

321
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,920
I base it just on the idea that I've watched 20 years

322
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,320
or more than that worth of Oscars.

323
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,560
This has never happened.

324
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,320
There's never been a, an envelope mix up

325
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,080
in the entire history of the awards.

326
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,760
And it happens to happen during Best Picture

327
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,360
on a year when, when semi prankster Jimmy Kimmel

328
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,200
was hosting.

329
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,720
It was like, everyone's like,

330
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,600
and the only reason it's not come out is

331
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,120
because the initial response was not positive.

332
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,480
If the initial response was, wow, that was super fun,

333
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,920
then, but the initial response was no Moonlight,

334
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,240
an important American film was robbed chance.

335
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,880
It's, it's, it's proper chance.

336
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,320
Those are bad optics for sure.

337
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,360
Yeah, and it's kind of the more bubble gum movie.

338
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,160
Like, like there's sort of different films.

339
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
So you can't rot.

340
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,040
Like, so there's someone making songs

341
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,920
in the show and there's lists here.

342
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,760
It's kind of weird.

343
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,480
Yes, but I think that was the, that was the reason was like,

344
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,000
oh, this movie's, this movie should have had its own moment.

345
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,920
And instead the Moonlight people had to share the stage.

346
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
Oh my God, this back, I think it backfired.

347
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,520
I think it was a prank that backfired.

348
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,920
This is, this is some conspiracy stuff

349
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,760
I'm spreading on your show.

350
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,880
Yeah, this is like Alex Jones stuff.

351
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Hey, come on guys.

352
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,200
Have you really, what are the chances

353
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,600
that the long walker make it out to the stage?

354
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,440
Ah!

355
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Well, thank you for presenting your theories.

356
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,520
I, what other questions did I have for you about this?

357
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,360
Oh, oh, in terms of like your,

358
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,480
when you, like growing up and watching the Oscar,

359
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,760
do you, was there one that you recall as being like,

360
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,720
that you, where you kind of like came to,

361
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,400
like this one where like, oh, I like watching this.

362
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,560
It feels like your initial idea

363
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,200
of what a classic Oscar telecast is.

364
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,400
Yeah, the truly the best, the best Oscars

365
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,600
and the best award show I've ever seen period

366
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,880
is Billy Crystal in 1992.

367
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,720
Yeah.

368
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,280
So this would have been for the movies of 91.

369
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,680
And this is the year that he did,

370
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,440
he came out as Hannibal Lecter.

371
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,280
Yes.

372
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,520
And he did a medley,

373
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,480
it was the second time he'd done the medley,

374
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,000
but he did it, it was like just a fun medley.

375
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,280
It was the Jack Palance pushups.

376
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,160
And it was the best joke.

377
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,720
And they've since recounted this,

378
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
him and the Lanchard people have recounted this

379
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,000
enough to where I don't like it anymore.

380
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,040
But at the time it was very funny where Hal Roach gets up

381
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,800
and he introduces Hal Roach,

382
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
who's the great silent film director.

383
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,720
And Hal Roach like gives a speech where he can't,

384
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,600
he gives it off mic.

385
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,440
So the whole thing.

386
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,480
I like you, I like you, I like you.

387
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,480
And then Billy Crystal's response is that was appropriate

388
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,800
since Hal began his career in silent film.

389
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,520
And that brings back.

390
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,520
And so when I saw that as a kid, I was like, wow,

391
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,160
this is a real, it was a genuinely entertaining show.

392
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,800
I mean, I know everybody has like conflicted thoughts

393
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,120
about Billy Crystal now, but like he hosted that.

394
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,520
And when Ellen DeGeneres hosted the first Emmys

395
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,520
after 9-11 were like genuinely really great hosting jobs.

396
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,960
Like I can point to it's that.

397
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,760
And maybe like when John Waters,

398
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,320
there's been like when John Waters

399
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,720
did the independent spirit awards,

400
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,640
like there's a handful of like hosting jobs where you're like,

401
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,760
well, those were really good,

402
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,040
but that one was like a really good show, 92.

403
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,080
That's exactly my answer to it.

404
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,040
And especially, and I was of the right age

405
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,760
and being like a Disney kid as we all were,

406
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
that's the year of beauty and the beast.

407
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,880
So it's all those songs.

408
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
So they're big songs,

409
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,440
which has like almost immediately stopped being the case.

410
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,360
Like, I don't, I can't remember when a popular song won the,

411
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,600
or was even in competition for it.

412
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,720
They're all like weird.

413
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,120
Sometimes it's almost like they don't do the category,

414
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,440
but that year it's like huge songs,

415
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,240
Sons of the Lambs, huge, every movie's huge.

416
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,920
Did something from Beauty and the Beast win best song?

417
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,800
I think Beauty and the Beast.

418
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,840
But it was three of the five were from Beauty and the Beast.

419
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,760
It was always, and then like the Disney ones won,

420
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,080
I feel like every, the Disney ballads.

421
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,200
Yes, which always upset me as a kid.

422
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,320
Cause you like the more fun ones.

423
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,520
I wanted Under the Sea to win.

424
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,400
I wanted Be Our Guest to win.

425
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,640
Did Under the Sea win?

426
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,480
It may have won.

427
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,320
I think it might have.

428
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,400
But from then on it was always.

429
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,120
Kiss the Girl wasn't enough of a,

430
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,720
wait, no, or was it, did Party Your War?

431
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,560
I don't know.

432
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,360
Like Hakuna Matata did in the wedding.

433
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,200
Hakuna Matata did not.

434
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,040
No, no.

435
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,880
Circle of Life probably.

436
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,000
Or Can You Feel the Love Tonight?

437
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
Jason, Look at our Love Tonight.

438
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,600
That's what it was.

439
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,720
I'm looking up Little Mermaid.

440
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,320
I can only do one at a time.

441
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,800
I, you know what's a funny one is that

442
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,240
Colors of the Wind won over

443
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,160
You've Got a Friend in Me.

444
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,880
The Randy Newman ones are really spotty.

445
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,720
Oh, interesting.

446
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,000
Where it's less popular, Randy Newman ones won.

447
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,560
But in looking at, in general,

448
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,120
looking at clips of the last 20, 25 years,

449
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,480
I think Randy Newman has performed every year.

450
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,600
Since, you always have.

451
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,480
Did Randy Newman win for Michael or something?

452
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,320
Yeah, probably.

453
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,360
Oh, here, Jordan's got it.

454
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,840
That's Under the Sea winning.

455
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,680
Okay, Under the Sea did win.

456
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,160
With Dudley Moore and Paula Abdul presenting.

457
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,000
Wow.

458
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,840
What a pair.

459
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,760
Original score and original song.

460
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,600
Oh, Little Mermaid.

461
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,440
So it got two.

462
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,280
Yeah.

463
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,520
But I think you had the ballads from then on.

464
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,440
Kiss the Girl was nominated.

465
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,280
Sure.

466
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,120
It's a fun one.

467
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,960
Kiss the Girl.

468
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,240
Kiss the Girl.

469
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,680
Morgan Freeman's Kiss the Girl.

470
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
That should have been that.

471
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,040
The original Alex Cross adventure.

472
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,600
One of the great, one of the great notes.

473
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,840
Tyler Perry took over the role.

474
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,280
Is that what that is, really?

475
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,120
Tyler Perry played Alex.

476
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,400
Kiss the Girl's the same thing.

477
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,240
It's the same book series.

478
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,960
Kiss the Girl, Along Came a Spider.

479
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,800
Oh.

480
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,640
And Alex Cross.

481
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,480
Alex Cross, yeah.

482
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,320
Oh, wow.

483
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,880
I didn't know that.

484
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay, so in terms of,

485
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,920
let's just start diving in here.

486
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,120
And I'm excited to have you for this, Ryan, also.

487
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,440
Because I feel like you're, you are a cinephile.

488
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,760
You're a fan of high art.

489
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,520
And we tend to gravitate to the lowest.

490
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,360
Gutter.

491
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,600
Yeah, we tend to.

492
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,880
Waterless toilet full of art.

493
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,760
I like the toilet, I like it all.

494
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,120
Ryan likes the toilet.

495
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,200
But that's where, these things, I think,

496
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,520
really square off on the Oscar stage.

497
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,160
And especially did, we're gonna be so 80s centric here,

498
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,400
I feel.

499
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,360
And I'm gonna start there with one.

500
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,720
I couldn't not do this one.

501
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,280
And this might already answer the question,

502
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,720
what's the most theme parky thing

503
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,080
that ever happened on the Oscars?

504
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,760
And for this, I go to 1988.

505
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,720
Jordan, I believe the file is Peewee One.

506
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,360
Do you guys know this offhand?

507
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,680
Can you picture Peewee Herman's Oscar appearance?

508
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,240
I think I've seen this, yeah.

509
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,840
Okay.

510
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,600
Yeah, this is like, I mean,

511
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,840
this is like designed to get five-year-olds in

512
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,920
and watching it for the rest of their lives.

513
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,440
It's so crazy.

514
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,240
Oh, wait, I'm sorry, stop it for a second.

515
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,400
The context here is that Peewee Herman

516
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,320
is presenting an award,

517
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,480
but he's been, a PA has come on stage

518
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,120
and whispered in his ear that there is a giant robot

519
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,560
that is making his way to the theater.

520
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
And he says, yeah, I'm so sure.

521
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,640
And then goes about his business,

522
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,480
and then this happens.

523
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:26,760
It's Ed 209 for the listeners.

524
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,440
Roll the cop when you need one.

525
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,640
Oh my God.

526
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,560
Oh.

527
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,840
Ed 209 is now shooting,

528
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,120
and Peewee is flying up into the rafters.

529
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,800
Peewee can fly is what we're learning.

530
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Ed 209 is, by the way,

531
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
open fire on the audience of the Oscar.

532
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,480
Yeah, he's pointed more at them than at Peewee.

533
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,640
Yeah. And either way,

534
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,720
he's hitting people in the balcony.

535
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,160
Yeah, no, this is a mass shooting.

536
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah.

537
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,560
This is more deadly of an event than in RoboCop

538
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,960
and in the conference room.

539
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,560
Massive body count.

540
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,080
The choice to make him fly in that is the fun.

541
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,800
I mean, I like everything that happens.

542
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,560
I think that's a great, if I saw that today,

543
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,520
I would eat my shorts.

544
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,560
That's a terrific little bit.

545
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,720
It's really fun.

546
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,040
That's just fun for all ages.

547
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,880
It's just good.

548
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,600
If you want to see a little of the aftermath of Peewee 2,

549
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,720
Jordan, just to see it in reverse, RoboCop does appear.

550
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,160
You'll be happy to know.

551
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,600
And I skipped most of the extremely analog,

552
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,080
old TV mixer laser fight that occurs.

553
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,800
It's the wimpiest laser beams you've ever seen,

554
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,320
but it really goes and goes.

555
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,520
And then, do we have the clip?

556
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,360
Let's see what it is.

557
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,360
It's like it's a laser that using a Johnny Carson sketch.

558
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,760
Johnny Carson sketch.

559
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,180
Thanks, RoboCop.

560
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,600
All right, Peewee.

561
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,960
It's safe to continue giving the award now.

562
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,300
Thanks, RoboCop.

563
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,360
It's silence.

564
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,000
RoboCop just in the aisle.

565
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,560
Doesn't know his exit.

566
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,800
Peewee just lowers slowly.

567
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,160
He should have been sitting somewhere.

568
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,400
It's cool if Peter Weller would have

569
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,500
reprised his role though for the little appearance.

570
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,800
I mean.

571
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,640
That's good.

572
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,480
I mean, John Wick should interrupt the Oscars or something.

573
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,320
Yeah.

574
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,160
Like, yeah.

575
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,980
That'd be awesome.

576
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,820
They should do stuff like that.

577
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,660
Yeah.

578
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,500
You know what?

579
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,840
We're all so concerned, like as if nominating

580
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,860
the right movie is gonna get everybody excited.

581
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,160
Like, and then it's not gonna win.

582
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,600
You know, like what's the Top Gun Maverick nomination

583
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,920
actually gonna do in terms of like,

584
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,280
oh, there's movies people like it.

585
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,120
What they need is Maverick crash landing

586
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,240
in the theater.

587
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,600
Mini like drone control planes racing through.

588
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,120
When I was a kid, I never thought like,

589
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,820
why isn't Batman nominated for best picture?

590
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,420
Like, it's nominated for like visual effects or something

591
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,060
and then that's when you see Batman.

592
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,360
Like there is a time and place in the ceremony

593
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,800
as that was for RoboCop to show up.

594
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,640
Right.

595
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,460
And they would make a point.

596
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,600
I don't know that they do that kind of thing anymore.

597
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,400
They should have Maverick crash landing in the theater.

598
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,640
And then Tom Hanks's Colonel Tom Parker should try to,

599
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,200
you put on a hell of a show and he should try to do

600
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,240
all 10 accents he does as one character.

601
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,360
I did not kill everybody.

602
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,400
It is not true.

603
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,800
Singing to Santa Claus, singing.

604
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,320
This is not, why are they giving away golden statues?

605
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,680
They have not sung Santa Claus.

606
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,160
My pitch for a movie actually is Tar versus

607
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,440
Colonel Tom Parker.

608
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,720
Maybe they can do that at the show though.

609
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,800
It's like start with, she's like conducting,

610
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,000
like open on her conducting and then Tom,

611
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,560
and then Colonel Tom comes out and says,

612
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,900
no, no, no, she will not,

613
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,400
Tar will not conduct Santa Claus.

614
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,240
You sing rocking around Christmas tree.

615
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,080
That is what you do.

616
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,700
He picks up the same baton.

617
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,240
For him it goes limp.

618
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,960
And then all that he tries, I will do it myself.

619
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,800
And then all the tubas.

620
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,040
I love, they should, like, you know what?

621
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,400
Well, it's clear what they have to do.

622
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,960
They gotta get Bruce.

623
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,560
There's only one way out of the mess.

624
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,840
Like when you think about when did the Oscars

625
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,580
start going off the cliff?

626
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,740
I don't know exactly when he stopped working on them,

627
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,360
but I can only, you know, he hasn't been doing it

628
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,200
since the early 2000s probably.

629
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,040
Does he have a credit?

630
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,880
This is a good question.

631
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,600
We've looked this up, I think.

632
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,280
And it feels like he has it, but maybe again,

633
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,160
Jason, you have to look this up.

634
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,320
When did Bruce stop?

635
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,200
Yeah, well I know that he,

636
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,960
because I read an oral history of it recently.

637
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,200
Get Bruce's information.

638
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,920
Let's get him down here right now.

639
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
We should get him on here.

640
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,320
If you don't know also, Bruce,

641
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,640
but we should probably contextualize Bruce Vellanche

642
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,480
the kind of like.

643
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,800
I don't think your audience needs a context.

644
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,640
Yeah, okay, bye, after.

645
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,680
He comes up every three episodes anyway.

646
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

647
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,120
I just said it, maybe I said it for the first time

648
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,040
that Ryan and I have seen Mr. Vellanche perform live

649
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,320
as the Widow Twanky.

650
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,560
Yes, yeah. That's true.

651
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,960
That's true, Mike and I had a special day

652
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
many years ago in Aladdin Live.

653
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,320
And do you remember what happened at the brunch before?

654
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,160
What news you received on your phone?

655
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Yes, it was a Sunday morning

656
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,040
that we saw Aladdin's winter wish.

657
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,720
And right before we went in,

658
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,040
I remember I looked at my phone

659
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,800
and Peter O'Toole had just died.

660
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
It wasn't just a text that said he is risen.

661
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,480
No.

662
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,720
It wasn't just a text that said he is risen.

663
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
No, no, it wasn't that.

664
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,320
Well, and if we're addressing tales of this nature,

665
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,000
I think I've told you, Ryan,

666
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,640
the tale of you meeting Wallace Shawn

667
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,040
has been told on the show more times

668
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,920
than I could possibly count.

669
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,000
You've been a presence in the show ever since five years ago

670
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,160
when you did it by this story being told over and over.

671
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,000
I think it's where Five Timers came from.

672
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,480
Five Timers for us, Ryan, are not people

673
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,560
who've been on the show five times.

674
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,600
Stories that have been told five times.

675
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,960
A lot of times when I'm saying something,

676
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,320
I'm like, oh, this is one of the things that makes Scott mad.

677
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,160
Like if I bring up Brian Setzer,

678
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,360
if I bring up Green Day or something,

679
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,960
I know for sure, like I'm in the middle of it,

680
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,920
but I'm like, well, you know, I'm telling you about it.

681
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,640
I wandered right into retelling the Wallace Shawn,

682
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,960
Andre Gregory story.

683
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,320
And he was like, you've told this before.

684
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,160
And I went, what?

685
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,000
I thought it was just, like, I had no idea.

686
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,920
I had told it this many times.

687
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,760
So it's just something I say.

688
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,080
Also, because some of these things

689
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,160
are also told in our day to day life.

690
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,000
Sure.

691
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,840
Oh, sure.

692
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,920
It might not be Five Timers on the show,

693
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,080
but I have heard them in person so many times

694
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,920
as opposed to the clown.

695
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,600
I had such a good time seeing you go up to them

696
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
and talk to them and then the whole experience.

697
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,440
It was not even Gregory's birthday.

698
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,280
It was his birthday.

699
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,600
We all sang happy birthday.

700
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,000
We all sang, you thought about getting a piece of cake,

701
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,560
but I think you decided not to.

702
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,400
Oh, okay.

703
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,240
Which would have probably been fine, honestly.

704
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,320
We all should have gotten cake.

705
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,840
It was like a group of 20 people.

706
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,320
We were just like standing there to say hello to them

707
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,160
or something.

708
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,200
And we realized we were in the middle

709
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,360
of a birthday celebration for Andre Greger.

710
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,200
Yeah.

711
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,040
Yeah, that would have been a good,

712
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,800
I don't know why we didn't do that.

713
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,040
I know, I feel a little regretful of it.

714
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,760
I liked that little, that piece of it

715
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,280
where a detail that was important to you, Mike,

716
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,200
and that you've told every time it's been told,

717
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,960
Ryan thought about getting a piece of cake and then didn't.

718
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,560
Or something that didn't register with Ryan himself.

719
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,400
Well, he.

720
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,160
And then here's what makes it a great story.

721
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,480
Yeah, but it does make it a great story though.

722
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,960
It does really, the idea that I thought about eating cake

723
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,440
and then really kicks it up a notch.

724
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,480
I think it does.

725
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,600
I guess it indicates your respect for these men

726
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,000
such that you would not.

727
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,160
Yes, you don't want to suspect them.

728
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,880
Wait, so what do you find,

729
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,280
what is the best part of the story?

730
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,280
It was how excited I was?

731
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,120
Well, I think,

732
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,960
Well, first of all, it's Walsh-Sean

733
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
being part of it at all.

734
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,000
I love Walsh-Sean.

735
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,320
Because another thing that's happened on the show,

736
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,040
you have argued to no one about,

737
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,400
I've watched you go like,

738
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,080
and if you don't think Walsh-Sean is great,

739
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,160
then fuck you.

740
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,840
Like you've argued to no, to an invisible party about like,

741
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,680
I think I have,

742
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,320
you want to tell me Walsh-Sean isn't great

743
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,160
in Haunted Mansion?

744
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,280
He's always great.

745
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,480
Well, I was yelling at Jason in that.

746
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,320
Yeah, yeah.

747
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,840
I've read a few of, during lockdown,

748
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,720
I read a few Walsh-Sean books.

749
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,880
So I started to appreciate Mike Stewart's a little more.

750
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,360
It's gone to a different level,

751
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,200
especially that play that you all saw.

752
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,120
This is what you'd say about a grandparent.

753
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,760
Now I have the context to know that they've lived in a chain.

754
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,840
I shouldn't roll my eyes at his stories.

755
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,640
I used to think grandpop stories were boring and bland,

756
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,160
but then I realized the wisdom he was trying to impart.

757
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,640
I'll take it, honestly.

758
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,200
I'll answer the, I jumped on the,

759
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,040
what makes it,

760
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,640
what is the crucial part of the story for you?

761
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,960
Well, okay, there's a,

762
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,160
I don't want to rehash the whole thing

763
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,840
because there's so much stuff I loved about the situation,

764
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,920
including that Armand Schimerman was sitting behind us,

765
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,880
who played Quark on Deep Space Nine.

766
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,720
Oh, that part makes it come up a lot.

767
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,760
And I peed next to him,

768
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,720
and then at the middle of this, again,

769
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,080
this is, I've said this on the show before,

770
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,880
but it, in the middle, at intermission,

771
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,360
Armand stood up and he goes,

772
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,400
huh, I thought it was over.

773
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,880
Well, I guess we'll just see what happens next.

774
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,480
Which is so funny.

775
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,080
He forgot how a play works.

776
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,200
He forgot how to play.

777
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,520
He clearly was done.

778
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,280
It was a long first half.

779
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,120
Yeah.

780
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,520
Quark doesn't know how plays work.

781
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,720
Mike pees with Quark.

782
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,160
I peed with Quark, which is so fun.

783
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,000
I love him.

784
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,640
He's one of the best characters.

785
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,920
He's great.

786
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,880
All of that was fun.

787
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,720
It's fun seeing it in a small theater.

788
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,560
And then we were,

789
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,800
just ended up in this little celebration,

790
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,720
and I was just delighted by the whole situation.

791
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,920
I was delighted by it.

792
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,040
I haven't been back to the Red Cat in COVID times,

793
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,600
but at that same theater,

794
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,800
I don't think it was this performance.

795
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,640
It was a different performance.

796
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,400
I saw Philip Baker Hall.

797
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Oh yeah.

798
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,440
And he was on Oxygen, and he was in his,

799
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,400
he was, he died not that long ago,

800
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,880
but I also saw him there, attending a play once,

801
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,240
and said hello to him.

802
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,960
He was very gracious as well.

803
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,480
You had to say hi to him before you went.

804
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,320
Yeah, that's cool.

805
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,040
Yeah, that's a little secret.

806
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,880
I think that's kind of a,

807
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,480
if you want to see like really great actors,

808
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,400
go see plays at the Red Cat, you'll see.

809
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,680
Cause a very small, I mean small theater.

810
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,520
It's a small theater,

811
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,160
but they do like plays by the Wooster Group,

812
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,840
and like, it's like,

813
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,240
you'll see sometimes stars on stage,

814
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,080
but a lot of times respected actors in the audience

815
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,920
watching, I feel like.

816
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,760
Right, wow.

817
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,040
Where's the, what city is Rick heading?

818
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,280
It's like downtown, it's by the Disney Concert Hall.

819
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,200
It's like, it's connected to that big structure.

820
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,040
Oh, gotcha.

821
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,000
And then maybe you'll get to eat cake,

822
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,400
or think about eating cake with one of the actors.

823
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,520
If you're lucky, you will get to consider cake.

824
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,760
You get to look at cake.

825
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,240
And then I think you came back and said,

826
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,840
Andre Gregory was telling somebody like,

827
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,760
you must come up to the cabin sometime.

828
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,720
That's a good quote, that's a good quote.

829
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,400
I think you did a good impression on much better.

830
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,720
You did a very good impression of him,

831
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,600
as my memory is full.

832
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,440
Anyway.

833
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,400
Okay.

834
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,320
Let me throw this out into what we were talking about

835
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,720
before that sidetrack.

836
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,680
Ryan, what you said about like,

837
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,880
you knew that the silly stuff would happen

838
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,680
in the effects categories.

839
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,960
This isn't the funniest clip in the world,

840
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,320
but I wonder if you'll remember it.

841
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,360
This to me is the epitome of what you're talking about.

842
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,120
That like, with those ones, that they feel technical,

843
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,200
but it's about the big movies that everybody likes,

844
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,080
and we have a little fun with these.

845
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,080
Can we show the clip Elijah?

846
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,400
Does anyone remember this offhand?

847
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,480
I don't think I know this.

848
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,320
May I have the envelope?

849
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,720
Young Elijah Wood.

850
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,560
Oh wow.

851
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,600
What's that sound?

852
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,440
Oh!

853
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,320
Oh!

854
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,520
It's a T-Rex poking out from.

855
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,080
That's a big build.

856
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,920
Yeah.

857
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,520
You can kind of feel the flatness.

858
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,720
I think this is, you know, a facade style.

859
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,520
They only did one side of it, but it's huge.

860
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,360
Yeah.

861
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,760
You got the context when little Elijah Wood walked up.

862
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,600
That's little Anna Paquin there.

863
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,080
Little Anna Paquin who won.

864
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,000
I don't know what that award was going to, Jurassic Park.

865
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,840
But Anna Paquin won that.

866
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,680
The one that year won for the piano.

867
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,840
Yeah, yeah.

868
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,360
Big year for kids.

869
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,800
Big, big year for kids.

870
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,320
Big year for kids.

871
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,000
That's fun.

872
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,840
That's Elijah.

873
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,680
Let's see, he would have been coming off

874
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,760
the good son probably.

875
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,580
Yeah.

876
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,420
With old Mac.

877
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,680
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

878
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,840
I think I was surprised that wasn't Mac.

879
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,640
I assume Mac had his Oscar, he must have done.

880
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,280
I'm sure Mac had an Oscar moment at some point.

881
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,480
Well, Jason, do you have a say?

882
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,640
I feel like you got a list brewing or something.

883
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,720
Do you want to throw in something?

884
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,560
I need a few.

885
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,000
If you have, do you want to jump to 98?

886
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,840
Sure.

887
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,680
Yes.

888
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,000
Okay, let's jump to 1998.

889
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,800
This is, I looked this up, this was the year

890
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,280
the most viewers, like the highest rated.

891
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,480
So 50 million people tuned in.

892
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,920
Is this the Titanic?

893
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,520
Yeah, this is the Titanic here.

894
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,200
And I think one thing I think about the Oscars,

895
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,320
you mentioned the State of the Union, Ryan.

896
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,420
This time of year, it's like State of the Union

897
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,240
Super Bowl Oscars.

898
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,760
And I feel like I just always kind of related that,

899
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,240
of these are live events, everyone's gonna watch

900
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,400
these sorts of things.

901
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,560
All equally exciting.

902
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,000
All equally exciting.

903
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,180
Well, look, the Oscars was most exciting to me.

904
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,760
But when it comes down to viewers, the Super Bowl in 98

905
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,240
had 90 million viewers and the Oscars had 50 million.

906
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,320
And so I think that used to be the norm,

907
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,600
a little bit like 50%.

908
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,000
And...

909
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,120
Now it's like negative 12 million.

910
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,880
Now it's like, the Super Bowl has held steady

911
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,160
and gone up to like 110, 120 million a few times.

912
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,760
And the Oscars last year, I think was 16 million.

913
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,600
Wow.

914
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,440
Yeah.

915
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,240
And it's grimmer and grimmer.

916
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,880
I mean, as with, you know, Ryan, we watched

917
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,040
the train station Oscars together.

918
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Which turned out to be a train wreck Oscars.

919
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,440
Not because of the movie either.

920
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,920
That wasn't that year.

921
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,680
No, that was the most...

922
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,440
Then you hear the numbers and you're like,

923
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,640
of course no one watched.

924
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,880
Why would anyone?

925
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,000
I think it's hard to come back.

926
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,760
Honestly, after Union Station, it's hard to come back.

927
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,960
You can't keep them, you can't get them back on the farm

928
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,560
after you've been to Union Station

929
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,400
with the glen clothes twerking.

930
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,680
And that was the fun part.

931
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,400
That was the only bit of fun.

932
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,480
That was the only, that was like the slice of cake

933
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,320
they considered having.

934
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,040
As good as it got.

935
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,280
But better times, 98.

936
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,520
Yeah.

937
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,020
Jordan, if you can pull up the first clip.

938
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,720
So just to set everyone up,

939
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,920
Billy Crystal comes out on a big Titanic.

940
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,640
He's like up by the ceiling.

941
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,480
Of course.

942
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,840
And then the ship sinks.

943
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,680
But while sinking, it gently lowers him to the stage.

944
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,760
So it kind of serves two purposes.

945
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,360
And there's just like two song moments in this

946
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,880
that really stuck out to me.

947
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,880
I think the Oscars too, were a good demonstration of like,

948
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,160
when the culture was much more of like a mono culture,

949
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,240
with like, here's the reference point,

950
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,280
and everyone in the crowd knows what they're referencing.

951
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,320
Sure.

952
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,600
Oddly, the only thing that's gotten us back to that

953
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,160
is the slap.

954
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,000
Yeah, it is.

955
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,720
Finally, the thing at the Oscars

956
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,120
is the only thing everyone was talking about.

957
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,480
Yeah.

958
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,120
But back then.

959
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,520
My films nominated for best picture are,

960
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,400
The Judge, Right Back to the Theater,

961
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,760
The Tale of a Giant Ship,

962
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,800
that started many years ago with an over budget script.

963
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,640
20 year old show.

964
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,200
The Borg was a loud director man,

965
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,040
who made accountants sick.

966
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,800
Two studios teamed up to pay for a three hour flick.

967
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,880
Everybody got three hour flick.

968
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,120
That's good, like what else?

969
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,440
That's so clean.

970
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,280
People like it.

971
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,400
Yes.

972
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,240
And then.

973
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,600
Some other films deserve a break,

974
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,680
like My Giant in Three Weeks,

975
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,880
My Giant in Three Weeks.

976
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,920
Oh, that's a room for My Giant.

977
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,080
I've gotta tip my hat to Gilligan,

978
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,320
the skipper to.

979
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,160
That's Jimmy Cameron.

980
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,000
Jimmy Cameron, yeah.

981
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,320
The propeller guy and the eye.

982
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,040
The movie star, the professor and Marianne,

983
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,680
here on Oscar's Big Night.

984
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,520
Yeah, going well.

985
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,680
So like that, it is clean.

986
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,520
It's very clean.

987
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,360
Everyone gets it.

988
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,280
It works.

989
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,680
There's a classic like,

990
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,800
and then you just leave the last one in the list,

991
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,200
is just the actual one.

992
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,040
Yeah.

993
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,160
That's exactly what I would do in anything similar to that.

994
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,000
It's funny to not change it.

995
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,840
Replacing the wife,

996
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,640
and his wife with the ice.

997
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,480
Ice.

998
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,320
It's really funny.

999
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,600
It's really slick.

1000
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,920
Well, this is a question maybe,

1001
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,240
is where does,

1002
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,640
because I've been grappling with this in my own head,

1003
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,080
where do we all fall in terms of,

1004
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,760
do we like the Billy Crystal medleys?

1005
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,800
What's, where do you put it in terms of ironic like,

1006
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,880
or just like?

1007
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,920
Do you even know?

1008
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,760
That's a good question.

1009
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,580
Yeah.

1010
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,420
Because we loved it when we were,

1011
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,320
I mean, we would look forward to it.

1012
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,440
Loved it, we paid, everyone got it.

1013
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,040
I think, you know, it's a few crossovers

1014
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,680
with theme parks for me where it's like,

1015
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,000
oh, I know the reference before I saw the thing.

1016
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,680
Like I knew this joke about Gilligan's Island at Titanic

1017
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,680
before I ever saw Titanic.

1018
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,240
I have to give credit for,

1019
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,960
I have to say that these like,

1020
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,280
Mark Shaman arrangements are good.

1021
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,320
Like they're, they're like,

1022
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,600
they flow in a way,

1023
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,960
like as to whether or not these are good or bad,

1024
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,240
like lyrically they're corny or whatever.

1025
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,480
They, they're not always like the most inspired,

1026
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,880
but like I do like listening to them as well.

1027
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,840
Like, you know.

1028
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,080
And he pulls them off music

1029
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,760
and it utilizes the full orchestra that's always there

1030
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
and sounds great.

1031
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,480
And it makes it feel like elevate,

1032
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,360
it doesn't feel like some talk show bit

1033
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,520
because there's a grandeur to the orchestra,

1034
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,360
to the stage.

1035
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,960
And soon to have a theme park credit to his name

1036
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,080
because he was one of the people

1037
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,520
behind Rodgers musical from Hawkeye

1038
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,280
that they're putting in California Adventure.

1039
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,120
Mark Shaman is really?

1040
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,960
Yeah.

1041
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,800
Wow.

1042
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,640
Okay.

1043
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,460
I mean, he's good.

1044
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah, everything his name is on is good.

1045
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,840
Ryan, when you,

1046
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,680
I don't know if it was last year when you were doing this,

1047
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,400
but you, you were like ranking the Billy Crystal songs

1048
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,600
on Instagram,

1049
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,440
Yeah.

1050
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,260
which was a delight.

1051
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,240
And to see ones that you particularly responded to,

1052
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,360
do you recall what was number one?

1053
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,740
I don't offhand.

1054
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,440
Number one was the Full Monty was in the top.

1055
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,320
It might've been like number three or two.

1056
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,960
And it wasn't really ranked by the best.

1057
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,640
It was more ranked by what like was lodged in my head.

1058
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,000
It was more like a subjective rating of like,

1059
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,840
of a line.

1060
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,480
And if I think about it sometimes while I'm driving

1061
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,920
or something that it's the thing,

1062
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,320
but number one was the year it was the,

1063
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,400
he had done all the movies for 1990.

1064
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,240
It was in 93.

1065
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,400
So it would have been the movies in 92.

1066
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,040
So it's unforgiven, few good men or whatever.

1067
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,440
So he sings unforgiven.

1068
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,560
If it's to the line,

1069
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,840
it's to the music of unforgettable.

1070
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,720
Unforgiven a few good men sent of a woman,

1071
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,040
the crying game.

1072
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,720
And if you get a man,

1073
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,960
that's the list of all five nominees.

1074
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,800
Now before I slide down on my knees,

1075
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,160
da da da da da da da da da da da da da,

1076
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,080
Mr. Saturday night.

1077
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,360
And everyone's like,

1078
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,880
which he was plugging at the time.

1079
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,720
The film.

1080
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,760
And there was talk that maybe he would,

1081
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,080
the film would be up for Oscar.

1082
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,720
I think David Paymer did get an Oscar nomination for it.

1083
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,560
Oh really?

1084
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,600
But, but, but yeah.

1085
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
And so he was, it was this thing.

1086
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,960
It was just so raw.

1087
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,600
Yeah.

1088
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,240
Him wanting that, that, that, you know,

1089
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,560
a joke, but also like I made it.

1090
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
It's kind of like my giant, you know, kind of like.

1091
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,000
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1092
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,560
Very, very bald, I guess.

1093
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,400
The one that I think I told you this

1094
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,800
when you were posting those,

1095
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,760
the one that's lodged in my head forever.

1096
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,720
And I couldn't even remember what movie it was for,

1097
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,520
but it was, it was George Clooney for sure.

1098
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,000
And I mean, now I know what it is,

1099
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,200
but the song I just remembered was

1100
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,520
George is cracking up because his wife is shacking up.

1101
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,600
George is cracking up because his wife is shacking up.

1102
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,760
And then he's got in a comatose.

1103
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,400
And I don't remember it from there.

1104
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,240
Yes.

1105
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,040
Yeah. That's the private descendants.

1106
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,880
The descendants.

1107
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,280
And I had to look, I only,

1108
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,400
I only in a list later did I realize that's like,

1109
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,600
that's some Hawaiian hits, like pops.

1110
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,000
That's like a Don Ho kind of song.

1111
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,520
Oh, the Hawaiian tie.

1112
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,640
Or it's, or it's too like a traditional Hawaiian song.

1113
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,720
I don't, I don't know exactly, but like, yeah,

1114
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,560
I couldn't place the melody on.

1115
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,880
Isn't it in the Tiki Room, I think that song?

1116
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,320
Dun ka dun ka dun ka dun ka dun ka.

1117
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
Maybe. I think so.

1118
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,160
I don't know the name of it,

1119
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,560
but it's, I think in a lot of stuff.

1120
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,560
I, this brings me to a question that I had,

1121
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,960
and I wonder if we could, if we could just do,

1122
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,560
put on our writer, put on our Bruce hats.

1123
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,880
Do we think that we could think of a plausible

1124
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,120
Billy Crystal song for this year's nominees?

1125
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,880
And I say that, and I don't think we,

1126
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,000
we don't have to flesh out the whole thing.

1127
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,880
Just be the vaguest idea of it.

1128
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,800
And with this, I don't mean to make it tougher

1129
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,480
to tie your hands behind your backs,

1130
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,240
but I remind you of the Billy Crystal rules,

1131
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,720
which are it, preferably a song from before 1959.

1132
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,560
Oh, okay.

1133
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,240
And, and if possible, you know,

1134
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,160
with the Jonah Hill one being the exception,

1135
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,760
a song that is nice to the people involved.

1136
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,600
Right.

1137
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,440
And he likes them.

1138
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,280
Yeah.

1139
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,680
That's just, that's just, that's just bonus points.

1140
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,200
But does any, at this point,

1141
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,960
what you gotta do is just like,

1142
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,680
and I don't look, I don't know a lot of these songs,

1143
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,440
but if we, maybe we can work backwards from like

1144
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,320
the Cole Porter catalog or a song from a musical.

1145
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,080
Yes, you have to know the great American song,

1146
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,000
Rodgers and Hammerstein song.

1147
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,840
That would help.

1148
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,960
Like my favorite things.

1149
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,840
I know we did once.

1150
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,240
I think if we can think of a,

1151
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,200
just a song from a musical at all,

1152
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,400
I think we could go backwards.

1153
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,760
Yes.

1154
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,600
Well, okay.

1155
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,680
Let's just take a title.

1156
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,520
What's a title from this year?

1157
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,360
With Bright.

1158
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,200
What are the movies?

1159
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,080
And then, and then rhyme it with something from there.

1160
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,960
Well, Tar has, oh, thank you, Jordan.

1161
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,800
Oh my God.

1162
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,960
Oh, All Quiet on the Western Front.

1163
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,800
Okay.

1164
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,080
Women Talking.

1165
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,920
Okay.

1166
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,040
Oh, here, let me, well, let me admit it guys.

1167
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,560
Cause since I came in with this in the pocket,

1168
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,240
I did, I did this, this thought exercise

1169
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,680
on the couch there in a little while ago.

1170
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,200
And she said, oh, you know what,

1171
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,120
what about like a boogie woogie bugle boy?

1172
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,240
And I thought for a second, and then I think,

1173
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,160
wait, can I remember it?

1174
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,880
I think it was, oh, it's there,

1175
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,000
the fuss and feud and fable men's of Phoenix AZ.

1176
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,840
All right.

1177
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,340
Now you're talking.

1178
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,000
But don't let me take fable men's off the table.

1179
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,240
Oh sure, yeah.

1180
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,320
You know, Tar, there's a lot of rhyme schemes for,

1181
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,520
everything everywhere all at once.

1182
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,560
I think, I think there's probably something in like,

1183
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,320
you're the top gun maverick.

1184
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,680
You're the top, I think that's Cole Porter.

1185
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,300
And whatever, and we're gonna give you no static.

1186
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,800
You know, and you're the top Tom, we love you Tom.

1187
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,080
Yes, we genuinely love you Tom.

1188
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,880
The song was nice.

1189
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,880
You would only agree to be here

1190
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,000
if we didn't make any Apatow style jokes about you.

1191
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,280
I actually thought of one for top gun maverick as well,

1192
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,660
which is, okay, it was,

1193
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,640
start cheering for Cruz.

1194
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,000
Tom's flying the planes.

1195
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,840
Oh man.

1196
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:53,840
He wants to bring the theaters back, maverick, maverick.

1197
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,320
I should have texted you guys, we could have come in.

1198
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,200
I cheated here.

1199
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,360
You were, yeah.

1200
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,680
Is there one for like, does anything,

1201
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,520
oh, go ahead, Jason.

1202
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,080
I think I have one for Avatar,

1203
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,040
but it's a little bit of a journey.

1204
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:08,880
Sure.

1205
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,200
Like the film itself.

1206
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,040
Like the journey.

1207
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,600
Yeah.

1208
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,900
Again, Cole Porter song to lovely.

1209
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,520
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's the Navi.

1210
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,420
I think that's great.

1211
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,260
That's right on.

1212
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,580
Thank you.

1213
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,160
What about like the lonely goat from Sound of Music,

1214
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,080
like lonely Eekron or mighty Eekron.

1215
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,080
The mighty Eekron, yeah, assuming.

1216
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,240
I mean, if you use that phrase.

1217
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,560
Like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Eekron.

1218
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,340
And you can switch it to the, what's the other,

1219
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,480
the animal, wait, the, wait, the whale is the,

1220
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,440
Pyocon is what, why am I not remembering this?

1221
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,400
Wait, Pyocon.

1222
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,240
Toqun.

1223
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,060
Oh, the Toqun, yeah.

1224
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,280
Yeah, well, you could go through all the ee-hoo and toqun.

1225
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,120
That's how you switch it up.

1226
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,880
I would also propose a Gershwin,

1227
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,880
like someone to watch over Navi.

1228
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,960
Does anything scan with Oklahoma?

1229
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,320
Yeah, maybe.

1230
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,960
Could you, well, you could just do,

1231
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,440
I mean, you would think maybe he would do Elvis

1232
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,080
with an Elvis song, but I kind of like the idea.

1233
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,920
I think that would be the cheat.

1234
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,640
It would be, yeah, like, right, you know.

1235
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,040
But you could also just like, oh, it's Elvis.

1236
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,680
It's the most fun movie of the year.

1237
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,680
That's what he would do.

1238
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,160
The plot lures great, but look at Tom Hanks' waist.

1239
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,840
Okay, how about this?

1240
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,760
And I hate to break the rules of this, but.

1241
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,600
You can, I mean.

1242
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,520
But the song is over 20 years old,

1243
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,240
and it is another thing I say sometimes to annoy Scott.

1244
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,000
This Everclear song, Everything to Everyone,

1245
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,760
comes into play.

1246
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,280
Or like, damn. Maybe Billy's daughter would.

1247
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,360
Damn, damn, damn.

1248
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,160
You think that you're everything to everyone.

1249
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,320
All at once. All at once.

1250
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,880
The idea that he would do that.

1251
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,200
I like the idea that Billy Crystal,

1252
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,960
like what are some of the newer songs?

1253
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,800
Yeah.

1254
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,840
This is when you're writing for it.

1255
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,680
Oh, I know, Everclear.

1256
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,040
Oh, well, this is one of the hottest

1257
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,880
everybody's still talking about, Everclear.

1258
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,200
This is one of the hottest rock and roll songs

1259
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,320
around, Mr. Crystal.

1260
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,160
Okay, good, I'll go home.

1261
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,840
I'll look at it.

1262
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,240
Send me a tape.

1263
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,080
Oh, listen.

1264
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,040
You do what you do.

1265
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,640
You go to the parallel universe.

1266
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,440
You try to go everywhere.

1267
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,480
I had another thought also,

1268
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,640
which is that you would do,

1269
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,800
like, you know, it's about a conductor,

1270
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,800
so you could just go to Tar, Tar, Tar, Tar.

1271
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,760
Oh, yeah, you could do a classical.

1272
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,280
Well, Beethoven is definitely more than,

1273
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,240
older than 1959.

1274
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,480
Tar, Tar, Tar, Tar, Tar, Tar.

1275
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,320
She didn't.

1276
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,840
She made her.

1277
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,880
And then Crystal.

1278
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,040
And now she's dead.

1279
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,760
She's getting canceled.

1280
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,880
She's getting canceled.

1281
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
How about, I mean, it's not that old of a song,

1282
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,320
but like women talking around the sewing circle,

1283
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,760
women talking.

1284
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,760
And you know.

1285
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,600
Oh, Pretty Woman.

1286
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,440
Pretty Woman.

1287
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,520
Oh, no, I think he would do early rock and roll.

1288
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,600
I think now that's what he would bring fresh to the table

1289
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,720
for the 2020s.

1290
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,560
Yes, he'd be like.

1291
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,000
He's doing rock and roll now.

1292
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,840
Right, right.

1293
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,680
I like that.

1294
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,920
Any other quick hits before?

1295
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,760
Are we missing?

1296
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,160
No, wait, we got them all on screen right now.

1297
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,200
The Banshees, that's just a weird title.

1298
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,040
You know.

1299
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:27,880
You got to learn how to.

1300
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,120
It's something about like, inner Sharon, is that right?

1301
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,160
I don't know how to say inner Sharon.

1302
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,040
Like, I can't think of the song, though.

1303
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:36,880
I feel like there's jokes,

1304
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,760
so I feel like I've heard that title said

1305
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,160
multiple different ways.

1306
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,520
Yeah, inner Sharon, and Sharon, inner Sharon.

1307
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,040
You say inner Sharon.

1308
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,880
I say inner Sharon.

1309
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,000
I say inner Sharon.

1310
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,600
You say inner Sharon.

1311
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,440
Inner Sharon.

1312
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,920
Let's call the whole flick great.

1313
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,680
That's a, all right.

1314
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,520
Wow.

1315
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,320
We put on our Bruce hats.

1316
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,800
All right, all right.

1317
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,640
That's wonderful.

1318
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,960
Some of these, a more recent host,

1319
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,120
I always love the joke,

1320
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,680
when Hugh Jackman did a musical medley,

1321
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,680
and they were just doing a weird dance,

1322
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,920
and he said, the reader,

1323
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,800
I didn't see the reader.

1324
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,640
That was really funny.

1325
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,880
That was a great joke.

1326
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,600
Yeah, and it catches, I like when he laughed while doing it.

1327
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,320
I think Jackman was kind of, who we liked lately.

1328
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,000
Do we like, I've liked all the Kimmel, I'm happy it's.

1329
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,840
Yeah.

1330
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,680
I'm happy it's Kimmel, because for the first time,

1331
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,120
we will get a joke on the Oscars about the slap.

1332
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,120
Yes, all right.

1333
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,640
I like it when there's a host.

1334
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,040
That's what lately what I enjoy.

1335
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,280
Controversial stance.

1336
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,120
When there's any host present.

1337
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,080
For some reason, Kimmel does it twice,

1338
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,480
and then they go, all right,

1339
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,600
we need to lay off the whole host thing.

1340
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,440
Yeah.

1341
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,840
After that envelope that he did the first time,

1342
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,760
but not the second.

1343
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,080
Why did the host disappear?

1344
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,320
Now they're just back to him.

1345
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,160
Yeah, yeah.

1346
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,560
Really strange.

1347
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,320
I was looking up some older ones,

1348
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,600
because I was trying to think pre-Billy Crystal,

1349
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:03,160
and they were much more reserved affairs,

1350
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,440
usually Johnny Carson hosting,

1351
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,680
and he would get some lines in,

1352
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,480
but then there were some weird moments, like 1981.

1353
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,280
The day it was supposed to happen,

1354
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,160
John Hinckley Jr. shot Ronald Reagan.

1355
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,840
And so they pushed the ceremony 24 hours,

1356
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,760
but then in a weird turn of events,

1357
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,760
they already had a pre-taped welcome from Ronald Reagan.

1358
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,000
So Johnny Carson is talking about Reagan

1359
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,720
being in a hospital room and requesting a TV

1360
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,680
so that he could watch the Oscar ceremony,

1361
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,640
and then they cut to a videotape

1362
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,080
where he's in the West Wing,

1363
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,720
talking about the magic of the movies.

1364
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,520
And it was just very weird.

1365
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,680
The other weird-

1366
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,160
From the bottom of my intact heart.

1367
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,000
Yeah.

1368
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,480
That's when they said,

1369
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,840
we're going to cut to a video of Mr. Rao.

1370
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,200
I was like, oh my God, is he in a emergency room?

1371
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,040
We're gonna cut to him in the middle of surgery.

1372
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,880
Yeah.

1373
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,480
And just so you know, Jodie Foster didn't,

1374
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,440
she's not impressed, sir.

1375
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,280
Yeah.

1376
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,400
America Soldier's on.

1377
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,000
Mission not accomplished.

1378
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,560
But 11 years before, I found an odd segment

1379
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,640
I didn't know about where Bob Hope and Fred Astaire

1380
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,280
gave out best documentary and best documentary short.

1381
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,280
And this was purely a way to set up Bob Hope

1382
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,280
to kind of pimp Fred Astaire into doing some dancing.

1383
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,160
And this is 1970.

1384
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,920
Fred Astaire was born in 1899.

1385
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,280
So he was 71 doing this.

1386
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,920
And he's still pretty good, but I was just like,

1387
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,000
wait, how old is he when this is happening?

1388
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,760
And the answer is he was 71.

1389
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,400
From the 1800s.

1390
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah. Wow.

1391
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Terms of kind of questionable performances of that nature.

1392
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,080
I'm gonna head to some stuff that Ryan brought to the table.

1393
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,560
And this is 1983.

1394
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:11,400
And well, the first performer in this list

1395
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,440
is Liza Minnelli, makes sense.

1396
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,880
This is how they open the shows with this musical number.

1397
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,360
Ryan, would you like to introduce the rest?

1398
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,240
Oh yes, this is 1983.

1399
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,320
Now I actually don't know where, I think this sat

1400
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,480
probably at the beginning of the show is where I think it does.

1401
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,880
I think so, yeah.

1402
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,600
The performers, it's a medley led by Liza Minnelli

1403
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,160
who had done the show before.

1404
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,480
Natural, gifted, when you think of,

1405
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,360
what basically Billy Crystal is parodying

1406
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,680
to some degree is something that Liza Minnelli would do wonderfully.

1407
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,360
Yeah. Dudley Moore, who was her co-star in Arthur,

1408
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,880
not a musical guy so much, but you know,

1409
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,040
could choke his way through it.

1410
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:52,440
Richard Pryor and Ed Walter Mathau.

1411
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,200
And if you have the question, can those people sing?

1412
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,320
Prepare for it to be answered.

1413
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:06,760
Let's do Liza Minnelli.

1414
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:30,200
There are thousands of craftsmen and women too loaded with technical skills.

1415
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:43,400
There was many a worthy crime.

1416
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,760
And also, and if it was a little unclear how that divided up,

1417
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,800
Dudley Moore gets through his little part OK, but then he coughs

1418
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,160
and then goes to Pryor who just doesn't, he loses it.

1419
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,120
Yeah, he does not have it.

1420
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,680
He's trying, he doesn't seem embarrassed or anything,

1421
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,880
but he is just not.

1422
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,360
So why would you think of him to sing?

1423
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,800
Yeah, so I'm more amazed at is why did they agree?

1424
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,040
Like now no one agrees to anything and they're like, yeah,

1425
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,640
we'll come out there and try to sing with Liza Minnelli.

1426
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,720
Yeah, I think a person now would be like, like my sense of I mean,

1427
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,480
I was starting to bring this up earlier that Bruce,

1428
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,160
I know that Bruce Philanche at least worked on the kind of notorious

1429
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,040
Anne Hathaway, James Franco Oscars.

1430
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,560
And that one, I guess that 2011, I looked it up to that 2010,

1431
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,240
2011, where the last one she was credited.

1432
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,280
Oh, well, OK, OK.

1433
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,880
That might have been the last one. Yeah.

1434
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,120
But I, you know, I mean, rightfully so given how it went,

1435
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,280
it seems to me from this oral history of that one that I read,

1436
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:51,720
and I was like very, very frightened and copped to it several times

1437
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,320
during the show was just kind of out of her wheelhouse.

1438
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,120
And she can sing, though, and she was still and then prior,

1439
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,120
just like, yeah, sure.

1440
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,360
Like zero nerves.

1441
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,720
What I would say is like the Anne Hathaway that failed might have been.

1442
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:10,160
I don't think that one failed as a failure of Anne Hathaway's hosting.

1443
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,360
If anything, she was the capable host.

1444
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,320
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1445
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,520
I don't know. I haven't gone back and rewatch it. Who would?

1446
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,400
But like at the same time, it's like that probably maybe was maybe.

1447
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,640
I don't know. There was some element.

1448
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,840
She's she's if anything, she's closer to like Eliza Manelli,

1449
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,200
who can like she can go out and carry the whole thing. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah.

1450
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,360
That one, because I went and looked around for like,

1451
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,120
are there clips of that for this episode?

1452
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,280
And it's just kind of it's just that the whole thing is off.

1453
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,760
There's no moment that's the drug.

1454
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,560
Yeah. Mainly that just doesn't.

1455
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,680
No, no, I just like it's they aren't that crazy to look at.

1456
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,800
It's just even the oral history said it's not that one thing was really bad.

1457
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,120
It was like death by a thousand cuts.

1458
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,160
There's like a mood in the. Yeah, I remember that.

1459
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:57,200
Yes. The whole night versus like, yeah, doing something crazy.

1460
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,280
James Franco, I think like by the time he came out and dressed as a woman

1461
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,760
or something or there was some kind of drag thing that didn't play.

1462
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,040
And by then, you're really not right.

1463
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,120
Well, this is what we got.

1464
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,240
This is the one idea that they agreed to.

1465
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,160
There's one more of can we play math out as a math prior to just to get one more

1466
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,360
hit of that sweet math that was singing.

1467
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,600
I wouldn't have thought that the loser of the fun.

1468
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,800
I just didn't know what he like.

1469
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,920
Maybe he's like an old man.

1470
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,960
Maybe he knew how to sing.

1471
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,640
But then the answer is this.

1472
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,760
And what about tonight?

1473
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,120
Now there were 2000 taxes and cummerbunds

1474
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:41,640
waiting for people to wear and buy those are of Hello Dolly, by the way.

1475
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,320
Oh, right. Totally unfamiliar.

1476
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,880
Yeah. Come on, Bonzo.

1477
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,480
We look to the sky.

1478
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,320
But he's like singing to a different song.

1479
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,680
It's yeah, he's all he's got on beat.

1480
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,440
Pretty nice even tries to help her line says now.

1481
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,760
What do you think now? Now?

1482
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,320
Now, now, now, wait.

1483
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,120
But but, you know, as as kind of disastrous as this is,

1484
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,960
they just laugh their way through it and it's fine.

1485
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,000
And it's all made up for by what Ryan you alerted me to at the end of the clip.

1486
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,840
Can you play number three?

1487
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,480
They didn't know the audience remembered this song by the time this thing happened,

1488
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,400
which is just legit good that we explain the voting procedures.

1489
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,000
So here to read the rules, here's Mr. John Maschietta.

1490
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,280
Know that name off and you know who this is.

1491
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,360
The voting procedures work like this.

1492
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,440
All Academy members vote on nominations for the five pictures of the year.

1493
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,040
Oh, the fast talk. Yeah.

1494
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,160
Micro Machines.

1495
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,200
They remember sending those nominations.

1496
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,480
That's that you get you get the idea.

1497
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,160
I mean, that's just that's just funny.

1498
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,640
He gets a huge applause at the end.

1499
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,360
Ernest Borgnein loves it. He's like, ah, I love it.

1500
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,800
That was probably before the Micro Machines campaign.

1501
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,600
Ever even. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1502
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,160
It might have just been like something he was doing for bits and

1503
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,640
options or something. This guy.

1504
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,440
If campaigns are on the table, have flow.

1505
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,520
The progressive lady and the guy code Gecko have them come out together like, well,

1506
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,520
we don't usually share the stage.

1507
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,280
We don't usually share the spotlight.

1508
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,840
Well, and the guy from the Hulu pool.

1509
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,600
Yeah, please. Oh, yes.

1510
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,440
Hulu executive before.

1511
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,960
Yeah. Let's get you out there.

1512
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,880
I'd love that.

1513
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,880
What does everyone here want to host the Oscars?

1514
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,240
No. Sure. Would you do you like that?

1515
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,040
It's really I'm asking you like as a kid, was that something you were like,

1516
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,480
I like to do this as a kid?

1517
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,920
Yes. Now, you know, it's just such a like trap.

1518
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,960
Like nobody comes out a lot like you're damned if you do damned if you die.

1519
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,720
And I think it's possible because of podcasts, the right.

1520
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,280
You guys could be asked.

1521
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,720
It's well, it's possible.

1522
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:54,120
We've I've been trying to get us to host the Theo Awards, the theme park awards.

1523
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,240
We've been turned down just even getting free tickets to it.

1524
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,640
I think a hosting trio could be in your future.

1525
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,480
And I think take any hosting job.

1526
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,600
I think host. I think when people like it's amazing to me that they can't find a

1527
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,600
host for the Oscars. That is absolutely mind boggling.

1528
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,040
Right. That they that there's not comedians.

1529
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,640
And I'm sure there are. There has to be a small list.

1530
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,760
Don't you think? Yeah, I think the list.

1531
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,920
I think the list is too.

1532
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,720
The list is too small. Yeah.

1533
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,120
And and and too many people are too afraid of I don't know.

1534
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,680
I guess what happened there and it was just like one thing is going to be

1535
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,440
pulled out and their career is going to be over, I guess. Right.

1536
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,840
You know what I think? I think they I bet what we don't know about

1537
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,000
is that I wonder if they aim way big.

1538
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,200
Like you always hear they want Dwayne Johnson.

1539
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,240
Yeah. And then maybe they try that for four months and then it falls apart.

1540
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,600
And then they have to scramble.

1541
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:50,240
And then like people who actually would be good at it are not available

1542
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,640
or they have to go to like their third choice on the I bet they lose a lot of time

1543
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,720
pursuing. That's why Hathaway and Franco happened is that they were trying

1544
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,680
Timberlake for a while. Oh, yeah.

1545
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,720
Yeah. Which would it because the whole idea was like who do young people like

1546
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,640
like last time it was Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin, which was good also.

1547
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,040
Like that's a strange calculate.

1548
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,840
Then the next year they just completely flipped.

1549
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,480
I think the extra was Billy Crystal.

1550
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,000
Like, who cares? Oldest, oldest thing.

1551
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,600
Oldest back. Oldest new.

1552
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,760
Yeah. Oh, good.

1553
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,840
Well, I have a clip

1554
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,280
from a way that the ceremonies used to begin,

1555
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,600
you know, which was everyone arriving while a narrator

1556
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,920
named who you're seeing.

1557
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,760
I love those.

1558
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,240
And I I forgot how much I liked them.

1559
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,280
And then I discovered a moment where I'm like,

1560
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,000
well, this is a thing we bring up on the show.

1561
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,560
We like like the old Disney parades or like the old clips where it's like

1562
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,120
the fifth Mickey, like it's not the A or B voice for Mickey.

1563
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,480
It's like the D or E voice they got. Oh, yeah.

1564
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,320
And this is kind of just one of those unscripted moments.

1565
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,400
Jordan, if you can bring up it's labeled 1996.

1566
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,760
And this is they're loading people in.

1567
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,520
The interviewer who is going so fast is Oprah Winfrey.

1568
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,360
This is not current, like last 10, 20 years, Oprah,

1569
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,080
where she is sitting down and thoughtfully slowly conducting.

1570
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,720
She is rapid fire going like, who are you?

1571
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,360
What are you wearing? What are you here for?

1572
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,720
You know, that sort of thing.

1573
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,360
And she is talking to

1574
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,720
Nicole Kidman and her then husband.

1575
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,120
Well, she's just talking to Nicole Kidman. OK. OK.

1576
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,080
Hello, Mr. Kidman. How are you?

1577
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,640
To die for. That's what you look like tonight.

1578
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,560
Just to die for. And you were.

1579
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,480
What do you think?

1580
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,840
You're presenting.

1581
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,440
Yeah. Yeah.

1582
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,160
Oh, my goodness.

1583
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,360
Introducing babe.

1584
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,080
Introducing babe. Yeah.

1585
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,960
How do you feel about that?

1586
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,600
For the listener, Tom Cruise is back here saying nothing.

1587
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,280
Of course you do. Yeah.

1588
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,880
Love this choice of colors.

1589
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,960
Hasn't been acknowledged. Oh, thank you.

1590
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,200
So he's Tom Cruise standing there.

1591
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,360
He's got the biggest Cheshire grin on his face the whole time.

1592
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,120
At one moment, he had turned to a bandstand to wave.

1593
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,720
And you just hear dozens of people scream in excitement

1594
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,880
because one of the most famous women in the world has waved to them.

1595
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,960
By the way, he has not been named on camera.

1596
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,800
Yeah. No acknowledgement.

1597
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:39,040
And but my favorite thing is that a very relatable, very human moment.

1598
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,120
He doesn't know where to stand.

1599
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,440
It's like he doesn't know where to go.

1600
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,440
Well, they organize these.

1601
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,480
Now these things are little sets and you have marks and everything.

1602
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,600
Yeah. It's a whole like geography is like they know exactly where they're moving people.

1603
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,520
And in some of the other footage, you can see people arrive

1604
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:01,920
and suddenly like jump and wave to someone in the press crowd

1605
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,320
in a very elegant gown.

1606
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,320
And it's it's clearly Joan Rivers.

1607
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:12,360
But that she used to be like the big exciting part of the pre-show coverage.

1608
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:18,160
But this footage was so funny because Oprah Winfrey is just talking to Nicole Kidman

1609
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,400
and clearly wants to talk to Nicole Kidman.

1610
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,640
But it's just an odd run of questions.

1611
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,880
Like you're here to present, babe.

1612
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,880
She's like dissing. I mean, it's a kind of a diss.

1613
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,840
There's no way she doesn't recognize Tom Cruise.

1614
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:36,080
And then the very last question is, I have never seen you in that color.

1615
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,960
Like she's like commenting on the purple dress.

1616
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,800
Is this why Tom would later go on a jump on her couch in an angry manner?

1617
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,480
You know what? I'm going to get your attention.

1618
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,760
I'm getting it now.

1619
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,880
On this show, Mama Needs a Movie that I do.

1620
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,240
We recently talked about Interview with a Vampire with Alan McCloud.

1621
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,960
And I was reminded of this is this is babe.

1622
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,880
This is 95 in 94.

1623
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:04,800
Tom Cruise went on Oprah and Oprah was like, I don't like this movie.

1624
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,560
Oh, she said she showed the movie to some whatever.

1625
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,600
They screened the movie for her.

1626
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,560
And the audience or whatever.

1627
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,680
She was like, I didn't like the movie.

1628
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,000
I walked out and prayed with my friends in the lobby.

1629
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,400
Really?

1630
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,920
Oh, I think there was an I think that might be awkward.

1631
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,240
Oh, this is all tied together now for me.

1632
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,200
Oh, OK.

1633
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,080
This is key.

1634
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,360
They later made up with the couch.

1635
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,600
But I think that might be post Interview with a Vampire awkwardness.

1636
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,160
Wow.

1637
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,840
That's really fascinating.

1638
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,560
Yeah.

1639
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,040
Wow.

1640
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,000
Which seems so wrong.

1641
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,520
That adds another level to it.

1642
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,960
I just could not get over him just walking right through between the two of them.

1643
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,240
And then just it's just a big grin after he waves.

1644
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,800
And everyone just seems a little uncomfortable.

1645
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,200
Like everyone and Oprah is not doing a good job.

1646
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,000
That thing where you talk into the mic and then hold it over to someone.

1647
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,760
Yeah, you're not supposed to go like, so funny.

1648
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,040
Yeah.

1649
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,160
Yeah.

1650
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,480
Like, this is so beneath Oprah to be doing this.

1651
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,600
But all three of them are such like longtime professionals.

1652
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,520
It's just a weird like pick up.

1653
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,960
It's just a weird moment.

1654
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:09,440
Sure.

1655
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:09,940
Wow.

1656
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,420
Wow.

1657
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,240
Well, it was saved by the presence of Martin Landau, which drove the audience.

1658
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,040
Martin Landau.

1659
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,560
And that brought the ratings up.

1660
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,480
The stern face of Martin Landau.

1661
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,840
Oh my goodness.

1662
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,880
There's a little more Landau to come potentially.

1663
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,520
You might even see if you can spot a Landau later.

1664
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,600
Let me get to another thing that, Ryan, that you brought in, which let's go back to Crystal

1665
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,400
and to jump around.

1666
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:41,120
And this will take us to the 2004 Oscars because we've talked about the opening numbers,

1667
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:48,480
but we have not talked about the opening films where he felt very revolutionary at the time.

1668
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,920
That he's inserting himself into all that was like a new in his bag of tricks.

1669
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,600
That was a new trick.

1670
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:59,200
I feel like in the Titanic year, which made that one big too, that he's in Titanic.

1671
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,920
He's talking to the guy who drops off at the top.

1672
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,640
And I feel like the first few were great.

1673
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,800
But then this one 2004 were getting a little dicey, I feel.

1674
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,200
Yeah.

1675
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,760
And then they'll continue to be dicey after that.

1676
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:17,920
Well, yeah, this was I was searching for in particular 2000 because that was the year

1677
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,480
that he did an American beauty parody.

1678
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,000
And that has been that scrubbed.

1679
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:22,960
That's really.

1680
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,360
Wow.

1681
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,480
Good luck finding that one.

1682
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,080
But this is 2003.

1683
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,680
This was the movies of 2003.

1684
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,520
So Lord of the Rings was the big movie and they kind of cut it, I think, more in a trailer

1685
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:31,760
form.

1686
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:38,080
This is probably this is directed by Troy Miller of Dakota Pictures up the street.

1687
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,120
Yeah, this is I think this is from the ceremony that year.

1688
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:51,360
Yeah, and this is I just I cut it down to what I feel like are the crucial moments,

1689
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,920
the moments that hold up the best.

1690
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,280
So here's the highlights of the 2004 opening.

1691
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,440
I must control.

1692
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,480
You must.

1693
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,920
They are counting on you.

1694
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,400
That's funny.

1695
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,960
I haven't been to the Oscars since they were taken over by the evil wizards.

1696
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,640
You mean the orcs?

1697
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,240
No, the Weinsteins.

1698
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:17,200
He's blind in one eye, but I ain't deaf.

1699
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,560
Oh, no.

1700
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,880
2004 blackface.

1701
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,120
Now we're in the rings.

1702
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,160
Nothing would stop his journey back home.

1703
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,200
Stop this war.

1704
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,880
Shame on you hobbits.

1705
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,000
Shame on you.

1706
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,680
This is a fictitious war.

1707
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,680
This Lord was not elected by the pocket.

1708
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,520
Michael Moore shows up to be crushed.

1709
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,840
Yeah, that'll show him for wanting a war to end.

1710
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,880
Yeah, give me some advice.

1711
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,400
Light him up, Bill.

1712
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,640
And Jack hands the magic sunglasses, the magical sunglasses.

1713
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,760
This has several endings, I feel.

1714
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,400
Light him up.

1715
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,720
And then he puts them on.

1716
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:04,960
Kill him, baby.

1717
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,520
Is it kill him, baby?

1718
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,240
Kill him, baby.

1719
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,520
Light him up, kill him, baby.

1720
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,720
Keep it all in, Troy.

1721
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,400
Keep every...

1722
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,680
I'm going to give you a lot of options.

1723
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,400
Keep them all in.

1724
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,680
Keep it all in.

1725
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,920
Keep that steady cam spinning and spinning.

1726
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,560
What's that contraption you're writing around on there?

1727
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,360
It looks pretty cool.

1728
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,080
That's a segue.

1729
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:24,580
Interesting.

1730
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,080
This is full disclosure, and I'm not going to say anything here,

1731
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:35,120
but there's a friend of ours, a friend of all of ours,

1732
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,080
who worked on this exact opening.

1733
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:38,800
Oh.

1734
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,040
Who might be listening and worked on this and is flashing to a lot of memories,

1735
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,800
and I am not in a position to tell their stories,

1736
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,280
but I just want to broadcast this message that if you ever want to tell the stories

1737
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:56,960
about the 2004 opening with Sammy Davis Jr. and the magical sunglasses,

1738
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,360
we would hope that you would consider us to be the venue should you decide to go public.

1739
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,040
And you're not talking about Jack Nicholson.

1740
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,200
All right, fine.

1741
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,520
He started listening after we showed all those pictures.

1742
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,720
With him and the hoagie in the boat.

1743
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,400
Yeah, with him and the hoagie.

1744
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,600
That happened last week.

1745
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,560
He really likes that.

1746
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,120
So he's like, I love the attention, guys.

1747
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,040
Thanks for remembering your love.

1748
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,080
Finally, nobody's building me up these days.

1749
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,720
Yeah.

1750
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,280
By the way.

1751
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,640
Light them up, good boys.

1752
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:31,840
Jack Nicholson, primo seats at the 2012 Oscars and those 1970 Fred Astaire Oscars.

1753
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,400
Always.

1754
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,280
That's the thing.

1755
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,000
We love it.

1756
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,280
Jack's in the front.

1757
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,800
It is fun when Jack's in the front.

1758
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,600
It is exciting.

1759
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:37,920
Yeah.

1760
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,040
I won't lie.

1761
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,320
He ain't going to be in the front no more.

1762
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,760
When the days are over.

1763
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,480
Yeah, that's true.

1764
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,800
Mike, do you want to throw anything in?

1765
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,280
Oh, yeah.

1766
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,880
I know you brought a couple clips.

1767
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,480
So both these clips, I think.

1768
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,760
So what I like about the Oscars, especially at this era of the Oscars, like 80s ish, is that

1769
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,240
Hollywood has changed, but the Oscars hasn't.

1770
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,040
That's something that kind of is over now, but there's still obviously the music.

1771
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:03,760
They want musical.

1772
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,040
They want some schmaltz.

1773
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,440
But I feel like when I'm watching some old clips from 80s, I go, what the hell?

1774
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,400
This guy's alive?

1775
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,840
And then especially when they're talking about certain movies.

1776
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,200
Let's start with Jordan, the file named Liberace.

1777
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,560
This is 1982.

1778
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,560
And I was watching the 1982 Oscars.

1779
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,320
We are so far into punk.

1780
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,080
We're like beyond punk now.

1781
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:28,880
Well, right.

1782
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,960
So much has changed culturally.

1783
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,280
Right.

1784
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,800
And movies have changed.

1785
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,760
And we're still doing.

1786
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,600
I've read this over metal as in.

1787
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,920
Yeah, I've read, you know, I've read movies change in 1969.

1788
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,040
I've read the book, Easy Rider, Raging Bull, whatever.

1789
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:43,920
Yes, the rebel.

1790
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,640
I read the book.

1791
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,840
But it was of the celluloid back lot.

1792
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:53,360
It's 82 and Liberace is going to play a medley of all of the scores of the movies of the year.

1793
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,000
Light them up.

1794
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,360
So let's play this.

1795
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,960
Just a little bit of it, just because I like seeing Liberace.

1796
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,960
So he's played a little intro.

1797
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,240
He does a little joke up here.

1798
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,080
The theme from Rads.

1799
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,280
Thank you very much.

1800
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,960
Well, I've done my part for motion pictures.

1801
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,040
I've stopped making them.

1802
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,400
That joke goes pretty well.

1803
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,800
The writer of that screenplay, he's gone back to writing books.

1804
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,960
His name is Irving Wallace.

1805
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,360
No applause.

1806
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:25,860
What?

1807
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,800
Smatter applause.

1808
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,280
He's just rolling through it.

1809
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,960
I never stopped attending them.

1810
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,800
In fact, ladies and gentlemen, I'm enchanted by the music.

1811
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,280
1982.

1812
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:41,280
I think it's consistently the most original music written today.

1813
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:45,520
Mr. Conti, will you help me remind everyone of this year's live comedy?

1814
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,080
Bill Conti.

1815
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:46,640
Oh, yeah.

1816
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,360
Bill Conti, a lot of years.

1817
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,640
Beginning with Chariots of Fire.

1818
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,560
Well, that's cool.

1819
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,520
I mean, it's cool.

1820
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,080
I like it.

1821
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,920
And I don't have the full...

1822
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,080
You'll listen a little bit of this.

1823
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,600
Listen a little bit of this, but then Liberace is an awesome piano player.

1824
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,880
It's nice for him doing this.

1825
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,440
This is good.

1826
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,160
It's cool.

1827
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:06,800
This is good.

1828
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,360
And then he does all of these.

1829
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,600
This is the year Angolden Pond is nominated.

1830
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:13,920
iconic score.

1831
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,440
So I don't know.

1832
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:19,120
From Angolden Pond.

1833
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,080
I mean, this rules.

1834
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,040
I love this.

1835
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,600
The titular song by Joe Strummer.

1836
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,640
So you could stop playing it.

1837
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,160
And then he does...

1838
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,280
Stop making sense.

1839
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,160
I mean, I love it.

1840
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:38,240
But yeah, again, it's just like it's funny because he's old school Hollywood, but it's 82.

1841
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,520
Can I do one from 82?

1842
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,520
Since we're talking about that.

1843
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,560
Oh, yeah.

1844
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,600
This is Ryan, actually.

1845
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,520
And another thing that I just think is good.

1846
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,680
This is from...

1847
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,680
Oh, what did I call it?

1848
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,920
Did I call it Sheena Easton?

1849
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:59,840
This is a performance of the Bond song for Your Eyes Only.

1850
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,640
One of my favorite.

1851
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,200
It could be my favorite Bond song.

1852
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,040
And they...

1853
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,160
Ryan, as you put it, this is a rare occasion.

1854
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,560
This is just the Oscars turn into a stunt show.

1855
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,880
This is close to a stunt show as I've ever seen it be.

1856
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,120
There's a little bit of song, but then things get real stunty.

1857
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,160
I wonder who produced it.

1858
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:18,660
Oh, yeah.

1859
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,680
And you got the real henchman, by the way.

1860
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,880
I don't know.

1861
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,560
I am not a Bond enough person to...

1862
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,920
Oh, yeah.

1863
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,320
The old...

1864
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,360
Richard Keele.

1865
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,160
He's the big tall guy.

1866
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,800
What a gown.

1867
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,200
Sheena.

1868
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,120
Morgan Discoey here in 82.

1869
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:43,680
Yeah.

1870
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,400
A car pulls up on stage.

1871
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,200
Is it Bond?

1872
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,040
Who is it?

1873
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,680
Well, it's a dancer.

1874
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,160
He does a kick.

1875
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:54,720
Maybe that's...

1876
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:56,960
I guess it's...

1877
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,160
Later you find out it's Bond, but he's in an orange jumpsuit.

1878
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,040
It's weird.

1879
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,640
He stabs someone with a sword.

1880
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,680
James Bond and his fucking sword.

1881
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:06,560
Lasers!

1882
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,920
That's the same laser from...

1883
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,520
The RoboCop.

1884
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,020
RoboCop.

1885
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,040
Guitar wailing.

1886
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:18,960
James Bond.

1887
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:24,480
And it looks like the universal The Cone in the Barbarian stunt

1888
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:24,960
show.

1889
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,160
It looks so much like that.

1890
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,600
It's multi-tiered.

1891
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,840
Whoever produced 82, I got to hand it to them.

1892
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,200
I like both of these things.

1893
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,320
When was the last time a fake punch was thrown at the Oscars?

1894
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:35,520
I don't know.

1895
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,320
We know the real one.

1896
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:36,560
I know.

1897
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,240
We know the real one, but I just want to know...

1898
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,640
When was the last time a wrestling...

1899
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,080
You say a worked punch.

1900
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:42,400
Yeah.

1901
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,280
They don't pull punches.

1902
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,480
I think they did stop doing this kind of thing.

1903
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,200
Strong?

1904
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:47,520
Yeah.

1905
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,880
I think everyone would like it.

1906
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,640
It's a bit like we're going to just do...

1907
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,760
The Avengers are going to fight on the...

1908
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,040
The Avengers should fight.

1909
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,640
None of them are famous.

1910
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,240
It's all just generic dancers.

1911
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,120
It's just dancers.

1912
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,040
Dancers are just pretending to fight with big high kicks.

1913
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,920
Just get the Rockettes to dress as the Avengers

1914
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,240
and have them high kick each other.

1915
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,080
People would like it.

1916
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:11,680
Did you have another one, Mike?

1917
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,480
Yeah. Let me go quickly.

1918
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:18,000
It's, I believe, 1987 and I was looking at some lists for things.

1919
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,480
I was just looking up bad Oscar moments.

1920
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,480
And the intro to 1987, which I had to do a little hunt for,

1921
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,600
and I found it pretty easily.

1922
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,080
Again, sort of the juxtaposition of the movies that came out

1923
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,960
versus wanting to do a big Hollywood number

1924
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,080
of something that would be in the 40s or something.

1925
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,240
So I'll let this unfold.

1926
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,840
There's a lot of elements that I enjoy,

1927
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,760
but you'll be able to tell pretty quickly

1928
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,200
which ones I like.

1929
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:50,560
So there's the dancers.

1930
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,520
Star Trek 4 logo.

1931
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,640
And they're dancing on the movies that came out this year.

1932
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,760
And they're appearing behind him.

1933
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,720
So you have to listen to some of these.

1934
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:59,680
The fly.

1935
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:03,680
The fly is in the background as they're dancing like it's an old school.

1936
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,400
So listen to the, they'll start singing soon.

1937
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,040
It's Anna and her sisters in the back.

1938
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,040
Anna.

1939
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,040
Platoon.

1940
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,120
Platoon is Salvador.

1941
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:29,600
OK.

1942
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,800
And they're like, these dancers are like,

1943
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,480
they're like dressed like newsies or something,

1944
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,600
and they're shimmying and they're big high kicks.

1945
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,120
And we love platoon.

1946
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:38,720
So here we go.

1947
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,720
Here comes Dom DeLuis!

1948
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,720
Telly Savalas!

1949
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,720
Sloppy Telly!

1950
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,720
I cleaned up for the big night!

1951
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,720
Pat Morita!

1952
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,720
Yeah!

1953
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,720
Wow!

1954
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,720
Does it seem a bit under-rehearsed?

1955
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,720
Yeah!

1956
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,720
This is a guys and

1957
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,720
dolls reference.

1958
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,720
This is like Walter Mapp out singing

1959
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,720
a regular song.

1960
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,720
Famously!

1961
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,720
I'm a man of two

1962
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,720
and platoon and got

1963
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,720
blue velvet and salvador

1964
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,720
Star Trek 4!

1965
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,720
I want some more!

1966
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,720
El Salvador!

1967
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,720
And I'm here and this is Thursday

1968
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,720
here!

1969
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,720
This is 1987!

1970
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,720
This isn't

1971
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,720
1965!

1972
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,720
This is 1987! Decades after

1973
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,720
the Brando Sinatra

1974
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,720
guys and dolls.

1975
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,720
Maybe there was a revival.

1976
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,720
Blue velvet came out this year!

1977
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,720
The only

1978
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,720
thing wrong with this is you shouldn't open

1979
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,720
with a show stopper.

1980
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,720
How do you top it?

1981
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,720
How do you top it?

1982
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,720
We should have thought of that for

1983
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,720
Billy Crystal. He would do

1984
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,720
you got your western front, it's all quiet

1985
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,720
here,

1986
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,720
and the Germans are running in with diarrhea.

1987
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,720
She's tar!

1988
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,720
She's tar!

1989
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,720
That

1990
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,720
is a song that you can

1991
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,720
if you look on YouTube you can find a

1992
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,720
million like high school productions of

1993
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,720
guys and dolls. And that is an

1994
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,720
opening number.

1995
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,720
That's like a great search to do.

1996
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,720
Were you in guys and dolls ever?

1997
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,720
No I was not in guys and dolls ever.

1998
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,720
Unfortunately. But that is

1999
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,720
very fun that people have cut

2000
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,720
compilations together where you can just find

2001
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,720
that element of the song.

2002
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,720
Because it's watching 15 year olds in

2003
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,720
ill fitting suits try to do the

2004
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,720
three people singing slightly

2005
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,720
different things at once.

2006
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,720
It's very similar to

2007
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,720
Dr. Deluise.

2008
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,720
You gotta get

2009
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,720
telly. It's 1987.

2010
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,720
Who do we

2011
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,720
gotta see?

2012
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,720
I found that clip in there for some reason

2013
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,720
like a browser closed.

2014
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,720
And then I was like searching for it.

2015
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,720
And I found

2016
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,720
the opening when the hosts come out.

2017
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,720
And I go well Cheryl Ladd

2018
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,720
and William Shatner hosted the Oscars

2019
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,720
this year? And then I went oh wait this is a Golden Globes

2020
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,720
show.

2021
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,720
I was like when did William Shatner host the Oscars?

2022
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,720
Oh okay. Golden Globes.

2023
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,720
Got it.

2024
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,720
That goes to show you though what Billy Crystal

2025
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,720
that's a really good context of

2026
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,720
the Billy Crystal thing though.

2027
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,720
Of what it was reactionary

2028
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,720
of what it was reacting against.

2029
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,720
So when Billy Crystal showed up and did what was

2030
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,720
essentially an ironical version of that

2031
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,720
it was

2032
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,720
like a funny parody version.

2033
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,720
You forget that

2034
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,720
context. I recently

2035
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,720
rewatched the first one or the second one

2036
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,720
and he did couch it as like

2037
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,720
I know you don't want one of these big

2038
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,720
musical numbers. It's so

2039
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,720
annoying. He did that for like three years.

2040
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,720
And I think when younger people look at it they're like

2041
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,720
oh that's corny. He's doing like

2042
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,720
a medley and like no he's

2043
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,720
doing a parody of what was

2044
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,720
persistent on the Oscars for

2045
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,720
many years. You have no idea

2046
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,720
how bad it was. Yeah. Which maybe

2047
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,720
takes us into the

2048
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,720
big ones that are remaining. Oh yeah.

2049
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,720
Are from 1989.

2050
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,720
And

2051
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,720
are we going to move on to

2052
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,720
89 because we need to spend a little

2053
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,720
time in 89. Oh yeah.

2054
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,720
I have something for the end but I'll

2055
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,720
save it for the end. Okay sure.

2056
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,720
So

2057
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,720
89.

2058
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,720
So I mean I don't need

2059
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,720
to say the whole context. One thing

2060
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,720
that happened in 89. The context

2061
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,720
is this is not the worst thing that had.

2062
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,720
Although that's up for debate because

2063
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,720
Ryan you put this on your list.

2064
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,720
I'm honored to have apparently exposed you

2065
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,720
to this one. You didn't show this to me first.

2066
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,720
And your argument

2067
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,720
was this is the listeners might know

2068
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,720
where this is heading. Like what are they saving

2069
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,720
as the worst thing that ever

2070
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,720
happened on the Oscars. You might

2071
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,720
know. But this is a solid

2072
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,720
candidate. You said maybe this is worse.

2073
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,720
This is more skin crawling to you.

2074
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,720
This is the most

2075
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,720
oozy.

2076
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,720
Like you talk about your hair

2077
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,720
standing up. This is the hair standing up for me.

2078
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,720
I think I've ever seen on any

2079
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,720
award show. Yeah maybe

2080
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,720
ever. Yeah

2081
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,720
this is the clip

2082
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,720
is called Stars of Tomorrow.

2083
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,720
And this happened deep into the show.

2084
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,720
And these people are introduced as maybe

2085
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,720
the future winners

2086
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,720
of Academy Awards. The sequence

2087
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,720
starts with Blair Underwood and

2088
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,720
Holly Robinson who by now we know

2089
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,720
for the many Oscars they've won

2090
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,720
as have everyone in this segment.

2091
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,720
It actually is a high percentage.

2092
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,720
There are a lot of people in this who've done

2093
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,720
great things. It's not bad.

2094
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,720
It could be a much lower number.

2095
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,720
You maybe could have forgotten about all of

2096
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,720
these people.

2097
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,720
But wait was there one more. Oh the only

2098
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,720
other piece of context. I've tried to be a little

2099
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,720
like sparing with these clips and these

2100
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,720
ins and outs. But this one I'm like I

2101
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,720
think you have to just sit in it

2102
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,720
and deal with it. Maybe we'll cut it off. And if you can't

2103
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,720
take any more. Okay we'll tap out. Yes please.

2104
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,720
Are you going to show the intro?

2105
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,720
Yeah. Oh wait well not the people

2106
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,720
not Bob and Lucille.

2107
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,720
Okay well that's a little bit important

2108
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,720
that Walter Mathau comes out and introduces

2109
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,720
Bob Hope and Lucille Ball who are

2110
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,720
about as legendary as anyone

2111
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,720
is at that time. And then they introduce

2112
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,720
this. They get an intro

2113
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,720
a legend introduces two

2114
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,720
legends who then set

2115
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,720
up this. Let's

2116
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,720
hit it.

2117
01:24:50,720 --> 01:25:04,720
Someday I'll be the one who walks up here accepting the prize.

2118
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,720
And he's at a podium where you would accept the Oscar.

2119
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:12,720
Someday my Oscar's come home.

2120
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,720
I don't know who Holly Robinson is. She can sing.

2121
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,720
Is she Holly Robinson Pete now?

2122
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,720
Oh god. And I forget

2123
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,720
sitcoms, big TV shows.

2124
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,720
And now there's dozens more.

2125
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:50,720
Like Joey Fisher later from Ellen.

2126
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,720
Hey little spry guy. Keith Kugen.

2127
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,720
Jackie Kugen's

2128
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,720
grandson.

2129
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,720
Wow. I just realized that.

2130
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,720
He's from Adventures in Babysitting.

2131
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,720
Tyrone Power Jr.

2132
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,720
It's not the people themselves. It's this number.

2133
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,720
Ricky Lake.

2134
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,720
Spangly jacket and hat.

2135
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,720
I got some Alora Harden.

2136
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,720
Who's that busting those Michael Jackson

2137
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,720
moves? Is it Michael?

2138
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,720
Oh, Cory.

2139
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,720
Cory.

2140
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,720
Still wearing that jacket.

2141
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,720
I made it up through that.

2142
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,720
I mean Blair Underwood and Malora Harden have worked quite a bit.

2143
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,720
But this is such a

2144
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:36,720
weird pressure to put on someone.

2145
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,720
It's nothing to do with the actors.

2146
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,720
Yeah.

2147
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,720
It's everything to do with who put it together.

2148
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,720
Like what jokers put this

2149
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,720
song together? Well according to

2150
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,720
Lucille Ball at the beginning,

2151
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,720
it's Marvin Hamlisch, then the

2152
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,720
winner of several Oscars.

2153
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,720
What did Marvin Hamlisch

2154
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,720
do?

2155
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,720
Big ones. Way we were.

2156
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,720
Yeah.

2157
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,720
Fred Ebb wrote the lyrics, the lyricist of

2158
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,720
Cabaret in Chicago

2159
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,720
and the song New York, New York mentioned

2160
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,720
earlier. Well, I'll say.

2161
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,720
Major cred. What I will say about this number

2162
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,720
is that it's not a good

2163
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,720
song. And there is a, you can tell

2164
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,720
literally by the progression of

2165
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,720
notes and the idea that Ricky Lake

2166
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,720
and Julie Fischer are on

2167
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,720
a stage singing a song that's like

2168
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,720
ra-ta-ta-pa-pa-pa-da-ta-ta-pa-du-da-da

2169
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,720
or like

2170
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,720
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

2171
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,720
That's bad.

2172
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,720
That's not a good, I'm sorry

2173
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,720
Marvin, that's not

2174
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,720
Rat Packers should not be singing

2175
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,720
that style

2176
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,720
of like and Hollywood

2177
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,720
tonight will find me here on the

2178
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,720
stage.

2179
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,720
It's just not a

2180
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,720
good song.

2181
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,720
Skin crawling moment for me is

2182
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,720
it was in that clip when Ricky Lake says

2183
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,720
the word statu-etter

2184
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,720
I'm a statu-etter

2185
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,720
I hate things like that

2186
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,720
like made up words and Broadway

2187
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,720
song. Oh that is

2188
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,720
so lame.

2189
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,720
There's a lot of nepotism on

2190
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,720
that stage. Let's face it. Tyrone

2191
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,720
Power Jr. is there.

2192
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,720
Eddie Fischer's daughters or So-and-So's daughters

2193
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,720
It's like two Eddie Fischer daughters.

2194
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,720
It's like if the New York Times

2195
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,720
NEPO article were

2196
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,720
instead of an article it was a

2197
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,720
stage show. That's what that is.

2198
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,720
I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make the best show

2199
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,720
you've ever, Sam Levinson

2200
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,720
and

2201
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,720
and and and and and they'll scream

2202
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,720
when the idol premieres

2203
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,720
on HBO I'll take it

2204
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,720
over from Amy Simons and here

2205
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,720
we go. You know what? It's not

2206
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,720
a fix.

2207
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,720
It's

2208
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,720
not a fix I have. Well it is a

2209
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,720
maybe it is a fix. If you just take

2210
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,720
everyone's name away

2211
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,720
from it it's not gonna make

2212
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,720
the song sound better but

2213
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,720
then it doesn't put like the pressure on

2214
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,720
everyone to get the

2215
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,720
when they don't get the Oscar in 30 years. You know what I'm saying?

2216
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,720
Then it just looks like a stage of young

2217
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,720
performers. That's right. Everyone's sort of

2218
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,720
on the same level. But you don't know who

2219
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,720
the fuck they are. I know

2220
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,720
but then they're just sort of like nameless

2221
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,720
actors and you're saying oh look at this

2222
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,720
young actor like it's not putting any

2223
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,720
pressure on the specific performers. I'm not saying

2224
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,720
it's good. I'm just saying it might be a little

2225
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,720
bit better unless like presumptuous

2226
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,720
that we're just like ordaining these people.

2227
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,720
Maybe that's what the audience saw.

2228
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,720
Maybe the audience was like who are these talented

2229
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,720
singers?

2230
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,720
So it was appropriate for the people sitting

2231
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,720
in the theater. Yes but at home

2232
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,720
being introduced to

2233
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,720
I would have

2234
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,720
fired my agent if I was like

2235
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,720
later on like Patrick Dempsey

2236
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,720
shows it like Kristen Slater is in it.

2237
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,720
It's a wild thing to watch at

2238
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,720
full length but like

2239
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,720
it's such an embarrassing way

2240
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,720
to be presented I feel. Yeah.

2241
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,720
Well never stopped Corey

2242
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,720
Feldman from doing anything.

2243
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,720
He takes the lead in this next

2244
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,720
little part. And he was also famous then.

2245
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,720
He was famous. He was even the star of a bunch

2246
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,720
of movies. Maybe it's just that he said yes

2247
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,720
and that like maybe they were getting

2248
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,720
desperate and he's like can I do my moves?

2249
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,720
Fine, fine, whatever.

2250
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,720
Let's just get a little bit of like

2251
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,720
I don't think Marvin Hamlisch wrote that into the

2252
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,720
performance.

2253
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,720
Plus some of your moves.

2254
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,720
Corey we can't bring out the angels

2255
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,720
but you can bust your moves.

2256
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,720
You can bust my stars of tomorrow

2257
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,720
too. Like minutes past.

2258
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,720
This is so long. Like

2259
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,720
a bunch. I skipped a bunch. And then

2260
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,720
it gets to this.

2261
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,720
Woo! Wow!

2262
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,720
Woo!

2263
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,720
Corey Feldman

2264
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,720
does Michael Jackson

2265
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,720
dances but not as good.

2266
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,720
Work it.

2267
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,720
Work it.

2268
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,720
I think you're going to footloose?

2269
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,720
No. It's just no. It's generic.

2270
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,720
Keith Coogan slides

2271
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,720
and wiggles.

2272
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,720
Wait, does it split through though?

2273
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,720
Say what?

2274
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,720
Say what?

2275
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,720
They're holding, waiting for some cue that

2276
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,720
didn't happen.

2277
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,720
Say what?

2278
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,720
Say what?

2279
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,720
This is one more of these. I don't think I want to see it.

2280
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,720
I think I'm done with stars of tomorrow.

2281
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,720
The sword fight.

2282
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,720
Christian Slater's in a sword. Alright, Jordan's

2283
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,720
making us.

2284
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,720
You wouldn't want to be seen doing

2285
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,720
this. Do you want to be seen

2286
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,720
watching it? I don't want to be seen watching it.

2287
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,720
Then this guy

2288
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,720
walks to a podium. It takes a long time.

2289
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,720
Don't know who he is.

2290
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,720
The Oscar goes to.

2291
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,720
Run back, run back, run back.

2292
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,720
Everyone at the stairs.

2293
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,720
As fast as you can. Hurt yourselves.

2294
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,720
They'd all spill to the bottom of the stage.

2295
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,720
They would be the best thing that ever happened.

2296
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,720
They should do a salute to the movies

2297
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,720
that may win in ten years.

2298
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,720
Oh yeah. Try to guess?

2299
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,720
Yeah, just guess the names.

2300
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,720
Finnean's Love.

2301
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,720
What's that?

2302
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,720
Guessing titles?

2303
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,720
You'll be on the floor when I'm the star of Godfather

2304
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,720
4.

2305
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,720
Yeah, it's all sequels.

2306
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,720
When I'm taking home the

2307
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,720
for playing Rain Man again.

2308
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,720
I'm taking home the gold for

2309
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,720
When I play Rain Man Jr.

2310
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,720
Rain Man

2311
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:18,720
Rising. Definitely

2312
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,720
be great.

2313
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,720
Amazingly, this is not

2314
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,720
the worst or

2315
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,720
longest musical number

2316
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,720
involving a low brother

2317
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,720
in this year's Academy Awards.

2318
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,720
Because now we go to

2319
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,720
the inevitable where else could it be?

2320
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,720
And they've had a lot of chances to do

2321
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,720
something worse. They've done things that are more

2322
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,720
notorious and

2323
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,720
stranger and slappy.

2324
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,720
But they have not done anything this

2325
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,720
crappy. And it is

2326
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,720
of course the

2327
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,720
1989

2328
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,720
Snow White sequence.

2329
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,720
Have we all had experience

2330
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,720
with this?

2331
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,720
You can't not run into it.

2332
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,720
I feel like mostly in

2333
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,720
montages. I don't know

2334
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,720
if I've ever seen a big chunk of it.

2335
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,720
It's like it's

2336
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,720
War and Peace.

2337
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:10,720
I've seen it all.

2338
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,720
I've seen Red Sea Pieces.

2339
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,720
Spin on the lid. Spin in the queue of crap.

2340
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,720
I studied it in college.

2341
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,720
My thesis was on it.

2342
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,720
I was showing the big

2343
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,720
ones. This one.

2344
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,720
I've seen a lot of Tar movies and this one.

2345
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,720
I'm waiting to show it to my child.

2346
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,720
Let's just

2347
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,720
dive right in.

2348
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,720
We can do more context.

2349
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,720
Let's just see what the viewers saw.

2350
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,720
First we're in the

2351
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,720
lobby. We're outside the Oscar Theater.

2352
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,720
And then Army Archered.

2353
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,720
A reference no one's had to know for the

2354
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,720
last 30 years.

2355
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,720
To their credit

2356
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,720
was well known as

2357
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,720
he's the guy that

2358
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,720
introduced people.

2359
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,720
He greeted you.

2360
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,720
He was a variety writer.

2361
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,720
He was a variety writer. When I first

2362
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,720
moved to LA the first celebrity

2363
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,720
I saw when I was living in Westwood

2364
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,720
going to UCLA was Army Archered.

2365
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:06,720
I saw him at a screen. I went to

2366
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,720
the movies. I saw Nurse Betty.

2367
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,720
Three months after

2368
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,720
it came out and Army Archered was like a

2369
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,720
row behind me.

2370
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,720
It actually

2371
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,720
distracted me. I was like

2372
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,720
Army Archered. What happened with me and Armin

2373
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,720
and Andre? We're sitting behind us.

2374
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,720
If I cough weird he might put it into

2375
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,720
a review. Oh no.

2376
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,720
What if I end up at the

2377
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,720
star?

2378
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,720
So

2379
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,720
he's in the lobby

2380
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,720
of the theater and

2381
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,720
he introduces the special guest who

2382
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,720
is Snow White. Let's see the first

2383
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,720
one.

2384
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,720
And now ladies and gentlemen here's one of the great

2385
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,720
legends of Hollywood. She's back with us tonight.

2386
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,720
Miss Snow White.

2387
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,720
Good evening. Oh good evening Mr. Archers.

2388
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,720
It is so exciting to be here tonight.

2389
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,720
I'm a little late though.

2390
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,720
Can you tell me how to get into the theater?

2391
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,720
That's easy Snow.

2392
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,720
Just follow the Hollywood

2393
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:02,720
stars.

2394
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,720
Follow the Hollywood stars?

2395
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:06,720
Oh! Follow the Hollywood stars!

2396
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:08,720
A couple of star costumes

2397
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,720
walked by her and then the stage

2398
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,720
is full of them. This is what would be

2399
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,720
like a high school fashion show.

2400
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,720
89.

2401
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,720
Wait did I leave in

2402
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,720
the stars? Did I leave in her talk?

2403
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,720
I guess I don't have her.

2404
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,720
Then Snow White comes

2405
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,720
in and

2406
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,720
walks through the front

2407
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,720
row, like the first couple rows where the big

2408
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,720
stars are and she sings

2409
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,720
to this. She sings an amended version

2410
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,720
of I Only Have Eyes For You. Yeah.

2411
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,720
She's bothering

2412
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,720
the Glyne close.

2413
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,720
She wasn't ready to twerk yet.

2414
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,720
Exactly.

2415
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,720
She was nervous back then.

2416
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,720
Even the twerking she was freaking out because she wasn't sure if someone was going to appear

2417
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,720
at the ceremony and start singing

2418
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:58,720
to her.

2419
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,720
She was trying to distract everyone.

2420
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,720
It was a panic move.

2421
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,720
She's singing to

2422
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,720
Robert Downey Jr.

2423
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,720
and Tom Hanks

2424
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,720
and Michelle Pfeiffer.

2425
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,720
And

2426
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,720
according to this woman's

2427
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,720
recollection, Eileen

2428
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,720
Bowman, the actress,

2429
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,720
who is a complete unknown.

2430
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,720
She's never done anything on television.

2431
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,720
This is her first time on television

2432
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,720
we're watching and it's this.

2433
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,720
And she has to go face to face with all the biggest

2434
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,720
stars in the world. And she

2435
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,720
was very nervous but she got to the

2436
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,720
stage and she saw her friends

2437
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:36,720
who were the dancers who were the stars

2438
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,720
and she thought maybe I will have some fun.

2439
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,720
And she tried to take Michelle Pfeiffer's

2440
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,720
hand who gave her this look like

2441
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,720
get the fuck away from me.

2442
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,720
And refused the hand.

2443
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,720
And she realized uh oh this is not

2444
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,720
going to work and I have 11

2445
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,720
minutes to go.

2446
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,720
She goes down the aisle.

2447
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,720
There is one person who is

2448
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,720
very sweet and nice to her and that is

2449
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,720
Martin Landau.

2450
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,720
Which like just holds

2451
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,720
her hand and oh

2452
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,720
which is in keeping with things

2453
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,720
I've recently heard about Martin Landau.

2454
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,720
I'll see you later.

2455
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,720
I'll see you after the show.

2456
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,720
You have time to write your number down. I know you're doing a thing.

2457
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,720
But um anyway

2458
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,720
maybe now I just

2459
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,720
that's what the viewer got without

2460
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:22,720
context. So the viewer is

2461
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,720
baffled. Why is Snow White, who is

2462
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,720
this? Why is it Disney Snow White

2463
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,720
but who is playing? It's like at a theme park where

2464
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,720
who would this you don't know who the

2465
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,720
actress generic person is playing.

2466
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,720
The greater context here

2467
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,720
is that this is the year that

2468
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,720
Alan Carr produced.

2469
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,720
70's 80's mega producer.

2470
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,720
Did a lot of musicals.

2471
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,720
Did Grease.

2472
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:46,720
Great. Grease.

2473
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:48,720
Did this Village People movie.

2474
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,720
There was a massive bomb at the time.

2475
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,720
Can't stop the music. I've been in Alan Carr's

2476
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:54,720
home. What? Really?

2477
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,720
Formerly owned by Alan Carr because

2478
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,720
I've been in Brett Ratner's home.

2479
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,720
He bought the

2480
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,720
home owned by Alan Carr. Has an

2481
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:04,720
underground disco.

2482
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,720
He's filled with all his stuff.

2483
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,720
He has like Clockwork Orange props?

2484
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,720
Yeah he has a collection of props including

2485
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:12,720
the phallus from Clockwork

2486
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,720
Orange. He says it was real. Actually

2487
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:16,720
now I'm doubting that. Not anything about it.

2488
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,720
He might have been lying.

2489
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,720
Anyways that was a weird thing of its own because

2490
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:22,720
because

2491
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:24,720
Ratner was

2492
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,720
thought he could produce it.

2493
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:28,720
I think at the time when I saw him in his

2494
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,720
home he was trying to get Eddie Murphy to host

2495
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,720
SNL.

2496
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:34,720
He had that ability that he was enough

2497
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,720
of the Murphy whisperer. He thought he was like

2498
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,720
a Murphy whisperer. So he was trying to get Eddie Murphy

2499
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,720
to. I can talk about this now because I don't

2500
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,720
hope to never see Brett Ratner again.

2501
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,720
Let's all

2502
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,720
hold his arms. Listeners too.

2503
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:48,720
Let's all just hold hands through the podcast

2504
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,720
space. That's kind of the inspiration

2505
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,720
for it follows. You just in the

2506
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,720
distance see a fuzzy Brett Ratner

2507
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,720
following around. You're like oh I hope I didn't

2508
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,720
see that again.

2509
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,720
But yeah he was like he was like I can get Eddie

2510
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:02,720
to you know Eddie's going to host SNL for a

2511
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:04,720
Tower Heist or whatever they had done.

2512
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,720
And then that didn't

2513
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:08,720
happen. And so when years later it was

2514
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,720
rumored or they were basically

2515
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,720
set up I was like this isn't going to happen.

2516
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,720
The chances of this happening.

2517
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,720
Anyway but it was all Alan Carr's house.

2518
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,720
Wow. So he had been

2519
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,720
and his Oscars fell apart. So he

2520
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,720
it was the curse of Carr.

2521
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,720
Exactly.

2522
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,720
There's a car curse. And not

2523
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:28,720
a car scene.

2524
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:30,720
So that's Alan Carr.

2525
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,720
Oh well

2526
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:34,720
that's good Conti. Yeah.

2527
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:36,720
He's deep in party mode here.

2528
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,720
He was like a he was a party guy. I think he

2529
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,720
was a manager. Hosted a lot of part work

2530
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,720
with Hugh Hefner.

2531
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,720
So in addition to being a big producer

2532
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:46,720
of stage and screen

2533
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:48,720
everybody knew him from

2534
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,720
parties. So it just made sense

2535
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,720
that and he

2536
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,720
in taking over the Oscars he actually

2537
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,720
said he what he said was I don't want

2538
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:58,720
it to be one of these boring stodgy affairs

2539
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:00,720
like we've been having lately. Meaning

2540
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:02,720
all the ones we've just been watching

2541
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:04,720
the year before was Robo

2542
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:06,720
Coffin at

2543
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,720
2009 in Peewee. That was a boring

2544
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,720
year. Alan Carr's mind.

2545
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The fascist

2546
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,720
robot showed up. No thanks.

2547
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,720
Let's party. Come on. We need

2548
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:18,720
glamour. We need elegance.

2549
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,720
And that's what I'm going to do.

2550
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,720
And we need the longest musical

2551
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:24,720
number ever attempted on live television.

2552
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,720
Yes. It goes. Yeah.

2553
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,720
OK. We've all watched the entire. I mean it's almost like

2554
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:30,720
if we really wanted to punish ourselves we

2555
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,720
could just watch it and do commentary.

2556
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:34,720
Do we really want to. We're adults.

2557
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,720
We have been a lot of lives

2558
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,720
talking for a while. Yes. Yeah.

2559
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,720
No I'm not suggesting it.

2560
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:42,720
But that's really the way to experience

2561
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,720
the pain. But I kind of I've called

2562
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:46,720
I think it's also what's bad about it is that

2563
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,720
like there are as we have seen

2564
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:50,720
almost every year the musical number is

2565
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,720
bad. But

2566
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,720
what's unique about this

2567
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,720
Alan Carr produced thing which I really

2568
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:58,720
do think the

2569
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,720
the burden falls on him. I don't think

2570
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,720
it's Snow White. I don't think it's Rob Lowe. I don't think it's

2571
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:04,720
Eileen. What's her

2572
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,720
name. Bowman Bowman. She was

2573
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:08,720
a young probably talented person

2574
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,720
Vincent Price and Coral

2575
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,720
Brown. It's a price and Coral Brown. Certainly

2576
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:14,720
not. It's not Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.

2577
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,720
I'll tell you that much. They just sit

2578
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,720
and enjoy. By the way probably the last

2579
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,720
time I saw their appearance they

2580
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,720
any of those people ever made on the Oscar stage.

2581
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:24,720
Oh yeah sure. Yeah. The last round of applause

2582
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,720
they got was in this thing.

2583
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,720
Merv Griffin also comes in.

2584
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,720
Merv Griffin's doing a whole singing number.

2585
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:32,720
But I think what it is

2586
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,720
it's that you sit

2587
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,720
just when you think it's going to end it goes

2588
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,720
for another three minutes and just when you

2589
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,720
think it's going to end it goes for another three minutes

2590
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,720
and just when you think it's going to get it goes for another

2591
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:44,720
three minutes. There are different movements of it.

2592
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,720
It's like a sweet

2593
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,720
it's a Russian nesting doll.

2594
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,720
It really is that there's like

2595
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,720
sets within sets within sets

2596
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,720
which now we're doomed to do as we

2597
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,720
describe it here at the end of the episode.

2598
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,720
OK you said some of the things

2599
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,720
that happen.

2600
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,720
She makes some stars

2601
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:04,720
very uncomfortable and then

2602
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,720
is reminiscing about times in old

2603
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,720
Hollywood. And the reason any of

2604
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:10,720
this is happening is because Alan Carr saw a

2605
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,720
show called Beach Blanket Babylon

2606
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:14,720
in San Francisco. Big

2607
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,720
campy show that involved that was this

2608
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,720
it was like a tribute to the 40s and Snow White

2609
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,720
takes you through different 40s

2610
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,720
scenes. He's like I'm doing that.

2611
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,720
We're opening the Oscars with that

2612
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:26,720
which none of none of us know that

2613
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,720
like this is the viewer

2614
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:30,720
is like has no sense.

2615
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,720
A viewer I was trying to really

2616
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,720
context I was trying to put myself in the mind of a

2617
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,720
1989 viewer. The viewer thinks this

2618
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,720
is Disney. They know Snow White

2619
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,720
from one thing which is Disney. And this

2620
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,720
seems like a disneyfication of the

2621
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,720
Oscars before Disney has

2622
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:46,720
had its ups with this is early

2623
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,720
in 1989. Little Mermaid

2624
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,720
doesn't come out till the end of 1989.

2625
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:52,720
So Disney's still in the doldrums

2626
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,720
of like Disney's not like cool

2627
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,720
like now if Shrek

2628
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,720
came out not Shrek that's not Disney.

2629
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,720
But now if like there was an incanto opening

2630
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,720
or something people go oh it's cool.

2631
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,720
We're not a big hit song

2632
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,720
or yeah yeah yeah. This is not the

2633
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,720
Snow White is no longer cool at this moment.

2634
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,720
No and it's clearly it is so much

2635
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,720
the Disney Snow White. The character

2636
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,720
and the voice absolutely.

2637
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,720
And apparently and the costume

2638
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:18,720
is from a Hollywood Boulevard rental

2639
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:20,720
place because it's a little

2640
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,720
off. They put rhinestones

2641
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,720
on a Hollywood Boulevard rental

2642
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,720
costume. So she's

2643
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,720
recalling her Hollywood glory

2644
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,720
days and then suddenly

2645
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:32,720
the curtain opens and you're at the coconut

2646
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,720
grove and

2647
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,720
the ambassador ballroom

2648
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:38,720
and then of course who

2649
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,720
else would be there the emcee but

2650
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,720
Merv Griffin of course

2651
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,720
and he's of course singing I've

2652
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,720
got a lovely bunch of coconuts. We know

2653
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,720
we know he did that song.

2654
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:50,720
That's not just a song you faintly recall

2655
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,720
from like preschool or something.

2656
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:54,720
1989. 1989.

2657
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:56,720
Merv Griffin. How many of

2658
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,720
those locations. Not the Emmys either.

2659
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,720
Were standing. How many

2660
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:02,720
of those located the coconut grove

2661
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,720
and the ambassador

2662
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,720
the ambassador.

2663
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,720
That's yeah.

2664
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:10,720
Merv Griffin's notably

2665
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,720
so he's a talk show host.

2666
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,720
Talk show host producer. Producer of all the game shows.

2667
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,720
And it was considered kind of

2668
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,720
like a lame guy.

2669
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:20,720
Like a schmaltzy guy in the 70s.

2670
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,720
Let alone

2671
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,720
89. But a nice guy.

2672
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,720
But still 89.

2673
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,720
What? Why?

2674
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:30,720
It has no association

2675
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,720
with movies that I am aware of.

2676
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,720
By the way when I first watched this I was delighted

2677
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:36,720
to see him. I'm not saying I wasn't.

2678
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,720
I know that Mike Carlson was delighted

2679
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,720
to see Merv Griffin. But I don't think Alan Carr

2680
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:42,720
did it for me 30 years later.

2681
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:44,720
Unless

2682
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:46,720
it is. Yeah it's a tenant.

2683
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,720
Unless it's a simulation.

2684
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,720
Which we've been talking about lately.

2685
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,720
We'll have to ask Mr. Slap.

2686
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,720
By the way

2687
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:56,720
Ambassador Hotel notorious for where

2688
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,720
Robert Kennedy was killed.

2689
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,720
That's what that is.

2690
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,720
Still not the worst thing that's

2691
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,720
happened.

2692
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,720
Not demolished until 2005.

2693
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,720
Yikes.

2694
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:10,720
Very much what you're saying.

2695
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:12,720
So what now? Who now?

2696
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,720
Merv Griffin? Huh? And then he

2697
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:16,720
introduces a bunch of people. All the stars.

2698
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,720
Like alright Alice Faye.

2699
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,720
I'm going to be honest I don't know who Alice Faye is.

2700
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,720
Dorothy Lamour.

2701
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,720
I kind of know that name.

2702
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,720
Somebody on our Patreon.

2703
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:28,720
Cicharise is in there.

2704
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,720
I don't really know Cicharise.

2705
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,720
I'm going to be honest. Somebody on our Patreon

2706
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:34,720
was suggesting this before Club 3

2707
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,720
but we brought it up to the big stage.

2708
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:38,720
And in their suggestion they said

2709
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:40,720
it's a bunch of introductions of movie

2710
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,720
stars only Jason would know.

2711
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,720
Cicharise probably the most. Cicharise

2712
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,720
has a big dance number in

2713
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,720
Singing in the Rain. And the

2714
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,720
apocryphal story

2715
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,720
is that like oh well she her legs

2716
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,720
were famously insured for a million

2717
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,720
dollars. Oh and she's the one who's like

2718
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:58,720
okay in this. She does like a big kick.

2719
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,720
Yeah she did a lot of kicks.

2720
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,720
And she's still got it.

2721
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,720
But most of the people as they start

2722
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:06,720
rehearsing this thing. And Alan Carr

2723
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,720
has it in his head and all of the greatest

2724
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,720
stars will be there. But he's picturing them

2725
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,720
30 years ago. Merv Griffin at his

2726
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,720
height.

2727
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,720
Okay if this were 60's Merv Griffin

2728
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:18,720
no problem. Oh my god.

2729
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:20,720
It would have been cooking.

2730
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:22,720
The audience would have been turned on.

2731
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:24,720
We've got Merv Griffin centuries.

2732
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,720
If you've got Vincent Price.

2733
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,720
Vincent Price is here.

2734
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,720
Vincent Price hot off Dr. Goldfoot

2735
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,720
in the bikini machine. Now we're

2736
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,720
talking.

2737
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,720
But 89 Price?

2738
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,720
No way.

2739
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,720
So they have to start like okay maybe we can't

2740
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,720
have all of these people be in the musical

2741
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,720
number. Maybe we say their names and they wave

2742
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,720
politely. They stand up from a table

2743
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,720
and leave. Assuming that they're able to

2744
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:50,720
do that. Well you need the Coconut Grove audience.

2745
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,720
I mean who's celebrities have to

2746
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:54,720
be enjoying the Merv Griffin performance.

2747
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,720
All of it. Roger's,

2748
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,720
Vincent Price is crazy. Sorry

2749
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,720
is it Vincent Price's wife?

2750
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:02,720
Well there's a clip that I

2751
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,720
think it's on a Gilbert Godfrey podcast where Michael

2752
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:06,720
McKeon is doing. They're doing dueling

2753
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,720
prices. And they both have very

2754
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,720
good prices. And Michael McKeon points out that

2755
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,720
Vincent Price always. Vincent Price

2756
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:14,720
I don't know if I'm wrong to say

2757
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:16,720
probably a gay gentleman.

2758
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,720
But was married to this woman Coral Brown.

2759
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:20,720
And the speculation would be that he'd always

2760
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,720
say her full name and title.

2761
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,720
And the actress, my

2762
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,720
married to the actress Coral Brown.

2763
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,720
You could say it like that.

2764
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,720
The woman, the female actress.

2765
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:32,720
Is there a sexualism I...

2766
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,720
Right.

2767
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,720
So yeah I don't know

2768
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,720
a movie or anything. All I know

2769
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,720
her is from this clip. So this is a little

2770
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,720
like can my wife

2771
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,720
come along on the...

2772
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,720
That was I believe his speculation.

2773
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:48,720
Now who is your wife again?

2774
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,720
The actress. Coral Brown.

2775
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,720
That's what

2776
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,720
Michael McKeon says. I don't know

2777
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,720
for sure. But

2778
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,720
yes. So

2779
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,720
all the big stars. To get Vincent

2780
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,720
Price you gotta bring Coral

2781
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:04,720
Brown. Right.

2782
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,720
We've talked about

2783
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,720
Vincent Price being on the

2784
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,720
Horror Hall of Fame

2785
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:12,720
awards.

2786
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:14,720
Which would be after this.

2787
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,720
So Coral Brown would not be with

2788
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,720
him. I'm not sure when she died.

2789
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,720
But he at least...

2790
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,720
He would go somewhere without Coral is really what I'm saying.

2791
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,720
I think. As long as he was

2792
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,720
being honored in some way. Yeah. For the

2793
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:28,720
Horror Hall of Fame he went to his backyard.

2794
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:30,720
That's right. Yes.

2795
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:32,720
He was via... I think he went in person one year.

2796
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,720
Okay. He was there one year.

2797
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,720
But yes. His backyard for one of them.

2798
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,720
Produced by Alan Carr. I think that's what he had to do

2799
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,720
after this. He took over the Horror Hall of Fame.

2800
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,720
But

2801
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,720
hey. They realized it

2802
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,720
can't just be a bunch of old fogies.

2803
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,720
We gotta get some young blood

2804
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,720
in this number.

2805
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,720
And that is when Snow White

2806
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,720
meets her blind date. Let's go to Snow White

2807
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:56,720
too.

2808
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,720
Meet your blind date, Rob Lowe.

2809
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:02,720
This is so wild.

2810
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,720
I just watched it

2811
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,720
a couple hours ago again.

2812
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:08,720
Oh Mr. Lowe.

2813
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,720
I'm such a fan.

2814
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,720
Really?

2815
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,720
Processing him being part of it. Beyond what's

2816
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,720
about to happen.

2817
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,720
I mean...

2818
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,720
No.

2819
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,720
No.

2820
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:44,720
Now the performance here.

2821
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:46,720
The way he chooses to sing

2822
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,720
is so...

2823
01:49:48,720 --> 01:50:00,720
What is that goodbye?

2824
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:06,720
And then...

2825
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,720
Okay.

2826
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:10,720
This is a year

2827
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:12,720
after the thing too.

2828
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,720
Actually. Well it's a year after

2829
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:16,720
the thing happened.

2830
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,720
The thing is not public.

2831
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:20,720
So it's about...

2832
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,720
But they don't know the camera rolling line

2833
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,720
that he ends on here?

2834
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:26,720
He's still in movies.

2835
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:28,720
He wants cameras to be rolling.

2836
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:30,720
That's an often confused thing.

2837
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:32,720
It was

2838
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,720
public right

2839
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:36,720
soon after this which was part of the curse

2840
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,720
of the sequence.

2841
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,720
About like six weeks after. Which in 1989 time

2842
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,720
is like six days after.

2843
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:44,720
He already

2844
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:46,720
took such a big career hit from

2845
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:48,720
this. And that adds

2846
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,720
to it.

2847
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:52,720
I...

2848
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,720
And if we aren't afraid of being struck down

2849
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,720
by the Doughboy's curse we can talk about

2850
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,720
Rob Lowe a little bit.

2851
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,720
We can't talk about Rob Lowe?

2852
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:02,720
We'll try.

2853
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,720
We can't talk about...

2854
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,720
I mean...

2855
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:08,720
The most insane...

2856
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:10,720
The voice...

2857
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,720
I've thought about...

2858
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:14,720
Grubby and sleepy...

2859
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:16,720
Forever... And the voice crack

2860
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,720
on it. The delivery is

2861
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,720
so... I...

2862
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,720
You can't... I mean... I...

2863
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,720
I don't know if he ever thought he could sing.

2864
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,720
It doesn't feel... It feels like he was asked arbitrarily.

2865
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,720
As with Richard Pryor. It's like doesn't matter.

2866
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:30,720
Big star. He's gonna be great. A big star

2867
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:32,720
can probably sing right?

2868
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,720
And then he's just thrown to the wolves here.

2869
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,720
Yeah. I mean you could talk... Again people can talk

2870
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:38,720
sing. There's like...

2871
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:40,720
You can get away with a lot.

2872
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,720
As long as maybe you're not doing a weird voice.

2873
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,720
Dudley Moore I feel like...

2874
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:46,720
Richard Pryor following Dudley Moore

2875
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,720
already doing the talk sing.

2876
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,720
That's unfair to Richard Pryor. You can't...

2877
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,720
You can't let everyone do the...

2878
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,720
Yeah. You gotta throw some other

2879
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:56,720
ringers in there.

2880
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:58,720
Don't have three talk singers in there.

2881
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,720
Yeah. Sure.

2882
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:02,720
To Rob Lowe's... I think Rob Lowe can sing.

2883
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:04,720
Some.

2884
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:06,720
The thing I read about this today was that Rob Lowe

2885
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,720
did this performance

2886
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,720
and then went backstage and was mortified.

2887
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:12,720
I believe Rob Lowe is on the record

2888
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:14,720
for telling this story. He was on some show.

2889
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:16,720
He went backstage and Lucille Ball

2890
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:18,720
was there to comfort him.

2891
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:20,720
And held his hand and said I really like your singing.

2892
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:22,720
A young man. I didn't know

2893
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:24,720
you could sing so well.

2894
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,720
He had a blue smoke in his face accidentally.

2895
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,720
Because remember she introduced Stars of Tomorrow

2896
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:30,720
right at the beginning of this.

2897
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,720
She's had her own debacle for the evening.

2898
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,720
By the way that's the only universal character

2899
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,720
I want to tell me that she's proud of me more than Optimus Prime.

2900
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:38,720
Oh my dear boy.

2901
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:40,720
If I could go in a tiny room with Lucy

2902
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,720
and it's filled with smoke.

2903
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,720
What a singer you are.

2904
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:46,720
You're wonderful.

2905
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:48,720
Gary thinks you're wonderful too.

2906
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:50,720
Who's Gary?

2907
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,720
Gary Morton.

2908
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:54,720
Gary Morton. My new guy.

2909
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,720
My new husband. I'm not so thrilled with him.

2910
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:58,720
But he's nice.

2911
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:00,720
Michael you're doing a great job.

2912
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,720
Were there any

2913
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,720
Ornette's children in the Stars of Tomorrow

2914
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:06,720
segment?

2915
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,720
Oh I don't think so.

2916
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,720
Too old maybe.

2917
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,720
They were the Stars of Tomorrow in the 60s.

2918
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:14,720
Yeah in the 70s.

2919
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,720
Here's Lucy it already happened.

2920
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,720
They missed their chance.

2921
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,720
He sat with Lucy

2922
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,720
for an hour. They held hands

2923
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,720
and they talked about Hollywood

2924
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:26,720
and then she passed away.

2925
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:28,720
Again the car

2926
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,720
curse. She passed away

2927
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,720
like five six weeks later.

2928
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,720
This was her last time on television I think.

2929
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,720
Really?

2930
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:38,720
Oh my god.

2931
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,720
To introduce Jolie Fisher and Corey Feldman.

2932
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,720
It was the last time she was.

2933
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,720
Immediately after.

2934
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,720
At this point it might bear mentioning

2935
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:48,720
that I did the show Moonbeam City

2936
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:50,720
for Comedy Central. Rob Lowe

2937
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,720
was the main voice on it. Ryan Perez

2938
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,720
was a writer for the show.

2939
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:56,720
And you may recall

2940
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,720
that maybe I

2941
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,720
wasn't so vocal about it.

2942
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:02,720
Tell me if I was. To me

2943
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:04,720
when it went to. Wow.

2944
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:06,720
To me

2945
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,720
when it went to series

2946
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:10,720
when I realized we were going to have an opportunity to fill

2947
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:12,720
a lot of episodes with Rob Lowe.

2948
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,720
Priority number one to me

2949
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,720
became we have to get him to sing.

2950
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,720
Being a fan of this

2951
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:20,720
we have whatever reason we could possibly

2952
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:22,720
find to get this guy

2953
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,720
to sing. You in fact

2954
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,720
wrote an episode. A fantastic

2955
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:28,720
episode of the show called Cop Con.

2956
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:30,720
That is full of like

2957
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:32,720
themes and it's a very

2958
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:34,720
prescient piece about

2959
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,720
police brutality and police

2960
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:38,720
violence. I should say so.

2961
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,720
Check that out somewhere if you can find it.

2962
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,720
Possibly on the way out

2963
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:44,720
the door. You know it was on Pluto.

2964
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,720
Before I came over here. The legend of Circuit

2965
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,720
Lake. Oh there you go. Pluto TV.

2966
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,720
They do air it. Yeah yeah.

2967
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,720
It really means a lot to me that they air it.

2968
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,720
You can see. Well in that

2969
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,720
one you can see the line that you wrote which delighted me so

2970
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:58,720
much. An episode that's a big tribute to

2971
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,720
Free Jack. The Emilio Esteves. Oh yeah.

2972
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,720
Free Jack. And that has the line

2973
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,720
now I can free Jack

2974
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,720
into the system and jack off

2975
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,720
that dazzle no bag. Oh there you go.

2976
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:10,720
That delight. That made me so

2977
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,720
happy. The first time I saw it.

2978
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:14,720
But anyway you wrote this episode. There was

2979
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:16,720
I give you entirely the credit for like the

2980
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,720
like the like the

2981
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,720
weighty quality stuff in it. And I think

2982
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,720
my main contribution my only contribution

2983
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:24,720
was we should get Rob Lowe to sing

2984
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,720
a song in it.

2985
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:28,720
And I believe he sings two relatively

2986
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:30,720
close back to back in the show.

2987
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:32,720
He sings like a rockabilly song.

2988
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,720
Yes. Yeah.

2989
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:36,720
He sang at Rad's wedding.

2990
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:38,720
Oh yes yes. He sang Cop this Town

2991
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:40,720
and he sang Wed this

2992
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,720
Bride. Which is all

2993
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,720
on Spotify. I forgot that it was

2994
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,720
Cop this Town. I'm very

2995
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:48,720
proud. I don't know how much singing.

2996
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:50,720
Rob Lowe had done since this performance.

2997
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:52,720
If he sang on Perks

2998
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:54,720
and Wreck I don't know it. There's not a

2999
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,720
lot of Rob Lowe singing out there. I made

3000
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:58,720
it a point. We're gonna get some time with this

3001
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:00,720
guy. I make you sing in a song

3002
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,720
a song which to tie a bunch of things together

3003
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:04,720
was the song that we put in

3004
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,720
just because I thought Brian Setzer

3005
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:08,720
is stupid.

3006
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:10,720
That's the song.

3007
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,720
I'm gonna have him sing a dumb bad

3008
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,720
Brian Setzer song.

3009
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,720
Did it cross your mind though of like

3010
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,720
you think you do roll it

3011
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,720
on a river.

3012
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:22,720
Oh we did.

3013
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:24,720
I guess I wanted to get him into a new

3014
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:26,720
bad genre. A new bad type of

3015
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:28,720
songs that dad bands would play.

3016
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,720
And

3017
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,720
just about that experience recording

3018
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,720
it I will say that is the number one most

3019
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:36,720
fun thing I got to do

3020
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:38,720
making the show. Making him sing that

3021
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,720
song was so much fun. However I

3022
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:42,720
was a little bit disappointed he was not

3023
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:44,720
a worse singer.

3024
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:46,720
I kind of thought I was gonna get the

3025
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,720
grumpy and sleepy. But he's a

3026
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:50,720
perfectly capable dad type

3027
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:52,720
singer. I thought

3028
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:54,720
he was not. I think he

3029
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:56,720
I bet he was like collapsing under the pressure

3030
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,720
of because I get 42 million

3031
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:00,720
people. Oh and I

3032
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,720
wonder what the direction was because I feel like the direction

3033
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:04,720
was like you're really into her.

3034
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,720
Like that felt like that's

3035
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:08,720
where he's coming from. Yes I mean

3036
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:10,720
there's a shot later on where

3037
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:12,720
it's like a downbeat moment and

3038
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:14,720
it's like a zoom in on him. He's looking at

3039
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:16,720
her. Yes. And it's like

3040
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,720
he's playing like in love.

3041
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,720
This is like a dramatic moment in the middle

3042
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:22,720
of a. Yes. And lust I would say.

3043
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,720
And lust was so white. Yes.

3044
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:26,720
And I feel like it. It's very

3045
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,720
sensual. The whole thing. It's still not

3046
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:30,720
as weird as when Travolta grabbed Adina

3047
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:32,720
Menzel's face in that Oscars.

3048
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:34,720
That's the most scary

3049
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:36,720
moment I think of any Oscars.

3050
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,720
They thought they were gonna fix it

3051
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:40,720
with that. Alright this Adele Dezime

3052
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,720
thing was weird. Let's make it right.

3053
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,720
Let's get them together and then

3054
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,720
can I touch your face?

3055
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:48,720
Can I touch your face?

3056
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:50,720
I want to

3057
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,720
take your face.

3058
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:54,720
You're so wickedly delightful.

3059
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,720
He's like squeezing her skull.

3060
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,720
Those are the most wonderful

3061
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:00,720
nostrils I've ever put my fingers

3062
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,720
in. It's such a mafia like

3063
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:04,720
threatening.

3064
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:08,720
Anyway

3065
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:10,720
that is not the last of the Rob

3066
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,720
singing because then things kick into gear.

3067
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,720
This could have been the end of the entire

3068
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,720
what we watched a little bit ago could have been

3069
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:18,720
the end of the whole thing. That could be two whole

3070
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:20,720
separate numbers already. Yes.

3071
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,720
But Snow White 3.

3072
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,720
I don't think he's bad.

3073
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,720
He sounds better here I'll say

3074
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:36,720
than before.

3075
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,720
Well they also gave him a thing that is not

3076
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:40,720
what he... Rockabilly

3077
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:42,720
this is your genre. I figured it out.

3078
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:44,720
We figured it out.

3079
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:54,720
Oh boy.

3080
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,720
But really in that part

3081
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,720
it's less him and more these

3082
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:00,720
the animated

3083
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:02,720
mama.

3084
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,720
Is there any...

3085
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:06,720
Was it just meant to be like this will be

3086
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:08,720
just the kitchiest only appreciated

3087
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:10,720
tongue in cheek or are they thinking people are

3088
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:12,720
going to really respond to this message of keeping

3089
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,720
cameras rolling.

3090
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:16,720
Hollywood's been rolling for years and we're not stopping

3091
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,720
not tonight.

3092
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:20,720
I think that makes more sense that it was in

3093
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,720
line with like a sincere celebration

3094
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:24,720
of Hollywood and also

3095
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:26,720
I'm going to be an Oscar winner.

3096
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,720
That's the skeleton key into understanding

3097
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:30,720
this is that like. Oh right.

3098
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:32,720
This is it. Also by the way

3099
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,720
this is the end.

3100
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,720
Like Billy Crystal takes over the next

3101
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,720
year. Like this is the last one you ever got

3102
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,720
of like the old ways.

3103
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:42,720
No irony.

3104
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:44,720
I think later on they said it was

3105
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:46,720
kitschy but that's what feels like a cop

3106
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,720
out. Yeah. I think

3107
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,720
Alan Carr is like we are celebrating

3108
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:52,720
we're bringing the glamour back.

3109
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,720
It's going to be full of sparkles

3110
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,720
and sparkles on stars that look like

3111
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:58,720
the backboard to a high school

3112
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,720
science project. Yeah.

3113
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:02,720
When is the Tina Turner

3114
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,720
version of that song come out? So it's fairly

3115
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:06,720
recent I guess as far

3116
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:08,720
as you know 60s.

3117
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:10,720
Oh yeah.

3118
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:12,720
We know she had a different but she had a newer

3119
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:14,720
version. Wasn't she had a newer version of it as

3120
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:16,720
a hit I think. Rollin on the river.

3121
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:18,720
Am I wrong. I don't

3122
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:20,720
know the ins and outs of the newer

3123
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:22,720
or am I thinking of didn't she have there was a

3124
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:24,720
performance or something. Am I crazy.

3125
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,720
I don't know. Jason saved me here.

3126
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:28,720
She had an 80s resurgence.

3127
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:30,720
Is that what I'm thinking of. I don't know.

3128
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:32,720
I don't think we're within the decade.

3129
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:34,720
I'm trying to help out here. I'm trying.

3130
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,720
It's a little bit like saying it's a

3131
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:38,720
reason like people don't cover Stevie Wonder.

3132
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:40,720
It's the same thing like Tina Turner is like

3133
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:42,720
that's also not an easy

3134
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:44,720
task. Like go sing.

3135
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:46,720
Go sing that actor.

3136
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

3137
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:50,720
This is meant to be like a show stopping

3138
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:52,720
number. Go sing that song associated with

3139
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,720
Tina Turner.

3140
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:56,720
It's only the most dynamic performer

3141
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:58,720
in the world. You guys got this.

3142
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,720
This is your first time on television. You could do a proud

3143
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:02,720
Mary. Right. You're not singer.

3144
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,720
You very scared. Twenty two

3145
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:06,720
year old who's never been on television before.

3146
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,720
Just be Tina Turner. Go go go.

3147
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,720
Also what made what maybe

3148
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:12,720
should be said is that behind them are

3149
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:14,720
tables and place settings.

3150
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:16,720
But those are people who then like

3151
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:18,720
in that part of it they're swaying their

3152
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:20,720
heads back and forth and they have flower pots on their heads

3153
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:22,720
and then they all stand up. It's like be

3154
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:24,720
our guest. It's a bit

3155
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:26,720
of pre be our guest. Be our guest might have

3156
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:28,720
got that idea from that possibly. Yes.

3157
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:30,720
Yeah. The Broadway inspiration

3158
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:32,720
comes where you least expect it.

3159
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:34,720
This thing this goes and goes.

3160
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,720
And you say all right that coconut grove. All right.

3161
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,720
Are we are we done. We don't know the coconut

3162
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:40,720
grove moves away and the

3163
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:42,720
revealing a Chinese theater. OK.

3164
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:44,720
Now surely we must be no. Then

3165
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,720
part of the Chinese gate moves

3166
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:48,720
away and there's a

3167
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:50,720
kick line and then a different part

3168
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,720
moves away and then the

3169
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:54,720
top of the Chinese theater

3170
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:56,720
becomes the top of a wig

3171
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:58,720
on Snow White's head.

3172
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,720
Yeah. And it zooms out from

3173
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:02,720
this and there's wowie

3174
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:04,720
and the and then where else can it go

3175
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:06,720
but Snow White having the biggest wig

3176
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,720
in the world.

3177
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:10,720
But then she gets covered up by

3178
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,720
a flight of stairs that Lily

3179
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:14,720
Tomlin walks down. Yes.

3180
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,720
And by the time all this has transpired

3181
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:18,720
this has been 11 minutes

3182
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:20,720
of live television. This is almost

3183
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:22,720
Super Bowl halftime show length

3184
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:24,720
and they still have stars of tomorrow

3185
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:26,720
to go. They they stopped. And by the way

3186
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:28,720
Lily when Lily Tomlin walks down

3187
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:30,720
she has a good joke.

3188
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:32,720
Uh huh. Yeah.

3189
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,720
This is a Bruce. This has to be

3190
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:36,720
you got they got Bruce. Yeah.

3191
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:38,720
The joke is

3192
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,720
I agree to do the show if they could

3193
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:42,720
only come up with an entrance.

3194
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:44,720
OK. Yeah.

3195
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,720
Pretty good joke. But on

3196
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:48,720
the stairs behind her

3197
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:50,720
there's like a gag where

3198
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:52,720
like a guy's like somebody's

3199
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:54,720
reaching for a shoe or something. It's like a

3200
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,720
Cinderella. I don't know what it is. It's like a shoe

3201
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:58,720
on the stairs. They do not convey what it is.

3202
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:00,720
I think it's Cinderella.

3203
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:02,720
But it's Snow White.

3204
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:04,720
I think it's good.

3205
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:06,720
And then there's like a

3206
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:08,720
performer like Hamily like reaching

3207
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:10,720
for the shoe.

3208
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,720
And this is going this is fighting

3209
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:14,720
that's the worst thing I actually think in

3210
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:16,720
that number is that all

3211
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,720
could be forgiven if she

3212
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:20,720
could just come out and say hey you know what

3213
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:22,720
I want an entrance or whatever.

3214
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:24,720
The joke is and it keeps

3215
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:26,720
going. It's like it's it's

3216
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:28,720
it's it's it is cursed.

3217
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:30,720
Yeah. Yeah.

3218
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,720
Well and the car curse

3219
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:34,720
unspooled through the as we said

3220
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:36,720
Lucille Ball

3221
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:38,720
passes away.

3222
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:40,720
Watching this

3223
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:42,720
performance in the theater

3224
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,720
Jeffrey Katzenberg and Roy

3225
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:46,720
Disney Michael Eisner is

3226
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:48,720
attending to the parks in Orlando.

3227
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:50,720
He gets on the phone to the

3228
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:52,720
entire Disney legal team and says

3229
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:54,720
are you watching the Oscars. Yeah.

3230
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:56,720
All right. Do your thing.

3231
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:58,720
Lawyer Disney lawyers stay up all

3232
02:03:58,720 --> 02:04:00,720
night so that they can have

3233
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:02,720
at 530 in the morning a

3234
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:04,720
legal document ready to review

3235
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:06,720
which by that afternoon is sent

3236
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:08,720
to the Academy. We are suing

3237
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:10,720
you for unauthorized use of Snow White

3238
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:12,720
because they did not

3239
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:14,720
clear it. They did not. And they're

3240
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:16,720
thinking Snow White's in the public domain and they use

3241
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:18,720
it in Beach Blanket Babylon.

3242
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:20,720
Well not that Snow White with those

3243
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:22,720
colors and that voice.

3244
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:24,720
Yeah. Yeah.

3245
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:26,720
So and another bit of context

3246
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:28,720
as soon

3247
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:30,720
as this is over as soon as it goes to commercial

3248
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:32,720
break finally after 11

3249
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:34,720
minutes the very first thing it cuts to

3250
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:36,720
is a Chevy Lumina commercial

3251
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,720
which is a cross promotion with the

3252
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:40,720
about to open Disney MGM Studios

3253
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:42,720
theme park in which there's

3254
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:44,720
Chevy Chevy Luminas are pulling up

3255
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:46,720
outside the Chinese theater

3256
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:48,720
and Disney characters are coming out including

3257
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:50,720
the dwarfs. So

3258
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:52,720
to a viewer they're like

3259
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:54,720
oh Disney did that. If I'm

3260
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:56,720
seeing a Disney commercial right now

3261
02:04:56,720 --> 02:04:58,720
surely Disney was

3262
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:00,720
part of it. So they it's in the

3263
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:02,720
press within 24 hours we're

3264
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:04,720
suing the Academy. They have to

3265
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:06,720
issue they ended up settling it. They didn't go

3266
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:08,720
to court or anything. They just apologize

3267
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:10,720
profusely. Frank Wells got Frank Wells

3268
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:12,720
called the producer immediately.

3269
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,720
So this guy he's on the phone

3270
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:16,720
with a bit like hey how you doing Frank.

3271
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:18,720
He thinks he's calling to congratulate

3272
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,720
not so good. Disney's not happy.

3273
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:22,720
So immediate lawsuit right out

3274
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:24,720
the door. Then guy

3275
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:26,720
hangs up the phone then gets another

3276
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:28,720
all right. You hear about the letter. No what's the letter.

3277
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:30,720
There is a letter going out

3278
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:32,720
that's going to be in all the trades from

3279
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:34,720
a group of esteemed actors

3280
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:36,720
criticizing the performance.

3281
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:38,720
Do you guys know. I don't know this.

3282
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:40,720
OK.

3283
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:42,720
This is a letter.

3284
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:44,720
The 61st Academy Awards was an embarrassment to both

3285
02:05:44,720 --> 02:05:46,720
the Academy and the entire motion picture

3286
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:48,720
industry. It is neither fitting nor acceptable

3287
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:50,720
that the best work in motion pictures be

3288
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:52,720
acknowledged in such a demeaning fashion.

3289
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:54,720
And this letter is signed by

3290
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:56,720
among other people. Julie Andrews

3291
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:58,720
William Friedkin Stanley Donin

3292
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:00,720
Blake Edwards

3293
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:02,720
Billy

3294
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:04,720
Wilder Paul Newman

3295
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:06,720
and the main

3296
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,720
person who pulled this together. Gregory

3297
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,720
Peck. Wow.

3298
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:12,720
Wow. Made a point of

3299
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:14,720
we have work to do.

3300
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:16,720
I've written a letter.

3301
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:18,720
This

3302
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:20,720
cannot stand. Wait

3303
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:22,720
so. I an animated

3304
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,720
mama. An animated mama. Bill Friedkin

3305
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:26,720
Bill Friedkin

3306
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:28,720
here saying

3307
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:30,720
that's not how you open an Oscar

3308
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:32,720
ceremony.

3309
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:34,720
Wait OK. This is

3310
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:36,720
independent of the Disney lawsuit. Yes separate.

3311
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:38,720
It all happens with it like in one afternoon

3312
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:40,720
everything unravels for this

3313
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:42,720
entire production team. I mean I

3314
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:44,720
feel like Mary Poppins is telling you you

3315
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:46,720
suck. That hurts.

3316
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:48,720
That really hurts.

3317
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:50,720
Was not

3318
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:52,720
practically perfect in every way. The stress

3319
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:54,720
of this killed Lucille Ball.

3320
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,720
Just watching it.

3321
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:58,720
Yeah. Yeah.

3322
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:00,720
Maybe she hadn't like maybe

3323
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:02,720
maybe she hadn't watched the opening

3324
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:04,720
really. She's like quick second of it. Found out

3325
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,720
later. Oh I complimented that

3326
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:08,720
boy. I was wrong.

3327
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:10,720
Gary taped it. I was so nice to the

3328
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:12,720
boy. Gary showed me the tape and

3329
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:14,720
I thought I was dreadful.

3330
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:16,720
And I decided to pass

3331
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:18,720
away.

3332
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:20,720
Gary I'm gonna die.

3333
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:22,720
And all my affairs.

3334
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:24,720
Gary

3335
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:26,720
you're good for nothing.

3336
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,720
As for Alan Carr

3337
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:30,720
it's he like

3338
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:32,720
he went into a restaurant the next day

3339
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:34,720
expecting to get a standing ovation and

3340
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:36,720
instead no one would look at him.

3341
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:38,720
He never produced a film or a television

3342
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:40,720
show again. And

3343
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,720
the

3344
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:44,720
Oscar's producer Gil Kates

3345
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:46,720
many years later said

3346
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:48,720
if he had just made that number shorter

3347
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:50,720
I think he would still be alive today.

3348
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:52,720
Oh my gosh.

3349
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:54,720
I mean he's right.

3350
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:56,720
He's probably right.

3351
02:07:56,720 --> 02:07:58,720
So the joke I made about Lucy is true.

3352
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,720
I think so. Yes. There's a

3353
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:02,720
body count. So he had to go. He basically

3354
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:04,720
went into exile.

3355
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,720
Yeah. Yeah. He was like embarrassed and

3356
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:08,720
ashamed. There's a whole documentary about him.

3357
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:10,720
It was apparently a huge deal when there was

3358
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:12,720
he thought I want to

3359
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:14,720
re-release Grease and get all the love about

3360
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:16,720
Grease again. And it probably helped start

3361
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:18,720
the fire which now like Grease is

3362
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:20,720
eternally popular. And it was like a

3363
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:22,720
meaningful thing for him. So he got like a little bit

3364
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:24,720
of like glory

3365
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:26,720
at the end. But like he

3366
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:28,720
didn't do anything new. He was Mr.

3367
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:30,720
Hollywood. Before that Billy

3368
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,720
Wilder somehow created

3369
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:34,720
a new Norma Desmond. He just

3370
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:36,720
wouldn't leave his house.

3371
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:38,720
I'm doing it for real this time.

3372
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:40,720
So

3373
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:42,720
yeah this might

3374
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:44,720
be the most cursed. And now I'm worried

3375
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:46,720
that something bad is going to happen to us because we talked

3376
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:48,720
about it. Oh no.

3377
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,720
I think we're fine. I mean I think it's over

3378
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:52,720
it's also overstated.

3379
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:54,720
I mean like it's not I think in context

3380
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:56,720
it's not it is bad. It truly

3381
02:08:56,720 --> 02:08:58,720
is terrible. But like

3382
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:00,720
Dom DeLuis and like

3383
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,720
I mean that's two years before.

3384
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:04,720
Like what are we imagine that

3385
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:06,720
was 12 minutes. Maybe that's

3386
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:08,720
the issue. It was quicker.

3387
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:10,720
I think yeah I think that is

3388
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:12,720
what it is because we have seen

3389
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:14,720
performance.

3390
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:16,720
I think that's the lesson to take away. There are

3391
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,720
performances of comparable

3392
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:20,720
shittiness.

3393
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:22,720
But it's really just

3394
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,720
what are you asking people to endure?

3395
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:26,720
Sure.

3396
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:28,720
I would have still partied at Alan Carr's

3397
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:30,720
house after this.

3398
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:32,720
Who gives an underground disco?

3399
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:34,720
Yeah who cares. Yeah you said that about

3400
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,720
Brett Radner says that he had a disco in his

3401
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:38,720
house and that is from Alan Carr.

3402
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:40,720
Wow. Yeah.

3403
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:42,720
We all want that in a mansion

3404
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,720
of ours one day.

3405
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:46,720
Yes. It's a little flying

3406
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:48,720
too close to the sun kind of

3407
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:50,720
story. Yeah maybe

3408
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:52,720
something else needs in your house. Maybe a disco

3409
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:54,720
floor.

3410
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,720
Yeah boy.

3411
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:58,720
You have a brighter spot.

3412
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:00,720
Well you know it turned well obviously

3413
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:02,720
there are no hard feelings in the long

3414
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:04,720
run between the Walt Disney Company

3415
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:06,720
and the Academy because it's

3416
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,720
aired on ABC for a long

3417
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:10,720
time which the Disney Company has owned for a long

3418
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:12,720
time. And

3419
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:14,720
I was looking up because

3420
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:16,720
for a while I couldn't find it

3421
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:18,720
they were doing it this year.

3422
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:20,720
They would show the Oscar broadcast

3423
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:22,720
on the Main Street Opera House.

3424
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:24,720
They would show that in the Main Street Opera

3425
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:26,720
House on Main Street and

3426
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:28,720
Disneyland. Yes. This year

3427
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:30,720
what I saw they have

3428
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:32,720
and they have this every year a big step

3429
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:34,720
and repeat and giant Oscar statue

3430
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:36,720
at the Grand Californian Hotel that

3431
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:38,720
you can take a picture with

3432
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:40,720
and a milkshake with a bow tie on it.

3433
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,720
You can buy in

3434
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:44,720
California Adventure. But

3435
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,720
something actually of merit

3436
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:48,720
at the Carthay Circle

3437
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:50,720
Restaurant on loan

3438
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:52,720
from the Walt Disney Family Museum in

3439
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:54,720
San Francisco they have the

3440
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:56,720
Snow White Oscar

3441
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:58,720
with the little Oscars. With the seven

3442
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:00,720
little Oscars. With the seven little Oscars.

3443
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:02,720
So you can go see that right now

3444
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:04,720
in the restaurant that is a

3445
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:06,720
replica of the theater that Snow White

3446
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:08,720
premiered in. That's pretty cool.

3447
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:10,720
That's pretty good.

3448
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,720
Well that's nice. But that's I don't know

3449
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:14,720
that's not my Snow White.

3450
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:16,720
My Snow White is a petrified

3451
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:18,720
inexperienced actress who's

3452
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:20,720
chased out of the business put on a

3453
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:22,720
gag order to where she can't talk about

3454
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:24,720
this for 13 years.

3455
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:26,720
True fact also.

3456
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:28,720
Really? 13 years? Yeah I think so.

3457
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:30,720
Now she's spoken about it. But

3458
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:32,720
yeah to me Snow

3459
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:34,720
White has to be couched

3460
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:36,720
in tragedy.

3461
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,720
I mean I don't know where else

3462
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:40,720
to go from here. We've fully explored

3463
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:42,720
the depths of will the

3464
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:44,720
will the ceremony

3465
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:46,720
this year have anything

3466
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:48,720
as memorable as this?

3467
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:50,720
Will Michael Eisner step in somehow?

3468
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:52,720
Because this is back to back. We just

3469
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:54,720
on a Patreon episode discovered that Michael Eisner

3470
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:56,720
put an end to a regional

3471
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:58,720
Los Angeles kids show called

3472
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:00,720
King Koopa's Cool Cartoons.

3473
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,720
What? Just recently?

3474
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:04,720
No. In the early 90's.

3475
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:06,720
He wrote a letter to, this is again according

3476
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:08,720
we talk about it on Patreon but

3477
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:10,720
according to this Wikipedia one of the writers

3478
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:12,720
on the show said he wrote a letter to Barry Diller

3479
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:14,720
and got the show cancelled.

3480
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,720
So we're learning just like obviously we knew he was

3481
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:18,720
powerful but this man wielded so much

3482
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:20,720
power and will he step in

3483
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:22,720
this year is really what my question is.

3484
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:24,720
Well he's expending all of his power this year

3485
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:26,720
making sure those pesky crank anchors

3486
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:28,720
don't show up and cause mischief.

3487
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:30,720
I'll bet you. I mean

3488
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:32,720
I'm just glad he left Aladdin's winter wish alone.

3489
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:34,720
That's you know.

3490
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:36,720
Because Ben

3491
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:38,720
Verin didn't know what he was

3492
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:40,720
in that production. Oh my god Ben Verin

3493
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:42,720
was in it. It's so fun. I think he

3494
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:44,720
was like hey everybody Disney like he

3495
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:46,720
didn't know. So the whole

3496
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:48,720
go back to Aladdin's

3497
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:50,720
winter wish. There were

3498
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:52,720
elements of it that were clearly just ripping

3499
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:54,720
the Disney version off. It wasn't totally

3500
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:56,720
Disney because Bruce Flange played

3501
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:58,720
the widow Twanky which is a character that does

3502
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:00,720
not appear in the Disney

3503
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:02,720
Aladdin but Ben Verin was the

3504
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:04,720
genie and he made a joke

3505
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:06,720
about the Lion King

3506
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:08,720
and he referenced the character Mufafa

3507
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:10,720
from Lion King

3508
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:12,720
and I don't think he

3509
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:14,720
knew the character but obviously somebody like threw this

3510
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:16,720
name at him and he just did his best and

3511
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:18,720
honestly that was the most fun to see.

3512
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,720
It was great seeing Richard Carn as the

3513
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:22,720
sultan but Ben Verin

3514
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:24,720
as the genie truly I was very

3515
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:26,720
excited to see him.

3516
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:28,720
This is Alan Carr level casting.

3517
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:30,720
I mean if Carr could cast.

3518
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:32,720
Well you gotta go

3519
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:34,720
to the stage to get Carr level

3520
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:36,720
quality now. Ben Verin was on a show called

3521
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:38,720
Jubilee Zoo when I was a kid.

3522
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:40,720
As mayor Ben and he had like

3523
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:42,720
an animal nose and it's

3524
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:44,720
terrifying but I was a big fan

3525
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:46,720
from back then.

3526
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:48,720
But we just should

3527
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:50,720
honestly just remember it as the day

3528
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:52,720
that Peter O'Toole died.

3529
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:54,720
Yeah that's maybe a moment of silence

3530
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:56,720
and we'll hear it.

3531
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:58,720
Okay and

3532
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:00,720
Ryan Perez you survived

3533
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:02,720
Podcast the Ride.

3534
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:04,720
Well you got it.

3535
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:06,720
It's an Oscars episode you gotta have an in memoriam.

3536
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:08,720
That's right. Oh yeah exactly.

3537
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:10,720
But now 34 minutes of show everyone.

3538
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:12,720
We're still

3539
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:14,720
going. We got we reached a

3540
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:16,720
down point but now we're coming back

3541
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:18,720
for the best actor best actress.

3542
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:20,720
Well let me be like Armie Archer and say

3543
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:22,720
hey what irons do you

3544
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,720
have in the fire. Let's exit through the gift shop.

3545
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:26,720
Mr. Perez is there anything you'd like to

3546
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:28,720
plug. Oh boy Armie there's so

3547
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:30,720

3548

my co-host and Raymond talk about

3551
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:38,720
movies a new movie every week.

3552
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:40,720

3553
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:42,720
going to be on the show you know. It's one of

3554
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:44,720
another podcast to add to.

3555
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:46,720
I know your podcast options are many.

3556
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:48,720
But consider adding

3557
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:50,720
one more movie podcast.

3558
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:52,720
And some of the stars

3559
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:54,720
you have coming up are crazy.

3560
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,720
Jolie Fisher. We got Jolie Fisher.

3561
02:14:56,720 --> 02:14:58,720
We got

3562
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:00,720
a Chad

3563
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:02,720
Wood.

3564
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:04,720
Ricky Lake.

3565
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:06,720
They're all going to be. We got Tyrone

3566
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,720
Power Jr. Oh geez

3567
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:10,720
I was going to say I was maybe

3568
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:12,720
not going to listen until you threw that one. I was waiting

3569
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:14,720
for Tyrone Power Jr.

3570
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:16,720
I heard Gary Morton is going to be on

3571
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:18,720
this.

3572
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:20,720
This is a

3573
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:22,720
first turn. Pull up the logo.

3574
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:24,720
There we go. Mama Needs

3575
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:26,720
a Movie. And I don't know wait in what

3576
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:28,720
order these things are coming out but I'm either

3577
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:30,720
going to be on it sooner or just been on it.

3578
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:32,720
And I'm talking about Mommy Dearest.

3579
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:34,720
That's right. Oh wow.

3580
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:36,720
A movie I've never seen. Should we put

3581
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:38,720
that up before the Oscars or after the Oscars?

3582
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:40,720
Maybe before the Oscars. Well people are

3583
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:42,720
going to be thinking about Faye because

3584
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,720
of her involvement.

3585
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:46,720
Maybe and again we

3586
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:48,720
all remember she got out of there fast.

3587
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:50,720
She actually read the name

3588
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:52,720
and then was never seen from

3589
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:54,720
never seen again as opposed to Warren Beatty.

3590
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:56,720
That's true. So

3591
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,720
relevant.

3592
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,720
She might have really been the

3593
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:02,720
She read the name though.

3594
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:04,720
So I don't know.

3595
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:06,720
My conspiracy theory I think still stands that

3596
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:08,720
maybe they

3597
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:10,720
were in on it. Maybe not. Whatever.

3598
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:12,720
You know what you

3599
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:14,720
were saying was

3600
02:16:14,720 --> 02:16:16,720
the trickster Kimmel was maybe

3601
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:18,720
it. But think about who's presenting

3602
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:20,720
it. The ultimate criminal

3603
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:22,720
Bonnie and Clyde.

3604
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:24,720
The writing is there. It's all

3605
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:26,720
there. You just have to look at it.

3606
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:28,720
One last heist.

3607
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:30,720
That might have just been an Oscars

3608
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:32,720
producer who's been doing it so long

3609
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:34,720
was still mad that the movie started going

3610
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:36,720
when they nominated Bonnie and Clyde

3611
02:16:36,720 --> 02:16:38,720
that's going to took a turn.

3612
02:16:38,720 --> 02:16:40,720
No nice movies

3613
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:42,720
for the nice people.

3614
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:46,720
Well yeah well check me out on there whenever

3615
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:48,720
and other episodes.

3616
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:50,720
You're great and it's great and so happy to have you

3617
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:52,720
for this Ryan. Thank you so much for having me.

3618
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:54,720
You guys I haven't been on the show since

3619
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:56,720
I was in. I would think I was

3620
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:58,720
in the first 10 episodes. Yeah.

3621
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:00,720
At the time I did nots Berry farm

3622
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:02,720
and I legitimately thought you guys

3623
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,720
were going to do like one park per show.

3624
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:06,720
That's what I thought.

3625
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:08,720
Maybe you'll do maybe you'll do like a

3626
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:10,720
few more because you'll do the lands. Each

3627
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:12,720
land each land will

3628
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:14,720
get an episode. I never would have thought you guys

3629
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:16,720
not only have you guys done a great show

3630
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:18,720
you've done it now for a

3631
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:20,720
such an enduring show and

3632
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:22,720
I never thought you would get as granular

3633
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:24,720
and as entertaining as

3634
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:26,720
this. No this is neither.

3635
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:28,720
It's been a great joy to watch and

3636
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:30,720
listen to this show.

3637
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:34,720
There's multiple episodes about nights

3638
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:36,720
and white satin.

3639
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:38,720
That level of that level of

3640
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:40,720
I never would have thought

3641
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:42,720
you guys could

3642
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:44,720
do it but it's great. Thank you.

3643
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:46,720
You harken back to another time like

3644
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:48,720
that nots Berry farm would only get one

3645
02:17:48,720 --> 02:17:50,720
episode. Now we'd be like

3646
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:52,720
an episode for each pie.

3647
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:54,720
Each pie available.

3648
02:17:54,720 --> 02:17:56,720
That snuck in early. Each jam.

3649
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:58,720
You got away with something.

3650
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:00,720
We didn't know our pace as has become a catchphrase

3651
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:02,720
from the Cars Ride. Slow down

3652
02:18:02,720 --> 02:18:04,720
you ain't racing yet.

3653
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:06,720
We're going as

3654
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,720
slow as we can as we roll

3655
02:18:08,720 --> 02:18:10,720

3656
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:12,720

have getting Ryan having you back

3670

after so long talking about all this great

3671
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:42,720
stuff. I feel really high. This feels like a high

3672
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:44,720
moment for me. But keep in mind

3673
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:46,720
that when it's your highest moment

3674
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:48,720

3675
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:50,720
you gotta watch for

3676
02:18:50,720 --> 02:18:52,720
I think I see something. Oh no

3677
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:54,720
I think I see something. Oh no. It's

3678
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:56,720
Brett Ratner. Maybe it's just Dom DeLuis.

3679
02:18:56,720 --> 02:18:58,720
