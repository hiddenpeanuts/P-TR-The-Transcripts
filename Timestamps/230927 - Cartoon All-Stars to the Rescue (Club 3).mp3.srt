13
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,120
president I was aware of and yeah there he is George Bush the great president

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,180
Barbara Bush who appears to be getting like get that drop it drop it like

15
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,200
getting a chicken bone out of her dog's mouth the whole time she's like you're

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,500
talking about Millie huh you're talking about presidential dog Millie okay oh

17
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,020
yeah I never paid like holding the dog's mouth and well that's maybe that's a

18
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,140
like behavior on camera stay there to make it seem more of like a friendly

19
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,800
shot I think because Millie wants to get out of there yeah yeah I remember now

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,220
that you bring this up I remember not having any sort of barometer for

21
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,420
politics which I guess I shouldn't when I was eight or nine whatever however old

22
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,980
I was but weekly reader made us vote on president in 1992 and I remember I

23
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,020
voted for George Bush because I knew who he was yes voted against Bill Clinton

24
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,740
in the weekly reader which I don't believe was counted in the official

25
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,920
tally but I'm not sure I'm not really sure we did that in school every time

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,200
there was a presidential election which is totally psycho because I think George

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:44,380
Bush won in 2000 in high school for sure he won actually like that is so odd like

28
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,800
yeah that is strange yeah yeah given that it was so close I was 15 I voted for

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:01,280
Nader it's I was like we're in high school okay because it was like well

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,520
we're in high school like this doesn't matter what you ever consider that your

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,880
fake high school protest vote might have skewed the fake election you ever think

32
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,800
about that maybe your fake Bush rippled through time well the Brooks brothers

33
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,300
right give it the push but it rippled through time and lost Hillary the

34
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,980
election too uh-huh okay yeah I see that election yeah I that's fine I mean that

35
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,180
really proves it for the eight-year-old just votes for who he knows that's why

36
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,240
the incumbent always has an advantage I think yes which is actually applicable

37
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:45,160
in the club three poll situation oh yeah yeah I'm been almost always has one

38
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,360
and this much like rush V Gore was extremely close and I don't want to say

39
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,160
contested but it came it came very good because this this club three vote came

40
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,540
down to one vote yeah cartoon all-stars the incumbent one by by one that's why

41
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,880
you got a vote people you really people you know and I know some people voted

42
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,320
what else was in this poll right people well okay tales is the gore the nadir

43
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:19,140
maybe the Tomorrowland opening from 19 the grand opening of Tomorrowland in

44
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,340
1898 I already forget what was in the poll but Gore lost and we didn't involve

45
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,960
the Supreme Court it is going to cartoon all-stars and therefore to the bushes

46
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,300
this is another election with a Bush victor I feel like we've talked about

47
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,820
this has been on the board for a long time I feel I feel like I remember

48
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,480
talking about this early on in the show and it's just I think it's come up in

49
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,820
the shuffle here and there and yeah I mean because it's it's way up our alley

50
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,120
so yeah I think we would love plotless all-star adult man who are stuck in

51
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,060
their childhoods of course are obsessed with this thing can I say one thing more

52
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,000
about George Bush really quickly that I don't know that I've sat on the show

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,160
because it relates to a common reference to on podcast the riot George Bush many

54
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,120
women I think who were maybe taking care of him toward the end alleged that he

55
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,980
would say inappropriate things to them which is very common with older men

56
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,640
like a rest a rest home or whatever you call it out on the way out sure yeah

57
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,800
that's a very common thing that we that's like a kind of a fear of mine that

58
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,580
like when I have dementia I'm gonna be just saying creepy shit to people I don't

59
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,480
want to do that that being said I don't know if I've said this on the show

60
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:38,500
before have I said what joke dementia ridden George Bush would say to

61
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,420
different nursing nursing my mental recesses person we bring up on podcasts

62
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:51,380
are a lot Wow Wow do you want to get as friendly as Jimmy Buffett is with Frank

63
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,700
Marshall no I wish it was that no it's much more clever he would he would I don't

64
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,580
know if he would like inappropriately touch the nurse or he would just say he

65
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:07,820
go I'm David Copperfield yeah really creepy and this was like a common joke

66
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,380
of his because there's there's like a what I didn't know was a Washington Post

67
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,900
it's like second woman alleges George Bush it uses David Copperfield joke it's

68
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,600
like Jesus this guy is it mean because doesn't if you just say that and there's

69
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,520
not then some sort of like magic or sleight of hand involved and you're just

70
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,480
saying a name you could just be like he could just be it like it's as you could

71
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,300
just say I'm George grope like that doesn't mean any I mean that's boy I

72
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,300
guess he would be taught if he like touches you then or like touches your

73
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:45,180
leg mm-hmm and then that's that's the prestige I guess with that joke but if

74
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,360
they noticed then he doesn't see he didn't get away with it like a magic

75
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,380
trick yeah so he was when he was an old creep he used to reference mr.

76
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,080
Copperfield and I don't know I've never heard that joke before so maybe he made

77
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,960
that up I don't know never heard that joke before David Copperfield yeah have

78
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,860
you yeah really Scott it feels like an old bark like fly joke

79
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,380
used to hear it in the bars and the old days

80
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:24,780
okay I got it when Jason at 15 like an old bar fly already part the episode

81
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,460
where Bart you know starts running errands for the mob you would make a

82
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,840
Manhattan for all the mobsters yeah and hear them say David Copperfield well I

83
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,760
wish George had cut deeper and said like you know I don't know what number it was

84
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,900
maybe the 41st president let me take that stab like is I mean is there's I

111
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,340
trend doesn't allow it yet it's a little yeah wait it is not a lot of room for

112
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:06,500
procedure and the whole mechanism Scott you had sent the former bed bath me on

113
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,500
that hosted that Disneyland oh yeah you know temporary museum option pretty

114
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,720
quickly became like a Halloween superstore it's just called Burbank

115
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,600
Halloween yeah it was just called Burbank's not even spirit Halloween I think that's

116
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,180
usually in the abandoned Ikea well that was where because earlier in the day we

117
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,360
I don't think this was in the episode and you said though the Burbank mall is

118
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,680
really hopping these days I mean you know there's always people in there and

119
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,840
now they got that closed bed bath and beyond is a swing space and then I went

120
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,980
there later in the day I was like oh they have a Halloween store and this is

121
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,700
Jason's definition of hoppin swing space I really like that swing space now it's

122
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:54,580
not just an empty mall store again I'll reiterate I didn't say good I did not

123
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:00,800
it's been packed anytime I've been there and it's so hard to see a mall that busy

124
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,160
nowadays it's a smaller mall though smaller mall yeah well since some are

125
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,540
it's just a matter it's like every other mall got eliminated if you looked at

126
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,120
them on a map it's like all the middle ones go and then the bigger ones yeah

127
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,920
that stay just get more and more fancy and those kind of stick around I feel

128
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,740
right yeah oh yeah there I haven't been to Burbank Halloween yet I would like to

129
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:29,860
go so I'll see it's a packed right it's hopping it's a big unsorted mess so if

130
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,260
you want to hear about if we want to put Burbank Halloween if we want to put the

131
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,400
hyper local one oh yeah just spirit Halloween that's an option listeners

132
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,680
whatever you want to do for now let me read the official blurb as proposed by

133
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,100
Brad Daniels for this cartoon all-stars to the rescue the 1990 McDonald's

134
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,120
produced anti-drug video it stars such childhood heroes as Slimer Muppet babies

135
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,800
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated Alf George HW and Barbara Bush as we

136
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,740
heard and George C Scott as the villain smoke oh man so that's that's a lot I

137
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,880
don't mean to hopefully that didn't ruin anything but that's also that's exciting

138
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,360
that's like the build-up to a variety special from the 70s like we love you

139
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,140
know with Alf with and George C Scott has smoke gets you excited gets me

140
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:23,200
pumped especially because I think we all have I'm gonna assume we all have strong

141
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,980
memories of this special it's not like we had to what is this what is this

142
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,640
curio this I mean I watched this a ton of times yeah show this in school a lot

143
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,680
and that like this is okay listeners said this and I was trying to maybe it

144
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,420
happened in my school and I don't remember but I guess that's not

145
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,020
surprising true for you Jason to it like do you know was this an in-school viewed

146
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,720
special at some point it must have been not often but maybe like once yeah I

147
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,400
mean once a couple times I think I watched in school I think I've confused

148
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:01,620
the whole time that's a lot yeah I mean two maybe mm-hmm I think maybe maybe

149
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,920
only one maybe I'm like mixing up times but I've seen it I saw it more than once

150
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,340
we did not have the VHS I don't believe we ever rented it so this is something I

151
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,680
was trying to remember I didn't own it but I definitely rented it and I was

152
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,560
remember if this was a true thing somehow that it I don't know if this was

153
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,540
across the board at all video stores but if they try to arrange it to where this

154
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,300
was a free rental because it is educational and the message is so

155
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,800
important maybe that's a phantom memory but that's in my head interesting maybe

156
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,720
you got like library the library we would rent videos from the library all

157
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,340
the time and all the good ones would always be taken you know we should go

158
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,200
to like because they would have the actual video behind the box it would be

159
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,720
in a different plastic it's like a blockbuster where you would see the

160
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,080
actual box and then behind it would be the plastic whatever container that had

161
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,240
the tape in it then you're just stuck with like what's this triple tape set

162
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,120
about Yosemite what the wonders of Yosemite yeah what I want I want eek the

163
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,980
cat yeah I remember the library I went to growing up one looking back I'm

164
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,980
assuming cuz VHS was so expensive still like it cost money it was like a buck or

165
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,560
two to rent and like out here the LA and Burbank library it's free the moves are

166
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,440
free and you gotta pay at the library yeah and you're sure that was a like a

167
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,680
day or two that's weird maybe it's like a dollar library yeah that's what I'm

168
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,700
saying George Bush's America that's what that is did you ever pay money in a

169
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,540
library I don't know I don't think that's yeah I'm wrong in say it's not

170
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,280
that much money depends depends on the rules my mom wouldn't get them a lot

171
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,800
cuz she's like I'm gonna have to be back here tomorrow or the next day oh cuz

172
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,340
yeah you'd have to return it to her yeah I think that I think I remember that I remember it being like books you

173
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,820
could keep for like a week or two and VHS is it was a couple days so that makes

174
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,740
sense but yeah I wonder I mean I guess yeah that's not so crazy if it was like

175
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:08,000
a high sought-after rental mm-hmm I don't know but you could rent it you

176
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,780
could own it but the the big ticket way that they made this special available to

177
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:23,920
watch was an unprecedented multi-network takeover where on April 21st 1990 one

178
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,300
day after 420 ironically they were they avoided it's everybody's everybody's

179
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,960
coming down that's when you got a strike everybody's coming down from their

180
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,880
hangovers yeah the high is over folks so sober up and watch a team get tortured

181
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,740
by all of his sister's favorite cartoon characters but this is I mean that shows

182
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,300
you how much that this they basically they blocked off all the net there was a

183
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,300
there was a half hour there where it's it's not just the networks not just ABC

184
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,840
ABC Fox which I don't think even had a kids lineup at that point so yeah I

185
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,080
don't think so this was the first cartoon the first kids cartoon on Fox

186
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,160
possibly not only that but then you got your Superstations and your Knicks and

187
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,020
all these you know utterly removed from each other corporate interests you can't

188
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,320
it's hard to imagine this happening today yeah I think I watched it on

189
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,820
Nickelodeon if my memory is correct it might not be but I remember watching it I

190
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,300
think I Nickelodeon this is a question is like well I wonder if they re-aired it

191
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,820
but do you think like do you think you watched the early airing the original

192
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,220
airing that's a very good question I have a memory of watching it on

193
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,140
Nickelodeon and I it's hard to know because I was so little but I do

194
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,000
have memory of switching around and it being on other stations so I feel like I

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,500
did see this live I mean that's what I want to see now more than anything is

196
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,360
just to like that moment of flipping through the channels and the same stuff

197
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:57,400
is yes not so you know I think only 9-eleven is the only or January 6th

198
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:05,400
maybe I don't think Nickelodeon was covering January 6th that decision to

199
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,080
this is unprecedented do we go with it no go with our 13 of ridiculousness we

200
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,480
cannot break the ridiculousness barricade OJ verdict I think was a lot of channel

201
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,560
possibly though that was the middle of the day that was very weird in ten years

202
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,520
old fifth grade I watched it in school like all right we're still we're not

203
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,960
doing math today we are watching the Simson verdict yeah I think they will

204
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,980
TV in for that for us too I don't know yeah uh-huh I was concerned that they

205
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:45,200
wouldn't I was very I was you know studying the case using class projects to

206
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,180
do topical comedy about the Kate's all right yeah that's right I needed to know

207
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:54,680
I needed to be there when yeah interesting mm-hmm so yeah this was I do

208
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,840
I'm pretty sure I watched it live Wow Wow pretty sure do you think your mom

209
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,540
caught wind of it and like Michael there's something important happening

210
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:11,520
today I don't know I don't know I really don't know I'd like to believe that I

211
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,100
knew about it because it was the event of the year mm-hmm and that all the

212
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,340
friends were together because obviously yeah I was a fan of most of these

213
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,540
cartoons yes yeah my memory of it though and maybe I'm thinking of another like

214
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,580
crossover cartoon is that they went on a lot more adventures in this as opposed

215
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,800
to showing up and bothering some well like being busybody I've watched this in

216
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,480
the last ten years so I did remember from remember it from that but yes my

217
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:48,840
memory of it was a much more exciting well cartoon I think that's because and

218
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,940
if Jason if you're misremembering and imagining more adventures it's because

219
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,660
like the way to to baby brain everything seems bigger and what now you just see

220
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:04,400
is like essentially two elongated kind of psychedelic torture sequences yes those

221
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,920
probably as with earnest goes to splash mountain for me those probably all felt

222
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,720
like full half-hour right right odysseys like fear and loathing style terrifying

223
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,980
which I I was an easily scared kid but I don't remember being especially scared

224
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:27,500
of this it was just such a like like honestly at times like pretty impressive

225
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,880
animation and a pretty like at least just like nuts in its scope kind of piece

226
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,820
yeah I remembered Michelangelo showing up at the end because that was what I was

227
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,980
waiting for and but I remember him being involved more than he actually is in my

228
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,840
mind it was a bigger deal they kind of give him a little sequence but he's not

229
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,200
in there mixing it up with the babies so much right right he is with them he does

230
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,400
not cross paths particularly with poo I mean they're all in the song yeah he's

231
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,280
not I would have liked well we get to that but I wanted to see him an elf

232
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,960
interact more you don't maybe get a lot of the ultimate these characters are

233
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,000
meeting there's one moment that has a lot of pressure on it I feel because

234
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,640
it's like this ain't gonna happen again and we know that these two need to meet

235
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,920
and need to address the elephant in the room and that is Alf and Garfield yes

236
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,960
who likes to eat cats and Garfield a cat so you're really waiting for how do we

237
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,920
address it what do we do and it's the the way they address it is fine but it's

238
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,980
not the be-all and I'm saying there's maybe a superior Alf meets Garfield's I

239
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:53,220
threat mm-hmm there's a threat of yeah yeah join us in this anti-drug mission

240
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,120
or you're dead well he's he doesn't even know it's anti-drug he just knows we're

241
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:05,600
a piggy bank has gone missing I'll kill you if you don't join us this is a

242
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,600
financial crime he's so much more motivated than he ever is on the actual

243
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,000
else kind of lazy in general it's he also like eating cats is typically a

244
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,200
joyful thing but in this yeah it's like it's a threat to murder ripping the meat

245
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,520
off your bones you lazy shithead imagine your eyeballs in my mouth as I'm

246
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,320
chomping down on them I'm scraping the fur off that tail like sauce off

247
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:41,460
spaghetti it's always Monday when I send you to hell Garfield I will say is not

248
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,740
Alf is Alf is pretty good here even though he's threatening Garfield this I

249
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,440
know he's lazy but he's phoning it in on some of these retorts Garf I was

250
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,220
disappointed in Garfield sides of these conversations is what I'm saying but

251
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,820
don't you like but this is the Lorenzo music Garfield yeah where the race is

252
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,600
well what do you want what's what's an elevated Garfield two lasagna jokes in

253
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,700
the span of two minutes it's like there's a couple other things I might

254
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,940
challenge you and I don't know I don't remember the show very well but I might

255
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,380
guess that if you put on Garfield the show you may find two Garfield lasagna

256
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:27,420
jokes the cartoon was not such a level that also read the lasagna jokes I feel

257
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,880
like that's Garfield getting his shit in as you've said well you really got a

258
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:40,780
little it's it's a really kind of show can't do the deep cuts everybody goes

259
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,060
to get snacks and go to the bathroom he doesn't threaten to mail elf to Abu

260
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,580
Dhabi doesn't do any other ones so I'm just saying he could have thrown

261
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,300
another well these the writers of this special who seemed to be graduates of

262
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,200
they all wrote for like the love boat and Mannex and stuff some Sid and Marty

263
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:08,320
Croft bullshit that makes sense yeah some true garbage on these guys like good

264
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,320
garbage in the sense that I like started to look I have the list of oh sure but

265
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,780
I'm saying you know if you're given this assignment and you have to like quickly

266
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,600
brush up on all of children's television yeah you're probably gonna go alright

267
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,060
what are the what are the Garfield go-to's I think it's yeah well Garfield

268
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:31,120
was I guess a newer thing to them at this point I think they worked on I don't

269
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,260
understand this stuff in my day I was beatied Cecil they still like high and

270
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:42,220
low is still making those big sandwiches yes he is see cartoon all-stars so who

271
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:49,940
do we got we got I assume Dagwood I assume the gang from dog patch USA

272
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:56,560
Betty whoops dog our gang an animated version of our game I assume you couldn't

273
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,680
pay for droopy even the president United States can't get droopy yeah well they

274
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,760
wrote on a cartoon called the Fonz and the Happy Days gang oh I've here yeah

275
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,820
I've seen clips of that that's not the one where I think I have jumped to

276
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:17,440
partridge family 20 76 AD where they go to space Fonz does not go that's just a

277
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,480
I think that's just a regular one yeah we've talked about that a little bit

278
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,880
that was filmation right I think incorrectly said it was Hannah Barbera on

279
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,940
one episode okay yeah so they they they wrote on heart to heart and work in

280
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,160
Mindy it does all the cartoon mark and Mindy and the cartoon Laverne and Shirley

281
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,380
I've never even heard I didn't even know there were those maybe they're special

282
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,100
cartoons that no one is saving that nobody that's in that drawer with like

283
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,760
the you know there was like a there was a Coneheads cartoon yeah nobody really

284
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,480
maybe just a pilot that one maybe didn't yeah I don't know some of these might

285
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,780
have been it's just a special or something but yeah Laverne and Shirley

286
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,740
in the army I believe is what the this Fonz one it looks like I mean from a

287
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:02,060
sample still I'm looking at it looks like he is with like a maybe some kind of

288
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,580
witch or sorceress and there's a like a dog who clearly can talk and is about to

289
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,640
say a punchline next to the Fonz and then he's with like this might be a girl

290
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,220
he came with who's been turned to stone so I guess they aren't dealing with you

291
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,880
know like typical Wisconsin business on Fonz and the Happy Days gang is that

292
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,240
where they Milwaukee where was that?

293
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,680
Yeah I think that's right I can't

294
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,380
remember I guess that's I think that's right the one of the ones that caught

295
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,880
my eye real quick on the and these guys filmography is something called all-star

296
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,720
comedy ice review which is Hannah Barbera characters in like mascot

297
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,580
costumes on ice wow and I watched a trailer of it and it looks just I think

298
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,060
it's Sid and Marty Croft and it's just completely like shit nothing really

299
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,740
funny every one of these by the way viable candidates for the November Club

300
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:01,740
3 poll where they will all get 6% and last place yeah throw it in anything I

301
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,400
want to talk about everyone is mad it is not mad you just you've had a lot of

302
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,480
like where it takes a lot of explaining it'll be like I think like legends of

303
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:18,040
superheroes live special stunt show 1976 with that last 3% yeah and

304
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,480
somebody else suggested it I just shows it there's just yeah yeah because we all

305
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,520
have our personal pick and that we throw in yeah you can probably you can tell

306
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,240
the pattern of mics I think ice review we have threatened to do more ice

307
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,760
capades type stuff so maybe there's more with ice capades there probably is

308
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,840
anyway so these are the right our finest writers have come together for this

309
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,860
every network is showing it in terms of putting it together obviously all the

310
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:50,160
studios that all the big dogs in animation Disney Warner Brothers Deke

311
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,540
alien productions the trusted entity behind elf they all had to come together

312
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,880
to make this happen and then but then how do you event at some point it's got

313
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,480
to be like impartial parties putting it together because like the I think Disney

314
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,340
maybe had a slightly bigger role right they can't you know fully take over and

315
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:17,520
make their characters more heavy duty in it you know so who are the outside

316
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,720
parties mediating all of this you got McDonald's slash the wrong McDonald's

317
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,600
charity right and then the television Academy yes so putting this together and

318
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,660
at some point the credits change and now there's a little Emmy up top and

319
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,560
that's how you know yeah the television Academy's part of it this really seems

320
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,740
like a miracle that would get put together because of how many people were

321
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,440
involved yeah and nowadays yeah every like I would think there would be so

322
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,760
many more like qualifications or rules for all the characters and how they're

323
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,480
allowed to interact and what they're allowed to do I think so are we we are

324
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,020
now we are post Roger Rabbit so a little bit of president has been so I feel like

325
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,330
a lot of the rules just get thrown out the window knowing that this is a like a

326
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,680
presidential order I guess yeah I guess I don't know if he's they got him

327
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,040
involved I don't know if he said to do it maybe that is the pitch so they're

328
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,320
like you know like let us do give us a little more room here I don't know yeah

329
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,320
yeah maybe but it is it is crazy yeah yeah I was also curious then like from a

330
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,220
physical standpoint who put it together because if you know that also has to be

331
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,800
an impartial party you would think right because like Disney can't just do it and

332
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,000
you know or because then they hey those are the days where they're putting you

333
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,080
know hidden penises and the little mermaid like what if they take poor baby

334
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,560
Kermit and turn his weird little shaped pupils into little penises that's a good

335
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,840
point and get their little revenge on their competitors all the now they own

336
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,220
Muppet Babies they own every I was running the number they own every one of

337
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,460
these characters now I don't know if they actually own or but I don't I don't

338
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,700
actually think but the numbers have grown and probably more of these

339
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,820
characters are in the same corporate family than there they yeah no yeah I

340
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,520
don't think they actually they gained too many of these other than the Muppet

341
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,000
Babies and it drives them insane oh yeah make them crazy they look at this poster

342
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,660
and they're like why aren't they why don't I own these Bob Iger will go Bob

343
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,340
Iger will go into more debt just ruin the company further just so he can

344
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,280
acquire the Smurfs he somehow acquires the which has not existed for decades

345
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,160
weren't they involved in Deke already huh weren't they involved in D.

346
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,220
C.

347
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,300
here's here's the answer of whom made it this was made by Wang film productions

348
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:34,480
company limited in Taiwan this is a Taiwanese studio which was half owned by

349
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,140
Hanna Barbera and I don't know who on the remain nobody they owned themselves

350
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:46,300
but this was a company that took over giant workloads of massively ordered

351
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,460
Disney Warner Brothers Universal Deke show all of them yeah so because you look

352
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,600
at their filmography and it's just it's every one of the cartoons we would it's

353
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,460
everyone most of the things that these characters come for so that probably

354
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,300
gave everybody a head start that the same studio had like model sheets and

355
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,700
knew the basics of how to do these characters because it's a crate you'll

356
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,340
look at like okay they just fully did 30 episodes of Tiny Toons or 12 episodes of

357
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,700
DuckTales so I think this was the studio that was where it's like Disney TV

358
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:24,680
animation is drowning please handle some of the chip-and-dales for us yeah and so

359
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,960
they they took care of it all which then probably the issue just became like how

360
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,000
do we make all these characters not look insane next to each other and they don't

361
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,100
yeah yeah yeah mostly other than like Winnie the Pooh seems oddly small but

362
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,280
also Winnie the Pooh is justified as like a teddy bear so there's some I have

363
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,880
some issues with scale but well bring them up call out call out Wang here I

364
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,140
guess you know what I shouldn't know Alf seems small to me but I guess Alf

365
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,620
I'm trying to remember cartoon well enough cartoon might be different than

366
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,920
real Alf honestly this special is the main thing that keeps anybody

367
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,860
remembering that there was cartoon Alf cartoon is low on the top like live

368
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,760
action now it's number one I feel like Marvel Comics Alf is number two just

369
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,540
because some of those covers were funny I feel like those go around the internet

370
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,720
every now and then where's Alf's talk show with the Ed McMahon is that a is

371
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,460
that a real thing or am I hallucinating?

372
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,380
No that's real he was just circulating a clip

373
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,480
where Ed said something creepy to a woman and Alf had to correct him hmm so

374
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,040
it's actually David Copperfield yeah exactly so better joke from the old

375
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:47,120
bar flies yeah well so what about Ryan Reynolds Alf commercials that he's

376
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,640
producing well we'll have to find out yeah yeah do those exist that there's a

377
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,420
deal was struck between else new owners shout factory and Ryan Reynolds for some

378
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:04,240
ads featuring Alf for mint mogul I don't know I'm not sure or Raxam we'll see

379
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,400
which of Ryan Reynolds endeavors is Alf gonna be in the new mascot for for

380
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,940
Raxam I think that's gonna be welcomes to Raxam it's on the table the citizens

381
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:21,920
of Raxam immediately tear him apart like who's this creep so I'll also the same

382
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,820
company Wang film produced a similar sounding special called Flintstone kids

383
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,780
just say no oh have I ever seen that I was a Flintstone kids fan mm-hmm yeah I

384
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,180
don't know that I've ever seen that is it the one I know that there is a Michael

385
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:41,020
Jackson equivalent Michael Jack Stone perhaps I don't know who does maybe does

386
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:46,100
a song about say no to drugs oh interesting I don't know that I think I

387
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,960
mean unless the songs about something else maybe I'm equating a few the

388
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,900
several things I know about Flintstone kids I'm sorry listener that I'm not

389
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:59,380
sure enough about my Flintstone kids facts it would not shock me if that's

390
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,200
the case cuz I know all those kids shows had like an analog for a real-world

391
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,740
character or just a like a person or rip like when you watch it it's extremely

392
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,560
one-to-one sometimes like yeah you're rewatching Ninja Turtles or collecting

393
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,520
the toys or whatever it's like oh they just did a Robo cop in this episode oh

394
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,240
this episode is just Freddy Krueger like just like a lazy writer going I don't

395
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,960
know let's do Freddy Krueger with a different name yeah yeah let's just make

396
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,300
this Michael Jackson like whatever laziness with the Flintstones people I

397
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:34,900
don't I don't believe it okay well let's let's dive into the thing and you know

398
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,460
as we went in order here there was the George Bush intro which you heard some

399
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:46,180
of a couple things about this one is you know I've said you know I've implied

400
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,580
that this like the government you know led to this or was a presidential order

401
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,500
but I don't think that's true because you could see this internationally and

402
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,480
there were separate versions and separate intros done by the leaders of

403
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,420
many other countries with all pretty much the same format like it's kind of

404
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:11,320
always first lady and prime minister so they the prime ministers of Canada New

405
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:19,520
Zealand Australia at least you know if not more and here is Bob Hawke who was

406
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:26,460
the prime minister of Australia with his wife Hazel his extremely similar intro

407
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,200
many of your favorite characters come together in this one cartoon you

408
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:39,240
understand that drugs and alcohol can ruin your life so watch it then talk

409
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,720
about it with mum and dad and the rest of your family and your friends these are

410
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:51,240
funny characters but they have a strong and a serious message drugs are not good

411
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,040
for you these are they are funny but they won't be doing anything funny not

412
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,320
my watch why is it Hawke's watch first of all his wife is paying a kangaroo in

413
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,320
that covering it's now yeah put our hands in the power behave she hands are

414
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,760
all sticky from putting it in the pouch yeah shopping the kangaroo is a little

415
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,400
smaller baby yeah yeah the baby's crawling up her arm the covered in goo no

416
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,900
hoping your own camera why is everyone so old like everyone was just old back

417
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,660
like today our leaders today oh it's a vibrant out on camera and now Mitch

418
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:35,400
McConnell introduces drugs are there to go silent for 20 minutes the only

419
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,800
difference is I would say is that like all that those people are probably like

420
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,820
58 and they are ancient I think so I think so well also knowing how Bob Hawke

421
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:52,680
lived because I wanted to know more about Bob Hawke and you know here he is

422
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,760
but you go into his history Bob Hawke according to his Wikipedia set a world

423
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,480
record for drinking and and you look at that and like what does that mean does

424
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,820
that mean like most times most alcohol could see that's a pretty generic thing

425
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,300
to say yeah and I kept looking and what that what that means is chugging that

426
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,920
means he was like he's like that guy from the man show you know I play the

427
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,180
piano in the early days he could just the Fox oh yeah yeah uh-huh I went to

428
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,320
that guy's bar he was like so excited when he saw him on TV oh yeah there

429
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,840
were a lot of the Fox yeah no this Bob the eventual Prime Minister of Australia

430
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,300
could just like pick up two pints and just down it like it was like it was

431
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:38,420
water like superhuman level of chugging that implies that his like

432
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,720
throat's doing anything he just goes a clap and then it's gone yeah that would

433
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:47,240
explain why everyone looks so aged like yes full-throated professional drinking

434
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,520
and just smoking cigarettes all the time will aid you prematurely yes that's

435
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,280
true one of the funny things is George C Scott playing a character named smoke

436
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,300
and you just you look up George C Scott smoke and just photos of him smoking on

437
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,500
the Tonight Show so I guess it makes sense that he was smoking yeah well it

438
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,480
doesn't negate the character of smoke no it's more harder drugs I suppose they're

439
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,400
talking about but still.

440
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,540
I can't put it down for a five-minute television set.

441
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,940
Well those shows were a little longer you know he was gonna do it another guest

442
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,420
came on.

443
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,580
I'm gonna be out there for eight minutes saying I need my cigs.

444
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,820
Bob Hawke incidentally then he he got sober before he started his

445
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,720
political his big career and earnest was sober for many years did this

446
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,120
little intro to this you know so sobriety was a big part of his life and then he

447
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,360
was not the Prime Minister anymore and it was just like he just went to rugby

448
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,160
games and chugged beers again if there was ever a camera in front of him oh my

449
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,020
And everybody loved it.

450
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,520
Hooray!

451
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,340
And then he died and you know maybe some of the

452
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,000
reaction was the Prime Minister has passed but the first article I found was

453
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,360
like Bob Hawke's 11 greatest drinking moments.

454
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,280
Wow.

455
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,640
He was a champion drinker and

456
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,760
beloved for I think his obituary might be world record drinker comma Prime

457
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,300
Minister question mark.

458
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,880
He was like I can't remember.

459
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,320
Was Rob Ford the mayor?

460
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,080
Oh yeah.

461
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:12,500
Who was out of control drug-taking and stuff and he's past yes he has but his

462
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,240
brother is still in power something like that.

463
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,040
I don't know if he is also I believe a

464
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,680
terror I don't think he's like an addict.

465
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,000
Oh I don't know.

466
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
We'll have to look into that.

467
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,480
This is five times.

468
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,880
Did I already say on the show or have I just said to you guys that we tried to get him to be the

469
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,880
mayor of Moonbeam City that we reached out to Rob Ford.

470
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,460
I don't know that you have.

471
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,420
That doesn't actually seem so familiar.

472
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,160
Showrunner Tommy Blodgett, the hilarious Tommy Blodgett show got really into that idea like oh yeah that's what we got.

473
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,380
He just really like just really wanted to meet Rob Ford and they're like wouldn't that be so

474
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,100
fun if they're real and then and he's somehow out of contact in the Canadian

475
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,760
government.

476
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Wow.

477
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,080
So he reached out to the contact and then like a week later he

478
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,800
got back to him and he said on the phone and said like um so it's not a no it's

479
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,920
not a no but and then there's a lot of but and then it didn't happen but why

480
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,840
wouldn't he do it?

481
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,520
He was the sitting mayor dealing with a lot of control.

482
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,560
I well some things you got to say no to.

483
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,200
I guess.

484
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,520
Cable animated shows.

485
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:19,220
No complaints because Powers Booth ended up playing that part but I at one point

486
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,580
saw an email list of who we were talking about.

487
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,380
So okay Rob Ford passed who else

488
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,100
do we get and somewhere in the ideas that were batted around was Donald

489
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,680
Trump.

490
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,360
Oh wow.

491
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,420
2014 remember he'd only done a lot of the bad stuff.

492
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:32,920
Right right.

493
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,560
We didn't pursue it it was just funny at some point I looked at Donald Trump in my

494
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,100
emails and I was like oh my god what if we'd done that.

495
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,960
Then that could have

496
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,260
happened.

497
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,620
He would have done that I think.

498
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,700
He would have insisted on being on it

499
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,700
maybe we would have kept him busier and he would have kept his nose out of politics.

500
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,160
Right.

501
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,060
Should have asked him.

502
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,880
Should have asked him.

503
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,380
Anyways George Bush is the

504
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,000
main thing to talk about here and this is it doesn't make me remember.

505
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,320
I was like

506
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,320
isn't there some story like I was trying to remember the other George Bush drug

507
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,940
stuff.

508
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,880
Do you remember the the baggie of crack?

509
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,460
Do you know about the baggie of crack?

510
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,960
Oh that they bought outside the White House.

511
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:09,380
Yes.

512
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,240
Quote unquote we bought this outside the White House.

513
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,920
Seven months before this he went on TV and said this is a baggie of crack that

514
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,900
was purchased just feet away from the White House and the whole thing was that

515
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,660
they had that idea to do that.

516
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,420
Okay so just like go find some crack and whoever

517
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,660
is doing this is like you can't do that.

518
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,380
It's gonna find crack.

519
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
You know it's

520
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,540
alright we have busted somebody like four blocks from here can we give you

521
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:36,780
that?

522
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,980
No no no it's got to be the block or it's gonna be the park next to the

523
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,460
White House.

524
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,440
So they had a guy that they were tailing and they were like they

525
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,320
already done several rounds of fine crack from not arresting him.

526
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:49,760
Right.

527
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,940
So just like hey alright we're ready for our next we just just

528
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,240
finished it up ready for our next round of crack please.

529
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,240
Would you mind this time

530
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,580
giving it to us at Lafayette Park?

531
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,900
What's that?

532
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,740
The park next to the White House.

533
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,860
What's that?

534
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,900
The guy literally said on the phone what the fuck is the White House?

535
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,360
Sure.

536
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,680
Guy who lives in Washington DC and then they explained it to him a little more

537
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,740
and he was like oh you mean where Reagan lives.

538
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,040
So then they arranged this fake

539
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,940
thing so that he can do it on TV but it's entirely fictionalized and then

540
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,620
like okay he's going live on TV what if he brings that up and then that guy

541
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,520
sees it and then he gets the jump on us and leaves town.

542
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,700
He might see the address

543
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,360
and see George Bush talking about crack bought in that park and then and then of

544
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,580
course that did not happen because he's not watching a president.

545
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,880
He doesn't know who the president is.

546
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,100
He's not gonna watch the live presidential address.

547
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,660
He might know we illegally entrapped him you know.

548
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:53,420
Then what if he sees it and knows that we did something illegal and sues us.

549
00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:00,000
No the strangest that what a like weird bungled like burn after reading dopey

550
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,440
guys kind of thing to do.

551
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,060
Yeah.

552
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,580
The fake drug bust.

553
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,720
Also is that guy a CIA asset?

554
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:24,600
Because that's the thing I'm watching this like wait a lot of some of the crack it's been proven at this point was sold by the government like that was sure they're double dipping on this special they're doing don't say no and it's like well wait a minute you flooded cities.

555
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,680
You think elf knows that?

556
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,900
Elf doesn't know that.

557
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,620
Elfusco doesn't know anything about that.

558
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,220
Yeah.

559
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,680
Yeah.

560
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,060
So it's really.

561
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,700
What do you need?

562
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,540
Can I help?

563
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,380
I'm doing a personal appearance.

564
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,020
I'm playing a mall in Ohio.

565
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,040
I can hide some drugs and inside elf.

566
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,260
Run a quick deal before I go into the mall.

567
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,120
We've got to fund the Contras.

568
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,660
We've got to fund.

569
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,740
Fusco was an asset.

570
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,920
A CIA asset.

571
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,440
All of elf.

572
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah.

573
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,440
We need so if there can be a government asset that confuses America entirely.

574
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:02,900
Yeah.

575
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,540
Why does this exist?

576
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,460
Why did they do it?

577
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,980
It's like okay we elf worked in the 80s but we need we need like the QAnon shaman.

578
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,600
Yeah.

579
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,900
We need this guy.

580
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,820
The war on drugs in general is like an unmitigated disaster.

581
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,000
It's a tremendous waste of money.

582
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:21,520
Yes.

583
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:25,340
All the programs the dare program all of it seemingly.

584
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:25,840
Which is now.

585
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,040
It's still around.

586
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,720
It's still around but more focused on bullying I believe.

587
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,360
Okay.

588
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,880
They don't care about.

589
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,580
I mean weed's legal in like a lot of the country now.

590
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:36,820
Yeah.

591
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,280
And that's what poor.

592
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:46,740
That's what Michael is just you know hooked on this dirt weed that he's getting in arcades and behind park toilets.

593
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,960
Well he gets a little harder.

594
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,500
He gets tempted by the harder stuff.

595
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:49,760
He gets a little hard.

596
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,500
We'll look at what's in his box here.

597
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:52,580
Yeah.

598
00:43:52,580 --> 00:44:08,800
But that's the okay so let's now that George Bush has been introduced the our protagonists Michael a troubled teen and his little sister Corey who is getting concerned about him because he's been very moody and erratic.

599
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,120
Yeah.

600
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:16,120
And the inciting incident is that his her piggy bank has been broken into.

601
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,780
And or is about to be stolen.

602
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,440
It was stolen.

603
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,100
Yeah.

604
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,260
It's gone.

605
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,940
That's one of the items in her room that's not already shaped like one of the cartoon characters who will appear in it.

606
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:33,300
But she's still asleep and in sort of a proto Toy Story scenario.

607
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,740
Yeah.

608
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:43,140
The various the cartoon characters represented in her room start to come to life and are worried about what's happening to this family.

609
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,820
Some are on posters.

610
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,260
Some are you know is what baby Kermit is an alarm clock.

611
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,760
Alphys or excuse me Garfield is a lamp.

612
00:44:53,260 --> 00:45:00,600
And then and then ultimately they couldn't figure out one for Slimer and he just manifests in the room.

613
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,860
Ghosty ghosty comes and comes to the wall.

614
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,340
Yeah.

615
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,760
Not around a lot.

616
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,220
Right.

617
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,080
Like you see him beginning and not.

618
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,420
Doesn't doesn't drive the story.

619
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,580
I feel smurfs are kind of bailed on pretty quickly.

620
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,580
Muppet babies really get a lot of time to shine.

621
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,740
I'd say they're driving it.

622
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,500
Let's get to let's get the babies handling this drug mess.

623
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,580
They are going to get this kid the worst trip of his life.

624
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:44,900
But so this the Michael and Corey scenario she's kind of like a little she's a little bit like goody two shoes and he is he's smoking some weed so he's really angry and looks like shit.

625
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:52,980
He's just getting he's gotten so action from presumably two weeks of occasional weed use.

626
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,840
Yeah yeah he's on death's door.

627
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:05,200
If you if you buy the animation you know that the the the box where he keeps his stash is opened up and this is something I wanted to show you guys.

628
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,420
Yeah I have the box.

629
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,040
OK.

630
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,380
Yeah.

631
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,180
We both noted this.

632
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:08,520
OK.

633
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,440
So this is we all stare at it.

634
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,420
Yeah this gets put in front of Alvin and the Chipmunks who are hiding under the bed.

635
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,980
Because Simon can serve as like the know it all right and know what what the things are.

636
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:27,480
So we see some some real brown joints and then we see a rolled up.

637
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,800
What's the rolled up tan thing.

638
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,200
This is Dr.

639
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:32,840
Jason about.

640
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,320
Well I don't know.

641
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,940
I thought those looked like coconuts to me.

642
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,500
Can you show me the picture again.

643
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah I.

644
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,540
Yeah I don't.

645
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,420
What is it.

646
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,320
I don't know.

647
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:53,480
Even the blunt I was like is that rope is he is that like rubber is he doing heroin.

648
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,300
Is it.

649
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,860
It's to tie his arm off.

650
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,440
There's a heroin illusion is it in there.

651
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,240
I think so.

652
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,460
Is that like maybe that's just hemp he's gonna make a bracelet out of.

653
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,000
That's that's music.

654
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Well that's that's that's that's right.

655
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:08,460
Right.

656
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:08,660
Right.

657
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:08,900
Yeah.

658
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,880
They don't approve that either.

659
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,260
I think it's rolling papers matches.

660
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,280
Maybe that's a grinder.

661
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,880
What's the blue thing.

662
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,400
That might be a grinder.

663
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,820
That's a grinder.

664
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,180
Oh in my mind it was like a bag of cocaine.

665
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,640
The blue thing.

666
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,420
I guess not.

667
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,060
I guess not.

668
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,740
I don't I don't know.

669
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,700
It looks like a miniature surfboard.

670
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,440
Yeah it does look like I'm really I'm really stumped by that.

671
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,100
Yeah.

672
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,000
I don't know.

673
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,340
I don't know.

674
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:34,960
I guess they didn't.

675
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,420
Grinder is to.

676
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,940
Here's a is a real amateur question.

677
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,260
Grinders to grind up the weed.

678
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:41,900
Yeah.

679
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:42,580
Yeah.

680
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,820
Put it in a flower.

681
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,500
You got to grind it up.

682
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:45,840
OK.

683
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,840
You get that sticky icky flower.

684
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,520
You want to grind it up into a big old.

685
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,660
Well but you could.

686
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:52,820
Yeah.

687
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:53,320
You can put it in a bowl.

688
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,560
You can put it in a pipe.

689
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,200
Yeah.

690
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,400
Or the are the black.

691
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,320
The brown thing supposed to be blunt blunt.

692
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,020
Maybe.

693
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,600
OK.

694
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,800
Yeah I don't know.

695
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,920
I think that's correct.

696
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,500
Yes.

697
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,020
I'm stumped by the blue.

698
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,740
Don't know.

699
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,940
We'll post a photo.

700
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,020
Listeners you can decide.

701
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,120
Is it the blue meth from Breaking Bad.

702
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:10,920
If any.

703
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,680
They invented it.

704
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,160
They thought of their blue meth.

705
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:15,700
Yeah.

706
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:15,760
Yeah.

707
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,520
Listeners we'll post a photo.

708
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:25,660
And you know say if you say if you know what these items are and it's not so that we can nirk you out to the government.

709
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,040
Yeah.

710
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,440
All right.

711
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,100
Really isn't.

712
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,380
We love that there's drug listeners in this show.

713
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,700
We embrace it and accept it and we will not be reporting you.

714
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:39,340
One of the hosts may have smoked a little and then watched this half of the special.

715
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:39,980
No.

716
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:40,860
Really.

717
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:41,920
No.

718
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,500
Well have a bit because I was just like frantically writing and I was like there's too many things.

719
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,880
There's too much going on.

720
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,680
You had to blaze up.

721
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,480
Yeah.

722
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,200
Wow.

723
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:52,820
Different.

724
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,360
You've been blazing a blast lately.

725
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,140
Yeah.

726
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:55,560
Yeah.

727
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,440
You made us take big old blunt away from you.

728
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,380
Now we can give it back.

729
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:58,700
Right.

730
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,220
I just found you know I'm packing up to move.

731
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:08,620
So I just found a little nub in in like a tube behind behind your bed in the corner.

732
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,560
In a pile of cobwebs.

733
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:11,320
In my box.

734
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,520
In your box.

735
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,600
You have a box.

736
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,300
You watched the box show when you were a kid and now you're a box user.

737
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,060
Coconut bundle under under.

738
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,160
You've got coconut.

739
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,240
You're shaving coconuts and putting them into it into a blunt.

740
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,300
Ikea Tupperware things that BPA free.

741
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,920
We're all big on BPA free.

742
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,960
A few years ago.

743
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,640
You know the box under my bed does have a little miniature surfboard in it for my figures.

744
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,900
Could put Michelangelo on.

745
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,380
I absolutely have a Michelangelo surfboard.

746
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:48,160
What did you say you buy for like accessories and heads and arms and some of the tackle box or a sewing kit.

747
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,060
More of a sewing kit.

748
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,900
I have four different little plastic boxes full with heads and hands and accessories.

749
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,060
Yeah.

750
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,480
Their first.

751
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,420
I think it's for sewing.

752
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,480
You're going to have to send me one of those.

753
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,020
Oh.

754
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,380
Because you have a lot of little accessories.

755
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:01,220
Yeah.

756
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:01,620
Yeah.

757
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:01,880
Yeah.

758
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,940
You got to have them to switch them in and out.

759
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,000
The cartoon all stars in your hat that come to life in your house.

760
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,700
Just just the introductions is going to take.

761
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,160
Oh my god.

762
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:11,860
Four hours.

763
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,000
It's going to be like what's happening.

764
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,660
I don't know.

765
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,940
Other Michelangelo.

766
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:16,800
What do you think.

767
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,020
Third Michelangelo.

768
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,800
What do you think.

769
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,180
If I could wait in here.

770
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,080
Oh it's the entire cast of Bucky O'Hare.

771
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:31,340
It's going to be like that Avengers endgame scene with all the portals and it just takes forever.

772
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,260
And it's every character salute each other.

773
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:40,440
50 Michelangelo animated Laverne and Shirley animated Alice for the Brady Bunch.

774
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,460
I have an elf.

775
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,580
I have an animated elf.

776
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,800
Neck and Mane animated elf.

777
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,260
Wow.

778
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:45,420
Wow.

779
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:45,740
OK.

780
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,400
So he gets in there like like oh no what's in this box.

781
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,180
I think it might.

782
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:50,920
I think

783
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,560
this we aren't in cartoon land anymore.

784
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,620
Then somebody looks.

785
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,260
No I think that's.

786
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,220
Oh wait that's an extra head for me.

787
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,360
Never mind.

788
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:00,980
He's clean.

789
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,600
It's just some CBD gummies from a gas station.

790
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,740
They're legal in all 50 states.

791
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,480
He hasn't taken one in nine years.

792
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,700
These are much expired.

793
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,200
Petrified CBD gummies.

794
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,900
I do have things like that where it's just like I tried one a decade ago and I'm like

795
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,640
well maybe we'll try another one in another 10 years.

796
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:29,160
Well yeah I've thrown stuff out like that because years ago when it was just medicinal in California.

797
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:37,720
Places would just give you like free stuff when you checked out like free little mini cookies or gummies or whatever.

798
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,660
You have those still.

799
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,440
No I've thrown them out over the years because they get classified.

800
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,320
Well yeah you don't want to keep a petrified.

801
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,040
Yeah.

802
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,700
Cookie can't be kept too long.

803
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:53,900
OK so the the cartoon all stars who are starting to appear know that something is amiss.

804
00:51:54,220 --> 00:52:03,700
It's it's definitely an odd moment disturbed maybe a disturbing moment you might say to hear Simon the chipmunk referred to marijuana.

805
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,660
Yeah.

806
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,880
There's something strange.

807
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,440
It's weird to think about any of these

808
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,560
saying what's that smell.

809
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:16,940
I also noted that the chipmunks have especially funny dialogue because they have to directly address the drugs.

810
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:17,700
Yeah.

811
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:24,500
Which again I think would not happen now for a lot of these cartoons like you have to have like a human character say the drugs.

812
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,020
Yeah they wouldn't put these words in the mouth.

813
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,180
Yeah you couldn't do that.

814
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,040
Probably.

815
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:35,140
And I human characters teams say they're their teams wouldn't let them be filmed.

816
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,080
What do you mean.

817
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,340
You know saying that like

818
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,700
agents and managers.

819
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,340
The cartoons agents and managers.

820
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,920
No no the real life people.

821
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,960
It's like well we can't have Olivia Rodrigo say that.

822
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,400
Yes that's true.

823
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,420
There's no one older now.

824
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,320
She's older now.

825
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,780
But I know I'm listening to the album.

826
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:51,380
Yeah.

827
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,180
I'm listening.

828
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,140
I forget the name of it.

829
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,020
I'm listening to it.

830
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:54,360
I'm listening to Olivia.

831
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,240
Pretty cool.

832
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,460
Yeah.

833
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,100
I'm listening to it.

834
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:56,420
Yeah.

835
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,900
Assuming that's still popular when my daughter's grown up.

836
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,560
I'll be fine.

837
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,080
Yeah yeah.

838
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,420
It'll be real popular.

839
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:02,780
Yeah.

840
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,140
So I will say this.

841
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:20,820
Did you have when you I haven't watched this in many years but I watched it and I would like I almost immediately would start ranking the cartoons of like who I like and I was like hey these guys and then like oh I don't like the Smurfs showed up and I went I don't think I like the Smurfs and then the chipmunk showed up and I went I love the chipmunks.

842
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:21,580
I don't know why.

843
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,620
I really liked that chipmunks 80s show.

844
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:24,780
Yes.

845
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,980
That's the feeling I like the movie.

846
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,360
Yeah.

847
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,940
I liked it a little rock plays when they show up.

848
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,500
I really because I haven't seen the chipmunks.

849
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,780
I've seen some of these other characters more recently but I have not seen the chipmunks and I've not seen the Smurfs in a while and I was like the Smurfs.

850
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,220
We already generationally were not primed.

851
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:46,080
They were like a little before those differences make a big difference in what what your tunes you like.

852
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,380
But yeah I saw the chipmunks and I was like I love these chipmunks.

853
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,540
I totally do too.

854
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,240
I know I love who they chose.

855
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,480
Let me just say is it all my favorite characters.

856
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:54,760
Not necessarily.

857
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,040
But I really loved the chipmunks cartoon.

858
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,480
I loved Muppet Babies.

859
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,420
I loved that Winnie the Pooh cartoon.

860
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,540
I love that song.

861
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,940
I yeah I don't know.

862
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,760
So we it's a it's a good assortment.

863
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:14,620
It's not necessarily like the top star every one of these entities but there it's good ones.

864
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,200
Yes it's it's mostly I mostly like everybody.

865
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:17,700
Yeah.

866
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,280
I'm dogging on the Smurfs.

867
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,540
I loved the Muppet Babies.

868
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,440
It would air in reruns.

869
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:33,800
On Nickelodeon I partially learned the tell time because the Muppet Babies were on it either 10 or 1030 a.

870
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,620
m.

871
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,240
Secret tell between two times.

872
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,320
And that appointment TV for me.

873
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:38,860
You know.

874
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,680
Yeah I know it's a it's a good lineup.

875
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:50,860
I mean you also then because of that get like some of the great voice actors obviously.

876
00:54:51,780 --> 00:55:05,280
And something that's cool about it is that you know because some of those people voiced a ton of characters you get they like will do multiples crossing over in not their company boundaries.

877
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,620
So like Roosie Taylor voice of many is Huey Dewey and Louie and Baby Gonzo.

878
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:15,580
So I like that that she gets to like hop between her.

879
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,620
I'm amazed that Jim Cummings is only poo and tigger.

880
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:24,380
It's surprising that you don't end up with another Cummings somewhere because he did so many.

881
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:29,180
Yeah yeah I had the same thought I was like oh he probably did another but yeah like tons of these.

882
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:29,580
Yes.

883
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:29,860
Right.

884
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,480
And then Mel Blanket just died.

885
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,480
So he would this is one of the first non Mel Blank.

886
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:36,640
Yes.

887
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,380
Jeff Bergman is both of them I think is to bug Zandaffi.

888
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:48,180
Did you know that all of the chipmunks are at this point in time are done between two people who are husband and wife.

889
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,600
I didn't know that it's the site.

890
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,280
This is one much of a family business.

891
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,260
The chipmunks are.

892
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,180
It's Ross Bagdasarian Jr.

893
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,240
His father started the whole thing and then Janice Carmen Bagdasarian.

894
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:07,300
So Elvin Ross is Alvin and Simon Janice's Theodore.

895
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,320
That's funny.

896
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:08,880
Yes.

897
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:09,460
So Alvin.

898
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,140
So always remember this.

899
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,480
The chipmunks are married when you're the three chipmunk stock.

900
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,780
They are all three married.

901
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,660
That's funny.

902
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,600
And they're pitched up right.

903
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,040
I think.

904
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,500
Yeah there's no way they're not.

905
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:22,460
Yeah yeah.

906
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,360
That's always been the case.

907
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:28,360
I was almost like oh a man is two of them and a woman is one of them.

908
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:28,720
Yeah.

909
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,520
And that's what the weirdest thing about getting like known actors to play the chipmunks in those recent movies.

910
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,240
We were like they're pitching them up.

911
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,680
What waste of tears.

912
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:37,380
Yes.

913
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,840
Like it's got to be Amy Poehler.

914
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:40,600
Yeah.

915
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,820
It's like Justin Long is one of the chipmunks.

916
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:43,260
I think.

917
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,760
And you're like Jesse McCarty.

918
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,680
I can't.

919
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,220
I don't know.

920
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,880
I feel like these voices are better than any time.

921
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,120
I haven't really seen the full movies.

922
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,700
But any time I hear them I go well these voices are actually more.

923
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,980
There's really zero reason in a lot of cases too.

924
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:08,980
And you like sometimes when they just go with the like Optimus Prime in the movies like when they made that Christopher Robin movie and it's just Jim coming like they didn't you know.

925
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,300
Yeah.

926
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,960
It didn't need to be Seth Rogen as Winnie the Pooh for no apparent reason.

927
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,740
It's probably a fight to keep Jim coming.

928
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,420
Doing that.

929
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,360
I'm sure I'm sure in all of these cases.

930
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,060
Yeah.

931
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,120
No I don't know.

932
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:30,040
I show me the data that shows that anybody's going to like the kids are going to big animated movies because of a famous person because of because of a star their parents like.

933
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:30,740
Yeah.

934
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,680
Well did.

935
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,060
How much did it help that Zendaya was Michi.

936
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,920
How much did that impact the bottom line of Michi.

937
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,500
Well I guess the viral marketing the video acted as viral marketing.

938
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,040
Maybe that actually did.

939
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,860
It was a comedian who had nothing to do with any of it.

940
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,160
Yeah.

941
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,400
So maybe that actually did work.

942
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,000
But it wasn't directly.

943
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,280
Let me ask you a question.

944
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,280
What is the name of that movie.

945
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,080
Do not know.

946
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:54,720
Yeah.

947
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,140
I don't either.

948
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,040
I don't know what the movie where Zendaya is Michi is.

949
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,320
I don't know.

950
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:58,700
Yeah.

951
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,720
That's one of those Nimgaloo kind of like I mean I can now it took.

952
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:09,820
But I watched like a half hour of the Nimgaloo movie before learning it was epic and probably was years before I looked it up.

953
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,580
Yeah.

954
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,440
What was that movie.

955
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:12,600
Nimgaloo.

956
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:13,880
Love Nimgaloo.

957
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,620
Nimgaloo should be.

958
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,840
We'll discuss at the end what our own cult cartoon all stars would be.

959
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,220
And Nimgaloo I think is involved.

960
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,440
Whoa dude you can't do drugs.

961
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:29,540
I would never do drugs and my the guy doing my voice would never do copious amounts of drugs.

962
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,700
Everyone making this or not.

963
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,580
They don't spend the 80s combining uppers and downers.

964
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:42,100
It's also funny from this perspective to go like well thank you George H.

965
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,400
W.

966
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,940
Bush for keeping your children away from alcohol.

967
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,720
Drugs I don't know.

968
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,520
I was like does it ever confirmed the W.

969
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,820
That one's not really cocaine.

970
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,200
I think it's not officially official official.

971
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,060
I mean it sounds right to me.

972
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,100
I was trying to look into this.

973
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:02,720
I don't know.

974
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,360
I think it's like a confirmation where he's like yeah I used to have a cocaine problem or something.

975
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:06,300
Yeah.

976
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:06,420
Yeah.

977
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:14,060
I think it slipped out like that one time where he said that where he was giving that speech and like the Iraq War was a travesty of justice.

978
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,540
There's like a wedding video of him like hammered.

979
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,640
I'm trying to remember but I don't know if he seemed coked up on that one.

980
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,200
Anyway I think he did cocaine.

981
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:27,580
It seems right.

982
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,420
I'm just saying it's not maybe officially official.

983
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:37,860
There are other voice actor Michael Trouble Teen Michael voice of Max Goof and Binks the Cat Jason Marsden.

984
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:42,160
Oh my god TGIF perennial on every single one of those shows.

985
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:42,560
Yeah.

986
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,420
Always.

987
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,680
And he's good.

988
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,480
He's always good.

989
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:45,880
Yeah.

990
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,700
Good noise voice roles.

991
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,660
OK.

992
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,620
So we've we've established the gang.

993
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:56,420
The gang's all aligned and now they get a little bit more information.

994
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:07,220
They see that Michael has broken open the piggy bank broken his trust with his sister and he is going off to use his twenty dollars and quarters to go buy more drugs.

995
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:17,200
Alf declares that he's on a one way ticket to Nowheresville and they all jump out the window and go to town.

996
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:17,740
All right.

997
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:21,360
Let's go solve this except for Winnie the Pooh.

998
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,480
Just a moment that I've always loved that they are right.

999
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,040
Let's go down the banister.

1000
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:32,000
And then but the sweet innocent Winnie the Pooh just waves.

1001
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:32,720
Yes.

1002
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,120
This coward.

1003
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,700
He's Gary.

1004
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,580
He's lazy too.

1005
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:43,060
He's the one he's the only one who listened to like the lessons of like joke.

1006
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,100
Don't jump out of a goddamn window.

1007
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,620
You think that you think Pooh is rational.

1008
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,480
Who always makes weird decisions.

1009
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,120
That's true.

1010
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:51,500
Yeah.

1011
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,720
He's probably the biggest narc in this one.

1012
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,160
Like he breaks the rules first.

1013
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:05,260
He but if you I don't know if there's rules I don't know if this is Toy Story but he just for a while they're sneaking around like we can't let you know that we all talk.

1014
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:10,980
And then at some point like Cory you can talk.

1015
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,440
Yes of course I can talk.

1016
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,760
They just got to get rid of that.

1017
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:14,480
Yeah.

1018
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,860
I'm going to be able to drive this story.

1019
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,460
We got too much business to have the characters not talk.

1020
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,080
Deadlines.

1021
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:27,320
Right before this I think is when there was a moment I got hopeful because I hadn't looked up who who wrote this yet before when I was watching it.

1022
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,060
There's a line that I got hopeful that Bruce Philanche was involved.

1023
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,180
But that was not the case.

1024
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:42,420
It was when Alf when they're talking about Michael stealing money from his sister and also something along the lines of like this never happened to Wally and the beef.

1025
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,140
And I was like what is that for eight year olds.

1026
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,560
Now I knew what that was as an eight year old but an average eight year old do they know they'll leave it to be of a reference.

1027
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,860
And I was like I wonder if it's a couple of Lange.

1028
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:54,560
Oh please.

1029
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:54,940
Yeah.

1030
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:55,080
Yeah.

1031
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,340
And it was not.

1032
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:05,160
As I said I think I've said that my parents bought the home that I was born in that the beef was born that it's where they bought it from Jerry Mathers.

1033
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:11,920
So I knew the beef but not every child would have the luxury of growing up being born into the home.

1034
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,320
The Jerry Mathers.

1035
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,640
Did you know the Wally and the beef reference at this point.

1036
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:24,380
I knew leave it to be where it's not syndicated really where I grew up.

1037
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:24,780
I think it was.

1038
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,140
Well it was on Nick at night.

1039
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,020
That's what I watched.

1040
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,540
It wasn't like syndicated.

1041
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:35,300
I mean I thought it then I knew it as a reference in sitcoms or movies.

1042
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,840
I knew it as a reference.

1043
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,160
There'd be a little parody.

1044
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:38,620
Yeah.

1045
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:38,840
Yeah.

1046
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:43,600
I mean I understand that this was commonly parodied well into the 90s.

1047
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,040
Yeah.

1048
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:44,500
Sure.

1049
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,480
That was already 25 years 30 years old.

1050
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,000
Yeah.

1051
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,080
So yeah.

1052
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,840
But I was hopeful that was the Lange or something but it was not.

1053
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:51,300
Yeah.

1054
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:51,840
Yeah.

1055
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,320
No it was a different writers on everything he worked on in the 70s.

1056
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:56,840
Yes.

1057
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,080
Yes.

1058
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,200
They crossed paths though.

1059
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,260
I'm so sans poo.

1060
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:07,820
They all head out to keep an eye on Michael who goes to a bad kids arcade and he meets this.

1061
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:17,780
And this is like this is maybe something where they painted a false picture of fat when drugs are presented to you for the first time in your life.

1062
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:23,240
It is going to be the five bad scowling kids.

1063
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,660
It will not be friends of yours happily like hey you want to.

1064
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,840
It's going to be like hey.

1065
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:35,320
So like it's going to be for some reason people are going to get their rocks off on seducing you in this.

1066
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:36,720
Do it.

1067
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:47,320
Like that's I think like you know I see the benefit in I don't think it's like so crazy and to like make a thing about keeping kids away from drugs.

1068
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:53,240
However I think the lack of realism and how it will manifest is well odd.

1069
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,080
It is odd.

1070
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,720
It's I was saying this the other day.

1071
01:03:55,740 --> 01:04:01,220
We're like you want to like giving the full nuanced picture to like a child.

1072
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,280
It's sort of impossible.

1073
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,460
Doesn't really work.

1074
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,900
I I also on them for that reason.

1075
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:06,320
Yes.

1076
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:16,420
But then that also like once kids realize the reality of things where it's like oh yeah like if you if you drink beer it feels good and that you could do it in my.

1077
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:23,420
Like there's no way to actually give an eight year old that weird like well everything in moderation or milder stuff in moderation.

1078
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:29,500
Well this is this is my question is like is this is it bad that this was shown to us.

1079
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:38,220
I don't have a good answer because anything all my fear came from my family everything that I do regardless of what Michelangelo.

1080
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,720
Yeah this didn't make much of an impact on me.

1081
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:48,320
I don't think because everything I was afraid of was because I was made to be afraid of everything via my mother.

1082
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:54,320
So cartoon all stars help you say no to tissue beds for your ghost busters.

1083
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:01,140
Yeah yeah don't put a poster over your bed it'll suffocate you in the middle of the night.

1084
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,680
Let's not even talk about tax.

1085
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,440
To tax you got two eyes.

1086
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,140
Do you want to vote down or not.

1087
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:21,100
Yeah so yeah it's a good question and I don't really know I don't really know how to address that I don't know what I would do if I was president to try to keep kids away from drugs.

1088
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:34,240
I remember thinking Darryl was silly in fourth and fifth grade and I remember thinking there was one kid on drugs in fifth grade because his brother I think was dealing drugs and we kind of knew it in a way because he was like something was wrong.

1089
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,660
Something was odd about it.

1090
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,040
We're like he passed he passed there.

1091
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,560
Like what.

1092
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,220
So so yeah I don't know.

1093
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:52,940
It wasn't particularly hard like there usually where I grew up it was an after school activity so you didn't have to do it or it was assembly.

1094
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:56,000
So you're like oh nice don't do class today.

1095
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:01,240
I definitely remember a cop with a gun in my in my classroom.

1096
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:01,760
We had a cop with a gun.

1097
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,260
Definitely it was I think it was not.

1098
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:03,960
Yeah there was.

1099
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:11,640
Well definitely now but even back then like too many cops with guns in school.

1100
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,720
Nowadays it's like fucking the war came home.

1101
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,960
You know now it's like everyone's fully you have to have a police force in each school.

1102
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:28,600
But I feel like only just now they're barely explaining like well a lot of this stuff is poverty or systemic issues.

1103
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,560
You know I don't know.

1104
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:34,140
Do kids learn about that or do they get it at college like we did.

1105
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:34,960
Yeah I don't know.

1106
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,640
I don't think that stuff would play in cartoon all stars to the rescue ultimately.

1107
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,780
Is it just do you just not do this.

1108
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:43,660
Yeah.

1109
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,500
I don't know.

1110
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:50,300
I mean I guess just a blanket maybe if a kid is like is it good to do drugs.

1111
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,800
And they were like no one's ever said it yes or no.

1112
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:59,140
I guess if they see it and then they experience it on the street in the street they might say no.

1113
01:06:59,140 --> 01:06:59,820
I don't want to do.

1114
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:00,420
I don't know.

1115
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,540
Maybe it's just yeah just tell them it's bad.

1116
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,320
And then I.

1117
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:10,360
Well we get a couple people that face this as parents and I feel like stresses me out at some point.

1118
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:19,640
Maybe the knee jerk might be to add like for sake of ease early on say no don't do drugs and then shift your reality like OK.

1119
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,780
You know you just got to be careful with that stuff and don't go over.

1120
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,580
But you know you get it nuanced as you go.

1121
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,820
Yeah I think that's but I don't think you can do nuance.

1122
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,320
I agree that age.

1123
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,300
No no no no I don't think so.

1124
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:37,960
But I don't remember any situations when I was very young even when I was like a teenager where I'd be offered drugs.

1125
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:47,220
I feel like the stuff that friends when like would act out quote unquote act out it was usually petty like shoplifting.

1126
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:53,320
It was like anything can get out of CVS with some stuff or smoking cigarettes.

1127
01:07:53,860 --> 01:08:00,420
So were you somebody who's like Jason you want to get in on this we're going to go hit up too much dork five.

1128
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,820
So you didn't ever.

1129
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:09,680
And even like at 14 I was like why are you stealing like three dollar makeup from CV.

1130
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:18,940
I feel like there's no way I'm taking three dollars of product away from CVS unless I earned it with a coupon weekly.

1131
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,980
I have not been getting my coupons.

1132
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,000
Give me like a 25 percent off which I don't like as much.

1133
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:32,540
I feel like a lot of the women I grew up with like inevitably like well I just want to fucking I don't have money for I'm just going to steal makeup.

1134
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:33,820
I can get away with it.

1135
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:34,700
They don't pay attention.

1136
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,940
So girls were stealing makeup from stealing makeup or smoking behind.

1137
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:41,020
Well you got a platform now give us some names.

1138
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:42,780
No.

1139
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,420
Yeah sell them out.

1140
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,560
It's fine to pay wall.

1141
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:52,400
I mean like in high school they should be behind two walls.

1142
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,020
And several more to they pay their debt.

1143
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:56,540
Isn't it.

1144
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,540
Would be good.

1145
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:12,100
I was definitely not cool enough to go to the parties where people were drinking or it be like a high school graduation party and someone would be graduating standing there drinking a Bud Light next to their dad because they're like I don't know we live here.

1146
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:12,900
I don't care.

1147
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,140
You can do it here.

1148
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:16,740
As long as I can see you.

1149
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,660
Yeah yeah yeah no one of the strangest like if you're curious just do it here.

1150
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:25,300
Well no I'm not going to get drunk with you.

1151
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,400
That's not something I'm interested in.

1152
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:28,820
That's a good way.

1153
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,000
That's a very good deterrent.

1154
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,580
That's maybe the best deterrent statement.

1155
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,160
Just do some drinking with your dad.

1156
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,020
The best deterrent I think I was like 10 11.

1157
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:44,280
I was allowed at SIP of course light which I still think is disgusting.

1158
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:44,680
Yeah.

1159
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:53,420
And then at some point a sip of the wine that would be in the house which is white Zinfandel which is also nasty.

1160
01:09:53,880 --> 01:10:10,940
Yes I was I got thrown if you can imagine me I got thrown off the white wine course for a long time because I snuck some of my parents to Lano said 18 and I'm going to steal some of wine and I like it was so horrendous.

1161
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:18,240
I just I spit it out immediately since I realized probably the wine terrible wine and to not chilled my parents.

1162
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:18,700
Oh yeah.

1163
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,720
Still don't they still just white wine.

1164
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,100
They don't buy ice cube bar.

1165
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,360
It's probably been there for like two months.

1166
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,340
I didn't learn it from them.

1167
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:29,980
Wow.

1168
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:30,940
OK.

1169
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:31,660
Yeah.

1170
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:40,400
That's I guess that maybe that you could say that's a tactic too because if you give a child a sip of something they're not going to get drunk and they're just going to go oh god.

1171
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:41,720
This sucks.

1172
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:42,260
Yes.

1173
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:42,560
Yeah.

1174
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:48,940
I mean I guess it's like a really sweet wine it would taste like juice but you could have a sip of beer.

1175
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:52,500
They'd be like well yeah that'll throw you off the course for a long time.

1176
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:59,360
Actually here this is jumping around a little but let's bring parents into the conversation because he sent me.

1177
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:00,100
Yeah.

1178
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,980
They're literally they don't interact with the kid like yeah what's going on.

1179
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:03,460
Dad.

1180
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:12,860
Dad's pulling beers out of the fridge and like a couple of my beers are missing and mom says oh you probably drank them all watching the game last night and he doesn't flinch at that at all.

1181
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:20,500
And I'm like so wait so the dad can drink so many beers that he's just like yeah that's probably right.

1182
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,760
Yeah I don't know.

1183
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,760
Six nine fourteen.

1184
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,500
It's all fog to me.

1185
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:32,780
It's by the way in a wooden crate in the years are missing.

1186
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,500
That wood is going to warp dad.

1187
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,260
Yeah.

1188
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,280
Blacked out last night.

1189
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,200
Honey you don't remember.

1190
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,420
Oh gosh you wouldn't remember.

1191
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:49,140
And then the next time you see him is in the garage and he's just moving items around in the most uncomfortable looking slacks you've ever seen.

1192
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:49,930
Like he's.

1193
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,660
It's not his slacks.

1194
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:53,760
I didn't know the slacks.

1195
01:11:53,760 --> 01:12:01,440
He's like in a polo and slacks and he's like in theory working in the garage but just is probably cheapy anime.

1196
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,160
I gotta figure out.

1197
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,200
Just like moving items.

1198
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:09,000
Well if I don't tell my wife I have work to do in the garage then I'm going to have to chip in with the kids.

1199
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:12,020
So I have to go pretend that I know what tools are.

1200
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,420
I'm just going to move paint cans around for a while.

1201
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:28,580
OK I accidentally left the door open so I'm glad I wasn't screaming and crying like I often am.

1202
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,200
But hey sweetie what's going on.

1203
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:39,520
So any but anyway let me let me back up and say we go to these angry arcade teens and they refer to a drug.

1204
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:44,340
Am I making this up that they say we're trying something harder now.

1205
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,680
Lady Snake.

1206
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,120
And I.

1207
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,400
What's Lady Snake.

1208
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,860
There's no Google results for Lady Snake.

1209
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,880
Am I such a choir boy.

1210
01:12:54,620 --> 01:13:01,320
I've missed if I look if I am I am listeners mock me in the comments but I don't he doesn't even know what Lady Snake is.

1211
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,120
Is he holding up crack rocks.

1212
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,700
Is that what he's meant to be.

1213
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,580
Maybe yeah I think so.

1214
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:10,960
Which it's also like man what arcades were you going to.

1215
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,780
Like it's a big jump.

1216
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,520
Yes you look like you live in Pleasantville.

1217
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,940
Like what is going on in this town.

1218
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:22,260
The only the Lady Snake the only thing I know is the Simpsons reference.

1219
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,240
What's that.

1220
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:26,500
When Barry White says he loves the sexy slither of a lady snake.

1221
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,320
Oh yeah.

1222
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,760
But that's I don't know anything.

1223
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,300
I don't know.

1224
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,180
So well it kept the.

1225
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,880
Hey I can honestly say I've never done Lady Snake.

1226
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:41,900
Unless Lady Snake is like actually you know like mashed potatoes or something and I don't know that's what he's holding up his mash potato.

1227
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:42,340
Yeah.

1228
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,820
If it's mashed potatoes I've done Lady Lady Snake.

1229
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,020
We've all done Lady Snake.

1230
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:46,640
Yeah.

1231
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:54,300
Anyway there's a siren they got a scatter the cops are here and then the cop is Bugs Bugs Bunnies entrance.

1232
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:03,860
He talks about a joint he has a time machine he has a time machine to go back to three years ago when you know Michael was better.

1233
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:10,860
And when he and all his friends used to wear baseball jerseys with their first initial.

1234
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:15,120
Archie comics from the 1960s and like the Alvin and the Chipmunks.

1235
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:15,820
Oh yeah that's true.

1236
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:20,620
There's like the sweat yeah the sweater kind of I don't know.

1237
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,860
The cardigan with your.

1238
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,500
Yeah that's right.

1239
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,140
This was a Bush campaign too.

1240
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:32,820
We need more entertainment where children are wearing their first initial huge on their shirt so we can catch them faster when they deal crack.

1241
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,220
That's what that's what they they.

1242
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,680
Yeah they wanted the kids.

1243
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:42,260
We need these kids when they're very young they're dressed like little dolls or little sailor boys.

1244
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:51,100
And then when they grow up a little well they you get your plane baseball cap and your jersey with one letter on it.

1245
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:54,880
Yeah it's a very funny flashback.

1246
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:55,340
Yeah.

1247
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,460
Oh Bugs got the time machine from Wiley Coyote he says.

1248
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,880
Oh yeah I got it from some coyote.

1249
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:00,740
Some coyote.

1250
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,200
That's fine.

1251
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,960
Oh the one stuck in an endless cycle of violence.

1252
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:05,700
Yes.

1253
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,140
We're not.

1254
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,380
This shit goes wrong.

1255
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,080
This shit this actually works.

1256
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:09,840
Yeah.

1257
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,640
Usually all of Wiley Coyote's shit.

1258
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,440
It's Wiley doesn't know how to operate maybe.

1259
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:14,980
That's true yeah.

1260
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,880
Good hands every Acme item.

1261
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:18,340
The problem is not with Acme.

1262
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,420
Well that's an interesting.

1263
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,020
Problems with the.

1264
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:20,340
Wrinkle.

1265
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,160
I guess this proves that doesn't it.

1266
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:22,680
Yeah.

1267
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,020
Maybe if Bugs who is smart.

1268
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:25,780
Right.

1269
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,020
Could use any yeah he could catch the Roadrunner very quickly.

1270
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:29,420
No problem.

1271
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,620
If Bugs wanted to eat the Roadrunner.

1272
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:32,240
Yeah.

1273
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,900
I don't know how he would feel about that and we're on the food chain.

1274
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:41,680
Usually a bunny wouldn't eat a Roadrunner but the sizes are all over the map so he

1275
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,320
might want to I don't know it's like a big turkey to him.

1276
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,300
Yeah that's true.

1277
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,780
Thanksgiving Roadrunner.

1278
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,460
Gather up gang.

1279
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,340
Maybe next year we'll have duck.

1280
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:57,440
Bugs is like Bugs inspired by Alf maybe into eating other.

1281
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,640
They might have rubbed off on each other doing this special yeah.

1282
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:01,300
Hmm.

1283
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,020
So I could eat my animal pals.

1284
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,080
I would establish dominance.

1285
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,720
The power play.

1286
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,780
I mean I know I'm the I'm the main mascot I'm the.

1287
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,660
I'm the face of the company but how do I show him that I'm number one.

1288
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,640
If I threaten to kill Porky and eat him.

1289
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,860
This is Buster bunnies getting a little too big for his britches.

1290
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,120
He's eating his own kind.

1291
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,480
I'll eat the Roadrunner.

1292
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,280
Show him.

1293
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,520
The power I'm capable of.

1294
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,780
Ain't I a stinker.

1295
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,380
I ate Buster Bunny.

1296
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:44,080
Hey speaking of past guest Eric Bousa's Buster Bunny in the Tiny Tunes reboot.

1297
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:44,540
He's Buster.

1298
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:45,220
I didn't know what he was.

1299
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:45,740
He's Buster.

1300
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,140
OK.

1301
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:46,640
He's Buster.

1302
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,100
Yeah.

1303
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:47,540
Great.

1304
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:47,880
Great.

1305
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:54,100
And then a woman Ashley Crystal who I knew from UCB is Babs.

1306
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,140
So pretty fun.

1307
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,560
I got pretty excited when I found out there was a Tiny Tunes reboot.

1308
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,320
I love Tiny Tunes.

1309
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,520
I like Tiny Tunes.

1310
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:02,920
Yeah.

1311
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,080
Yeah.

1312
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:04,840
So they didn't.

1313
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,540
I mean we do voices all the time on the show.

1314
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:08,760
Why didn't we get that.

1315
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,940
They don't need a Ron DeSantis voice.

1316
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,800
Because we can do that.

1317
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,580
The mean Dean of the college.

1318
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:16,100
Yeah.

1319
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,560
Ron DeSantis or McGruff or.

1320
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,720
Is McGruff in Tiny Tunes.

1321
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,060
He could easily be.

1322
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:23,520
It should be.

1323
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,940
Or sort of a catch all Disney vlogger voice.

1324
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:27,100
They don't need that.

1325
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,000
OK.

1326
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,040
Whatever.

1327
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,480
Somebody who is in this.

1328
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:34,780
I mean it all builds up to it.

1329
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:39,280
We get another kind of like chase sequence and then there's like a yank down into the

1330
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:39,840
sewer.

1331
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:40,380
Yeah.

1332
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,160
And we then we know who we get there.

1333
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,020
And that is Michelangelo.

1334
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,940
If they had to pick one I think they picked the right one.

1335
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:47,460
Yes.

1336
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:52,240
This is I waited for this during the whole when I knew you were like anytime I watch

1337
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:56,120
this past the first viewing I was just like come on come on.

1338
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,040
When's he going to show.

1339
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,600
When are we getting to the fireworks factory.

1340
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,240
Mm hmm.

1341
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:05,400
And he showed up and yes watching this back I go it's not really the most exciting.

1342
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:05,940
Yeah.

1343
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,440
It's almost like why would you look forward to this and in the other ones he like

1344
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,040
fights shredder and eats pizza.

1345
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:11,720
It's awesome.

1346
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,720
He stands around.

1347
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,220
Yeah.

1348
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:16,300
This is so boring for my normal Michelangelo day.

1349
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:16,720
Yeah.

1350
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:21,820
So to reiterate what bugs and Alf and the Smurfs said drugs are bad dude.

1351
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,480
Yeah.

1352
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:24,060
They covered that pretty much.

1353
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:24,320
OK.

1354
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,960
What can I bring to this discussion.

1355
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:26,880
I don't know.

1356
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:27,940
Look I don't want to be repetitive.

1357
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:29,420
Just don't do them.

1358
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:34,220
And of course as many people different articles pointed out it's like yeah my voice

1359
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:38,580
seems like I'm high like it's I would be the most likely to be doing drugs and all

1360
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:39,180
four turtles.

1361
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,240
Yeah that's true.

1362
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,080
But listen to what I have to say bro.

1363
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:47,120
That's a subtext of all of our attitudes maybe less so I don't know Leonardo he's

1364
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,040
kind of serious sometimes but yeah Leonardo is definitely the guy but even he you

1365
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,040
know if we like trap a villain you know he'll party.

1366
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:59,980
He just he just waits till the work is done.

1367
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,360
He just spaces it out man.

1368
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,900
Where do you think Danatello gets the ideas for all his gadgets.

1369
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,940
Where do you get your ideas man.

1370
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,580
You should have been Leonardo here character wise I think not Michelangelo.

1371
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:16,080
I mean who you're going to not.

1372
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,560
He's the number one guy I know my number one guy plummets if it's not Michael.

1373
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,760
No it's true and I was he was my favorite.

1374
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
So yeah but like he doesn't like let him punch somebody out here let him punch

1375
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:27,400
something.

1376
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:27,840
Smoke.

1377
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,840
Well we have you know what I'm sorry I'm doing the whole description and I glossed

1378
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:37,980
over that like yes the creation of that smoke from a joint turns into the

1379
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:42,060
character smoke voiced by Academy Award winner George C Scott.

1380
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,440
Yeah I would imagine.

1381
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:45,080
Yeah probably.

1382
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:46,320
Dr.

1383
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:46,720
Strangelove.

1384
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:47,620
It's good.

1385
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:48,560
It's good.

1386
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:48,940
It is good.

1387
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:52,740
I like he's a good like crazy actor in general.

1388
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,960
Oh my God he's he is such he gives the craziest performance.

1389
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:56,560
He's a lunatic.

1390
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,280
Yeah.

1391
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,760
Strangelove so good.

1392
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,240
Yeah I got no I got no beef with smoke.

1393
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,160
Smoke's just good.

1394
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,680
I think animation wise smoke is good.

1395
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,820
Yeah I think smoke.

1396
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:13,400
Hey smoke beats Ferngully villain in my book.

1397
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:15,680
Oh oh similar smoke monster.

1398
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,820
What's his name.

1399
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:17,780
I don't know.

1400
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,600
Tim Curry.

1401
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:19,100
Right.

1402
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:22,860
I mean he's got that song which I kind of like but Ferngully in general is kind

1403
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,040
of a creepy.

1404
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,100
Yeah.

1405
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,980
Kind of icky movie.

1406
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:28,880
It's a little weird.

1407
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,560
Never never my favorite.

1408
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:50,820
I got it like some family fun day that was Spider-Man and Luke Cage and Storm and

1409
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:57,020
they fight a villain who I believe is to teach kids about the dangers of cigarette

1410
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:57,520
smoking.

1411
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:03,040
And a few years later I got it again and they had redrawn it.

1412
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,860
They'd updated the art style.

1413
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:06,140
You got the same comic.

1414
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,740
It's the same comic.

1415
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:13,180
Basically I'm going to try to find these because one was the more like stiffer 70

1416
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:18,780
style and the one was the more like slicker 90s style and it's the same villain

1417
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:24,520
and it's Luke Cage and Storm and Spider-Man and they're teaching kids about the

1418
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,600
dangers of smoking cigarettes.

1419
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:30,060
And there was a villain that was like created for this is what you're saying.

1420
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,820
And it was like a smoke monster.

1421
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,560
Yeah.

1422
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,920
Well it was a guy in a doofy outfit.

1423
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:37,840
Big cigarette.

1424
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,920
Who could turn into like kind of smoke partially.

1425
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:41,880
OK.

1426
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:46,900
So they really went to the well for the smoke is the bad thing you know.

1427
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:51,980
You got a smoke monster power rankings I'd be generally curious about listeners give

1428
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:52,580
us your choice.

1429
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,260
The lost.

1430
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:54,500
That is lost factor in.

1431
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,140
Hexas is the name of Tim Curry.

1432
01:21:59,480 --> 01:21:59,840
So yeah.

1433
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:00,140
Hex.

1434
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,780
Who's your favorite smoke monster.

1435
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:04,240
But you got to I think you got to give it up to the Academy Award.

1436
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,160
Yeah.

1437
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:05,800
I think so.

1438
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:06,800
Committed to performance.

1439
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,120
So he's in there but he always hides when then when there's a threat.

1440
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,220
I ain't got your back.

1441
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,800
That you might get caught.

1442
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:16,280
Yeah.

1443
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,560
Cigarettes are going to let you down.

1444
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:18,920
That's the message.

1445
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,220
Yeah that's true.

1446
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:24,620
If you get like if you're smoking a joint the smoke might not be there.

1447
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:27,840
You get in trouble for smoke it will have already dissipated.

1448
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,320
Smoke won't save you.

1449
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:34,540
Something I've never thought about until this episode is for as much as I loved

1450
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:40,020
Michelangelo why did I never note who the voice actor of Michelangelo.

1451
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,080
Oh right.

1452
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:45,680
I've I've never seen the name Townsend Coleman in my life.

1453
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,040
Yeah.

1454
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,240
Never occurred to me.

1455
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:50,340
Have you have you like have you like seen him at a con or something.

1456
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,080
I've never seen him in a con.

1457
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,660
I didn't know that name until the last five to 10 years though.

1458
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:58,720
It wasn't something that was necessarily on my radar.

1459
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:03,280
It's like you think that I like I wanted to know I have to know who the voice of

1460
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,260
Bart is the coolest character.

1461
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,080
And there was kind of you know an early celebrity to Nancy Cartwright but I never.

1462
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:09,560
Yeah.

1463
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,880
Why did I not care about Townsend Coleman.

1464
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,360
Townsend did a great job.

1465
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:18,280
All four of the guys who did the original Turtles I think are doing more like events

1466
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,640
at cons now owning it more than the last 10 years or so.

1467
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,280
They should.

1468
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:25,320
There's a very special quality to those originals.

1469
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:30,280
Townsend Coleman did a ton of voices voice on Animaniacs one time of a kid you know

1470
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,900
because they did their like topical stuff their Hollywood jokes.

1471
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:33,300
Yeah.

1472
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:38,240
And he voiced a character that I noted named Pressberg Katzen eiser man.

1473
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,940
We got to look up what that is.

1474
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:41,600
Yeah that's funny.

1475
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:42,720
We got to find that.

1476
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,520
Yeah.

1477
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,780
And then he was the tick.

1478
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:52,700
I don't know same guy was the tick and then was brought back as a voice on the dog

1479
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:59,560
midnight on the Amazon revival which starred Peter Serafinowicz and I don't remember any

1480
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,580
of the rest of the cast.

1481
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,020
Peter Serafinowicz and that's it as far as I know.

1482
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:03,640
OK moving on.

1483
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,620
I don't remember anyone else.

1484
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:13,440
So then we end up in kind of a psychedelic sequence which is pretty strong.

1485
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:17,720
They get to they go on a nightmare roller coaster trip with the Muppet babies.

1486
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,040
It's almost like Temple of Doom but in a dream sequence.

1487
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:22,200
Mine cart.

1488
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,280
It's a roller coaster but yeah it reminded me of that sequence.

1489
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,300
As a kid I remembered this being like a feature length movie.

1490
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,320
There's a million uploads of this on YouTube.

1491
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,760
It is like 26 minutes long.

1492
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,260
Yeah I know.

1493
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:39,840
Yeah I stretched it out in my measure especially this sequence.

1494
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:40,940
This seemed like a lot.

1495
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:45,000
And I even though it's meant to scare you I liked it because it's a roller coaster.

1496
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,300
It's a depiction of a ride.

1497
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:50,000
I'd like to go on a ride based on this ride and this special.

1498
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:55,000
All the Muppet babies in the ride vehicle with you talking about.

1499
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:55,240
Oh my god.

1500
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,040
That would be great.

1501
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:57,020
Drugs might get you.

1502
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,990
They might bring you up for a minute but then.

1503
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:03,950
The babies having to deliver this dialogue is really funny.

1504
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:06,190
It's not even the adult Muppets it's the babies.

1505
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:08,370
Drugs are scrabbling your brain.

1506
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:18,510
And then you get like there's this okay we've had a frame on my TV the whole time we've

1507
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:20,770
been recording this which is my favorite part of the whole thing.

1508
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:24,470
It's just like this is we're getting into some like crazy anime territory.

1509
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:28,510
This shot where it like goes from Michael's horrified fit.

1510
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:31,450
There's no dialogue or like almost any sound here.

1511
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:35,630
It's just him gasping and then the Muppet babies are also gasping.

1512
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:39,410
He looks more realistic or kind of off model than in any other shots.

1513
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:44,190
And then he like you zoom out until he's just in an infinity void and then you keep

1514
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:46,690
zooming and then you come out of his own eye.

1515
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:48,830
So you get a second Michael.

1516
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:52,470
It's so good they reuse I think some of it again.

1517
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:52,930
Yeah.

1518
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:54,090
A couple of minutes later.

1519
01:25:54,660 --> 01:26:00,290
I don't know if this was I this is just like genius from these Taiwan animators.

1520
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,510
It's really weird.

1521
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:04,370
I read somewhere that this they like did this in six weeks.

1522
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:07,890
I don't know if that was somebody like obviously that I think they would have to

1523
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:08,270
work quick.

1524
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:12,290
I don't know if that's complete fact but yeah I'm pretty impressed that

1525
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:14,590
they because I'm sure you have they shit all these things out.

1526
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:14,970
Yeah.

1527
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:16,210
As fast as they could.

1528
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:20,990
But some of it like you could tell where they put the you know like the big the

1529
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:24,670
scary trippy sequences like backgrounds are great really detailed.

1530
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:30,430
You see like worse looking stuff in the real show in DuckTales or Ninja Turtles

1531
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:31,170
sometimes.

1532
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:36,990
Ninja Turtles opening from the original cartoon is awesome.

1533
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:42,030
And then some of the episodes a lot of some of the scenes from the episodes you're

1534
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:45,070
like I don't know that they have like a half hour to do this.

1535
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:45,790
Possibly.

1536
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:48,810
And then like the bandana color is wrong a lot.

1537
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:50,610
And it would be like that too.

1538
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:52,170
The credits are amazing.

1539
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:53,130
Yes.

1540
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:53,450
Yeah.

1541
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:58,690
The show itself would be the stiffest like characters in business casual where

1542
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:01,170
it walking between rooms in the mansion.

1543
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:01,650
Yeah.

1544
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:02,170
Yeah.

1545
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:03,470
They were putting this is so off.

1546
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:05,850
It's why we all revere these theme songs.

1547
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:10,890
I will if I like I would watch all of these theme songs every day if I had to.

1548
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:15,770
And then the shows I'll just like bail as fast as I don't understand.

1549
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:19,050
They're so boring I almost don't know how I watched them all the time.

1550
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:24,250
Well I've said this before we're like I loved Heathcliff and I loved the theme

1551
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:25,390
song to Heathcliff.

1552
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:27,230
I was more of a cat like cats fan.

1553
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:28,590
That's the five timers here.

1554
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:32,450
But I like the whole intro to Keith Cliffe and I tried watching like the first

1555
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:35,470
episode and I was like this is unwatchable.

1556
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:41,290
This is like it was like translated from a different country or something like it

1557
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:46,650
doesn't even feel like it's so disjointed and it's so poorly animated and characters

1558
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:51,970
like I remember Heathcliff having a lot of like slow walk cycles clunk clunk clunk.

1559
01:27:52,110 --> 01:27:52,330
Yeah.

1560
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:54,710
Watch this guy step into frame slowly.

1561
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:55,210
Mel Blank.

1562
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:55,450
Whoa.

1563
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:56,370
He was Heathcliff.

1564
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:56,890
He was Heathcliff.

1565
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:57,830
I don't know that actually.

1566
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:58,330
Yeah.

1567
01:27:58,330 --> 01:27:58,710
Wow.

1568
01:27:58,810 --> 01:27:59,150
Wow.

1569
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:01,630
You got some Hartman in there sometimes doing that.

1570
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:01,950
Oh.

1571
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:02,330
Who is he being?

1572
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:03,090
What's the ant like?

1573
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,450
He's Clarify.

1574
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:06,070
Is it Walter Brennan maybe?

1575
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:07,290
Who is that actor?

1576
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:08,770
Yeah that might be right.

1577
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:11,090
Um yeah I think he did some Heathcliff.

1578
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:14,990
He's definitely he's what's Dennis the Menace.

1579
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:16,990
Oh right right right.

1580
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:19,190
Um okay let's see.

1581
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:23,830
Oh uh Huey and Huey Dewey and Louie get into the game.

1582
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:26,850
They kind of show up right before the song right.

1583
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:29,730
Yeah they don't have much to do.

1584
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:31,330
Tigger jumps into the song.

1585
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:31,830
Yeah.

1586
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:34,650
Well they factor in later but you know we'll get to that.

1587
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:39,850
But the then you get this song and it's a notable thing about it and a big selling

1588
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:45,310
point of the special that the song Wonderful Ways to Say No is an Ashman

1589
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:46,150
Minkin.

1590
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:46,650
Yes.

1591
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:47,010
Jam.

1592
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:55,010
In the exceedingly short period of time where Howard Ashman was working up his

1593
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:57,290
classics this they had time for this.

1594
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:57,750
Yes.

1595
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:02,450
And I wish then I could say it's another part of your world.

1596
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:03,710
It does not.

1597
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:10,890
It is not as good as any of the other songs they've ever written.

1598
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:11,530
I don't know.

1599
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:12,950
I listen to it.

1600
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:16,670
I also listen to it a couple of times because I wanted to champion it more.

1601
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:17,350
Yeah.

1602
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:19,130
I was like let me listen to that again.

1603
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:23,630
Maybe I was zoning out or something and I was like I don't think it's not better

1604
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:25,790
than any little shop of horror songs.

1605
01:29:25,810 --> 01:29:27,110
It's not better than the.

1606
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:28,130
It's it doesn't.

1607
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:32,370
It's a genre of song I don't really like so much.

1608
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:38,210
I mean it's kind of like a sub kids from music man.

1609
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:40,690
Paul in sings it.

1610
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:41,330
Oh yeah.

1611
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:43,770
Isn't that kind of it's like similar energy of song.

1612
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:45,470
Diner that dinner that that that that.

1613
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:47,290
Yeah it's a very like broad way.

1614
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:48,050
Kind of.

1615
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:48,610
Yeah yeah.

1616
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:49,310
It's not.

1617
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:53,870
You need you need a Paul in singing it to sell it in my mind.

1618
01:29:54,730 --> 01:29:55,050
For that.

1619
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:56,710
Not a Fusco.

1620
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:59,050
You know Lynn Fusco a Linde.

1621
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:04,890
Is it at least kind of fun to see all these characters sing and like Michelangelo

1622
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:05,750
tap a toe.

1623
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:07,210
That's OK.

1624
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:09,010
I'm pro that.

1625
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:14,250
But yeah no I was like oh yeah I forgot that they did this song and I was like this

1626
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:16,050
thing they shit this thing out.

1627
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:18,930
I think this might have been a bit of a I don't know that they they they were

1628
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:20,730
working on this as hard as they worked on.

1629
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:24,370
They're like if we're the new Sherman Brothers the Sherman Brothers could crank

1630
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:25,210
them out.

1631
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:26,390
Let's crank them out.

1632
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:26,690
Yeah.

1633
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:30,290
Doesn't it feel like the kind of song like there's certain rides were like and

1634
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:32,750
and this one had an original Sherman Brothers song.

1635
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:33,710
Do we like it.

1636
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:34,810
No.

1637
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:40,390
There's those random like random Epcot stuff where you're like oh the Sherman

1638
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:44,810
Brothers I'm like oh this one is when they may have lesser work they can't all

1639
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:45,410
be.

1640
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:52,110
So so it's also you just you have some of the most annoying voices.

1641
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:52,690
Yeah.

1642
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:53,870
Sing anything.

1643
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:58,850
And let me flash ahead to that let me just take care of the credits song while

1644
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:04,330
we're talking music because if you if you think wonderful ways to say no is bad

1645
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:07,550
then you get to the the credits song.

1646
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:08,270
Oh yeah.

1647
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:12,830
Over this which I do I do like this like rainbow gradient with like speckled

1648
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,590
texture that it plays over this.

1649
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:16,070
This looms largely in my head.

1650
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:21,530
But these might be this might be some of the most annoying singing ever recorded

1651
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:22,490
for any reason.

1652
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:31,350
I may have here as we say noorgh.

1653
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:37,390
You'll see stronger and stronger that's how.

1654
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:41,730
It's me in this house these

1655
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:43,590
big thing.

1656
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:46,330
He takes the cake you know what

1657
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,130
you're saying.

1658
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:52,050
Yeah.

1659
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:54,490
All right.

1660
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:56,130
Sorry, listener.

1661
01:31:56,490 --> 01:32:01,070
That's yeah, that is I do like that, but I don't think it would be interesting of

1662
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:02,710
like so.

1663
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:07,550
So when you're watching is it this guy, the movie's called Howard, Howard.

1664
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:07,970
Yeah.

1665
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:08,370
Yeah.

1666
01:32:08,370 --> 01:32:10,730
But then there's also he's Waking Sleeping Beauty.

1667
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:12,310
Also, there's a lot of stuff in there.

1668
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:17,590
If Howard was involved in this more, maybe it just they didn't bring out the

1669
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:21,990
because he'd be mad story, you know, shaped the story of the he saves the Disney

1670
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:24,710
company with his like opinions about these movies.

1671
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:29,010
I feel like he fixed the movies he fixed specifically fixed Beauty and the Beast.

1672
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:29,550
I think, right.

1673
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:30,190
That's the story.

1674
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:32,930
They're working on a lot and the B&B set a lot of problems and they just came in.

1675
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:34,070
Oh, he wasn't supposed to do it.

1676
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,430
Yeah.

1677
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:36,130
And overall, the whole fucking thing.

1678
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:38,390
It's the best one of all of them still, I think.

1679
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:38,650
Yeah.

1680
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:39,910
And the pressure is so high.

1681
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:42,070
They couldn't like have the post Little Mermaid.

1682
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:42,370
Right.

1683
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:43,150
And be a letdown.

1684
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:45,910
It had to elevate and it did and won Oscars and right.

1685
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:46,890
And nominated for Oscars.

1686
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:52,290
And but then Howard on this plate is also working on cartoon all star directing,

1687
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:54,630
voice acting and save the Walt Disney Company.

1688
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:59,190
And then his documentary was about to get removed as a tax write off.

1689
01:32:59,190 --> 01:32:59,590
Oh, of course.

1690
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:00,150
Yeah.

1691
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:00,390
Yeah.

1692
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:00,650
Friday.

1693
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:01,290
Yeah.

1694
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:02,110
Yeah.

1695
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:05,950
So crazy singing this song.

1696
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:07,650
I don't know.

1697
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:11,210
The story of this is kind of just like Michael,

1698
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:15,410
doesn't the story sort of like, hey, don't do drugs in minute three

1699
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:17,350
and then just different things happen.

1700
01:33:17,370 --> 01:33:20,410
And it's just a matter of volume.

1701
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:23,670
Eventually, the song doesn't really seem to do it for him.

1702
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:24,010
Right.

1703
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:27,970
Well, again, Michael, in general, these are his sister's characters.

1704
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:31,170
For the most part, he doesn't seem to care or is surprised

1705
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:34,030
that a Ninja Turtle is talking to him.

1706
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:34,290
Right.

1707
01:33:34,970 --> 01:33:36,630
Not concerned about it.

1708
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:39,090
He should have been maybe more like characters from his jet,

1709
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:43,270
like he man or something or Heathcliff, which aired earlier.

1710
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:43,810
Yes.

1711
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:47,190
If Heathcliff showed up, maybe he would have listened to him quicker

1712
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:49,010
because he respected those characters.

1713
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:50,450
But yeah, these are his sister's characters.

1714
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:52,430
His sister is more our age.

1715
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:53,250
Yeah.

1716
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:55,090
Michael is a little older than us.

1717
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:55,390
Yeah.

1718
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:55,590
Yeah.

1719
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:58,790
But he might have been like, well, where did all right.

1720
01:33:58,790 --> 01:34:00,050
You didn't do drugs, Heathcliff.

1721
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:00,910
Where are you now?

1722
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:01,410
Huh?

1723
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:02,950
You're not even on TV anymore.

1724
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:04,390
There's no movie of you.

1725
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:05,030
Right.

1726
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:05,970
Yeah, that's true.

1727
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:09,630
Maybe there's also a big emphasis on

1728
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:15,490
like we have to show Michael the error of his ways as opposed to,

1729
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:17,890
hey, Michael, seems like he's in a tough spot.

1730
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:19,190
Let's get him some help.

1731
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:21,270
Like, let's support him.

1732
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:24,630
Well, there there, I guess, is he says help out this help, I think.

1733
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:27,770
At a certain point, there's something towards the end resembling like

1734
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:30,110
very sort of what you're talking about.

1735
01:34:30,110 --> 01:34:31,050
But yeah, I think you're right.

1736
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:33,530
That's that's the way you would adjust this today.

1737
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:34,410
Yeah.

1738
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:36,630
It's like you're fucked up, Michael.

1739
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:38,030
Hey, Michael, you idiot.

1740
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:41,210
Hey, we got to torture him until he stops.

1741
01:34:41,850 --> 01:34:47,010
Michael somehow didn't comprehend that the five people pushing drugs on him

1742
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:47,830
were mean.

1743
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:49,450
He gave in to peer pressure.

1744
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:54,550
The only way anyone would ever do drugs is if five mean people were going,

1745
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:56,410
hey, you have to do this.

1746
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:57,650
It's like an electric guitar.

1747
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,770
We was playing.

1748
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:02,330
And he said, yeah, that sexy, evil guitar.

1749
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:05,830
That's really the sign of something good happening.

1750
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:06,430
Yeah.

1751
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:06,730
Yeah.

1752
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:08,690
No, then he's just like persecuted.

1753
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:14,670
And that's really the, you know, we end up in this psychedelic sequence, too,

1754
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:18,530
where he just goes to this like a horrible decaying carnival.

1755
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:19,450
More rides.

1756
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:22,510
You could do a themed land based on settings from cartoon

1757
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:23,530
All Stars to Rescue.

1758
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:27,270
And this is where I lose the thread a little bit because he's on

1759
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:31,230
scary rides, much like the Muppet Babies took him on.

1760
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:35,090
But these ones have giant Huey, Dewey and Louie faces.

1761
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:37,770
And they look so mad.

1762
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:39,910
They they're trying to kill him.

1763
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:40,270
Yeah.

1764
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:41,630
They're bigger than him.

1765
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:46,790
And like a whirly gig with eight Deweys on it is trying to crush him.

1766
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:47,450
This.

1767
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:52,370
This is not the way to get someone to stop doing drugs.

1768
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:52,810
Yeah.

1769
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:55,190
To abuse them psychologically.

1770
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:57,130
This is not right.

1771
01:35:57,130 --> 01:36:00,870
I will go on record as saying that this is what will happen to you.

1772
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:01,750
You pick it.

1773
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:02,150
You can.

1774
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:04,590
We will let you customize your character.

1775
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:04,910
Yeah.

1776
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:05,290
Whatever.

1777
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:10,330
If you like Lumiere from Pinyin the Beast, then it will be Lumiere

1778
01:36:10,330 --> 01:36:13,770
trying to singe your ass with his flame hands.

1779
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:18,010
But mark of our words, your favorite character will try to kill you.

1780
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:21,910
Nimgaloo will put a bunch of oranges in a bag and wail on you

1781
01:36:22,830 --> 01:36:24,150
till you're done.

1782
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:26,130
He's choking me with a scarf.

1783
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:26,790
Yeah.

1784
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:28,850
Series of scarves.

1785
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:31,630
Yeah, no, I understand.

1786
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:35,950
They tried to figure out a good visual way to represent this.

1787
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:39,270
But yeah, the reality is like all the characters sit him down like Michael,

1788
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:40,110
what are you going through?

1789
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:41,350
What's going on here?

1790
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:41,770
Yeah.

1791
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:42,750
The song.

1792
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:45,750
That's where you maybe can't fault the song as much.

1793
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:46,810
Yeah, that's everybody.

1794
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:50,330
Let's do something nice to show you that there's another way.

1795
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,790
Yeah.

1796
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:55,590
But then immediately after that, we're into dark carnival.

1797
01:36:55,590 --> 01:37:00,110
Yeah, because it's really, you know, you don't want it just to be like.

1798
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:02,150
And then like Michael walks in the door and then all the characters

1799
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,890
are standing there and he's like, what is this?

1800
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:06,830
And they're like and Garfield like, that's your intervention.

1801
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:10,350
Yeah, we're all just really worried about you.

1802
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:12,750
We all love you and care about you.

1803
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:14,490
Yeah, we care and love you.

1804
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:16,950
We just want you're going to you've hit rock bottom.

1805
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:18,590
Like that's the reality.

1806
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:21,670
I was going to say just to jump on what Alf said.

1807
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:23,430
You're a great guy.

1808
01:37:23,530 --> 01:37:25,370
And if I've never said I love you.

1809
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:30,070
Let me say now, gosh, this is our friend, Dr.

1810
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:33,090
Erica Johnson, and she's going to get you some help.

1811
01:37:33,410 --> 01:37:35,230
She's a pro at this.

1812
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:38,990
Is Michelangelo going to do any more talking?

1813
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:41,170
No, I think the doctor is going to take it from here.

1814
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:45,070
And then that's the 15 minutes of the rest of the episode.

1815
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:48,590
Hefty Smurf, do you want to weigh in at all?

1816
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:50,030
No, I'm fine.

1817
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:51,470
You're the doctor.

1818
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:51,990
You do.

1819
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:55,170
Isn't one of the there's got to be a doctor smurf, right?

1820
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:56,970
That's kind of versed in this.

1821
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:58,250
Oh, not really.

1822
01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:01,870
Their society needs at least a doctor.

1823
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:03,610
Is there a doctor smurfing?

1824
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:07,090
You're smurfing, complaining and listen to what the doctor has to say.

1825
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:09,070
Isn't David the gnome here?

1826
01:38:09,070 --> 01:38:10,150
He's sort of a doctor.

1827
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:11,950
No, he's not here.

1828
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:13,490
He's outside smoking.

1829
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:14,570
Yeah, he's got his long.

1830
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:16,410
He's got his long pipe.

1831
01:38:17,690 --> 01:38:18,530
He's contemplating.

1832
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:19,390
But don't do that either.

1833
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:20,350
David can.

1834
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:22,510
He's 500 years old.

1835
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:25,450
Baby Kermit just zoomed in.

1836
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:26,790
Yeah, sorry.

1837
01:38:27,370 --> 01:38:28,250
I'm a baby.

1838
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:29,910
I'm out of the nursery today.

1839
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:33,730
Doesn't mean my feelings are any less valid.

1840
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:37,370
I'm using my imagination to pretend I'm there.

1841
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:42,670
Strawberry shortcake RSVP with regrets.

1842
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:46,930
And it's her own strawberry stationery.

1843
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:48,550
We didn't send this out.

1844
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:50,490
It's too bad, but it smells nice.

1845
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:52,210
Everyone wants to take a whiff.

1846
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:52,710
Great.

1847
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:53,870
They don't have any.

1848
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:57,490
And I hate to say to use such an old term, but like there's not as there's no

1849
01:38:57,490 --> 01:38:59,690
like girl character like.

1850
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:00,070
Yeah.

1851
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:00,630
You know what I mean?

1852
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:05,330
Even Smurfette is in the poster, but doesn't appear special.

1853
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:05,990
Yeah.

1854
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:06,490
Yeah.

1855
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:07,870
Of Cory and mom.

1856
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:09,010
Yeah.

1857
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:10,050
What about mom?

1858
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:11,530
All her parents are there.

1859
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:12,090
Mom.

1860
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:13,530
Does mom have a name?

1861
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:14,090
We looked it up.

1862
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:15,030
Is it possibly Helen?

1863
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:16,550
Oh, I don't know.

1864
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:17,890
I think I think it might just be mom.

1865
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:18,470
It might just be mom.

1866
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:19,190
Check an IMDb.

1867
01:39:19,190 --> 01:39:20,230
All of them.

1868
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:21,230
Yeah.

1869
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:24,750
Moms and moms and female cartoon characters are nags.

1870
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:27,370
At least in this one, the male characters also nags.

1871
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:29,970
And some of the male nags are voiced by females.

1872
01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:31,030
That's true.

1873
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:34,190
Some female actors got to do nagging in a male voice.

1874
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:34,870
That's true.

1875
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:40,090
There's this you we're going to meet the man in charge and then the man in charge

1876
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:41,030
is smoke.

1877
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:42,050
Yeah.

1878
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:43,510
You.

1879
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:48,330
The big razor blades are going to cut them up.

1880
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:49,270
I.

1881
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:57,230
He bends up inside of Miss Picky, Miss Picky's big straw, and she spits him out.

1882
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:57,770
Yeah.

1883
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:02,150
Being like now all of my sister's favorite characters are brutalizing me.

1884
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:02,670
Yeah.

1885
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:02,930
This.

1886
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:03,910
Yeah.

1887
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:08,930
Because like in the reality of the special, they're all creating these.

1888
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:13,350
Or like I know they're supposed to also be representing like a drug trip that goes bad,

1889
01:40:13,370 --> 01:40:14,930
but they're on the trip with him.

1890
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:16,990
It feels like they're orchestrating it to some degree.

1891
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:17,950
I think so.

1892
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:20,370
It feels like they're using their cartoon powers.

1893
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:21,210
Yeah.

1894
01:40:21,410 --> 01:40:22,470
Pulling them into a car.

1895
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:22,870
Yeah.

1896
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:25,090
So they all they all teamed up.

1897
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:29,370
Laurie O'Brien is the voice of both baby piggy and mom.

1898
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:33,110
Oh, so they got they got to be real tidy with these actresses.

1899
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:33,530
Yeah.

1900
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:37,630
If they wanted some effect, they were going to have to hire the actors just for that.

1901
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:39,790
And that's that's not going to work.

1902
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:41,750
So, yeah, one is an extra.

1903
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:42,150
Yeah.

1904
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:43,350
Yeah.

1905
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:43,830
Yeah.

1906
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:44,310
Geez.

1907
01:40:44,650 --> 01:40:45,510
No, it's weird.

1908
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:49,050
Daffy Duck does a crystal ball reading of the bowling ball.

1909
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:50,370
I forgot Daffy's in here.

1910
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:50,710
Yeah.

1911
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:50,870
Yeah.

1912
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:52,170
A little bit of Daffy.

1913
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:52,630
Yeah.

1914
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:54,650
And then you see him in the future.

1915
01:40:54,710 --> 01:40:55,910
He's Michael in the future.

1916
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:59,030
And you see the drugs make you a literal zombie.

1917
01:40:59,190 --> 01:41:02,350
You become a Frankenstein if you do drugs.

1918
01:41:03,370 --> 01:41:06,230
And then after that, so all that you get.

1919
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:06,690
All right.

1920
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:10,370
Like I know that we sent you plummeting towards a razor blade

1921
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:14,310
and spit you out of a straw, but then like we care about you.

1922
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:14,810
Yeah.

1923
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:18,730
The over the top, going back to like thinking about how you were explaining

1924
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:22,370
this to kids, like the over the top, I think is where you actually kind of lose kids.

1925
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:26,130
I remember there was a guy in high school and I maybe I've said this before.

1926
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:30,450
There was like a scared straight guy and he had the intensity of that guy from Future

1927
01:41:30,450 --> 01:41:30,930
Islands.

1928
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:34,310
If you've ever seen that David Letterman performance of Future Islands.

1929
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:37,390
No, he was just at the time.

1930
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:38,690
It's probably 10 years old at this point.

1931
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:43,990
He just like he's a very expressive and he kind of like dances and he's like this.

1932
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,990
And it's a good song.

1933
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:49,650
And I like that band, but it's a very unique performance, I would say,

1934
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:50,790
if you want to look it up even.

1935
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:56,730
But like we had a guy like that who was that intense speed, like if you take ecstasy,

1936
01:41:57,010 --> 01:41:58,630
it'll melt your brain.

1937
01:41:58,790 --> 01:42:03,990
And we were just like looking at each other like, well, I don't think it's going to melt your brain.

1938
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:04,830
Maybe bad.

1939
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:06,150
Tell me like how bad it is.

1940
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:13,070
But like he was like, yeah, this is like he was just as bizarre performance performance art

1941
01:42:13,070 --> 01:42:14,790
in front of like a bunch of 16 year olds.

1942
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:16,870
The Macho Man scared you straight.

1943
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:19,650
Yes.

1944
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:25,350
And I was just like, yeah, I don't think I think you kind of lose even kids when you go

1945
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:27,510
insanely over the top like this.

1946
01:42:27,590 --> 01:42:29,450
You start to smell around like this is too crazy.

1947
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:30,050
Yeah.

1948
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:30,410
Yeah.

1949
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:30,850
Yes.

1950
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:33,290
So if it's like the guy was like, hey, look, here's the deal.

1951
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:35,230
You don't know where you're getting your ecstasy.

1952
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:36,950
It can fuck you up.

1953
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:38,010
You really should be.

1954
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:39,650
You probably shouldn't do it.

1955
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:40,910
And you should be careful.

1956
01:42:40,910 --> 01:42:44,010
And here's a couple of things that actually happened for real.

1957
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:50,970
I feel like the risks and I would feel like that would stick with you more than like this fucking buffoon came in here.

1958
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:57,850
And like, yeah, well, my OK, my five timers is, of course, the day of prom.

1959
01:42:58,470 --> 01:43:02,450
We all had to go out in front of the school where they staged a car wreck.

1960
01:43:02,490 --> 01:43:08,830
Oh, we did this to there was a guy and a girl who they were going.

1961
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:13,610
They were in a ripped tuxedo and fucked up prom dress and they were covered in stage blood.

1962
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:14,030
Yes.

1963
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:16,210
Well, we had we had that.

1964
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:16,470
Sorry.

1965
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:18,510
Oh, I think this has been on the show before.

1966
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:19,270
I've said this before.

1967
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:19,690
Yeah.

1968
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:19,790
Yeah.

1969
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:21,890
The fire department was next door.

1970
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:29,170
So you would watch the fire truck leave the firehouse, come down the long road to the high school.

1971
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:29,490
Yeah.

1972
01:43:29,490 --> 01:43:34,470
And like pull up and an ambulance and they'd start like, and this is what could happen.

1973
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:38,290
OK, now you can have your half day to get ready for.

1974
01:43:38,730 --> 01:43:43,770
We had a guy we had they staged somebody going through the window of a car on the football field.

1975
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:44,310
Yes.

1976
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:44,970
Yeah.

1977
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:45,230
Yeah.

1978
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:49,790
And then they had a helicopter land on the football field,

1979
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:53,590
which I guess this is a little bit of a bet.

1980
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:56,190
This is at least like kind of what might happen for real.

1981
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:58,970
But I remember being like, they got a helicopter.

1982
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:03,790
So my production value and then I was like, this helicopter could like

1983
01:44:04,690 --> 01:44:08,530
accidentally go right into the stands and kill about 300 people.

1984
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:09,570
And Bukovic.

1985
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:10,670
This seems dangerous.

1986
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:11,650
This seems dangerous.

1987
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:14,130
Some people called in favors for that helicopter.

1988
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:14,830
Yeah.

1989
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:15,330
Yeah.

1990
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:15,630
Yeah.

1991
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:17,190
So I was like, OK.

1992
01:44:17,370 --> 01:44:21,570
And some of you would be looking at it like, is this part of it that then you're going to need a helicopter

1993
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:22,730
and then it'll shop up a bunch?

1994
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:23,210
No way.

1995
01:44:23,230 --> 01:44:24,210
Those are my friends.

1996
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:24,430
Yeah.

1997
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:25,970
They got shopped on for real.

1998
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:29,130
Put half of the half the bunch of dummies on the other side.

1999
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:30,790
And that's what must have happened.

2000
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:34,470
I feel like we've we've made it through a lot.

2001
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:35,430
If yes, we have.

2002
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:35,710
Yes.

2003
01:44:35,890 --> 01:44:37,950
And I mean, we know I said the credits.

2004
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:40,290
I said the very annoying song.

2005
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:45,590
But I mean, tossing any fun details I missed.

2006
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:50,810
But there's something I wanted to get out that that here.

2007
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:54,410
This is this is my little rabbit hole on this thing that.

2008
01:44:54,590 --> 01:45:00,770
OK, so this airs April 21st, 1990 on April 19th.

2009
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:07,390
1990, there was a joint hearing of before the Senate subcommittee on the judiciary

2010
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:09,570
and the House Committee on the judiciary.

2011
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:13,290
There was a Senate joint hearing about this special.

2012
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:18,690
And this was not that you think Senate sub hearing and you think this will be like a grilling.

2013
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:19,350
Right.

2014
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:22,510
Like like we'll discuss, you know, was it was something improper?

2015
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:26,890
This was just kind of a big Senate thing celebrating that this was done

2016
01:45:26,890 --> 01:45:29,490
and that it's going to air in several days.

2017
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:29,890
Yeah.

2018
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:35,430
And this was so, again, the day before 420, this time

2019
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:39,970
the Senate all met with all the major people involved in the thing.

2020
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:43,970
Richard Frank from Disney Studios, Roy Disney was there.

2021
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:48,990
And then all star lineup of senators, congressmen,

2022
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:54,830
many of the old ghouls Strom Thurman spoke Chuck Grassley,

2023
01:45:55,410 --> 01:45:57,390
Orrin Hatch, Arlen Specter.

2024
01:45:57,390 --> 01:46:02,470
But the opening remarks and the most talking at this thing done by one

2025
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:04,470
Joseph Robinette Biden.

2026
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:05,350
Yeah.

2027
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:07,610
He gave the opening speech.

2028
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:12,270
And this is all in a transcript that you can look up and read in full,

2029
01:46:13,170 --> 01:46:17,710
most of which dull, obviously, as a big Senate transcript.

2030
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:22,770
But there are certain things that jump out in this that are so bonkers.

2031
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:25,650
And forget.

2032
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:27,470
I mean, I'll just cut to the chase.

2033
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:30,250
This is OK.

2034
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:32,570
Biden's opening address.

2035
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:34,570
We'll also read a couple of his parts.

2036
01:46:34,810 --> 01:46:35,090
Oh, my God.

2037
01:46:35,710 --> 01:46:38,230
Biden is on Biden is on hinged in a different way now,

2038
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:40,830
but we're completely on hinged in any hearing.

2039
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:41,890
Oh, yeah.

2040
01:46:41,950 --> 01:46:42,130
Sure.

2041
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:44,290
We'll wait till we see here.

2042
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:45,190
OK.

2043
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:45,410
Yeah.

2044
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:46,890
And I don't know how to do Biden.

2045
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:48,010
I don't know how to do 80s.

2046
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:49,150
Biden's a tough road.

2047
01:46:49,390 --> 01:46:49,830
Yeah.

2048
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:50,870
OK.

2049
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:53,930
Anyone who doubts the power of cartoons,

2050
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:57,050
I don't I don't think it was much about our children and their habits.

2051
01:46:57,550 --> 01:47:00,290
For unless your family has been stranded on a desert island

2052
01:47:00,290 --> 01:47:03,430
for the last six months, then

2053
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:06,770
or if you are a parent like me with an eight year old,

2054
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:10,410
you know that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are a well known group

2055
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:12,610
of individuals among eight year olds.

2056
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:15,730
And you know the powerful impact of those turtles,

2057
01:47:15,730 --> 01:47:18,730
along with figures like Bugs Bunny and Winnie the Pooh

2058
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:21,950
and the Smurfs and Alf, who have all had our children

2059
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:25,790
imitate these characters and their mannerisms and their games.

2060
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:30,150
What child is not imitating else games?

2061
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:35,310
So just knowing that he was talking about the Ninja Turtles years ago

2062
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:38,410
and then here's this is the bunch of boring stuff.

2063
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:39,330
It's an honor, blah.

2064
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:40,650
And then this jumps out.

2065
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:42,170
We'll see.

2066
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:44,850
This is the newest weapon in our so-called war against drugs.

2067
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:48,150
And I'm not real crazy about that phrase, but in our effort to stem

2068
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:50,870
what is a serious, serious problem facing this country?

2069
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:54,830
This new weapon is not a naval carrier group or a new prison.

2070
01:47:55,190 --> 01:48:00,910
It isn't a one billion dollar research program for cocaine eating caterpillars.

2071
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:02,870
It is more powerful in those things.

2072
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:03,530
It's cartoon.

2073
01:48:04,190 --> 01:48:05,670
The billion Joe Biden.

2074
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:07,250
This is when he was sane.

2075
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:11,190
I was going to say, yeah, this is at a mere 58 years old.

2076
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:16,310
He's talking about it isn't what we have not done on this day

2077
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:19,290
is a billion dollar cocaine eating caterpillar.

2078
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:25,090
Is that like a comment on like academic studies at universities?

2079
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:26,070
I'm like wasteful.

2080
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:26,530
It's too.

2081
01:48:26,590 --> 01:48:28,630
Yeah, we're going straight to the core with Alf.

2082
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:33,930
But the fact that this came out of his brain and that he had to imagine

2083
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:36,730
he's prepared these remarks that were typed up for him

2084
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:40,870
and he had to imagine in his head a cocaine eating caterpillar.

2085
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:43,070
This will be the way.

2086
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:47,230
This is the way that we hit the warlords and the cartels where they

2087
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:50,570
if we unleash the caterpillars, get them real coked up.

2088
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:52,330
Now, I don't know what happens to them.

2089
01:48:52,330 --> 01:48:53,410
They start running around.

2090
01:48:53,690 --> 01:48:56,470
They start sprinting around the whole surface of the earth.

2091
01:48:57,190 --> 01:49:00,230
It's really a smoke trail from super fast caterpillars.

2092
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:03,970
It's really that he just enunciated better back then.

2093
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:07,670
And then has seemingly was more confident in what he was saying.

2094
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:10,270
The speeches actually haven't changed.

2095
01:49:10,270 --> 01:49:10,990
No, not yet.

2096
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:11,390
Yeah.

2097
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:13,690
He would he would say something that insane now.

2098
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:14,070
Yeah.

2099
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:14,230
Yeah.

2100
01:49:14,230 --> 01:49:15,950
It's just he would trail off a little bit.

2101
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:16,430
Yeah.

2102
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:20,610
He's one of the funny guys on the daily show like him.

2103
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:24,250
He was one of the Washington politicians.

2104
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:25,930
It was like, oh, he's a little sharp.

2105
01:49:26,450 --> 01:49:26,850
Yeah.

2106
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:28,350
But he's I've said this before, too.

2107
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:31,670
He was like he he was I had a sinister vibe before he was rehabbed

2108
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:33,230
by the Obama administration.

2109
01:49:33,230 --> 01:49:33,770
Oh, sure.

2110
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:36,370
I got a bad vibe from him before that.

2111
01:49:36,430 --> 01:49:37,710
And I don't know if it's just like, sure.

2112
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:39,650
I kind of a big like Gene Ackman guy.

2113
01:49:39,650 --> 01:49:39,990
Yeah.

2114
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:41,410
And like kind of he seems angry.

2115
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:44,410
And then it was like the Obama administration was like, hey,

2116
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:45,290
let's ice cream.

2117
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:46,970
And it's like this goofy old guy.

2118
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:49,410
And I was like, yeah, he's a goofy old guy.

2119
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:49,850
Yeah.

2120
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:52,910
Well, in recent and then the last part of the rehab

2121
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:57,190
before the presidential campaign, the guy wears big cool shades.

2122
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:57,630
Yeah.

2123
01:49:57,630 --> 01:49:57,850
Sure.

2124
01:49:57,870 --> 01:50:01,930
Do you ever not see this guy wearing big cool sunglasses?

2125
01:50:02,910 --> 01:50:06,730
All us comedians have a duty in this day

2126
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:11,430
to show how he wears sunglasses and not make a joke about it.

2127
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:13,130
Show that it's cool that he does it.

2128
01:50:13,130 --> 01:50:13,410
Yeah.

2129
01:50:13,410 --> 01:50:13,630
Yeah.

2130
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:15,650
And he always does it.

2131
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:17,250
It's been the president now.

2132
01:50:17,250 --> 01:50:19,810
It's three years straight of sunglasses wearing.

2133
01:50:19,950 --> 01:50:20,470
Sure.

2134
01:50:21,690 --> 01:50:25,390
Anyway, then what happens is like a back and forth.

2135
01:50:25,470 --> 01:50:28,990
Oh, wait, it is a little more that the teachers and the Ninja Turtles

2136
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:31,870
and the parents and the Pooh Bear all do their part.

2137
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:33,650
Did he say the Pooh Bear?

2138
01:50:33,650 --> 01:50:34,470
Pooh Bear.

2139
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:34,970
He did.

2140
01:50:35,070 --> 01:50:36,210
That is in the transcript.

2141
01:50:36,210 --> 01:50:37,650
It's on all of us.

2142
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:41,110
The teachers have to work with the Pooh Bear, not against the Pooh Bear.

2143
01:50:42,650 --> 01:50:44,390
I'm surprised he hasn't brought up the Pooh Bear.

2144
01:50:44,410 --> 01:50:47,850
It doesn't matter how rumbly in his tummy the Pooh Bear is.

2145
01:50:48,370 --> 01:50:52,250
He needs to do his stoutness exercises and he needs to keep kids off drugs.

2146
01:50:52,370 --> 01:50:53,730
He's ripped his bottom open.

2147
01:50:53,930 --> 01:50:55,250
Yeah, he ripped it open.

2148
01:50:55,370 --> 01:50:56,330
All the stuffing came out.

2149
01:50:56,330 --> 01:50:59,230
His brain might be stuffed and fluffed, but that doesn't mean he died.

2150
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:01,050
He knows drugs are bad.

2151
01:51:02,650 --> 01:51:06,050
Then he then a bunch of people all make more comments.

2152
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:09,450
And then it becomes a big like, you know, cross examination.

2153
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:12,770
But again, everyone agrees we have to do we do this for two hours.

2154
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:14,910
Yeah, let's put Roy Disney on the stand.

2155
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:17,830
And then I just like this question.

2156
01:51:18,010 --> 01:51:19,770
We get into the logistics of it.

2157
01:51:21,730 --> 01:51:21,970
Mr.

2158
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:24,570
Disney, what seems to us just like a normal depiction

2159
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:28,490
of on a television screen of all these different characters we've seen in our

2160
01:51:28,490 --> 01:51:32,010
childhood, as well as watching our children grow that have never been

2161
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:34,290
what they have never been together before.

2162
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:35,410
Is that a big deal?

2163
01:51:35,410 --> 01:51:39,470
Is it a big deal that Daffy Duck appears with the Ninja Turtle or whatever?

2164
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:41,390
From a property rights standpoint?

2165
01:51:42,450 --> 01:51:43,930
And the answer is yes.

2166
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:44,530
Mr.

2167
01:51:44,670 --> 01:51:46,310
Biden, it remains a big deal.

2168
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:49,670
It is a very like, of course, this blew all of our minds.

2169
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:53,750
I do I do kind of appreciate that he's trying to wrap his head around like

2170
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:54,090
he knows.

2171
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:55,010
I don't know.

2172
01:51:55,010 --> 01:51:56,350
Difference between Turtle and Duck.

2173
01:51:56,350 --> 01:51:57,090
I don't know.

2174
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:59,510
I was when I was a kid, there were no cartoons.

2175
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:00,730
Depression.

2176
01:52:00,950 --> 01:52:02,330
We all had we all had sticks.

2177
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:05,070
And they're on the back pages of the newspaper.

2178
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:06,850
They didn't move.

2179
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:07,830
They had no color.

2180
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:09,630
They thought it would get us too excitable.

2181
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:13,170
But now today, animations come to light.

2182
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:15,670
And is that not does that not encourage drug use?

2183
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:19,570
The trippiness of a car to color cartoon talking to you.

2184
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:21,750
Surprising that the Republicans have not

2185
01:52:22,650 --> 01:52:24,410
dug this up.

2186
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:25,690
Yeah, I am against it.

2187
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:26,350
Oh, yeah.

2188
01:52:26,370 --> 01:52:26,770
Uh huh.

2189
01:52:26,830 --> 01:52:30,110
No, this will come out in the Hunter investigation.

2190
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:32,750
And also it occurred to me is in all of this,

2191
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:33,750
Mr.

2192
01:52:33,930 --> 01:52:36,410
Biden, great job keeping your kids off crack.

2193
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:36,850
Yeah.

2194
01:52:37,290 --> 01:52:40,310
Well, gee whiz that maybe he was a little older, though.

2195
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:42,530
So he didn't watch the special at the right time.

2196
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:42,870
Yeah.

2197
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:42,970
Yeah.

2198
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:43,630
That's well.

2199
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:45,350
And the characters didn't matter to him.

2200
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:45,930
Yeah, exactly.

2201
01:52:46,090 --> 01:52:46,910
We're in his character.

2202
01:52:46,930 --> 01:52:47,130
Yeah.

2203
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:49,390
It would have had to be for animated funds.

2204
01:52:49,630 --> 01:52:49,830
Yeah.

2205
01:52:49,850 --> 01:52:50,290
Yes.

2206
01:52:50,610 --> 01:52:51,050
Fine.

2207
01:52:51,090 --> 01:52:56,210
We need funds and the funds dog to go to and team up with Cleopatra.

2208
01:52:56,350 --> 01:53:00,110
When the party we can teach Cleopatra not to turn people to stone

2209
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:02,410
or you can teach kids not to do drugs.

2210
01:53:02,410 --> 01:53:05,010
So honor part of family to 39.

2211
01:53:05,650 --> 01:53:06,150
Mr.

2212
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:09,610
President, did you or did you not drink two

2213
01:53:09,610 --> 01:53:12,110
fridge beers from your wooden crate

2214
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:15,190
while you watch cartoon all stars to the rescue?

2215
01:53:15,190 --> 01:53:15,590
I don't know.

2216
01:53:15,610 --> 01:53:16,370
I lost track.

2217
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:17,130
I lost track.

2218
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:19,050
Well, that says something.

2219
01:53:19,110 --> 01:53:19,850
Hang on.

2220
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:20,250
Hang on.

2221
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:20,910
That's bullhicky.

2222
01:53:21,190 --> 01:53:22,210
That's that's that's you.

2223
01:53:22,210 --> 01:53:22,490
We do.

2224
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:23,590
Ian Louie.

2225
01:53:26,410 --> 01:53:29,890
Well, if you'd played closer attention, you would have seen you.

2226
01:53:29,890 --> 01:53:30,190
We do.

2227
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:30,790
Ian Louie.

2228
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:34,870
Anyway, I was just tickled by that.

2229
01:53:35,010 --> 01:53:36,370
And then and then

2230
01:53:36,850 --> 01:53:40,230
Richard Frank from Disney does answer about how like,

2231
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:41,870
you know, we had to make sure they were drawn properly,

2232
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:43,610
that their voice inflections are used, right,

2233
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:45,830
that they're drawn to the right scale and the right size.

2234
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:51,210
So Congress got this DVD commentary special for the or a hash got to hear

2235
01:53:51,210 --> 01:53:55,770
about how Winnie the Pooh had to be drawn proportionally to the Ninja Turtles.

2236
01:53:57,010 --> 01:53:58,270
God, that's so crazy.

2237
01:53:58,350 --> 01:53:58,990
Is that nuts?

2238
01:53:59,190 --> 01:54:00,410
This whole transcript.

2239
01:54:01,530 --> 01:54:02,490
Cocaine caterpillars.

2240
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:03,910
Cocaine caterpillars.

2241
01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:05,390
Did you that they could use that.

2242
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:06,110
Did you, Mr.

2243
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:08,810
President, not advocate for the use of cocaine

2244
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:10,070
for the funding?

2245
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:12,990
Have you not robbed this country of a billion dollars

2246
01:54:12,990 --> 01:54:15,990
to put it into a cocaine caterpillar plan?

2247
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:19,490
It is like.

2248
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:25,970
Oh, oh, there was a certain thing in the air, I feel like when we were kids,

2249
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:30,370
where adults, especially politicians, just talked about children

2250
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:34,970
like they were aliens, like they just don't know how to reach them.

2251
01:54:36,090 --> 01:54:39,330
And these cartoons seem to do it as a cartoon seem to do it.

2252
01:54:39,330 --> 01:54:41,830
And I guess that happens now, too.

2253
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:44,330
Like, like just get one.

2254
01:54:44,330 --> 01:54:44,870
Someone please.

2255
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:47,830
Everyone is every nut job on the right.

2256
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:50,770
It's just Helen Lovejoy screaming about one.

2257
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:52,870
Someone please think about the children.

2258
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:56,510
But I hope people understand them a little more.

2259
01:54:57,010 --> 01:55:02,710
I hope you wonderful fathers will give your children a little more grace.

2260
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:03,950
Or you just turn into like Liberati.

2261
01:55:04,050 --> 01:55:05,150
You're like, are you wonderful?

2262
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:07,930
May you shine.

2263
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:10,430
He was cut from this.

2264
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:12,950
He was cut from their animated cartoon.

2265
01:55:13,190 --> 01:55:14,230
Liberace real quick.

2266
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:16,510
Three rounds of our cartoon.

2267
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:20,210
If we wanted to put a draft of cartoon also our team right now,

2268
01:55:20,650 --> 01:55:24,450
just do it like three rounds of each picking our own favorite.

2269
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:26,010
And then it could be anything.

2270
01:55:26,010 --> 01:55:28,330
It doesn't have to necessarily be related to the podcast.

2271
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:29,110
Dizzy Devil.

2272
01:55:29,350 --> 01:55:32,070
And I want him to like just break the rules.

2273
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:33,730
I want to see him do cocaine.

2274
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:35,670
I want to see him spiral through cocaine.

2275
01:55:35,890 --> 01:55:36,690
And then like, what is that?

2276
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:38,790
Then he just turns into the speed of light.

2277
01:55:39,870 --> 01:55:41,950
And his voice has to pitch way up.

2278
01:55:42,390 --> 01:55:43,970
You can't understand him anymore.

2279
01:55:44,330 --> 01:55:46,910
But then he comes down and you see it was not good for him to do.

2280
01:55:46,910 --> 01:55:47,030
Perfect.

2281
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:48,810
Jasey Devil is Tiny Toons.

2282
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:49,110
Yeah.

2283
01:55:49,190 --> 01:55:49,650
Is that correct?

2284
01:55:49,690 --> 01:55:49,970
OK.

2285
01:55:49,970 --> 01:55:51,310
You're the Tiny Toons fan.

2286
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:52,890
No, I couldn't remember.

2287
01:55:53,170 --> 01:55:56,190
I remember that he was purple and I loved that he was purple.

2288
01:55:56,270 --> 01:55:57,830
Where would Dizzy be from otherwise?

2289
01:55:58,150 --> 01:55:59,370
I don't know.

2290
01:55:59,930 --> 01:56:01,610
Well, he could have been in high.

2291
01:56:01,690 --> 01:56:03,110
He could have been friends with Hot Stuff, Little Devil.

2292
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:04,370
But you should know that, too.

2293
01:56:04,410 --> 01:56:05,730
Well, oh, can that be mine?

2294
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:06,210
That's right.

2295
01:56:07,390 --> 01:56:08,570
A different devil.

2296
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:09,830
Yeah, different devil.

2297
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:10,870
OK, how does he do?

2298
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:12,870
Do you have any sort of thoughts on what Hot Stuff would be?

2299
01:56:13,010 --> 01:56:14,530
How like he would approach the situation?

2300
01:56:17,310 --> 01:56:18,030
He would

2301
01:56:18,670 --> 01:56:20,250
he would have his little

2302
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:23,930
this poker, his poker poker, his pitchfork.

2303
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:26,130
Like we would assault him.

2304
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:26,750
Oh, God.

2305
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:29,310
He would stab them with his little devil stick.

2306
01:56:29,330 --> 01:56:30,590
You can jam in the butt.

2307
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:32,730
Yeah.

2308
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:33,210
OK.

2309
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:34,510
I'm going to pick.

2310
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:39,510
I think I'm going to pick Napoleon Bonafrog from the Ninja Turtles.

2311
01:56:40,370 --> 01:56:43,170
He's kind of got the same sort of stoner vibe, but I think,

2312
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:46,530
yeah, in a situation here, he would have he'd be reformed

2313
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:49,390
and be able to give some insight onto the process of getting clean.

2314
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:50,090
Sure.

2315
01:56:50,490 --> 01:56:52,630
But anybody else would want to go around again?

2316
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:52,850
Yeah.

2317
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:54,290
Vlasic Pickle Stork.

2318
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:54,590
Great.

2319
01:56:54,690 --> 01:56:55,130
Fantastic.

2320
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:59,030
I'd like to put a pickle in your mouth instead of a blind.

2321
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:02,670
He's a he's a very like upstanding citizen.

2322
01:57:02,870 --> 01:57:04,330
He's a little bit of a square, too.

2323
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:05,770
So you get that perspective, I feel like.

2324
01:57:05,910 --> 01:57:06,130
Yeah.

2325
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:07,170
Yeah.

2326
01:57:07,190 --> 01:57:07,530
Yeah.

2327
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:08,030
Yeah.

2328
01:57:08,030 --> 01:57:08,850
For older generation.

2329
01:57:09,190 --> 01:57:09,250
Yes.

2330
01:57:09,530 --> 01:57:09,790
Yeah.

2331
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:11,530
Baby Huey.

2332
01:57:11,650 --> 01:57:12,590
OK, you're going Harvey.

2333
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:14,050
Jason wants all Harvey.

2334
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:17,650
And baby Huey, baby Huey is a baby.

2335
01:57:17,970 --> 01:57:18,610
Yes.

2336
01:57:18,610 --> 01:57:20,550
So he's really impressionable.

2337
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:21,850
He's got to be careful.

2338
01:57:21,870 --> 01:57:25,690
Like what that powder is that is that typey powder?

2339
01:57:26,770 --> 01:57:28,690
So does he get diapered with cocaine?

2340
01:57:29,770 --> 01:57:31,810
They put cocaine on his bottom accidentally.

2341
01:57:32,410 --> 01:57:35,450
Maybe or maybe just like sneeze it.

2342
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:40,070
Yeah, there is always the gag is sneezing baby powder gets sprayed everywhere.

2343
01:57:40,210 --> 01:57:40,850
OK.

2344
01:57:41,350 --> 01:57:43,030
So for him, it's cocaine.

2345
01:57:43,030 --> 01:57:45,290
Baby Huey get energy.

2346
01:57:46,870 --> 01:57:48,490
Baby Huey like this.

2347
01:57:49,150 --> 01:57:49,150
OK.

2348
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:51,310
I really like this.

2349
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:53,750
I choose a

2350
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:58,250
ruby cartoon, Ruben Kincaid, the Partridge family manager

2351
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:01,310
from Partridge Family 3099 or whatever,

2352
01:58:01,850 --> 01:58:04,330
because he's sort of the adult in the room and he's got, you know,

2353
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:05,650
he's got to be in charge of things.

2354
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:07,830
So he sort of has to be the wrangler of all these characters

2355
01:58:07,830 --> 01:58:08,910
because they're all so different.

2356
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:12,810
And he has to sort of figure out how to wrangle these characters

2357
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:15,070
in the same way that he has to wrangle a family band.

2358
01:58:15,490 --> 01:58:15,970
Yeah.

2359
01:58:16,630 --> 01:58:17,110
Great.

2360
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:17,690
Yeah.

2361
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:17,990
That's tough.

2362
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:18,490
Yeah.

2363
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:18,670
Uh huh.

2364
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:19,270
Yeah.

2365
01:58:19,330 --> 01:58:19,690
Get it.

2366
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:23,110
And he's like watching from the side of the stage while they do their performance.

2367
01:58:23,110 --> 01:58:23,990
Like Ruben.

2368
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:25,730
Yeah, that's good for that's a good role for him.

2369
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:26,370
That's good.

2370
01:58:26,890 --> 01:58:32,110
I'm going to toss in 90s Peter Parker and the polo shirt.

2371
01:58:32,110 --> 01:58:32,490
OK.

2372
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:33,030
Our tune.

2373
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:34,390
Not the cool.

2374
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:38,890
They made him cooler later on with like a T-shirt and an open button up.

2375
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:39,230
Right.

2376
01:58:39,370 --> 01:58:42,050
But he had a very square polo.

2377
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:43,710
They made him really on that cartoon, though.

2378
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:45,390
He was jacked and he had a cool voice.

2379
01:58:45,590 --> 01:58:46,230
He was very jacked.

2380
01:58:46,290 --> 01:58:49,250
It was the guy who played what's his name from and Greg Brady in the movies

2381
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:50,710
and the Brady Bunch movies.

2382
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:51,270
Oh, yeah.

2383
01:58:51,330 --> 01:58:52,370
Oh, forget his name.

2384
01:58:52,370 --> 01:58:52,630
Yeah.

2385
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:53,270
Christopher something.

2386
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:54,330
Prince Eric, too.

2387
01:58:54,910 --> 01:58:55,410
Oh, yeah.

2388
01:58:55,610 --> 01:58:56,050
Yeah.

2389
01:58:56,370 --> 01:58:58,330
So and then Nimgaloo's in, of course.

2390
01:58:58,450 --> 01:58:59,190
Nimgaloo's in there.

2391
01:58:59,330 --> 01:58:59,590
Yeah.

2392
01:59:00,210 --> 01:59:04,690
And most of the song, most of the King Features syndicate characters as well.

2393
01:59:04,850 --> 01:59:05,290
Yeah.

2394
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:07,070
Almost all of them.

2395
01:59:07,090 --> 01:59:07,950
Just jam them all.

2396
01:59:08,010 --> 01:59:08,250
Yeah.

2397
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:09,230
Just crowd shot.

2398
01:59:11,030 --> 01:59:12,910
Well, interesting, educational.

2399
01:59:13,450 --> 01:59:16,630
I hope this episode keeps you the listener off of drugs forever.

2400
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:17,250
Yeah.

2401
01:59:17,670 --> 01:59:18,890
I hope we scared you straight.

2402
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:21,690
And oh, wait.

2403
01:59:21,810 --> 01:59:26,470
And before I wrap it up, I got to mention if you want, if you like this special,

2404
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:31,310
if you watch the special to watch this episode Saturday morning, All Star Hits,

2405
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:36,490
the show I got to do with Mooney and Ben Jones culminates in the seventh episode

2406
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:39,590
of it's called Tape Seven Danger that is on Netflix.

2407
01:59:39,890 --> 01:59:40,630
And it culminates.

2408
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:42,450
It's kind of it's though if you didn't see the show,

2409
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:45,890
entire alternate universe of Saturday morning cartoons,

2410
01:59:46,410 --> 01:59:50,250
which then culminates in a cartoon all stars of the characters

2411
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:54,750
who don't exist otherwise with but also with people

2412
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:57,350
from the other blocks that you don't get to see.

2413
01:59:57,690 --> 02:00:02,090
So it's some characters you've seen, but then it's like the meeps

2414
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:05,990
and their villain, Bleaky Gloomer, who you haven't seen until this.

2415
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:08,550
But you get from context that it's an all star.

2416
02:00:08,930 --> 02:00:12,370
Anyway, it was really fun to like dive into this and try to figure out

2417
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:15,810
what made it tick and do what I think is the only parody of it

2418
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:17,670
that exists out there.

2419
02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:18,190
Yeah.

2420
02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:19,570
I think so.

2421
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:23,430
Was it was an and also, and if that doesn't sell you on it.

2422
02:00:23,430 --> 02:00:26,890
Oh, wait, part of Frank Welker, the great Frank Welker is in that

2423
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:28,450
and is in the real thing.

2424
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:30,150
Baby Kermit in the real thing.

2425
02:00:30,190 --> 02:00:33,770
And then wait, the guy slimer, right?

2426
02:00:34,290 --> 02:00:35,630
Well, he's slimer to slimer.

2427
02:00:35,630 --> 02:00:36,950
Oh, yeah, that seems right.

2428
02:00:36,990 --> 02:00:37,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2429
02:00:37,710 --> 02:00:38,230
I think so.

2430
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:41,490
And then he's he's in our thing as Ronnie Selfish,

2431
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:42,570
the villain of Pro Bros.

2432
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:45,410
So it's very cool recording it and realizing, oh, shit,

2433
02:00:45,410 --> 02:00:47,690
you were in the real thing was super cool.

2434
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:48,110
Yeah.

2435
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:51,350
And then in this one, gender flopped.

2436
02:00:51,570 --> 02:00:55,730
So it's like a it's a girl who's having she's it's not about doing drugs.

2437
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:56,910
It's about saying shut up.

2438
02:00:57,030 --> 02:00:59,170
And there's a girl who started to say shut up.

2439
02:00:59,170 --> 02:01:03,050
And her younger brother is like a little wiener who's worried for her.

2440
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:05,750
And the design of the younger brother is based on me,

2441
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:07,490
is based on three year old me.

2442
02:01:08,410 --> 02:01:13,150
So if you want to see me in a even meeker

2443
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:16,050
cartoon, all stars in the Kyle Mooney verse, check that out.

2444
02:01:16,170 --> 02:01:16,290
Yeah.

2445
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:18,750
And do I do it before it gets pulled off?

2446
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:22,970
For some reason, I check every once in a while to make sure.

2447
02:01:23,290 --> 02:01:25,150
I don't think Netflix has started doing the yanking.

2448
02:01:25,910 --> 02:01:25,910
Yeah.

2449
02:01:26,610 --> 02:01:27,690
Yeah, they don't do.

2450
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:28,310
Yeah.

2451
02:01:28,770 --> 02:01:32,990
These surely extremely financially beneficial yanking of shows.

2452
02:01:33,050 --> 02:01:36,390
They must really got to rake it in from this.

2453
02:01:36,390 --> 02:01:37,730
This will save the company.

2454
02:01:37,730 --> 02:01:38,050
Yeah.

2455
02:01:38,210 --> 02:01:39,110
Having less content.

2456
02:01:39,570 --> 02:01:39,570
Right.

2457
02:01:40,290 --> 02:01:43,810
Anyway, check that all all cartoon stars say don't say shut up.

2458
02:01:44,190 --> 02:01:46,790
But for now, thanks for listening about Cartoon All-Stars to the rescue.
