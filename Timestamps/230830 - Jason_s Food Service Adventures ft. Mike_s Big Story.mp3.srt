1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,240
A blowout is what we're dealing with here.

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,640
That's what we're diving into here on podcast,

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,680
The Ride Club Three.

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,960
The only way you could describe what happened in the poll,

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,480
a blowout like you've never seen,

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,000
like frankly like you've never seen before.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,320
Mike Jason, hi, welcome.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,160
Hi.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,240
It's very flattering, it's very flattering

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,080
when people wanna know about our personal,

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,400
our continuity, our personal continuity.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,160
Well, I mean, is it still when it's about

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,560
our personal embarrassments,

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,720
at least in your case's personal embarrassments.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,600
I see it differently.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
I see the audience thinks of us now as fictional characters,

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,520
like the great fictional characters,

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,600
like Atticus Finch or Jay Gatsby.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,320
They think of us now in that way,

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,240
and they just wanna know about our trials and tribulations.

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,320
So, sometimes it's hard, they're not even thinking about,

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,280
oh, we're gonna have to make one of the hosts

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,600
bring up some really like unpleasant memories

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,880
or memories where he was an idiot or failed or whatever.

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,360
Like they've unlocked secret texts seemingly.

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,480
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,800
Like, wow, did you know this one never got published?

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,760
Well, it's getting published today.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,600
Yeah, it is.

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,240
Just stats wise, interesting from the perspective of,

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,960
I was like, I knew this was the biggest victor by far,

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,160
but I didn't know that the whole time

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,280
we've been doing these Club 3 polls,

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,800
no topic has ever gotten more than 50% of the vote.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,400
This, we're dealing with 67.

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,240
Wow.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,080
Over two thirds.

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,400
It's not quite rushing.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,720
It's not quite Reagan winning reelection, I don't think,

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,880
as far as popular vote.

42
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,240
I can't remember, maybe it is.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,720
Close to, it's yet similar.

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,560
Yeah, similar.

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,720
Marvel Adventure City in Niagara Falls

46
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
only carried Wisconsin.

47
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,280
Is that the correct state?

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,080
I don't remember where we're on, Dale.

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
But yeah, way ahead.

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,200
So, we'll get into our mandate here,

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,480
but the runner-up, cartoon all-stars to the rescue

52
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,480
from 1990, the somewhat notorious anti-drug video

53
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,760
starring all of our favorite cartoon characters of the time,

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,080
or at least the ones that Disney

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,800
or the other companies would loan.

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,720
Yeah.

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,200
And of course, President George Bush,

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,320
to keep things in the political.

59
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,360
Keep things exciting.

60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,520
Yeah.

61
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,440
So yeah, hey, that's tailor-made for us, could be great.

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,560
Back at 12% behind.

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,000
I think that's the lowest runner-up number.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,920
Wow.

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
But yeah, could be a good one.

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,600
If you got anything else, suggest it,

67
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,360
and we'll see if we can beat it,

68
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,440
but that'll be the incumbent for the next one.

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,280
Wow.

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,200
But for now, we dive into, I mean, okay, on the poll,

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,640
we called it Jason's Food Service Adventures

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
featuring Mike's Big Story.

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,680
Oh, I didn't write down who suggested it.

74
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,520
My apologies.

75
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,320
I know there's like a couple of people nominated it.

76
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,800
I credit Aaron within the episode with saying,

77
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,520
hey, let's maybe do the stories episode.

78
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
Let's combine them.

79
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,080
Stories made it, thanks to whoever officially

80
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,880
did the nomination, but now we're here.

81
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,880
That featuring designation, I don't mean to downplay

82
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,840
anything that Jason's about to bring to the table.

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,880
No, not at all, please.

84
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,640
No, that's the main event.

85
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
That's what I feel.

86
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,160
Yeah, I was gonna say, it feels like the feature

87
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,560
that might overtake the main artist.

88
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,760
This is the Nicki Minaj on Monster.

89
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,760
Oh, yeah, yeah.

90
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,200
It could, I don't know.

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,040
I mean, it's up to you.

92
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,640
It's hey, it's your shot, only you can tell us.

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,200
But it is it's Starship featuring Mickey Thomas.

94
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,320
Is it like, is the Mickey Thomas,

95
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,280
maybe he thinks he's a big draw there,

96
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,640
but I would still say the Starship,

97
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,400
the idea of Starship and playing all the Jefferson Airplane

98
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,120
songs and stuff, that might be more appealing

99
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,280
to a lot of people than just hearing Mickey Thomas say.

100
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,880
Well, yeah, maybe sometimes the featuring can be

101
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,080
kind of a sad assertion of your own power.

102
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,920
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,920
So yeah, featuring can be all kinds of things.

104
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,320
But that being said, it's gonna feel like

105
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,880
it's what we gotta build to.

106
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,720
Yeah, I agree.

107
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,800
And I think that we, let's just go in that order

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,840
and let's dive into Jason's Food Service Adventures.

109
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,080
As uncovered in the last episode, if he somehow missed it,

110
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,120
Aaron said the word waffle while discussing

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,760
a okay breakfast at the Vegas Rainforest Cafe.

112
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
And then that split us off.

113
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,800
And this whole world of Jason, we had no idea about

114
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,800
making waffles in his college as part of a work study.

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
It was only because it was like one to one.

116
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,160
It's like, oh, I've made waffles before.

117
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,120
No, it wasn't a tangent.

118
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,880
Yeah, yeah, you were speaking from expertise.

119
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,160
Never, never, you don't ever have to explain

120
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
why you brought up the fact that you were making waffles.

121
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
No, don't apologize.

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,080
Never apologize.

123
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,520
We celebrate that this was brought up.

124
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,120
Never having to apologize for bringing out

125
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,480
how you made waffles in college.

126
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,800
Waffle complications, yeah.

127
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,280
Yeah, so I mean, I guess just to explain,

128
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,800
I, like a lot of people who went to college,

129
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,800
had a work study assignment and a part-time.

130
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,160
That is that there is some money guaranteed here,

131
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,120
money knocked off tuition, assuming that you do this gig.

132
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,200
Yes, so you do the gig and you get paid hourly

133
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,320
and you put it towards living expenses, books.

134
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,720
Okay, okay.

135
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,560
And I was probably mostly buying

136
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,760
takeout calzones and comic books.

137
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,040
Was everybody a freshman?

138
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,920
What's the amount?

139
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,600
What's the amount that you gave freshman 15?

140
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,440
I was gonna say 40, I thought that was overshooting.

141
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,280
Freshman 40.

142
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,640
No, freshman 40.

143
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,480
I gave freshman 40 during the first year of baby,

144
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,280
I feel like, but not in college.

145
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,480
No, no, you look for that.

146
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,920
I actually lost weight freshman year

147
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,000
because Ithaca is so elevated, the campus is in a hill

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,280
and there's so much declines, inclines and stairs and stuff.

149
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,160
That would have been me if I went to Pepperdine.

150
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,120
I remember the right of my school, Loyola Mary Mount.

151
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,000
That is a very like in the Malibu Hills.

152
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,080
I think you're on stairs nonstop.

153
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,000
So, okay, okay, so you like naturally worked some stuff off.

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,480
Or at least broke even

155
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,640
because ice cream counter at dinner every night.

156
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,680
Calzones, wait, that's a good question.

157
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,080
What is like the worst thing?

158
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,560
Because getting to college is a big,

159
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,920
and I imagine for all of us,

160
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,160
sure there's getting to go drink and your parents are gone,

161
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,760
but maybe more like, you mean I can get this

162
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,240
in the cafeteria all the time?

163
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Mine was that they had bread bowls.

164
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,320
I would get just like bread bowls and clam chowder

165
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,360
too often.

166
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,280
Like not a thing to have.

167
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,040
You eat the whole bread bowl?

168
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,880
Yeah, thanks for the meal.

169
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,560
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't shock me.

170
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
Yeah, all right, no, I think not that I-

171
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,080
This is funny.

172
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,840
Like bread bowls in the last decade I've had,

173
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,760
if that, are at California Adventure.

174
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,600
California Adventure.

175
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,400
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,080
And even then I'm like, I'm doing a couple of dips

177
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,560
and I'm still leaving that bottom,

178
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,920
but in college I'm devouring that bread bowl.

179
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,120
I, the first semester,

180
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,280
I think I was definitely trying everything.

181
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,800
So like I would talk to my dad or whatever on Sundays.

182
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,960
And I was like, oh yeah, I just ate dinner.

183
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,680
I had half a slice of pizza, half a cheeseburger,

184
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
some pasta, a salad, like not finishing everything,

185
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,400
but just trying to be like,

186
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,040
trying to figure out what's good.

187
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,840
Like the very hungry caterpillar.

188
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,680
Like the very-

189
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,080
To talk about kids' books that were,

190
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,800
is that it, or Hungry Little Caterpillar?

191
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
I don't remember, something like that.

192
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,480
Yeah.

193
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,560
I read it and I don't remember the name.

194
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,880
I was home visiting recently

195
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,240
and my mom had found some old like kids' books.

196
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,280
And I forget the exact name of this book,

197
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,120
maybe you guys know,

198
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,560
but she said it without the context.

199
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,240
Like I was, I didn't know she found the books

200
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,080
or I didn't see it.

201
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,240
And she's like, oh, did you see the hungry stranger?

202
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
And I was like, do you mean outside?

203
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,560
And she's like, no, the book, it's on the floor over there.

204
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,040
And it's like, oh, I think it was a kid's book

205
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,240
called The Case of the Hungry Stranger or something.

206
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,320
No, there wasn't a hungry stranger outside your house.

207
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,560
Like you're not getting in on your family dinner.

208
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Any pies getting left out today?

209
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,080
I mean, that'd be you more than it'd be a stranger.

210
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,920
Exactly.

211
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,920
So I worked work study in the one big dining hall

212
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,560
at college at Ithaca.

213
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,640
The dining hall was mostly run by work study students.

214
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,480
I will say primarily poorly trained work study students

215
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,720
and then actual like union employee,

216
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,440
like union prep cooks, like, who know what they're doing.

217
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,720
People who know what they're doing,

218
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,600
who are then given 18 year olds with no training.

219
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Like I didn't know about, I don't quite know how,

220
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,080
do you know the concept of like shift meal or crew meal?

221
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,400
You explained this last time

222
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,280
that you had to get there early.

223
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,760
I had to get there half an hour before

224
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,280
and I clocked in early and then you eat,

225
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,760
but that means you didn't really get a lunch break.

226
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,120
And I think this is a restaurant industry thing.

227
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,960
Yeah.

228
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
I used to, I film weddings sometimes

229
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
and there'd be like, okay, well everybody like.

230
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,880
Oh, everyone eat at once.

231
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,280
Yeah, or like all the way at the end or whatever.

232
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,080
Anyway, sure.

233
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,040
Okay.

234
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,360
So you're making lifelong friends, I'm sure.

235
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,360
Lifelong friends, everyone I rate,

236
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,240
a lot of people either sleep deprived or hungover

237
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,680
and just hustling for that six or $7 an hour in 2003 money.

238
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,440
God, is that what it was?

239
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,280
Yeah.

240
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,880
So, so not a lot of training.

241
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,240
So the first semester I was assigned like

242
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,200
Saturday morning shift, like Saturday brunch

243
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,120
and no one's in good shape Saturday mornings.

244
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,600
Like.

245
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,960
Oh wait, I was gonna ask how many days a week

246
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,800
you're doing this.

247
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,400
I just did it like the one day a week, the first semester

248
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,720
and then the second semester I did two days a week.

249
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,800
And like two days a week dinner shift,

250
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,760
which kind of sucked.

251
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,240
It was just the way my classes were.

252
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,000
All my classes were early.

253
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,160
So I had the nights free and that was too often

254
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,120
to be working at the dining hall.

255
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,960
Okay, yes.

256
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,080
Yeah.

257
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
So you're dreading the end that you're working

258
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,440
Saturday morning, the thing nobody wants to be doing.

259
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Yes.

260
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,120
In college.

261
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,640
And let me, okay, some things that were established

262
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,880
in the last one, this is as far as we made it.

263
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,000
And then I kind of, I re-listened to know like

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,680
what stories were left and teased.

265
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,640
It mainly came up because you were a little waffle maker

266
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,960
with a little hat and a little apron.

267
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,920
Yes.

268
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,600
This would require you to deal with a nasty syrup vat

269
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,520
is what you said you do.

270
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,320
You do not like the consistency of the.

271
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,480
Yeah, I mean, if you pay attention in any cafeteria

272
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,400
dining hall setting like that, you realize like,

273
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,400
oh, that they're making omelets with a vat of eggs,

274
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,520
of scrambled eggs.

275
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,240
Like that is not cracked fresh.

276
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Like better to ask for an egg over easy

277
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
where they have to crack it fresh, you know?

278
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, yeah, yeah.

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,160
Oh, this is similar in like some,

280
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,440
I've been staying at Embassy Sweets,

281
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,480
which I recommend the brand.

282
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
I like Embassy Sweets. Sure.

283
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,120
But you get free breakfast, but that vat of eggs.

284
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,160
That is not fresh. Tread carefully.

285
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,000
Tread carefully.

286
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,320
But you also, I've been surprised that Embassy Sweets

287
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,400
have the like actual omelet bar.

288
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,560
Oh really? Just as a free, yeah.

289
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,560
So that's, yeah, you wanna watch them make your,

290
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,720
they'll make the same thing.

291
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,240
They'll just make you scrambled eggs.

292
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,600
Right, but sure. You don't wanna go out of that

293
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,160
that egg beaters egg, but what a horrendous.

294
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,000
I can't imagine. Pretty nasty.

295
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,160
Is anybody into egg beaters somehow out there?

296
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,120
I prefer them weirdly.

297
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,600
I don't, there's gotta be somebody.

298
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,720
Someone out there. Yeah, yeah.

299
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,440
I don't know. Maybe it's just a weird thing with me.

300
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,320
It also, it mainly sparked our interest

301
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,960
that you would come home with pockets full of cups and forks.

302
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,240
Yeah, just like cleaning up.

303
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,640
Like they would give you like,

304
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,360
people would leave stuff on counters or like,

305
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,880
oh, if you see something dirty, clean it up and stuff.

306
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,520
And you're just kinda like grabbing stuff or cleaning up

307
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,640
or like they kept giving me utensils to like scrape off

308
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,320
excess waffle from the things.

309
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,480
The cups and forks I think was in sophomore year,

310
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,040
one semester pretty much the whole time.

311
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,680
I was in the dish room.

312
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,440
You know, the conveyor belt that you put like your tray on

313
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,120
and plates on, I was on the other side, like pulling it off.

314
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
Oh my God.

315
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,360
Which was. I cannot imagine you doing this.

316
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,240
It's unusually meditative, but it's like hell on earth.

317
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,000
It's the most humid place imaginable.

318
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,520
I can't, I just, I just picture the airplane gag

319
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,240
with the sweat, like just pouring down your head.

320
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
That semester I left covered in flop sweat every shift.

321
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,200
Yeah, I think I know exactly what this looked like.

322
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,400
Not that this is a fun job that anyone would like

323
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,840
or that anyone wouldn't feel stressed about.

324
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,960
I just can't imagine you just do constantly pulling dishes

325
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,240
for like hours and hours.

326
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,120
Well, cause you just like are dumping them

327
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,560
and then they go through a cleaning vat.

328
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,000
And then the actual like full-time,

329
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,920
like people who run this room

330
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,080
and like run the back of the house,

331
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,760
they are doing the actual work.

332
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,760
So they let the 18, 19 year olds do the brainless stuff.

333
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,040
Funny I say brainless stuff

334
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,440
cause the worst part of that semester

335
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,680
there was this guy who I was in a bunch of classes with

336
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,680
and he, bless his heart, he was so dumb

337
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,120
and he just talked so much.

338
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,560
So those shifts sometimes felt twice as long.

339
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,400
Oh boy.

340
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,680
Cause I'm just sweating, dehydrated, like,

341
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,680
and then just this, like, I just like a Looney Tunes,

342
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,400
the mobsters on Looney Tunes, the little mobster

343
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,680
and his doofy henchmen.

344
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,440
It was like working with one of the doofy henchmen.

345
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,000
What did they sound like?

346
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,360
Does it, do you recall the,

347
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,920
if you had to do an impression of that character,

348
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,760
I'm trying to remember.

349
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,360
Oh, we gotta get him George.

350
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,200
Oh, right, right.

351
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,040
Like that kind of.

352
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

353
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,920
Which way did he, well, that's the dog, right?

354
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,280
Which way did he go George?

355
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,520
Which way did he go?

356
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,360
Yeah, yeah.

357
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,200
That's right.

358
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,920
Is he, did he mean well?

359
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,240
Like he's trying to pass the time?

360
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,120
Was he talking about his life or what you're doing?

361
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,840
I could never tell.

362
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,600
You were very rude to him.

363
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,880
No, I gave him the benefit of that so many times

364
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,720
and then I was just like,

365
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,560
there is another 90 minutes left in this shift

366
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,000
and he's still going.

367
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,560
My God.

368
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,360
But the, I think the position I worked,

369
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
I did scoop ice cream once or twice.

370
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Oh yeah, we, yes, this came up a little bit

371
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,000
and was left unflashed out, I think.

372
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,640
You got, you being an ice cream scooper.

373
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,520
It turned out like more uneventful than you would think.

374
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,160
I think the thing that stuck with me is that like.

375
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,760
What do you think we were picturing?

376
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Oh, me just killing a gallon?

377
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,600
Like we just.

378
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,680
Oh, like one scoop for you.

379
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,520
One scoop for me.

380
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,360
One scoop for me.

381
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,200
Yeah.

382
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,240
But like the thing that I didn't realize

383
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,000
until the very end of the shift, it's like,

384
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,360
oh right, we have to clean all this up

385
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,880
and there is like a toppings bar

386
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,240
and as much as I love marshmallow syrup,

387
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,080
like marshmallow goo, like you have to get

388
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,440
some elbow grease going to scrape that stuff off.

389
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,920
Yeah, you nodded to that.

390
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,400
Is that just, I can't even picture like marshmallow sauce.

391
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,480
That's just, it's kind of.

392
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,760
It's just a little and it's just a little.

393
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,600
It's a little thick.

394
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,440
Marshmallow goo.

395
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,280
A little runny, yeah.

396
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,160
The ice cream came after your,

397
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,640
you were shifted to ice cream after the incident

398
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,320
where you cut yourself. Stabbed myself.

399
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,160
Yes.

400
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,840
And scarred yourself permanently.

401
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,160
Can you show us that?

402
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,000
Is that clear?

403
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,640
I have to get closer to you maybe.

404
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,640
There's a small white scar right here on my, like.

405
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,760
Okay.

406
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,580
Okay.

407
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,420
So not insane.

408
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,360
I have a college related scar from not my own college,

409
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,960
but from visiting a friend at USC

410
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,760
and then like being in a pool area we weren't supposed to

411
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,680
and then suddenly getting caught, like, oh, they're coming.

412
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,640
The security guards are coming

413
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,200
and then having to scale a fence.

414
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,040
Oh my God.

415
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,120
With pointy tops.

416
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,800
And I got impaled.

417
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,620
Oh yeah.

418
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,920
And was like, if you can imagine,

419
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,280
pretty inebriated for this.

420
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,640
So I think not until the next morning did I realize like,

421
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,960
ooh, I'm going to be looking at that mark for years.

422
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,800
I think it's gone now,

423
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,760
but I would say for like three years I had,

424
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,080
it was like akin to that.

425
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,920
Yeah.

426
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,000
Maybe it's still there if you look close,

427
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,320
but those are, yeah, hey, college is scarring time,

428
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,200
I guess, if you're dumb.

429
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,900
Although do you, how do you rate your own?

430
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,680
Because you, you're slicing meat,

431
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,000
you're wearing the like the falconer glove.

432
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,400
Well, I'm wearing like a latex glove

433
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,800
and then the chain mail glove and then another latex glove.

434
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,060
And like, I don't, they told me to do that,

435
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,120
but it kind of didn't make sense to me

436
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,360
and it probably didn't help my grip.

437
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,680
Again, everything kind of poorly trained.

438
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,920
There was like a handful of full-time managers

439
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,840
and they couldn't have been older than 30, these people,

440
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,040
but one or two of them had such a stick up their ass.

441
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,200
Like, if you have time to lean,

442
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,240
you have time to clean, sort of asshole.

443
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,280
Okay, okay.

444
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,840
And that's, I was gonna say that I think the position

445
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,480
that I got into the most antics was this semester

446
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,880
I worked at the pizza and pasta counter.

447
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,560
Oh my God. Okay, all right, great.

448
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,400
So.

449
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,220
I don't think we did any of this.

450
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,600
Here we go, let's go.

451
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,440
Let's go.

452
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,360
So it was always like one or two employees

453
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,080
and then this guy, this older guy,

454
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,340
who I have no idea,

455
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,960
I cannot still to this day place his accent.

456
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,320
Like he could be Italian

457
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,480
or he could have escaped a Soviet block country

458
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,040
and like the CIA would really like to talk to him.

459
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,880
But he was really-

460
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,240
It's from the nation of generica.

461
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,600
Yeah, he really was very brusque

462
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,600
and he took making the shitty pizza very seriously

463
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,760
and the shitty pasta.

464
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,760
Like that was within the first week of school.

465
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,160
I'm like, okay, pizza and pasta lost cause.

466
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,440
Like this shit is not good.

467
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,040
Okay, yeah, yeah.

468
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,040
And so he could be very jovial,

469
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,400
but he was usually annoyed

470
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,480
probably because he had to watch 18 and 19 year olds so much.

471
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,960
So the pretty early on,

472
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,680
I think the most notable thing I did

473
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,680
was attempt to pick up a vat of marinara sauce

474
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,000
and very quickly drop it on the floor.

475
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,880
And the floor is now covered in marinara sauce.

476
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,520
Is this public facing floor or backstage?

477
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,480
Oh, this is public facing by the way.

478
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,960
If you had to put a equivalent like on your own height,

479
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,240
how much of your body is the vats?

480
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,120
How big is the vat?

481
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,920
I would say the vat is maybe like a foot deep.

482
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,760
Okay, wow.

483
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,200
Like this is a sizable thing.

484
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,920
And I think I probably just didn't use enough

485
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,280
of admit circular and it was just hot, hot, hot.

486
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,120
And then I just.

487
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,640
You just said no choice, this has to go.

488
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,480
This has to go.

489
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,320
Okay.

490
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,680
And.

491
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,520
Jason, oh man.

492
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,800
How much would you love to see Jason spilling a big fan

493
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,640
of marinara sauce?

494
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,440
Oh, it's all I want in this life.

495
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,240
No one is telling us how to do these jobs.

496
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
No one's telling us.

497
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,720
The one time I worked like in the prep kitchen,

498
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,320
the guy's like, okay, we're gonna chop these mushrooms.

499
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,840
So here's how you do this.

500
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,720
To prevent a cutting board from sliding,

501
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,040
you fold a towel and put it on the cutting board.

502
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,720
And then you chop the mushroom until you can chop it.

503
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,920
Like chop it in half, turn the flat,

504
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
and then just chop it fast.

505
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,160
And I was like, these are valuable skills to have

506
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,680
that I have not acquired in other roles.

507
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,560
So, towel under the cutting board,

508
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,760
if anyone's having trouble,

509
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,520
you're heading where it's sliding around.

510
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,360
That's a good tip.

511
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,640
That's a good tip for cooking at home.

512
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,760
But this thing, just like, how do you,

513
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,560
it's just go, go get it.

514
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,400
Go pick it up.

515
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,220
Go get it.

516
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,060
Start a fire, basically.

517
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,380
You know?

518
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,540
So, right next to the pizza and pasta,

519
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,220
I think I had some very good, like, specialized kitchens.

520
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,660
In the other dining hall, there was a vegan kitchen.

521
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,580
Kind of the first I ever encountered, like, vegan cuisine.

522
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,620
And that was nice,

523
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,780
because no matter what garbage they were serving,

524
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,700
you could always get sweet potato fries.

525
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,540
So, that's pretty nice.

526
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,220
And then next to the pizza and pasta

527
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,620
was the kosher kitchen.

528
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,300
So, everything prepared kosher.

529
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,420
They used their own, I think it was all disposable,

530
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,580
plates and forks and stuff.

531
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,540
And so, the food, a little better,

532
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,420
a little more, like, freshly made and stuff.

533
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,620
Notable, I remember the first time, like,

534
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,420
trying, like, a falafel pita.

535
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,740
I was like, oh, that looks really good.

536
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,740
And they're like, oh, we'll wrap one up for you.

537
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,740
But the one night, I specifically remember this,

538
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,900
because they had, like, a giant tray of chocolate eclairs.

539
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,820
And I was like, oh, boy, those eclairs,

540
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,500
I call it, it looks so good.

541
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,100
And they're like, well, here, take one,

542
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,580
put it under there, you know,

543
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,380
because that was the big rule.

544
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,340
They did not teach us how to do much,

545
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,940
but they said, don't eat on the job.

546
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,020
That was the one thing, like, okay, fine.

547
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,260
So, I had placed a chocolate eclair, like, under the,

548
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,380
like, where we put our backpacks and stuff.

549
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,220
And boy, that shift was slow,

550
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,140
and that eclair was calling my name.

551
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,980
I love it.

552
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,420
Jason, come down here.

553
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,260
Hold on, real quick.

554
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,300
I just like, you saying, maybe I'm wrong,

555
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,220
but you saying eclair instead of eclair,

556
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,100
you're saying it almost like Slim Pickens would say it,

557
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,940
which I'm really enjoying.

558
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,780
I'm an eclair.

559
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,140
I love chocolate eclair.

560
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,980
And I'm loving it, so.

561
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
Like an etart.

562
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,060
Yeah.

563
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,900
Hi, yeah, it's just probably the, you know,

564
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,540
South Philly trash dialect.

565
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,500
Keep saying it like that.

566
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,340
It's fine.

567
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,460
And I was like, no one is,

568
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,180
I haven't seen a manager in ages.

569
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,740
Oh man, you're gonna be bad in this.

570
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,380
The old guy could not give a shit.

571
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,500
He's just leaning, like, no one has come by for Pete.

572
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,820
Like, so I crouch down and I kind of like hide,

573
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,820
and I go to take a bite, and it's like almost in my mouth,

574
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
and I feel a tap on my shoulder.

575
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,340
And I turn around and it's being like,

576
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,180
This is so good.

577
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,220
Shit, manager.

578
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,260
And he's like, throw it away.

579
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,100
Throw it out.

580
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,060
And I was like, you gotta be kidding me.

581
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,940
Oh no, but throwing it now, we're gonna waste it?

582
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,420
Yeah, so now he tossed it.

583
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,260
And like.

584
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,540
Not giving it a good home.

585
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,100
And so, and of course by that point,

586
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,100
like they were done next door,

587
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,900
or they were shutting down, or like.

588
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,780
So I was just like, you motherfucker.

589
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,020
I can't believe you.

590
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,500
Oh, what a dramatic, you're almost there.

591
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,620
You're like preparing your mouth.

592
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,580
You could see the cartoon closeups.

593
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,780
You could see your mouth unfurl like a little red carpet.

594
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,100
I'm sorry, your tongue unfurl.

595
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,300
Like, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.

596
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,980
Almost, and then like you're almost like getting

597
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,140
chocolate mist, it's like cringling.

598
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,500
It is so, it was like so aggravating.

599
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,660
All these stories are like three panel

600
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,980
Beatle Bailey comic strips.

601
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,740
Where it's like he's working in the kitchen,

602
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,500
and then something, like one ends with him

603
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
spilling marinara, this one ends with like him,

604
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,060
like maybe this is more of a Sunday one,

605
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,540
and it's like six panels.

606
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,260
And he's like, kind of like nothing's going on,

607
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,220
and he glances over, he sees the eclair over there.

608
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,340
He's thinking about it, he doesn't wanna do it,

609
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,100
and then he goes and gets it, and then Sarge comes in.

610
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,340
So you're proposing like maybe a little like,

611
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,540
I was out here, go ahead.

612
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,300
Oh yeah, no, Sarge for sure.

613
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,660
Because like the other employees did not give a shit.

614
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,300
The Kocher kitchen guys were the nicest,

615
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,700
and they were always wrapping stuff,

616
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,820
like oh here, I'll wrap it in foil,

617
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,300
take it to go, take it back to the dorm.

618
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,620
But would you think they would have been upset

619
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,740
if you ate on the job?

620
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,220
They don't give a shit, no, they didn't care.

621
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,060
Are you sure?

622
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,860
Yeah, I'm sure, 100% sure.

623
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,300
But you never did in their presence,

624
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,620
you never saw them eating.

625
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,260
They were happy, no, they were just,

626
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,820
they were thrilled, you know.

627
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,220
They weren't aware of the draconian nature.

628
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,060
They weren't aware of the action.

629
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,580
It was their own operation.

630
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,300
I was gonna say, you're probably proposing,

631
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,980
I don't know, maybe for any enterprising artists out there,

632
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,780
illustrators or comic drawers,

633
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,700
that it's like a con, like I leave it to you to name it,

634
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,340
but what's in my head is like something's cooking.

635
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,460
And so like starring Jason.

636
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,940
If you just do these high jar,

637
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,500
like does it inspire other little misadventures,

638
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,580
however you want it to be?

639
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,740
Yeah, it could be, I mean, it starts very simply probably.

640
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,060
Depends how much space we can get in the paper,

641
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,900
first of all,

642
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,660
because it could be just single panel for a while,

643
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,980
and then on Sundays, it goes three panels or six panels.

644
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,420
Yeah, but you know, I think it does beg like a close up,

645
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,260
at least, you know,

646
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,820
because that's what I'm picturing.

647
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,340
I wanna see that distance between,

648
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,860
the micro distance between a Claire and mouth.

649
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,700
Yeah, that's true.

650
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,140
You would wanna get some more like,

651
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,460
sort of real feeling like real time was going on with that,

652
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,260
because that's sort of the fun of that beat.

653
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,140
That's so sad.

654
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,740
And maybe as I was to do that,

655
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,020
the Claire is talking to you, is like calling to you,

656
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,300
or like, or that you're like,

657
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,300
yeah, your little like dream bubble is the a Claire with,

658
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,580
like, you know, like a sexy human eyelash,

659
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,940
like fluttering eyelashes.

660
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,500
I want you Jason.

661
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,820
Buzzing me a Claire.

662
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,660
Shoving up some dough pockets.

663
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,500
Hey, sure.

664
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,420
I mean, look, well, they print the paper,

665
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,260
might not print that,

666
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
that might have to be for just the collected edition.

667
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,740
Yeah, that's for the Santa crap.

668
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,580
That's for the art comics.

669
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,780
That's for the art comics,

670
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,020
but something's cooking is a good idea.

671
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,180
Maybe we should just do it.

672
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,020
I don't know.

673
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,820
See if King features is interested.

674
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,340
I like that you had so much experience

675
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,820
with so many different genres of food.

676
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,020
Yeah, I, the best, you know, job,

677
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,380
I think the job everyone wanted

678
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,340
was just carting people into the dining hall,

679
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,060
because you just sat and you could like,

680
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,620
do homework or like,

681
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,460
Just a greeter.

682
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,500
Read, yeah.

683
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,460
And so I did do that like once

684
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,980
at the like back door of this dining hall,

685
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,500
and I didn't do like anything for like two hours.

686
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,180
And then they eventually, I think they're like,

687
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,900
Oh, we can lock that door.

688
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,340
We don't need people coming in there too.

689
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,500
No one comes in there.

690
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,540
And I'm like, oh damn it.

691
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,740
No, no.

692
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,060
The cake position.

693
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,580
You also, you teased a story of getting yelled at

694
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,420
by an unpleasant man.

695
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,260
Is that what you just described?

696
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,340
That was the eclairs story.

697
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,180
Yeah, yeah.

698
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,620
Cause I wasn't sure,

699
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,540
cause I didn't sound like there was a yelling in there.

700
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,180
It was more of a, of a, of a humiliating tap tap.

701
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,580
I, yeah, I, I, he looked so,

702
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,980
and looking back again,

703
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,380
that man could not have been older than 30,

704
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:23,220
but like he just had the worst like Oxford shirt

705
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,100
from Sears tucked into two tight khakis.

706
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,860
Like, oh yeah.

707
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,620
Do you, anything, if anyone were to draw this,

708
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,620
is there anything, you know,

709
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,580
they could use their imagination, I think,

710
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,100
to create this Sarge-esque character,

711
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,820
but is there any other physical attributes just to get it?

712
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,580
It was a black apron and kind of a blue,

713
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,140
not dissimilar from the shirt I'm wearing now.

714
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,380
Like blue denim, a chambray shirt.

715
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,780
But like, did this guy have anything on his, on his face?

716
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,340
Was there like a unibrow or a wore?

717
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,260
I feel like he always had a dumb ass lanyard on.

718
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,380
I feel like he was a guy who like-

719
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,220
Not when they had his ID?

720
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,420
Like his own lanyard?

721
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,820
I feel like he was wearing,

722
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,740
no, I feel like it might've been an ID.

723
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,380
You know when you work someplace with key cards

724
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,220
and they're like,

725
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,780
and wear it around your neck all the time.

726
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,220
Like he took that seriously.

727
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,060
Both people- Like an IT guy.

728
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,780
Like there are two, two or three

729
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,420
are just shoving it in their pocket.

730
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,020
Like this guy was like-

731
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,940
Wearing it proudly.

732
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,980
Wearing it proudly.

733
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,020
I'm part of this army.

734
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,500
Huh.

735
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,740
Well, yeah, I'd like to see more of this,

736
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,940
like to hear more.

737
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,300
Does that sort of cover the main adventures?

738
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,700
That I think covers it.

739
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,100
Yeah, I did find out like,

740
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,140
I was just reading about like,

741
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,140
if a good news and the college apparently took full,

742
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,060
like they used to use contractors,

743
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,860
Sodexo or Cisco or these big food supply monopoly.

744
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,180
Like they took it over and run it themselves now.

745
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,900
So hopefully it's cheaper for students

746
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,380
and better for employees.

747
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,380
I think they just carried all the employees over,

748
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,580
but they work directly for the college now.

749
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,740
And it seemed much more pleasant

750
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,620
than the like faceless corporation,

751
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,340
food slop corporation that I worked for.

752
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,180
I don't know.

753
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,020
I hope it's better.

754
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,860
I hope so.

755
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,540
I never had to work it, but I, just seeing it,

756
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,700
you go, these people are working very hard.

757
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,460
Much harder than we're working.

758
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,300
Much harder than we're working.

759
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,140
Yeah.

760
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,460
Supposed hard jobs.

761
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,300
Yeah.

762
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,220
Yeah, no kidding.

763
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,980
Well, thank you for sharing your full adventures.

764
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,820
Sure.

765
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,220
There's more to come in the funny pages.

766
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,100
Mike, have you been over there just going like,

767
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,100
I hope this drags out.

768
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,980
I hope this is too long.

769
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,220
We have to do a second night.

770
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,060
This is the like,

771
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,900
Yeah, it's, yeah.

772
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,580
You've been delaying this event.

773
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,220
You've kicked this down the curb a couple of times.

774
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,060
What happened is,

775
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,580
what happened with this story is that

776
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,060
it sort of got built up too much.

777
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,100
I was hoping it would just kind of come out one day.

778
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,220
Cause I think I've pin,

779
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,060
there's an element of the story we'll get to

780
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,460
where I pinpointed a specific ride.

781
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,700
And I was like, oh, maybe it will just,

782
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,860
I'll just sort of tell it in a 15 minute,

783
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,380
10 minute version on that episode.

784
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,460
But now it's grown to this point where I feel like

785
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,780
I have to give a lot of context and it's sort of,

786
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,900
it's grown in anticipation.

787
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,860
So probably the way in which it's told

788
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,180
has to expand as well.

789
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,140
Like become this, it has to, you know,

790
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,540
it was maybe going to be like a part of a seven minute

791
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,260
standup set, but now you have to make this like a big

792
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,100
Now it's a story.

793
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,180
Now it's a Henry Rollins storytelling hour.

794
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,620
Yes, it is a, it's like Henry Rollins storytelling hour.

795
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,580
And I have been rolling it around in my head now

796
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,700
for a few weeks.

797
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,420
I guess I should give a lot of context for things

798
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,260
and really explain it.

799
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,500
Cause I want to bring you into the world of Young Me.

800
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
You like half mentioned this,

801
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,580
it was kind of a crowded Club 3 episode

802
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,260
and it didn't feel like the time.

803
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,860
And then it kept, and I think it's only existed

804
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,940
in Club 3.

805
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,780
Maybe, yeah.

806
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,740
This has just been going, I think, I think all in 2023.

807
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,180
It's been alluded to in like three, four episodes,

808
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,980
as you said, built up too much.

809
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,820
I don't know.

810
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,180
We were walking, I think Scott,

811
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,460
we were walking to the Holiday Inn pre-pandemic.

812
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,420
And I believe I said to you one, I go,

813
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,660
I just thought of a story that's sort of tied

814
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,700
to Disney World.

815
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,540
Oh.

816
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,380
And I think I said that, and I go,

817
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,420
yeah, eventually I'll tell that somewhere.

818
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,300
And I think that's like,

819
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,860
cause I had even thought of it for a long time.

820
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,700
Jeez.

821
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,940
So it's been- Pre-pandemic.

822
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,060
It's been going since then.

823
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,020
That hotel's not even called that anymore.

824
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,020
Did we go to BJ's or something?

825
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,860
Maybe we were at BJ's and we walked to the Holiday Inn

826
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,700
or something.

827
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,540
And I remember saying-

828
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,180
The crazy nights at BJ's,

829
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,820
you're going to forget a lot of stories.

830
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,660
That's true.

831
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,700
They got all those different beers, Jason.

832
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,140
And the deep dish pizzas.

833
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,340
And don't forget the Pizzouki's.

834
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,260
Mainly that, if you're in a Pizzouki fog,

835
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
that's really when you'll forget stuff.

836
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,820
Okay, so I've sort of talked a little bit about

837
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,820
high school and my fear of intimacy.

838
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,980
I guess that's what it was.

839
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,940
Despite being now one of your favorite virtues

840
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,780
in a theme park.

841
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,260
Yeah, exactly.

842
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,020
So, you know, like many people, you're like,

843
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,980
I want a girlfriend.

844
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,340
I want to kiss some girls.

845
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,060
That's what I want to do.

846
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,460
But when you're also extremely scared of it,

847
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,540
you are not necessarily making decisions

848
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,220
that will help you accomplish your goal.

849
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,260
If that makes some sense.

850
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,740
So here's the thing.

851
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,460
Don't feel bad for me when you're listening to this story

852
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,820
because there were nice ladies,

853
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,780
nice girls who were interested

854
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,580
in being romantically involved with me.

855
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,220
And I would make every excuse in the book not to do it.

856
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,740
And I didn't know I was doing this.

857
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,580
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

858
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,700
Not consciously.

859
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,980
Did you do what I did in my type for a long time

860
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,340
when I was very, very young?

861
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,500
Was women who weren't interested in me?

862
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,300
Yes, that was so safe.

863
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,060
What a safe thing to do.

864
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,420
Because you'd never have to actually engage.

865
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,500
Yes, of course.

866
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,420
So this is what I did at the start of high school.

867
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,860
Very early, I picked one person

868
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,140
who I'd never spoken with before

869
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,540
and decided that's who I should date.

870
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,500
And then I never spoke to her

871
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,220
except for sending a note to ask to go to a dance.

872
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,340
This is insane behavior.

873
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,460
And in what universe was I going to go to a dance

874
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,780
with somebody who I'd never had a class with?

875
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,620
Wow.

876
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,060
And is that a level of-

877
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,900
Obviously it could have.

878
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,740
I think it's kinda cute.

879
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,580
It is cute.

880
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,420
I think it's kinda cute.

881
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,260
All of this is cute.

882
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,620
Don't get me wrong, it's cute.

883
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,780
But as I relive it, I'm just like,

884
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,460
what if you're fucking idiot?

885
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,540
What's wrong?

886
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,740
You didn't actually want it on some level.

887
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,020
I completely relate. Of course.

888
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,100
I delayed dating, wanted to, of course,

889
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,500
but I hid in this long distance relationship

890
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,260
where I only saw the girl a week of a year

891
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,100
and nothing was ever really accomplished in that.

892
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,340
So I get it, I don't completely need to.

893
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,780
Someone needed to be like,

894
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,300
a female needed to be like, dude, here's the deal.

895
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,500
Here's how this goes.

896
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Here's how kissing works.

897
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,100
Like somebody just needed to be like,

898
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,420
it's not that big of a deal.

899
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,540
Don't worry, calm down.

900
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,620
Don't worry about it.

901
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,500
I needed someone to go like, okay,

902
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,740
this is hard to tell the teenagers, do less.

903
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,660
Stop talking.

904
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,980
You needed to be- And ask questions.

905
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,820
You know who you need.

906
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,300
Just ask a lot of questions and stop for the love of God.

907
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,580
You needed like a Natasha Leoni from Can't Hardly Wait

908
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,620
where she tells Seth Green,

909
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,380
she's much cooler and much more mature than he is.

910
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,060
And so she's just like, dude, here's the deal.

911
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,220
Stop being an idiot.

912
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,340
Stop being an idiot.

913
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,300
This is what's going on. Calm down.

914
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,100
It's also a lot to,

915
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,180
that's also like a fantasy.

916
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,660
I feel very similar to you where I was like,

917
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,580
yeah, if only some, okay.

918
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,100
Somebody else made me comfortable.

919
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,380
Here's all I needed, girlfriend and a different

920
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,980
like really confident girl to take me over as a project

921
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,300
so that I can get a girlfriend.

922
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,140
Of course, it's crazy.

923
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,900
All I needed were these two girls to participate

924
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,660
in my little- Of course, it's wrong.

925
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,820
A friend though, there was a girl a year or two ahead of us

926
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,980
and she did kind of do that to my friend

927
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,620
and it gave me the creeps.

928
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,460
Like she had the worst vibes.

929
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,100
Well, certainly what I'm describing also could be bad.

930
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,940
It could be a bad situation.

931
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,980
She just had terrible vibes and I was just like,

932
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,220
why is she hanging out with these 14 girls so much?

933
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,260
Well, that's a different dynamic

934
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,100
than I'm actually talking about.

935
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,300
She was all 15 or 16, but like-

936
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,740
Well, okay, that's not so, it's not 19.

937
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,180
But she just had a weird like aloof energy

938
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,660
and it just gave me the creeps.

939
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,140
Okay, well, I don't know this person,

940
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,660
so I can't comment on the creeps.

941
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,060
I don't even remember their name.

942
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,900
We had people that were like dating like in,

943
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,460
when they were 17, like a 20 year old

944
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,900
who would come to the dances and we knew that was weird.

945
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,460
We knew that was bad.

946
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,420
So, and it was not like, he was not like,

947
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,260
oh, I met him in high school and now he graduated

948
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,380
and we're still dating.

949
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,380
It was like, I met this DJ outside of high school.

950
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,820
Cool job, dad.

951
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,620
Yeah. Stiddy.

952
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,020
I knew someone who, when we were seniors,

953
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,700
she was dating a guy who graduated a year ahead of us,

954
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,220
but he was a college freshman and he was in a fraternity

955
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,180
and she would be like, yeah, I spent the weekend

956
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,500
at the frat and I'm like, that's really weird.

957
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,460
Like, I don't, that doesn't sit right with me.

958
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,180
And also he's kind of a drip.

959
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,980
Like he's not really- A drip.

960
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,020
He was just kind of like a wet noodle.

961
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,060
Like he wasn't really handsome or jacked

962
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,900
and he wasn't very smart.

963
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,460
He's an absolute drip.

964
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,180
What are you doing with that drip?

965
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,060
I like the idea that you're like being catty

966
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,260
about everybody in high school.

967
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,660
You're like, that guy's a drip.

968
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,820
Oh, well, our favorite-

969
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,140
I don't like the vibes on that girl.

970
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,580
I did not like, I, you know, I think some of my friends

971
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,660
like drank and smoked whatever, 2000s,

972
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,540
Philly dirt weed was available.

973
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,100
But like, it seemed like me and my friends in high school,

974
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,060
everyone's favorite pastime was just being

975
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,420
recreationally mean to each other.

976
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,260
Yeah, that's what we did too.

977
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,820
Too smart for our own good.

978
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,060
We were like a little on our high horse, like, oh, you know,

979
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,780
we don't drink or whatever.

980
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,140
But like we were just mean to each other.

981
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,820
And then we were like, we both backyard wrestled,

982
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,300
we fake fought each other.

983
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,180
And then we would fight each other all the time.

984
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,220
We would like just fight.

985
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,060
That's healthier.

986
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,900
That's healthier.

987
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,740
Healthier than what?

988
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,580
Than what?

989
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,300
Than not, than going like, you know,

990
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,300
being mean to each other,

991
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,060
like getting physical aggression out.

992
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,060
I think it's more particular.

993
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,900
I don't know.

994
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,940
It depends, it depends what it is.

995
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,260
I, you know.

996
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,460
We would fight, like we would like get into like

997
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,540
30 minute long UFC style without,

998
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,820
we would say like, don't punch each other in the face.

999
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,060
But everything else was sort of on the table.

1000
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,180
Not like hitting each other in the dick, I guess.

1001
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,500
But other than that, and it's like, we were all just like,

1002
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,420
we had a lot of energy and no one hit a girlfriend

1003
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,900
at the time, at least.

1004
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,780
Eventually a couple of these guys would,

1005
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,660
which I'll get into in a few minutes.

1006
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,140
Now they won't punch me anymore.

1007
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,980
Yeah.

1008
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,820
They're too busy getting.

1009
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,660
We were all corny.

1010
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,100
So we were fighting each other,

1011
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,820
is sort of what was happening.

1012
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,940
Look, Fight Club was huge on DVD.

1013
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,780
That's true.

1014
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,620
You had to.

1015
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,460
I mean, 30 minutes.

1016
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,220
I remember like looking at the clock after we were done,

1017
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,940
cause we would make each other tap out.

1018
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,860
We would literally make each other quit.

1019
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,700
Wow.

1020
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,180
So like, I look at the clock and I'm like covered in sweat.

1021
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,140
And I'm like, we've been fighting

1022
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,700
for 30 minutes on the floor.

1023
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,660
We've been like amateur wrestling forever.

1024
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,500
This is strange.

1025
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,380
This is a strange piece of the puzzle.

1026
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,220
Yeah.

1027
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,380
I don't think I knew these details.

1028
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,700
We would fight like, and there was definitely like

1029
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,300
a hierarchy, there was a ranking sort of unofficially of like,

1030
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,700
well, this guy always loses.

1031
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,420
Everyone beat this friend of ours.

1032
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,860
And then this guy's, I think I told this story before.

1033
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,700
My one friend who would beat us constantly

1034
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,700
in this amateur UFC fight style match.

1035
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,300
I told a real amateur wrestler

1036
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,540
on the wrestling team in high school.

1037
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,380
I go, you know, my friend Ryan, he could beat you.

1038
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,540
And he goes, he can't.

1039
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,020
He doesn't, I'm like good at amateur wrestling.

1040
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,060
That's what I've been doing for years.

1041
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,900
I go, no, no, no, no.

1042
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,020
He's really good.

1043
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,660
I'm sure he could beat you.

1044
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,140
And I was like, hey, Ryan, you gotta,

1045
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,740
I think the other guy's name was Ryan.

1046
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,020
You have to fight him.

1047
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,860
You should do it.

1048
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,380
And so we did it in somebody's backyard.

1049
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,180
And my friend Ryan got concussed.

1050
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,020
Jesus.

1051
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,500
You made this happen.

1052
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,340
He fell.

1053
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,220
He got like, he got taken down.

1054
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,580
He hit his head on the grass, probably got a concussion,

1055
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,740
bit into his tongue as well.

1056
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,420
So he was bleeding from the mouth.

1057
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,220
That being said, he beat him.

1058
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,820
He won.

1059
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,500
So I was right.

1060
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,300
But I caused my friend to get a concussion, which I don't,

1061
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,220
I'm not happy about.

1062
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,060
That's not good.

1063
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,260
So he, I mean, that's an odd way to define winning.

1064
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,100
Certainly.

1065
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,920
That's fair.

1066
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,060
But he was very good at wrestling.

1067
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,900
He could have been amateur wrestling.

1068
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,300
But what measure, if you get concussed,

1069
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,620
and then how do you, are you also still the winner?

1070
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,740
Well, he made him tap out.

1071
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,580
Okay.

1072
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,380
He put him in an arm bar and he made him tap out.

1073
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,220
Okay, okay.

1074
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,040
He tapped out.

1075
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,020
So even much like a SummerSlam 2000 or 2001,

1076
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,700
Kurt Angle had a concussion.

1077
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,520
He still finished the match.

1078
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,540
My friend finished the match and he made him tap out.

1079
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,140
So anyway, this is sort of what was happening.

1080
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,940
And then we were very like, oh yeah, we don't drink.

1081
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,540
We don't blah, blah, blah, blah.

1082
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,780
And it's like, I'm not,

1083
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,380
I don't think we should have been like drinking guys

1084
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
who were just like carousing.

1085
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,900
And there's always a bad vibe when it's like a 16 year old

1086
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,380
who knows too well how to like hook up.

1087
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,220
Yeah.

1088
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,180
Like that is bad usually.

1089
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,420
That's like creepy.

1090
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,740
I'm not saying having a boyfriend or girlfriend is weird,

1091
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,820
but like there's the guys who get too mature.

1092
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,620
And I feel like that's bad news in that way.

1093
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,420
That being said, if we had a beer

1094
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,420
and we could kiss a girl once in a while,

1095
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,540
I think we might've had a better time.

1096
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,780
I think we might've been a little more relaxed.

1097
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,620
I think so.

1098
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,980
No, Grant, I was not, I can't say I was,

1099
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,420
I didn't start drinking until I think I was 17.

1100
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,900
And actually, I don't know

1101
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,420
because I was drinking just like shit vodka,

1102
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,900
just like blackout.

1103
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,700
Like I was drinking so poorly,

1104
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,180
it kind of left me like emotionally all over the map.

1105
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,540
I, the year that I decided I drink and smoke weed

1106
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,580
and smoke cigarettes, now I was definitely,

1107
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,940
that was a miserable year.

1108
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,060
So you could be rough.

1109
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,180
Like until I knew how to do it, it wasn't good.

1110
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,020
There's a lot of factors there.

1111
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,820
But the high horse about not is interesting.

1112
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,140
Yeah, I don't think, like I remember my one friend

1113
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,140
when he heard that I drank at age 20 was still like,

1114
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,620
what is he doing?

1115
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,460
Wow.

1116
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,460
Yeah, I was a little in this territory too, here and there.

1117
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,300
Yeah.

1118
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,460
And obviously like,

1119
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,660
Were you all, were you like scared of it?

1120
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,500
Yes.

1121
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,340
Yeah.

1122
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,180
Yes.

1123
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,020
Everything is fear.

1124
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,860
Everything is fear.

1125
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,540
When my friend started smoking cigarettes in front of me,

1126
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,380
terror.

1127
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,620
Am I supposed, do I have to do that?

1128
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,980
Will it kill me after I have one?

1129
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,900
Yeah.

1130
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,820
And obviously like there's scary elements to all that stuff.

1131
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,060
Obviously kids were like doing stupid stuff

1132
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,420
and getting in trouble.

1133
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,500
So it's not like there was no danger there,

1134
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,220
but yes, there was mostly fear in general.

1135
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,380
Things like the potential Next Club 3 cartoon all-stars

1136
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,380
to the rescue, things like that made us feel like either,

1137
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,820
if you try anything, you are hardcore addicted.

1138
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,660
Yeah.

1139
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,300
The idea that you could just like kind of casually ride

1140
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,220
drinking or drug use was just never.

1141
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,540
And I get, I know that's complicated to experience.

1142
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,660
It's not the message you want to give to a 10, 11 year old,

1143
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,300
but as soon as once we all got there, like, oh,

1144
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,260
this can be part of your life and it does not have to make

1145
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,540
you an absolute mess.

1146
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,820
Yeah. Well that, yeah, that's, it's hard to think.

1147
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,900
Like nuanced lessons are hard for kids.

1148
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,740
Yeah.

1149
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,300
And then they oftentimes don't do that nuanced lesson

1150
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,500
and that makes kids reject it.

1151
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,580
So I don't know how to teach kids anything.

1152
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,420
No.

1153
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,260
Cause we had so many like,

1154
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,100
Good luck to us huh?

1155
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,940
No, I know.

1156
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,460
We've had a lot of discussions about date.

1157
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,380
Like how are we going to do?

1158
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,460
I don't know how to explain any of this.

1159
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,780
I got no plan for anything past tomorrow.

1160
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,420
Well that's what, that is what happens the day the baby's born

1161
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,420
because you think, oh, I'm going to plan or whatever.

1162
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,260
I'm going to man.

1163
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,100
No, no, no, no, no.

1164
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,260
No time for shit.

1165
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,660
There's no time to plan.

1166
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,380
Oh, what's happening today?

1167
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,220
Okay.

1168
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,260
Let me just muddle through it.

1169
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,580
Like that's really how it works.

1170
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,420
Better though.

1171
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,820
As you're an over thinker, I'm some degree of an over thinker.

1172
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,660
Yeah.

1173
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,180
I don't know how to talk to girls and it's 2004.

1174
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,100
I don't know why they're wearing dresses over jeans.

1175
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,660
I don't know what's going on.

1176
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,580
So yeah.

1177
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,220
So, so, so much of it was fear that we're like,

1178
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,420
this girl like asking me to a dance

1179
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,460
and I'm like trying everything to get out of it.

1180
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,860
And I'm like, well, this isn't the,

1181
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,580
this isn't the bride I chose six months ago.

1182
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,380
Like just weird, like weird stuff.

1183
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,580
And I'll always try to find like a reason

1184
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,620
why stuff's not going my way.

1185
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,700
And it's all, yeah, all fear-based

1186
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,700
and it's not, there's, there were plenty of people

1187
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,940
who probably at a, there weren't as many.

1188
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,540
And I think there wasn't, it sounds cocky or something.

1189
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,660
There were a handful of girls who would be like,

1190
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,580
she's interested in, didn't you?

1191
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,300
Have I told you this story?

1192
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,860
My friend who broke up with his girlfriend,

1193
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,980
who he said at the time when he was going out with her,

1194
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,900
he goes, you know what?

1195
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,660
She says you're not as cute as me, but you're really cute.

1196
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,780
And I go, oh, okay.

1197
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,620
And then I went to, after they broke up,

1198
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,740
I went to like her empty house for off-campus lunch

1199
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,100
for like six months with her.

1200
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,940
And?

1201
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,780
Nothing. Nothing.

1202
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,980
We ate lunch.

1203
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,820
What?

1204
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,660
We just ate lunch.

1205
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,500
Whoa.

1206
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,820
And it never even dawned on me till later

1207
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,540
that her inviting me to this house over and over again,

1208
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,500
was there might've been something going,

1209
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,940
like she was thinking of something.

1210
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,220
After month one, maybe she has lost.

1211
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,900
Well, of course everyone lost.

1212
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,460
They're like, what is, what's wrong with this guy?

1213
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,220
Yeah, all right, I guess I won't put him in that.

1214
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,060
Which is a theme.

1215
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,780
Again, don't feel sorry for me in a way

1216
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,620
that some people were feeling, you know,

1217
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,740
like this is a completely impossible task.

1218
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,380
When there were moments like this

1219
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,540
or things that were happening in my life

1220
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,020
where the opportunity was there

1221
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,740
and I was just too afraid of it, which is fine.

1222
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,740
So yeah, that's, I just, I wanna check my privilege here.

1223
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,060
You had the privilege of two girls thinking you were cute,

1224
00:44:59,060 --> 00:44:59,900
but not as cute as someone else.

1225
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,220
I'm just saying that's better than some other people.

1226
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,060
And I acknowledge it.

1227
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,900
Sure, sure.

1228
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,300
So anyway, so I think, okay, it's,

1229
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,660
I'm probably gonna get some things out of order

1230
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,860
because I didn't wanna ask the people involved to clarify.

1231
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,540
So.

1232
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,420
Oh, give me the information, I'll ask.

1233
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,740
Well, a lot of these people I'm friends with.

1234
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,660
To whom it may concern.

1235
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,460
A lot of these people I'm friends with, so.

1236
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,540
But I still don't wanna ask.

1237
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,940
I don't really wanna bring it up.

1238
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,940
Although they would think it's funny.

1239
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,940
So my friend's sister, who's a year younger than us,

1240
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,300
all of a sudden starts showing interest in me

1241
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,940
and wants to go to the prom with me.

1242
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,820
And I hadn't really considered this per,

1243
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,960
again, I'm still like stuck on this person

1244
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,500
that I've never talked to that's rejected me once in a way.

1245
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,660
Like that's still what I'm thinking.

1246
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:52,500
Like one of these days, I'm gonna really show this lady

1247
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,700
that I'm the guy for her or whatever.

1248
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,060
Is she also like kind of like social status

1249
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,220
that you're never gonna be in that?

1250
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,540
No, actually not.

1251
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,380
Really?

1252
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,380
I should say this too.

1253
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,980
We were not like, we were in like a sub,

1254
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,840
we were not like dorks.

1255
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,100
We were dorks, but we weren't like hardcore dorks

1256
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,800
and we were not cool.

1257
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,940
We were like chip on our shoulder guys

1258
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,820
who thought we were better than everybody in some ways

1259
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,780
for no reason.

1260
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,980
There's really no, I don't know what we were up against.

1261
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,580
No one really was doing anything.

1262
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,240
But we did comedy stuff.

1263
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,080
We made videos.

1264
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,180
I was in a band.

1265
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,900
And I'll say this right now.

1266
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,140
In case this episode isn't satisfying to a lot of people,

1267
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,460
I will play a track from the band I was in in high school

1268
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,860
at the end of this episode.

1269
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,700
Just in case you're like, this is kind of boring.

1270
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,540
What's the name?

1271
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,660
Carlson's story is second level.

1272
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,820
That's right, right.

1273
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,660
Oh, you're gonna drop at second level?

1274
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,580
I'm gonna play Like the House at the end of this episode.

1275
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,420
Oh wow.

1276
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,380
Wow, what a dream.

1277
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,260
So yeah, so that'll be played in case you were like,

1278
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,660
this doesn't live up to expectations.

1279
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,780
The second level drop and the song is?

1280
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,180
Rock the House.

1281
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,140
We talked about this in one of the episode with Kyle Mooney.

1282
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,860
Yeah, that seems right.

1283
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,100
Yeah.

1284
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,980
I may have to, yeah, anyway, we'll hear it.

1285
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,820
We'll hear it.

1286
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,660
I don't know how I got to get this story.

1287
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,380
You wrote some lyrics, I feel like.

1288
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,620
I feel like he likes the vibe of second level.

1289
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,860
I was listening to it again and I was like,

1290
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,740
it sounds more like 311 even than it sounds like

1291
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,380
right at Chili Peppers.

1292
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,220
Wow.

1293
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,320
That wets your whistle.

1294
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,220
So my friend's sister all of a sudden sort of wants

1295
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,540
to go to the prom with me.

1296
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,220
And I'm interested, but I'm just like,

1297
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,380
this is my friend's sister.

1298
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,500
This is, I can't, this isn't right.

1299
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,740
And like, again, all excuse fake stuff.

1300
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,660
My friend has never even really like expressed

1301
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,700
that he's mad about this or anything.

1302
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,220
It's like a little weird, but ultimately it like takes,

1303
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,660
I feel like I labored over this decision for weeks,

1304
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,580
like confiding with people.

1305
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,780
Is this the right thing to do?

1306
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,940
What do we do?

1307
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,580
A couple of things become clear later on.

1308
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,300
One, there's only so many people in your high school period.

1309
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,980
And two, this might be brainwrap from movies and TV.

1310
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,020
That helps so much.

1311
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,300
That certainly helps cloud a person who's afraid

1312
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:15,060
because it's hard, like you're all,

1313
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,580
you're like supposed to find a special person

1314
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,420
and that's the person.

1315
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,380
And if you really examine it, it's like,

1316
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,460
obviously there are better choices for you than others,

1317
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,900
but there are many people probably in the world

1318
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,060
you could get along with.

1319
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,900
There's not a magic unlocking the key

1320
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,420
for this perfect person.

1321
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,940
I took far too seriously because I was like,

1322
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,700
oh, okay, well movies and TV has showed me

1323
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,580
that you are friends with someone

1324
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,020
and then eventually you confess your true feelings

1325
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,300
a long time later.

1326
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,740
And then eventually you realize like,

1327
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,980
oh, movies and TV are written by neurotics

1328
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,500
who had tough times in high school.

1329
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,380
I see, I see.

1330
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,900
There's probably some part also where there's like a mix up

1331
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,180
where a lie is in play.

1332
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,580
Yeah, you lie to me.

1333
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,420
So things get all the way darkest

1334
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,220
and then they come, so that they can reset

1335
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,860
and then somewhere dramatic, like on a pier or something

1336
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,260
that it all actually comes together.

1337
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,980
Primatic lies so that we can show growth and forgiveness.

1338
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,260
That's how the world lines up that way too, yeah.

1339
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,860
Yeah, so that gives you a lot of cover

1340
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,820
if you're afraid as to be like,

1341
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,460
well, this isn't the person that came to me in a vision.

1342
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,900
Like this isn't like God didn't set this,

1343
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,220
like I just a bunch of nonsense.

1344
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,260
Not that I ever actually actively thought that,

1345
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,740
but I think that's part of it too.

1346
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,780
So yeah, eventually I go, yeah, okay, yes,

1347
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,220
we will go to prom, yes, we will go.

1348
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,740
And it was still like, I wasn't even acknowledging

1349
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,900
the reality of it being like romantic,

1350
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,420
even though that's what that is.

1351
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,060
This wasn't like in hindsight, it wasn't like,

1352
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,300
well, we're buddies, so let's just go.

1353
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,140
So I think the weeks leading up to this,

1354
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,340
I was not showing any romantic interest.

1355
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,220
I wasn't doing anything that would give this person

1356
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,260
the impression that I was interested that way.

1357
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,620
But we were going to prom, we did this or whatever.

1358
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,260
And about a week, I feel like it was a week before prom,

1359
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,740
I started hurting, like I heard rumors.

1360
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,620
I heard rumors of something that was happening.

1361
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,620
And I think I ignored them when we went to prom

1362
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,940
and we had a fine time.

1363
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,460
And again, no kissing, everyone's kissing.

1364
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,420
No, I'm not kissing, no.

1365
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,180
I turned into Trump there.

1366
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,380
I was kissing, I'm not kissing, whatever.

1367
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,380
My prom experiences and my friends' prom experiences,

1368
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,820
unless it was people who were already dating for a while.

1369
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,500
Totally platonic.

1370
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,580
Yeah, which again, all these things I'm saying is fine.

1371
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,060
I'm not so mad, but I'm just like,

1372
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,780
some easy layups here, man.

1373
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,140
And that would have again, made you just,

1374
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,700
I think a little bit calm, maybe not.

1375
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,060
Maybe it wouldn't have been calmer.

1376
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,620
But so anyway, so prom happens.

1377
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,620
And then all of a sudden I catch wind that like,

1378
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,900
there's like another maybe relationship going on

1379
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,700
with my friend's sister and somebody else.

1380
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,220
And again, keep in mind,

1381
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,660
I haven't shown any romantic interest,

1382
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,180
but this bothers me, this is upsetting to me.

1383
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,020
Oh boy.

1384
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,580
Okay, this is upsetting to me.

1385
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,780
Look, kissing or no, I own her.

1386
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:12,460
Yeah, I just bizarre, bizarre behavior, bizarre thinking.

1387
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,020
And then it turns out it's a good friend of mine.

1388
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,300
Okay.

1389
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,380
Which again, like makes me so upset

1390
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,900
and fight yelling, fighting.

1391
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,260
What, in hindsight, it's crazy.

1392
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,700
So let's fight it out, bro, let's fight it out.

1393
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,380
So yeah, I don't think we did not fight,

1394
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,300
but there was definitely like, it was a wedge,

1395
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,900
it certainly drove a wedge.

1396
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,100
And then it's like back and forth

1397
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,220
and there's so much drama and on the phone.

1398
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,060
And again, no romantic interest.

1399
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,380
Never showed that anything like this

1400
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,260
was something I was interested in.

1401
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,860
So I think even a couple of weeks later,

1402
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:52,340
I was talking to her and she basically said to me

1403
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,860
at this time, I don't think I actually like him.

1404
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,860
I think I like you, I like you better or whatever.

1405
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,220
Oh, wouldn't that have been a good time

1406
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,860
to like kiss or something?

1407
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,780
Wouldn't that been?

1408
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,780
Yeah.

1409
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,620
Yeah.

1410
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,460
I didn't do it.

1411
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,660
I said, well, that's not the time.

1412
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,500
What'd you say?

1413
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,860
That is the most green light, green light I've ever heard.

1414
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,780
I don't know what to tell you.

1415
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,500
This is why all this stuff starts to make me cringe

1416
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,780
because it's just like, it's fine.

1417
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,580
I'm over this type of issue in my life.

1418
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,300
But when you go back to your high school,

1419
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,220
you just go like, I don't know what, why, what?

1420
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,420
It's so weird.

1421
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,340
So.

1422
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,660
What happened in that moment then?

1423
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,660
It was a little more in public.

1424
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,420
There were people around.

1425
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,860
So it wasn't like, for a guy who really was not comfortable

1426
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,740
doing this, certainly I could say, well, there's people

1427
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,860
around, I can't.

1428
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,700
Sure.

1429
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,020
You could like hold someone's hand or something.

1430
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:45,860
You could have done something.

1431
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,700
Yes, some acknowledgement.

1432
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,380
Some acknowledgement would have been nice.

1433
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,660
A little arm squeeze.

1434
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,180
A little arm squeeze would have been nice.

1435
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:56,860
So anyway, so I'm still living in this weird muddled reality

1436
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:01,420
where this isn't like a, it's not, we're not like to get,

1437
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,500
we're not doing anything.

1438
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,580
So I can't, this is when I said I don't know exactly

1439
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,060
the timetable on this.

1440
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10,580
So something then in the next few weeks gives me the

1441
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,260
impression that it's not a, she likes this other guy better.

1442
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,980
Probably because I didn't do anything,

1443
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,460
but that's not what I'm thinking in my scared,

1444
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,420
dumb 17 or 18, 18 year old brain.

1445
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,500
So it's the, it's the end of the year.

1446
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,460
We're going to Disney world.

1447
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:31,660
We're going down to play late in the evening while marching

1448
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,500
down main street.

1449
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,340
Though this is a marching band trip.

1450
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,860
And where does she factor into this?

1451
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,660
She is actually in the band.

1452
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,580
Wow. The other guy in the band?

1453
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,380
No. Okay. No. Okay.

1454
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,300
Oh, I, this, I hate this is so,

1455
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,460
Oh man.

1456
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,020
So the whole thing is just makes me just so cringe.

1457
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,500
So, so, okay. Here we go.

1458
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,300
Spike the park. I'm at the turn.

1459
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,660
So cringe alert.

1460
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,540
We're in a bus. So we, it's, but you take a bus down there,

1461
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,860
which in hindsight, I'm like,

1462
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,260
how much money were we saving for the bus?

1463
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:04,940
I understand there's some big musical instruments

1464
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,820
that'll be maybe cheaper.

1465
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,540
I don't like what, what is the price?

1466
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,620
I mean, were you saving a hundred dollars?

1467
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,180
Like, especially back then, I feel like tickets to Orlando

1468
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,140
in May, Chicago to Orlando.

1469
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,300
What are we saving here?

1470
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,660
I don't know. Buses maybe much cheaper than well.

1471
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,220
No, this was the chaperones idea.

1472
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,940
It's like when you take a kid to a park, it's like,

1473
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,740
Oh, we'll tire them out for getting a nap.

1474
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,540
It's like, okay, the band kids,

1475
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,620
the most horny kids at the school tire them out on the bus.

1476
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,580
So they'll actually play their fucking instruments

1477
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,420
when they get to Disney.

1478
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,100
I want to derail. Was that a, was that a chaperone?

1479
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:37,940
Yeah. He said, yeah.

1480
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,780
I like a macaroon.

1481
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,620
That's another, that's another.

1482
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,060
We keep finding them.

1483
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:42,900
There's so many.

1484
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,740
That one's come up before.

1485
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,980
Yeah. We've talked about chaperones.

1486
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,700
They have delicious cookies.

1487
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,540
Yeah.

1488
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,380
Who supervise you.

1489
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,020
Even better than E-Clairs.

1490
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,260
I'm a E-Clair in a chaperoon.

1491
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,100
A chaperoon.

1492
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,740
A Cheryphi in a chaperoon.

1493
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,580
Anyway. So yeah.

1494
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,060
And we, we're on the bus, but we didn't stay in a hotel.

1495
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,380
Like we just straight drove, which is miserable.

1496
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,740
To start a trip like that sucks.

1497
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,900
So that's why I'm kind of in like in hindsight,

1498
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,140
I understand they didn't want to make the parents pay a lot

1499
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,500
of money, but a hundred bucks or something.

1500
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,100
I put you could be a discount.

1501
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,100
Well, they aren't checking like you, Mike.

1502
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,820
They aren't checking like, especially back then.

1503
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,820
They're filling out forms.

1504
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,700
Early AOL days, they didn't have the same abilities.

1505
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,780
To the degree you can now.

1506
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,620
Yeah.

1507
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,460
This is a thing.

1508
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,540
This is like when you get a travel agent involved.

1509
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,860
Like, Hey, we need to get 50 kids.

1510
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,700
That's what I'm saying.

1511
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,340
There's got to be some pork discount or whatever.

1512
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,060
Anyway. So we take the bus down and in my head at this time,

1513
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,620
this relationship wasn't going to happen again,

1514
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,620
from some bullshit I made up or whatever.

1515
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,220
And I don't quite remember the timetable or quite.

1516
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:49,700
So I'm feeling like kind of like negative on it for no reason.

1517
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:54,380
So I'm sitting next to my friend, Josh on the bus.

1518
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,780
And I remember it's like maybe seven,

1519
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,980
eight hours into the trip and we're at a rest stop.

1520
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:05,980
And this different girl in band comes up to me.

1521
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:11,420
And I have not talked to this girl very much ever, ever maybe.

1522
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,220
And I would say she's very,

1523
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,060
she's like kind of cooler than everybody.

1524
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,940
She might've just been quiet in hindsight,

1525
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,540
but she's definitely like cooler than everybody.

1526
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:25,180
And definitely like people were like,

1527
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,100
Oh, she's very cute or whatever.

1528
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,980
So like this sort of mysterious cooler person in band,

1529
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,500
who I've never really talked to comes up to me at a rest stop.

1530
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,140
And she says, Oh, I'm sitting next to Kristen.

1531
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,780
And she's like really hard to like sleep, you know,

1532
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,660
she made something up that didn't sound real. And she goes,

1533
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:47,060
could you think I could sit next to you on the bus? And I go, Oh,

1534
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:51,060
whatever. And I go, Oh yeah, I think, yeah, yeah,

1535
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,020
I think that would be fine. Yeah, that would be okay. Sure. Yeah. Okay.

1536
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,740
So I'm like running up to a job. I go, Josh,

1537
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,140
you gotta find a fucking another seat, brother. Like get out of here.

1538
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:03,180
I don't know what's going on here. That's this is pretty, that whatever this is,

1539
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:07,220
this is going, okay, here we go. So like Josh's like grumbling, of course.

1540
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,580
He was like, I don't remember where he even went because he didn't switch seats

1541
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,180
with her. He found a different empty seat.

1542
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,660
In the undercarriage tubas hitting him in the knee.

1543
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:18,580
It's very possible. I was very rude and was like, yeah, get out of here,

1544
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,580
get the fuck out of here.

1545
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:25,060
So we're sitting and we're like kind of talking for a while and then night falls

1546
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:30,620
and then basically this is this part of the story that just is a night is a

1547
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,980
nightmare to relive it in my mind.

1548
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:41,100
This girl cuddles up to me to go to sleep and for the next eight,

1549
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,060
nine, 10 hours I am awake,

1550
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:53,780
not doing anything, just going, do I kiss? Should I kiss? How do I,

1551
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,380
what should I kiss? Should I, is this, is this a, is this a sign?

1552
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,660
Is she touching? Is this a, and I'm away. I don't sleep.

1553
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:05,260
I'm awake, paralyzed with fear.

1554
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,940
And I, I just like, I don't know what to do.

1555
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,620
So like, I know you're also not, where's your, where are your arms?

1556
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,580
I don't remember. I don't remember what was happening.

1557
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:21,620
Maybe I put one arm around her. Okay. Maybe I did that.

1558
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,460
But this was like being awake for your own surgery or something.

1559
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:30,060
It's just like what part of high school is, is the senior year? Yeah,

1560
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,420
it's done. I've graduated.

1561
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,860
This is a rough aspect of it that this is not 14. This is no, this is 18.

1562
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,460
18. This is why it makes it worse. Yeah. Yeah.

1563
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,180
Firing up the voting machine for John Kerry, you know,

1564
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:50,020
no, no, no, no, no, not John Kerry. This is L this is like two years after gore.

1565
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,860
No, but yeah, it's coming. It's coming. Yeah.

1566
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,180
You're getting ready to cast. You're getting ready to voter die.

1567
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:01,100
Did I love John Kerry already? Yes. Of course I did. But I wasn't voting for him.

1568
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,380
You're Wesley Clark. I too use a four star general Jason. Of course.

1569
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:07,980
I would like to work on a turtle neck. I know you imagine the,

1570
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:12,980
you imagine the stern face of John, the stern long face of John Kerry. Yes.

1571
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,740
I wouldn't do that if I were you. So was this,

1572
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:20,820
would that be patriotic to kiss this girl? Yes. No, you're right.

1573
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:25,420
John, you're right. You're right. Of course. So she,

1574
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,260
I don't know if she slept. I never taught. I never explained.

1575
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,540
We never talked essentially about this.

1576
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,900
So I am just like shaken by this whole situation because I'm like,

1577
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:40,380
this girl likes me. I don't know what to blah, blah, blah. I like, so,

1578
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:44,380
so I'm trying to figure out what to do because I'm like, maybe I,

1579
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,660
maybe my shots not lost. I gotta try something.

1580
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:53,060
So we get to Disney world and my memory is that we went to Epcot first.

1581
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,340
And I think I mentioned this on one of the episodes we were referencing the

1582
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:02,340
story. We, I go on a ride with this girl and I go, okay,

1583
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,180
here's what I'm going to do.

1584
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,900
I'm going to try to hold her hand on one of these rides.

1585
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,860
Now I've been trying to figure out,

1586
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:13,020
I think the ride was journey into imagination.

1587
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:14,500
The new one.

1588
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,980
Well it's 2002.

1589
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,020
Yeah, it's the new one. Yeah, it's the new one. Okay.

1590
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,260
So you picked a romantic spot.

1591
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:26,260
I'm pretty sure that's the ride parts because it was not spaceship earth and

1592
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,540
like world emotion was,

1593
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:32,180
it was closed and horizons was closed already too, I believe.

1594
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:36,140
You're saying that somebody who had all these facts in their head and still

1595
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:39,420
does struggles with dating and signals. I look,

1596
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,220
here's what was going on with the land at that point.

1597
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,300
Here's what my move would have been on journey into your,

1598
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,660
into your ride. Yes. I said, you know, this guy, you know, it's Eric.

1599
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:53,500
I don't, he was in, do you know, my Python? He's from money.

1600
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,780
Did you see European vacation? Do you know, have you ever seen life for Brian?

1601
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,780
European vacation. You probably know Casper.

1602
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,780
Always look on the brights. Yeah.

1603
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,980
I know that girls of a certain age have a thing about like it's one of the

1604
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,540
actors and Casper was a lot of girls like awakenings is a,

1605
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:16,700
which actor was that? Was that Eric? I don't think I explained Eric Idol at the

1606
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,060
time, but it, maybe I did. I don't know.

1607
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:26,220
The moment where that hunk came out of course, Eric Idol, the ghost hunter,

1608
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,220
high school girls in the early 2000s loved hearing about money Python.

1609
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,700
You can find it on PBS sometimes. Yes.

1610
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:40,660
So I go in to hold this girl's hand on journey into your imagination.

1611
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:45,700
And wait, sorry. Ride vehicles on this are, isn't it like, are you,

1612
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:50,380
is anyone in sight? Are you sharing the row with anybody? I don't remember the,

1613
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,820
the, the layout of the vehicle. Tiny, tiny. Okay. Okay. Small. Yeah.

1614
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,180
You're not solo though. I don't think that's a good question.

1615
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,620
You're in the back or something. It's dark in there and I don't remember.

1616
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:05,380
I think I picked the darkest point of the ride to try to do this.

1617
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:10,020
Cause that's a very dark ride. Less physically and more spiritually.

1618
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,980
And I, I go for the hand and there's nothing, I get nothing.

1619
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:19,260
I get like a dead fish and I'm just like, Oh, okay.

1620
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,580
Oh, okay. And then I'm confused. I'm like, Oh,

1621
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:28,060
so then at this point I'm at pleasure Island and this is where I'm trying to

1622
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,820
figure out which I'm not sure which place we were at.

1623
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:37,220
I don't think we were at mannequins. Were you at one of the clubs though?

1624
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:41,020
In the morning, there was some sort of like teen dance party.

1625
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,380
And I'm still, I'm trying, there's some pictures of it and I guess I got a,

1626
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,340
I don't, I'm trying to think. So there was mannequins.

1627
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,540
There was a list of the other ones for me.

1628
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,540
There was the, Oh God.

1629
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,380
The BT club later on.

1630
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,060
The adventurous club where you were you were not the adventurous club.

1631
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,900
No, no, no, no, no. I would have known that. Puppets were around. Yeah.

1632
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,900
I don't know that, but there was a teen, like 11 AM dance party.

1633
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,580
Essentially one of these places.

1634
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,980
Teenagers famously on fire in the morning.

1635
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:16,940
But we were at, yeah.

1636
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,140
High energy at 11 AM.

1637
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:24,380
We were, yeah. So we were at pleasure Island. There's a photo. You know what?

1638
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,460
There's a photo somewhere and I don't know where it is.

1639
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,580
You at least got to show the audience what you looked like at this time.

1640
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,900
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Picture that motive, Mike. Yeah.

1641
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:38,660
And I then told this story to the girl I went to prom with.

1642
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:44,060
And then we, Oh yeah. I told, I don't, I don't know what I'm,

1643
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:48,500
I don't know. I don't know what to tell you other than just acting out of fear

1644
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:53,500
and confusion. And then we went back to Illinois and she dated my friend for two

1645
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:56,540
years. Wow.

1646
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:01,780
And the whole thing is just like so confusing to live,

1647
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,820
like to live again when I'm explaining it. It's obviously fine.

1648
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:09,660
It's in an innocent enough story. I actually think I talked to the girl,

1649
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:13,860
the bus girl. I think I hung out with her once actually, after this trip,

1650
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,820
she was like clearly giving me no signals about being interested,

1651
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:21,140
but then she was saying she was interested in my friend and a different friend

1652
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:24,380
who was on the trip and we all hung out together.

1653
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:29,620
And then he hung out with her alone and he said, uh, this girl,

1654
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:33,980
she, they were hanging out in a pool and then she just started crying for no

1655
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:38,980
reason. Uh, so I don't know exactly. I never talked to her about it.

1656
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,140
I could never get like, Oh, she was interested in you.

1657
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,780
But basically I use this,

1658
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:50,140
this traumatic bus ride to completely destroy any chance of having a

1659
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:50,980
relationship.

1660
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,860
Both at the end of the school. Yeah. You got nothing from either one.

1661
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:59,620
Yeah. And it's all essentially probably my fault. Wow. It is my fault. Yeah.

1662
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,700
So it's weird. Just like,

1663
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,740
what was her reaction when you told, did she,

1664
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,340
did you sense she was upset as if like,

1665
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,660
she just said, don't you not realize that I,

1666
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:13,260
she just seemed like confused or kind of like, uh, to use a wrestling term,

1667
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:17,460
like no sold it like, Oh yeah, that is weird. Okay. Huh.

1668
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:22,100
And then it's really, the whole thing is just, I'm just like,

1669
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:25,140
I don't know. That doesn't seem like me. It says, you know,

1670
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,100
even when you think about your memories and you're just like, I don't,

1671
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,540
that I guess that's me who did all that stuff,

1672
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:34,540
but it's just confusing and you just get mad at yourself in a lot of ways to

1673
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,900
relive stuff. I don't know. Like,

1674
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:41,020
I feel like all of these memories to some degree haunt everyone,

1675
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:43,620
you know, in ways,

1676
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,300
obviously there's certain people that like really haunts them and it like bogs

1677
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,180
them down in life.

1678
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,620
But I think that there's so many of these weird stories you have when you're,

1679
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,620
especially when you're younger, when you're in your teenage years,

1680
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:56,180
that like you could like, you can bring it up.

1681
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,580
You can bring the feeling back up pretty easily,

1682
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:04,900
even though you know ultimately this story is an innocent story and it's fun,

1683
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:10,180
like it's fine. Yes. Yes, it certainly is. But it's painful.

1684
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,380
I hate it.

1685
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:16,940
I had a few bubble up recently because like people started doing the push for

1686
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:19,500
like the reunions in October. Oh yeah.

1687
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,980
Are you coming to the reunion?

1688
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:25,460
And I meet some other people where I missed my 20 year. No.

1689
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:31,540
Yeah. I, I, I was doing the math of like, okay, hotel room flights,

1690
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,700
a ticket for the album. Like this is,

1691
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:40,580
this would be so expensive for one night for like a warm buffet dinner and a few

1692
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:48,380
yinglings, you know, a few yinglings. Well, you can't get yingling out.

1693
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,420
Oh, yingling beer. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Sorry. It's a pencil.

1694
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,780
It's an East coast thing. That was your, you went deep into Pennsylvania mode.

1695
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,860
Oh, you can get it up and down. You can get it in a Disney world, I think.

1696
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:06,500
But it doesn't go, I think they just made agreement to start brewing in Texas.

1697
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,980
Okay. Yeah. I had a look. I don't want to drive.

1698
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:13,580
I'm not driving a half an hour for my high school. Yeah, that's not a, well,

1699
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:17,740
I did, I did one, one, I did my, my 10 year,

1700
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:21,620
which was kind of a disappointing, I guess in the, well,

1701
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,420
in the interest of like humility, I think I was thinking like,

1702
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:29,700
I bet these people here are going to know like my videos or that I work for Conan

1703
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,140
O'Brien or, and like jack shit, not one. I like,

1704
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:37,580
I really thought something was going to satisfy me on that level and zero no.

1705
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,020
And so then I, then I'm just like, well,

1706
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:43,340
I will just use this open bar and try to have some fun,

1707
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:46,420
especially because I'm really uncomfortable at this as much as I was,

1708
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:51,180
so nothing has reset. I'm exactly as I do not know how to talk to anyone.

1709
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:54,380
And then I, so I drank a fair amount and then just like,

1710
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:58,100
as the dessert tray is not getting picked apart too much,

1711
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:02,540
I took some way too big piece of chocolate cake and shoved it in my face,

1712
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:07,340
much like a Homer Simpson file photo from one of those episodes and just,

1713
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:11,340
and then I turned right to like a girl who I thought was like,

1714
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:14,460
I found awkward to talk to back then and just as much now.

1715
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:19,340
And she just goes, you and walks away. And that is my strongest, like, all right,

1716
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,500
no progress.

1717
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:26,020
Whatever is in my head of like what I've accomplished is means a zilch and

1718
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:30,020
the first half of that story sounded like a win to me with a cake party.

1719
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,100
I have no regret. I actually, I kind of like that.

1720
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,860
I mean, I guess my high school was like, if I was like,

1721
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:40,020
I don't think I'm going to make a lot of headway socially and I like,

1722
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,860
and I don't think the person I'm meant to date is going to be here.

1723
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:46,940
So I'll just try to like a bug people when I,

1724
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:50,300
I think I was trying to get us out of people and some,

1725
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,980
well that was me in high school and I guess it's me now,

1726
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:56,380
but I shall not be going to the 20 less and one less. I don't know.

1727
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,780
If I hear that they have like even bigger bricks of cake available,

1728
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:02,860
if there's more cake, you should go to entirely over my face.

1729
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:07,340
But anyway, let's return back to yours. I mean, that, that ending is not like,

1730
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,940
you're not doing anything bad. No, no, I know. It was just a,

1731
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:13,580
such a poor read of, of signal.

1732
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:17,060
It's just so, it's so like, yeah, it's a poor read of signals,

1733
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:20,860
but it's also just like, it's weird when you realize,

1734
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,900
uh, it's Taylor Swift's, hi, it's me. I'm the problem. It's me.

1735
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,260
And you didn't realize it at the time. That's actually very,

1736
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:32,980
I think that's maybe the most upsetting part, even though I knew I was scared.

1737
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:35,300
I didn't know how scared I was.

1738
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:40,580
So it's weird to like think back to years of behavior and realize the common

1739
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,380
denominator is you, as far as the issue is concerned,

1740
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:46,460
because you're making so many excuses. You're trying to know what's going on.

1741
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,700
Dating at all costs.

1742
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,100
At all costs. And it's, yeah.

1743
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,180
I didn't go to any dances because it was like, well, look,

1744
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:56,380
I'm in this relationship and I cannot,

1745
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:01,340
I have a chaste relationship with somebody who is in Houston and I cannot,

1746
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:05,180
I would, of course I would. Are you kidding? And I'd be such,

1747
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:10,180
I'd be such a, like a dynamo. You have no idea what I can do.

1748
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:14,300
Yeah. I'd rock that body. However, I'm just,

1749
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:18,580
I'm in a thing and I can, and then cut to then the week where she's in town is

1750
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,700
the most like tepid, you know, the,

1751
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:24,220
what's that that term in school dances about like making room for Jesus.

1752
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:30,340
On my own without anyone telling you. Yeah, of course. So bad.

1753
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:34,900
There was no chemistry with this person. Yes. I need to do this or God forbid,

1754
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,100
they notice I have an erection, you know,

1755
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:42,420
that was more shunned from society.

1756
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:46,460
I will be recently how the random erection is a much,

1757
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:49,700
is that it really is a middle school, high school phenomenon.

1758
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:54,020
I don't feel like I'm like often just like sitting somewhere and then, oh,

1759
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:56,260
right. Am I crazy?

1760
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:00,940
The dance one, there's a reason for it, but the random one, no,

1761
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:04,180
I don't think just at the car wash or something.

1762
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:08,460
That's just your body going. Yeah, no, it's a, it's a whole thing.

1763
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:13,860
Well, we all really need it was a cool uncle to say, Hey, listen, you're 15,

1764
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,820
16, 17. This does not matter. The stakes are nil.

1765
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:22,260
So like be safe, be polite and go nuts. You know,

1766
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:24,180
it's been going nuts. I don't know.

1767
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,580
And go nuts. That seems like a, that's a good uncle.

1768
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:31,740
Like don't crash a car. Don't hurt someone, but like,

1769
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,940
put yourself out there. Take a, take a leap.

1770
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:39,260
Take a crazy chance. Isn't that a, is that a Hillary Duff song?

1771
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:46,180
Well, uncle Jason's not going to explain to my daughter anything.

1772
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:52,860
Cause I don't like this idea that his wife is giving. But I'm still, yeah, I,

1773
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:56,260
and look, I actually had a pretty nice time in high school cause I had friends

1774
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:00,780
that wanted to do dumb stuff and fun stuff fight mostly, but,

1775
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:05,940
you know, make a movie and being a band. I pretty much got along with everyone.

1776
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,500
I did the plays. I had all the play friends. Yeah. I, I,

1777
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,780
and we did some sketches.

1778
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:15,820
I will say I still sort of want everyone's approval in high school

1779
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,940
because you know, you're talking about like people knowing what you're up to.

1780
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:22,220
I, I was like, you know what I'm going to do? We went to the,

1781
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:26,180
we went to Las Vegas. It was very successful. I thought we did a live show.

1782
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,540
The three of us. So less you mean. Yes. Yes. And I said, you know what I'm going to do?

1783
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:33,820
I'm going to post a really normie post about this on Facebook.

1784
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:37,140
I did notice that. Really? Yes. And I said, let's see,

1785
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,140
let's see what happens. And it got so many likes from people in high school.

1786
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:42,180
And I was so satisfied.

1787
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:47,660
I still want all these people to know that I'm doing something that's somewhat

1788
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:50,140
cool. Like on some level that's,

1789
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:54,660
it's cool to go to Las Vegas and people come and I work a puppet and you know,

1790
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:58,220
like that's somewhat more satisfied from the heat stroke you had all weekend.

1791
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,420
When you saw, well yeah, when you saw my normie post, did you say,

1792
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,260
what is he doing?

1793
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:07,220
No, I just thought, well, I thought I was like, all right.

1794
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:11,060
I posted like a grandmother or something was like, what a nice time.

1795
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,380
It wasn't like, it wasn't like a joke. It was just like,

1796
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:18,380
I think I just went and crushed it in Vegas. I said like to everyone who came out,

1797
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,780
it wasn't clever. I was like Penn Teller and us or something.

1798
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:25,020
Like I put some really like, I was like, don't overthink this, just post this.

1799
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:28,380
And it was like, that's the, got like a hundred likes mostly from high school.

1800
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:34,460
Well, that's what most people that are like not I like irony poisoned or like

1801
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,060
worried self conscious people.

1802
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:40,740
The rules are if you're in comedy and you do something you're proud of,

1803
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:45,340
you have to K you have to cover it in a joke. So you can't show that you're proud.

1804
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:49,420
Yeah. Cake it in shame. So the funny people,

1805
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:54,700
I kept saying normie posts to put it down as if it was a bad,

1806
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:58,460
but yeah, really what I wanted is people from high school's approval.

1807
01:13:58,620 --> 01:13:59,820
That's interesting to me.

1808
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:03,340
That feels equivalent to you still wanting teenagers to think you're cool.

1809
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:07,700
I don't fucking done with ice guy. I don't care what anybody from there thinks.

1810
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:10,260
That's it. It's interesting. Maybe that will,

1811
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:15,020
but also I felt so on the outside of it at the time I felt like a weird sort of

1812
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,500
French person. And that was what I was trying to be.

1813
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:21,260
I feel like you maybe did like the high school community a little bit so I could

1814
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,780
see how you still have some, you wanting to think teens,

1815
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:27,140
you're cool is the, I understand that one less than the douchey biggest pool

1816
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,900
parties. I think that's, I think,

1817
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:33,100
I think you're going to watch that ship sail so far. What happened to the ship?

1818
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,260
The ship's gone. All the souls are lost. I don't,

1819
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,460
I don't know the teens ever just blanket thought I was cool.

1820
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:43,940
So I don't really know what I'm trying to cling to. But there's something,

1821
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:44,180
I'm just,

1822
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:47,500
I'm worried about when your daughter grows up and there's, you're going to have,

1823
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,780
there's going to be a car ride where there's a few of them back there and you

1824
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:52,820
turn around like, you know, and whatever comes out,

1825
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:56,260
whatever band you mention, I think you're going to find yourself on the,

1826
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,260
I think it's going to be a similar situation to not getting that handheld.

1827
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:02,740
Yeah. No shoulder from the girl in the pigment, right?

1828
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:05,620
16 year old, they're gonna like the hold steady forever.

1829
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:09,940
70 year old Craig Finn singing. I'm like, you know,

1830
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,900
he still sounds the same as a boy.

1831
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:16,020
Mr. Carlson, you're right. The red hot chili peppers are timeless.

1832
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:19,740
And they shifted through eras effortlessly and maintained their cool.

1833
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:24,660
No matter what 90 year old, even as clean change that core energy always stayed

1834
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,500
the same.

1835
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:30,460
Will it well, yeah. Will Anthony, will they still be kicking around at 80?

1836
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,660
Obviously they're in great shape. The two of them, Anthony and flea,

1837
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:38,180
they do yoga. So like this new chili peppers really rocks.

1838
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:39,820
Young people.

1839
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,700
You know that band, you know that band, you've probably been seeing them lately.

1840
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:48,820
Well, they were, they were just as big in my time and I saw them in concert a

1841
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:53,060
time or two. Yeah, I did. Well, speaking, do you want to hear,

1842
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:55,620
speaking of the red chili peppers? Oh, we get to hear it. This isn't like a,

1843
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:59,060
yeah, I'll play it too. No, I play it too. I think you guys should react to it as

1844
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:03,300
well. Uh, okay. Okay. Should I like wap, wrap it up and then make this the end?

1845
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,820
Depends if you guys really want to like goof on it or something.

1846
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:10,540
You probably want to make it a coda, you know, things that I, I gotta say we did.

1847
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:14,060
Hey, you heard the story. You did this. I hope you liked all the stories.

1848
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:17,340
Jason and Mike both. I'll try to humiliate myself further.

1849
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:20,780
I just didn't want to crowd this one. There's humiliation that can be done.

1850
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:23,260
I guess wait here. Now I will think I saw it.

1851
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,380
I think this was officially thrown out by red K Alex and Tim St.

1852
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:30,740
Aubyn. So thank you. He said, Scott, I'm going to find a story to, I'll,

1853
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,940
I'll figure one out. Uh, but, uh, yeah, hey,

1854
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:37,140
you survived podcast, the ride club three.

1855

1856

1860

second level that the bill O'Reilly intro that's wrong though,

1861
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:02,980
cause he didn't say play us out. That was the phrase he didn't understand.

1862
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:07,820
And here's a second level with a cut off their latest album. Take it away fellas.

1863
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:12,420
And then cut to me standing silently and screaming and flipping chairs. Okay.

1864
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:15,900
Oh my God, this is, this is huge. This is for sure.

1865
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:19,020
Well, I wanted to make sure that the audience is satisfied.

1866
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:22,140
So I wanted to give them a little tree when second love and how close to

1867
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:24,300
everything you described, uh, age wise.

1868
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:27,860
Second level. So I joined sex second level was already a band,

1869
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,260
the singer left. Okay. And I said,

1870
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:34,580
I want to be in a band and I want to sing. Um,

1871
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,300
the singer of the band. Yeah.

1872
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:41,980
Roll your own ticket there that, you know, this, this reminds me of like,

1873
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:46,020
I was very uncomfortable in a lot of social situations and navigating all this

1874
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:50,820
stuff, but I loved being on stage. Sure. I was confident on stage. Yeah. Yeah.

1875
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:53,900
I felt, I felt similar. Um, but so, yeah,

1876
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:57,340
so I think that we did this at the,

1877
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:01,660
we did this at the school variety shows. There is a video of this somewhere.

1878
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:07,420
I don't know. I'm sure I have my parents have a talent show at two years in a

1879
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,220
round. That was my big like breakout.

1880
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:13,820
Mr. Saxon was a show where we would do sketches and stuff.

1881
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:16,980
And most people would just do like a choreographed dance. Yeah. Yeah.

1882
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:19,820
And we were like writing sketches for it. Yeah.

1883
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,340
I had a lot of like everybody just doing the perfect in sync,

1884
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:26,740
like just exactly the more popular than the sketch original sketch. Yes. Yeah.

1885
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:29,340
Yeah. Yeah. But I,

1886
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:33,820
but the knowing that you thought that you fully generate, yes.

1887
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,340
And yeah,

1888
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:38,660
did my original sketch do worse than the guy performing the home star runner,

1889
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:43,900
a trog door theme. Yes. But the pride I have in the originality.

1890
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:50,140
So anyway, so yeah, we did this, I think the senior year talent show and,

1891
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:53,140
which also I did a, you know what, actually we did a sketch,

1892
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,540
but a second city sketch. I did another, I did like a sketch in that show as well,

1893
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:01,140
which I know the band was not happy with because they felt the band was serious

1894
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,140
and I shouldn't be goofing around.

1895
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:07,020
We're second level and now you're talking about second city. Which second,

1896
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:11,060
yeah. Are you part of which second is your allegiance point? You want to fight?

1897
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:14,220
Let's fight it out. Let's fight it out. Right. You and me. You're tapping out,

1898
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:18,420
bro. People were mad. And then the singer, my, my friend came back into the band.

1899
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:22,860
So then we had two singers. Whoa. Nice. So you need lineup.

1900
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,220
And I did not play guitar at this time.

1901
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:29,180
So I was like rocking the mic solo with no guitar or anything.

1902
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:33,260
So it's all on you. Then the stage presence has to be so high.

1903
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,700
So high. The first night it went amazing by the way.

1904
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,420
The audience loved it. The second night it was something was wrong. I don't know.

1905
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:42,300
Cause we did two nights of the variety show. All right. Without further ado.

1906
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:22,620
The photos are almost audible. I'll put it, I'll probably just put this in on the track to make it more

1907
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:57,540
for this party. It's off. That wasn't a solo. You want the second verse in the chorus?

1908
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:03,180
I get, I'm sure people are paying high premium for this. Yeah.

1909
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:08,580
The constant hits that's just the transfer. I don't have an answer for that.

1910
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,020
Okay. They put it in on purpose.

1911
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:12,420
It's more authentic.

1912
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,220
Going down.

1913
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:32,140
This is a rocking part.

1914
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,700
I think I would grunt doing this. Yeah.

1915
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:41,740
Yeah. What are you doing? Physically?

1916
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:48,220
Probably dancing. No, not skanking. That's for a stop.

1917
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:54,900
Those people, they were looking at me. I think.

1918
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,420
Were you singing the lyrics into a Folgers hand?

1919
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,020
Those people, they were looking at me. I'm saying.

1920
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:13,340
Oh yeah. Oh, and then this is I'll stop it here, but then there's a drum solo here.

1921
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:16,660
Oh my God. You know, it'll really knock them on their ass.

1922
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:20,620
The drum solo. Yeah. I don't know why the recording.

1923
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:22,780
Yeah. Well, it was a big,

1924
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,220
pretty good for a 20 year old.

1925
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:29,860
I don't know where this recording is from. I don't,

1926
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:32,300
there might be a better recording somewhere, but I don't have it.

1927
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:37,660
I have other songs that are better recorded, but we're talking over this drum solo.

1928
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:40,020
You have the quarter inch tapes of the other song.

1929
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,780
I really should have been respectful of the drums.

1930
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:47,780
Look, I'm talking to Giles Martin about remastering this at most and that,

1931
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:53,540
yeah, Dolby Atmos and we're going to go to a Abbey road and we're going to sort

1932
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:56,980
of find the original tracks and Rick Rubin's going to pull the,

1933
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:02,500
he's going to do the faders and then try to find sort of the

1934
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,780
actual like solo tracks.

1935
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:05,900
Being afraid to rock the sphere.

1936
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,580
Wow.

1937
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:12,380
Yeah. So that's rock the house. What do you think?

1938
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:15,380
I know it's not the best recording in the world, but the vibe wise, do you do?

1939
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:18,420
I mean, it's, I think it's better than I expected. Yeah.

1940
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,340
Oh really? For high schoolers?

1941
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:24,060
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I think that's, I think that's coherent. Okay.

1942
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:29,260
I feel like, um, I like, I don't want to pin the, the problem on you.

1943
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:32,540
It does feel like the tone is kind of,

1944
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:37,740
I feel like you maybe needed some like inner, some like more aggressiveness or,

1945
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:41,940
or grit. Cause as it stands, it's like kinda, uh,

1946
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,820
do you think maybe, sure.

1947
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,740
Do you think my, my, maybe I didn't know my artistic,

1948
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:51,740
my voice as a literal voice and also voice as a writer perhaps that I wasn't

1949
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,380
some like cool Anthony Kiedis guy who.

1950
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:59,100
Yeah, I think yeah. It was like a some insecurity. Yeah.

1951
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:06,100
Although you commit to that kind of like, uh, that the sort of a whine, I guess.

1952
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:09,660
Yeah. That's huge. It is consistent. It sounds, yeah.

1953
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:14,340
It sounds like three, like a three 11 like come or, you know, three 11. Yeah.

1954
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:18,980
Yeah. Um, down, down or come originals, whatever. Uh,

1955
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:22,740
so this was the first song I think we wrote with me in the band.

1956
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:26,860
And I do think the band was like, okay, this is a step up from our song.

1957
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:29,420
Did you write the lyrics? I sure did. Wow.

1958
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:32,900
The lyrics are complete nonsense. Believe that or not.

1959
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,060
It was a line that we wouldn't have been able to hear. Well,

1960
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:38,740
it's like that's when they rock the house. Oh wait, we never got out. Oh,

1961
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:41,740
come on. Can't you see those people were looking at me.

1962
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:47,580
Wow. That's strange. What does that mean? I don't know. I'm not sure.

1963
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:51,020
That sounds like, uh, you know, unconscious anxiety stuff.

1964
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:54,580
Like everyone is looking at me. This is exactly, this is,

1965
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:59,100
this describes Mike trying to throw away the mini monster in the city.

1966
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,380
What? Yeah. Yeah. Those people were looking at me. What people?

1967
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:03,860
You're like the woman on the plane.

1968
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:04,940
There's no people.

1969
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:12,620
Maybe one of the most sexless rock and roll songs I've ever heard.

1970
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:19,660
The level of sex being had by the makers of it is pretty clear.

1971
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,060
Yeah. I think that's right. We've established earlier. Yeah.

1972
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:28,100
You can tell. You can tell in that. It is, it is dripping. It's empty.

1973
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:33,260
No, with not sex. It is so dry. It is the driest.

1974
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:37,340
It's also not the other end of the spectrum of like, Oh,

1975
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:42,340
the punks making songs about being like isolated and not having sex and not

1976
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:47,220
having a girlfriend. It is not that, you know, we are having sex.

1977
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:51,700
You know that we are doing the best sex is something that I do have

1978
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:54,620
under the shirt.

1979
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:02,860
I can rewrite the lyrics. I'll let a friend sit. I'll let a girl sit on my lap.

1980
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:09,060
On the figment ride. I'll try to hold her hand. I'll tell her other friend about it.

1981
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:14,420
I don't even worry about it. I believe I performed that shirt and I was just

1982
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,980
said what I was going to say. I performed that song and someone's backyard

1983
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,740
and I removed my shirt to.

1984
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:24,700
He had a pool though. So it was like, seemed like kind of like the vibe there.

1985
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:27,180
Some people still, still.

1986
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:30,060
See that's the sort of swing you need to take more of.

1987
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:32,020
Taking my shirt off. Yeah.

1988
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:37,140
Not enough second level swag. I think is yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1989
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,980
Well there's more, there's more songs in the vaults and I just wanted to give

1990
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:43,060
that one as a little treat right now. Damn. Damn. Well,

1991
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:48,060
thank you for opening up so much. Of course. All of our friends here on the fun level.

1992
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:51,740
Everything's fine.

1993
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:57,060
The story's more traumatic for me than it is for people here.

1994
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,540
I'm sure people like this, not that big of a deal.

1995
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,500
I don't think anyone felt traumatic hearing it.

1996
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:06,180
Unless there are those listeners who are like,

1997
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:09,260
there only one small part of it was about theme parks.

1998
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:14,780
But welcome to podcast the ride. My friend.

1999
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:21,980
Too late for you. Hey, wait a minute. I'm listening to the show for three years.

2000
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:25,740
This isn't about a theme park. What the hell?

2001
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:30,860
They just talk about the pronunciations on these coasts.
