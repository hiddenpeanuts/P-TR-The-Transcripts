1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,500
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,380
Guys, Mike, Jason, can you hear me?

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,880
Yeah, I can hear you.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,040
Yeah, Jason, are you there?

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,080
I'm here.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,260
Oh, good.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,240
I'm here.

9
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,960
But why can't I see you guys?

10
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,660
What's happening?

11
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,920
It's like we're still in some weird muck zone between ends of the multiverse.

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,140
Is that what you're seeing too?

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,120
I'm also seeing weird muck.

14
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:26,760
Yes.

15
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,220
Anyway, we gotta find each other again.

16
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,200
How do we make our physical forms land in a physical place,

17
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,760
specifically at City Walk Orlando?

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,380
God, it's like we need some kind of new jump point, you know?

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,880
A place where we can reunite.

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,060
Like, where is a place of unity?

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,340
A place that brings together the best and brightest from far different ends,

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,080
from miles and miles apart, with a spirit of cooperation, celebration,

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,200
and yes, perhaps, delicious food.

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,220
Gentlemen, I know exactly where to go.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,840
A place we have not been to yet,

26
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,920
that brings people together despite minor differences.

27
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,320
Gentlemen, meet me at the Hot Dog Hall of Fame.

28
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,300
When your town has made you frown,

29
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,140
When your swear has made you swear,

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,580
When life gives you one more punch,

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,680
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge,

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,260
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol,

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,300
A place that features part of the Berlin Wall,

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,300
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks,

35
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,320
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.

36
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,460
So let's go take a walk,

37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight.

38
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,440
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the City Walk Orlando Saga Multiverse of Madness.

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,220
We are back together in one place again.

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,720
Me, Scott Gardner, you, Mike Carlson, and you, Jason Sheridan.

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,700
Hello, I'm here.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,560
Jason!

43
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,800
Hi, Mike!

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm so happy.

45
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,060
We could finally, it was tough being split apart,

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,220
but we did what we had to do, but now we're back together stronger than ever.

47
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,220
This is like when Kiss did their solo albums, and then the next album they were back together,

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,580
this must be what they felt like.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,440
Yeah, having conquered the world.

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,180
Each, how many, 12 songs on all of those?

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,600
So, what, 48, or something, maybe I'm at it wrong, like 48 classic songs.

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,300
Let's just say 48 classic songs that we all remember.

53
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,680
No notes, no problems.

54
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,860
But now we are, we have become, we're back together, the regular group,

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,160
but I feel that we are now a super group because we're joined by a great guest,

56
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,960
who coincidentally, perfectly, for today's topic, one of America's leading hot dog voices,

57
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,980
the writer of the New York Times bestseller Raw Dog, the Naked Truth About Hot Dogs, Jamie Loftus.

58
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,300
Wow, it's just really great to see you guys back together after this whole journey.

59
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,340
You have no idea.

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,320
Perhaps at this point we have no idea what we've been through separately.

61
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,140
It's all a fog to us, but yeah, yeah, we made it just in time to host you, to have you.

62
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,700
So excited to have you here.

63
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,880
The first non-Chucky Cheese-oriented episode.

64
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,960
I know, I was thinking that.

65
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,160
I kept, like, I knew we were talking about the Hot Dog Hall of Fame,

66
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,900
but there were several times this week where I was like, I gotta get, I gotta brush up on Chuck.

67
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,180
I had to like tamp down that anxiety, because I'm like, I'm behind, I'm behind on Fector,

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,000
I muted Fector, I don't know what's going on.

69
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,940
That's the correct move, is to mute.

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,520
I feel showbiz pizzas, or wait, no, he's the Rock of Our Explosion creator.

71
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:18,960
Yeah.

72
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Right.

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,500
If you're out there and you aren't following him, don't, or if you are, then mute.

74
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,600
Crazy things happening.

75
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,240
I do have one question.

76
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,540
I don't know if you know about this recent,

77
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,800
these happenings in Chuck E.

78
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,360
Cheese world.

79
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,040
The somewhat mixed bag of news that the animatronics

80
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:45,460
are officially going away, yet they will have one committed to residency near us in Northridge,

81
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,180
California.

82
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,940
There is one place where the robots will not disappear.

83
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:59,060
It feels very dark to be like there's one location where you can, like, because it's that Chuck E.

84
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,180
Cheese

85
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,580
was just a, is just a museum basically at that point, right?

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,520
Like, yeah, yeah.

87
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,040
I'm going to go, like, I'm going to go the second it's, is it, has it already happened?

88
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,280
It has happened.

89
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,440
I have not been, my wife and child went separately.

90
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,980
And here's what it is.

91
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,700
They just, they, they did something, I don't understand why they don't just, why didn't they do this at all of them?

92
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,800
Because, you know, all right, let me step it out a little longer.

93
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,440
Here's the deal.

94
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,720
Like, I've been to,

95
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,060
I've been to that one with my son.

96
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,080
I took him specifically, like, we got to go to one of the old school ones with the full munch,

97
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,400
with the full robot band.

98
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,160
We went, he had no interest in the robots.

99
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,900
I have failed to instill this in him.

100
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,780
Just a three-year-old with no context has no interest.

101
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,660
What he has been really interested in at other Chuck E.

102
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,480
Cheese's are

103
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,520
the light up dance floors that they are replacing the robots with.

104
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm looking at this in my own family,

105
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
and I'm seeing that like, boy, it works.

106
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,400
They figured out something with these dance floors.

107
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
So in Northridge, it's both.

108
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,200
They split the room.

109
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,020
So it's the best of both worlds.

110
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,000
And yes, why not do that?

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,940
Yeah, I guess, I guess possibly because the kids don't like the robots.

112
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,760
But specifically with no, because it's entirely context with us.

113
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,580
I might, I don't know if I liked them when I was a kid.

114
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,380
I might not have started to like them until high school.

115
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,060
I don't know.

116
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,940
Yeah, I was afraid of them.

117
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,620
Yeah, but I did like them.

118
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,100
I definitely, I think I liked them.

119
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,780
But yeah, I liked them, but I feared them.

120
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,040
They're kind of like, like aunts and uncles in that way.

121
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,700
I like these people, but I don't want to like touch them or be close to them.

122
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,820
But I like that they're here.

123
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,300
See them once a year.

124
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,400
Uh huh.

125
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,440
If you're good.

126
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,860
And I don't know.

127
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:58,860
Do you, I wonder not to like pathologize your son's got, but I wonder if he, because I feel like I have like a clear memory of the first time.

128
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,760
I'm like, oh, I think my, my dad is disappointed for something.

129
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:11,460
And I wonder if that, if this will lock into, he's like, I don't know what I did wrong, but I know I was supposed to feel a different way about these robots.

130
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,220
After the very tense car ride, because there's a little bit of a drive.

131
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,900
That's like half an hour for where I am.

132
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,240
Yeah.

133
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,240
When the icy silence set in.

134
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,740
Did you punch the dashboard?

135
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,660
Broke his hand.

136
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,340
Delightly.

137
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:26,640
Yes.

138
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,380
No, it did more damage to me than to the, than to the mirror.

139
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:29,800
Okay.

140
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,220
Okay.

141
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,040
It'll be fine.

142
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,780
No, I, you know, I try to be as open ended with these things as possible.

143
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,500
I try to not like, you know, I, I, of course I want him to, I'm just glad he likes being a Chuck E cheese at all.

144
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,400
And then within that, I'm not going to guide him.

145
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,460
I like that he likes being at Disneyland or Universal Studios.

146
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,780
I'm not going to, I don't, I don't need him.

147
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:55,280
I have plenty of like of eighties animatronics for the entire family from, from multiple entire families.

148
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,320
So he doesn't need to have this too, as long as he likes being in the places.

149
00:07:59,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Yeah.

150
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,120
Everyone gets what they want.

151
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,180
You guys were driving back and you did put on the Chuck E cheese cover of cats in the cradle though.

152
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,460
We did, I will say a year and a half ago, Scott and I and his son went to see Chuck E live on the Santa Monica pier.

153
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,020
Rocks.

154
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,140
Yeah.

155
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,860
How was it?

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,900
It was pretty good.

157
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,340
It was loud as hell.

158
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,700
It was very, very loud.

159
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,620
Great show.

160
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,340
Great set.

161
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,180
Great set.

162
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,700
Only new stuff though.

163
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,040
They weren't playing like together.

164
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:30,760
We got it.

165
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,720
Like they didn't do.

166
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,860
Did they, did they at least throw in a happy birthday?

167
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,300
Like they didn't do happy birthday.

168
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,900
I don't think, or there was a different type of birthday song.

169
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,200
The point of it was summer.

170
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,120
The point of it was having an awesome summer.

171
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:44,540
Yeah.

172
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,020
Okay.

173
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:45,620
Okay.

174
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,120
So he's doing his theme shows.

175
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,420
I respect it.

176
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,840
Wait, where was the concert in Santa Monica?

177
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,740
It's on the pier.

178
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,600
On the pier.

179
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,220
Next to the park.

180
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,120
Next to the arcade.

181
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Yeah.

182
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:56,980
I was like, wow, that's real.

183
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,080
You gotta let me know when this stuff's happening.

184
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,100
I didn't, wow.

185
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:09,660
That's the last time I went to the Santa Monica pier was to see Joey Chestnut eat, win a pistachio eating contest.

186
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,680
Whoa.

187
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,540
A non-hot dog.

188
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,800
I don't think I realized that.

189
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,040
Yeah.

190
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,040
I know Joey Chestnut is the hot dog competitive champion, but I didn't know he did other food.

191
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,000
He does other foods.

192
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,280
He's not general.

193
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't think he's the champion of other foods.

194
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,800
He was neck and neck for wings for a while, but he's been pretty, pretty square-legged.

195
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,440
He's got really eclipsed in wings, I think.

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,960
But he was doing it for Spawn.

197
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:41,260
He is the guy for, I forget what brand of pistachio, but he's like, he has two strong sponsorships that I know of.

198
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,500
He has his own brand of bespoke mustard, which I do have in my home.

199
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Whoa.

200
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,320
It's $14 for a thing of mustard.

201
00:09:50,580 --> 00:10:10,140
It's a huge ripoff, but he is the spokesman for pistachio nuts, and he is the spokesman for Dude Wipes, which I think is the best match from, because is there a messier guy on the face of the planet than our Joey?

202
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:10,900
Yeah.

203
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,180
Are Dude Wipes for your face, or are they for the end of the process as well?

204
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,140
I think they're for the-

205
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,340
Based on the commercial Joey did for them, they're squarely for your ass.

206
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,100
Okay, okay.

207
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,080
100%.

208
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,440
Oh, yes.

209
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:26,820
Oh, yeah.

210
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,420
I'm looking at the-

211
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,860
They're like ass wipe-

212
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,220
Google says, for your butt.

213
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,040
Butt wipes.

214
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,960
That was my thought.

215
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,700
You said messy, and maybe I was hoping you meant face, but you're right.

216
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,900
I guess I never really, because I'm thinking of his face when I say that.

217
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,140
I'm not thinking of his ass, but maybe they are, which adds to the great-

218
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,360
Yeah.

219
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,420
You have to assume.

220
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,300
I like that he's being accountable for the end of the process.

221
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,040
I think that that indicates growth on his part.

222
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,860
I don't think he always was really open.

223
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,760
The year I saw him, well, the first time I saw him, he was doing some bounty spawn, which also makes sense.

224
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,120
He's a messy guy.

225
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,500
Right.

226
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,540
He was wearing a bounty robe and slippers.

227
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,960
It was pretty awesome.

228
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,440
Oh, wow.

229
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,220
Jason, you got to get out of the mat.

230
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:09,700
Oh, the dream.

231
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,160
Yeah.

232
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,100
Wow.

233
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,240
Him having these endorsements.

234
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,760
I hadn't thought about this dimension of-

235
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,640
Dude wipes were created because some men felt, what, that using a baby wipe was not masculine enough?

236
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:31,240
That's why I get it, because I was like, there's not really a feminine equivalent that I can think of.

237
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,300
They're not-

238
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,800
Yeah.

239
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,460
This seems like a needless macho branding.

240
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,520
I guess maybe not if it's successful.

241
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,580
I don't know that it is.

242
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,520
I don't know.

243
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,840
I don't know either.

244
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:53,980
I know that they, dude wipes, at some point, they donated a block of dude wipes, individually packaged things of dude wipes to the homeless coalition I volunteer with.

245
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,920
Everyone was like, I don't think we're going to give this to anybody.

246
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
This is for no one.

247
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,020
This sucks.

248
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,040
Are dude wipes, do they have a scent?

249
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,660
Is it cedar or something?

250
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:14,100
They smell very strong, because I ended up, because we were like, we're not going to give these out, I brought some home just to test them out, see what they're, and yeah, they reek.

251
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:14,660
So they're, yeah.

252
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,620
They smell so strong.

253
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,480
Cigars?

254
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,380
They smell like a skimmed, chemical musk.

255
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,360
Cool water.

256
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,900
Just automatically, if women try to use them, they just make them sick.

257
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,640
Rashes and ill, yeah.

258
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,520
They find a way to chemically.

259
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,380
Yeah.

260
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,700
It's not for, yeah, you have to have tough skin to use it.

261
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,500
I'm just like, who is it for?

262
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,220
Like in the smell element, I find fascinating.

263
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,440
I'm like, is it for, like, I don't know.

264
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,080
I don't know.

265
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:56,220
I feel like the guys who are using it don't have people near their ass often.

266
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,840
I don't think so, yes.

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,580
The desire to, I can't see them having the desire to make their ass smell like a specific, to have an ass cologne.

268
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,560
I think it's just a vibe based product.

269
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,140
I hope they paid Joey well.

270
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,260
The pistachio thing, I'm a little more confused by.

271
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,700
It was very underwhelming.

272
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,820
We just like, I went, I took the bus to the San Monica Pier.

273
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,060
It was at 10 a.

274
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,360
m.

275
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,000
on a Saturday.

276
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,940
It was raining.

277
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,580
And he just, boop, boop, boop, boop.

278
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:27,060
I mean, it was like, you know, he, he won against the other guy and then they gave away free pistachios.

279
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,640
Was it like fixed though?

280
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,240
Was it, it was kind of a show, like a.

281
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,180
I feel like it was.

282
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,920
The other guy threw the fight, threw the contest.

283
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,340
I mean, it's only fair.

284
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,040
He won, he was on, god, I don't know anything about sports.

285
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,160
He was on a basketball game the other night, eating pierogies.

286
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,080
Really?

287
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:45,620
Yeah.

288
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,960
I didn't know that he was like just eats if you pay him.

289
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,360
Yeah.

290
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,140
Makes sense, but.

291
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,060
Yeah, he's very eat for pay.

292
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,820
What did you have?

293
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,320
The dream?

294
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,300
The Joey Chestnut texture to your book, I feel like is big.

295
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,300
It's a big turning point.

296
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:16,280
I wrote down something too, because I wrote down like a thought about Tommy's and then I flashed back to your book and I'm like, oh, Tommy's a very kind of pivotal moment as well.

297
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:23,060
I think it was a LA chain Tommy's chili dogs and chili burgers and fries and stuff.

298
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,300
Was it big in popularizing chili dogs or at least here?

299
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,680
What's the turning point nature of it?

300
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,700
I don't want to ruin the end of your book.

301
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,620
It's more, I learned about myself there.

302
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,500
Oh yeah, not history.

303
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,640
Not in Hot Dog.

304
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:39,960
Not in Hot Dog.

305
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,840
Your journey.

306
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,240
Jamie's book, there's a personal odyssey.

307
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,220
We got it too.

308
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,260
That's very stirring.

309
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,780
Thank you so much.

310
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,740
I went to Tommy's by myself on Christmas Eve.

311
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,520
I know.

312
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,920
I know my stomach just tightened saying that out loud.

313
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,260
But it's true.

314
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:09,640
I think in a just world, Tommy's would be as successful as Pink's is as an LA Hot Dog institution, because I think Pink's sucks.

315
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,240
Yeah.

316
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,800
Yes.

317
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,940
It's a scourge on Universal City Walk.

318
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,240
It's a waste.

319
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,040
It's a fake thing.

320
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,140
Especially growing up in LA, as I did, you hear about that forever.

321
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,540
The big line.

322
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,960
It's kind of put next to in and out.

323
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,300
But then when you go.

324
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,340
It's either unremarkable or fully bad.

325
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,500
It's a bummer.

326
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,600
The first time I went to Pink's, it was years and years ago, I stood in the line.

327
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,480
I did the line thing.

328
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:44,520
And I ordered something that there was no there wasn't a picture of it, but I accidentally just ordered like a little cup full of meat and sour cream.

329
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,680
Like I didn't even order a hot dog.

330
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,660
I was furious.

331
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,140
It's like, how did this happen?

332
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,940
What was it called?

333
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,840
I don't.

334
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,220
It was called like Sunday.

335
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,300
But I.

336
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,600
Yeah.

337
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,520
I don't know.

338
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,520
I'll take accountability for I shouldn't have ordered something from a hot dog place called Sunday.

339
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,800
But it was like a cup of meat and sour cream.

340
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,940
It was pretty gnarly.

341
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,840
So don't just like start saying those celebrity names.

342
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,500
Don't go up and order the Tom Bergeron.

343
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,100
Oh, yeah.

344
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,200
You might just get it might be like a hot dog smoothie.

345
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,740
Styrofoam cup with.

346
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,660
And then you should know that's what the Tom Bergeron is.

347
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,740
By the way, before any further discussion, I think we know where we're going.

348
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,900
But let's officially confirm.

349
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,740
Oh, yeah.

350
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,320
What is the what are the contents of today's sector with the sector keeper?

351
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:42,960
Boys, boys and Jamie, phase seven, sector one is the hot dog hall of fame.

352
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,440
Good luck, boys and Jamie.

353
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,840
And keep an eye on Jason.

354
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:49,860
All right.

355
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,480
Well, as assumed.

356
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,560
I mean, we we knew and, you know, this this I feel is very serendipitous.

357
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,140
This worked out perfectly because, Jamie, I just asked you to be on the show for whatever purpose,

358
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,340
not affiliated with the saga.

359
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:19,940
And you organically brought up the hot dog hall of fame, not even knowing what was not even knowing it was a crucial piece of what is now a series in its 19th day.

360
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,400
I can't find the original city walk saga.

361
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,400
Still don't know.

362
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,420
We don't know how long ago.

363
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,300
We don't know how much more we have.

364
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,100
We will see.

365
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,840
My luck.

366
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
Just to toss that out.

367
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,180
And then like, oh, you have no idea.

368
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,480
OK, hold that thought.

369
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,000
I think we didn't then it was we held onto that for like a year.

370
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,640
And now we're here to do it, to fulfill a really crucial function.

371
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,000
Right.

372
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,760
Thank God.

373
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,240
Yes.

374
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,620
Yes.

375
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,260
And what better place to have all met?

376
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,020
I think so.

377
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,580
Yes.

378
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,040
Yeah.

379
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,000
It's a read to reconvene here.

380
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:56,640
So you have and OK, so you you you wrote this book about hot dogs and well, I'm sure things about that will factor into this conversation.

381
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,140
But also you you have been to the hot dog hall of fame.

382
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,240
I've been twice.

383
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,740
Twice.

384
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,580
Oh, my gosh.

385
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,580
Twice in 2022.

386
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,120
Same.

387
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,540
Wow.

388
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,800
He returned that.

389
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,200
That speaks well of it.

390
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:16,360
I came back from any other while we're on the city because you were talking about having done a solo city walk, Orlando excursion.

391
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,800
Anything else from that experience you want to name check before we narrow focus on not talk all of them?

392
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:30,740
Well, I was I so I was yeah, I feel like I've given so many experiences of things that you're supposed to do with people by yourself.

393
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,660
The last five years.

394
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:47,680
And I like made time to stay at like a cheap hotel and go because I wanted to go to the hot dog hall of fame.

395
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,820
That was the thing luring you.

396
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,020
It wasn't even just city walk.

397
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,540
It'd be interesting and not the parks.

398
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,460
It doesn't sound like I well, I didn't have time for the parks.

399
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,720
I would have loved to go to the parks, but I was like, I only have time for one.

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,380
I'm going to walk.

401
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,240
And so I went I yeah, I love it was great.

402
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,240
I went at night.

403
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,540
I walked over.

404
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,540
I walked over for my hotel at night.

405
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,540
I was so overwhelmed by the hot dog hall of fame.

406
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,980
It's sheer size.

407
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,300
I have so many thoughts about the menu.

408
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,720
I tried to tell the person working there that I was like, I'm writing a book about hot dogs.

409
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,460
This is really exciting.

410
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,200
They could not have cared less.

411
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,940
I asked tourists to take my picture alone in front of the hot dog hall of fame.

412
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,100
It was really awesome.

413
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:37,680
I yeah.

414
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,220
So I loved the hot dog hall of fame.

415
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:48,260
I considered because I was like, this is you know, like when you reach the threshold of like personal humiliation where you're like, let's just keep going.

416
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,300
I considered going to like the dance club next to the hot dog.

417
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,200
Oh, yeah.

418
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,460
There's a few of those.

419
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,020
Margarita.

420
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,500
Clothes.

421
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,240
I don't even know which one it would have been.

422
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,700
The groove.

423
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,460
Yeah.

424
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,320
I read that.

425
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:02,940
Coconut.

426
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,680
There's a coconut club.

427
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:04,980
Yeah.

428
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,480
The coconut club.

429
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,200
That's what it was.

430
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,520
Yeah.

431
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,920
And it was Saturday night.

432
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,400
And I was like, should I maybe I'll meet the love of my life tonight.

433
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,200
I go to the coconut club.

434
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,980
But I didn't.

435
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,680
And yeah, it wasn't during Halloween, was it?

436
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,400
Because you could have met a sexy Frankenstein.

437
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,220
It was this.

438
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,740
OK.

439
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,700
It's about to get the stories.

440
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,880
It was on Valentine's Day.

441
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,320
So better, actually.

442
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,340
It was my first encounter with the like scary chocolate restaurant.

443
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,680
I still I know that you guys understand the scary chocolate restaurant.

444
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,740
I don't.

445
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,560
It was my first time encountering it.

446
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,520
I don't know if we've we've we've discussed it at this point.

447
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,580
I think we may we're possibly more baffled than ever having meditated.

448
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,700
It only unravels.

449
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,280
Baffling.

450
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,640
Do we like it?

451
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,760
How do we where do we land?

452
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,500
Oh, it's it's unpleasant in many ways.

453
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,960
There's a lot of ways to go wrong.

454
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,380
I'm sure there's one.

455
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,360
Maybe there's only one formula to get it right.

456
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,880
And it's like it's like a maze where there's only one path and then lots of dead ends and pitfalls and traps.

457
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,760
You know, you'll probably get into one of those.

458
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,200
But I'm sure someone out there has had a good time.

459
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,300
I somehow had a decent meal.

460
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:31,380
And it's because I got like the power green salad and just it's it's was shocking to like, well, this is all really fresh.

461
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,300
And the vinaigrette is flavorful.

462
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,620
It sounds like an anomaly.

463
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,880
Very strange thing for them to get right.

464
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,600
Yes.

465
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,800
And not any well, Hollywood, which is a more limited menu, I feel like probably.

466
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Yeah, because the one in Orlando is huge.

467
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,480
Yeah, it's really big.

468
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,820
Like looming, bizarrely big restaurant.

469
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,720
Next to right next to the biggest Hard Rock Cafe.

470
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,420
Yes.

471
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,520
This the scope of everything.

472
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,460
Hot dog, hot dog, all fame included.

473
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,580
There is scale to everything.

474
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, I was impressed that they really gave the hot dog Hall of Fame some breathing room.

475
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:15,400
And so then I went by myself and then I came back with my mom several months later.

476
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,720
And because she has a biannual timeshare and she really wanted to go.

477
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,420
This was on the fourth of July, another holiday.

478
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:34,140
She wanted to go see the new Minions movie that came out in 2022 on City Walk.

479
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,700
The day like on the fourth of July.

480
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,560
And I was like, all right, we're going.

481
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,540
And so we like pregame to the hot dog Hall of Fame.

482
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,760
And she was great.

483
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,840
That's an American day.

484
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,920
It was a very American.

485
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:48,960
Incredible.

486
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:57,480
What do we need to what picture do we need to paint of the hot dog Hall of Fame before we get into specifics about it?

487
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,060
It is it's like a walk up window.

488
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,800
Yes, so much so much more than that.

489
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,160
It is not an indoor sit down restaurant, but there are plenty of places to sit.

490
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,740
Great places to sit.

491
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,460
Bleacherous.

492
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,040
It's bleacherous.

493
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,980
It's basically like a they took this space.

494
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,120
I don't know what it was before because this wasn't there at the inception of City Walk.

495
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:28,300
But you like it's it's this like outdoor terrace on a corner that kind of like it just utilizes what would just be a weird awkward space.

496
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,840
I don't know what that would be without it.

497
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:44,000
But it turns it into this wonderful little mini stadium corner with like baseball stadium seating, baseball stadium seats, literal seats from our seats from OK.

498
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:44,700
Yes.

499
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,140
Right.

500
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,420
From old stadiums.

501
00:23:48,440 --> 00:24:00,500
There is a kind of the you know, not just the window that you order from, but that keeps going up into this mighty wall, which has a big screen where you can watch baseball games.

502
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:09,280
It's got many trophies that are have like a gold fork that is spearing hot dogs.

503
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,320
I want one of those so badly.

504
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:19,320
I was zooming in on all the many pictures I have of those trophies, and I don't think that they say anything, unfortunately.

505
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,580
I wish that they had they had taken the time.

506
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,240
It's not like individual jokes.

507
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:26,840
Yeah.

508
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,760
Here's my two Polaroids that I have at the at the Hot Dog Hall of Fame.

509
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,460
The stuff in the windows is genuinely cool.

510
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,520
I think.

511
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,300
Which things in the windows?

512
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,740
I mean, OK, there's the trophies.

513
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,720
But then what else are you referring to?

514
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,740
There's like I mean, I feel like it's a combination of sports memorabilia and vaguely hot dog related things.

515
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,640
But my guess is I don't I don't know.

516
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,220
I mean, how long has it been there?

517
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,820
OK, I have some materials from the opening.

518
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,480
Do the videos say that?

519
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,180
I mean, it's like it's last 10 years, I want to say, or maybe last like 12.

520
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,800
So like fairly recent part of maybe like the second wave of stuff at this city walk.

521
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,380
I have some materials from the opening ceremony, but I'll say that.

522
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,700
Yes, if I didn't if I didn't cover that, what kind of did they get any like hot dog celebs at the?

523
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,240
No, no, no, no, no, no celebs.

524
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,520
Nobody known for hot dog.

525
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,680
No, there was not really a star studded affair other than the founder of the restaurant.

526
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,160
But again, I'm going to deal with that separately.

527
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,900
But it's you know, maybe they don't want to distract from the hot dogs, the hot dogs of the stars.

528
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,800
Sure.

529
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,820
It is also funny that they didn't like like make a baseball restaurant.

530
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,540
That's what it seems like it kind of wants to be.

531
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,020
Right.

532
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,480
When it was playing, they were playing a hockey game on the TV.

533
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,460
It's not called like sports dogs or something.

534
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,160
No, which they could have gotten away with.

535
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,380
Yeah, I kind of wish that they had leaned more.

536
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,980
I mean, I like the sports angle is great.

537
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,180
I like the bleachers, but it's a little yeah, I feel like hot dog Hall of Fame.

538
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,980
Maybe I guess sports has Hall of Fame.

539
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,740
I was expecting more of like Hollywood hot dogs, which would make more sense at Universal anyways.

540
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

541
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:23,000
Well, it's kind of splitting the difference between hot dogs are associated with baseball and here's hot dogs from around the country.

542
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,160
But it's still not.

543
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:31,340
Yeah, you would want like like like an imprint of a hot dog in cement outside like famous hot dogs.

544
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,120
Oh my God.

545
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,820
That have put an idea immortalized.

546
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,680
Yes, from different movie hot dogs.

547
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,120
Movie hot dogs.

548
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,420
That would be really special.

549
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,620
Different types brought.

550
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,460
Yeah, whatever.

551
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,980
I guess brought worsts you can even do.

552
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,400
Would you be able to tell the difference like a regular wiener and then a and then a broad was like something with more of a curve and then a foot long.

553
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,100
Are you talking about and I feel like in your version of it, correct me if I'm wrong, it's not even buns.

554
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,220
It is purely the wiener.

555
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,420
It is probably the wiener.

556
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,780
Yes, I'm trying to think.

557
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,640
Yeah, I'm not against the bun also being part of the cement.

558
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,560
Yeah, if it's a crucial piece of that particular hot dog.

559
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,880
Yeah, but I do like the idea of just the meat.

560
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,560
Yeah, it's it's spot on.

561
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:17,300
So I'm just saying, yeah, that's if you're really if the concept is really being like fulfilled, I think it's more like that.

562
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:23,660
And then yeah, cases and like different buns, buns throughout the years, how they've changed.

563
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,060
You know, you're really.

564
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,520
Types of buns, high toast.

565
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,080
They're steamed.

566
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,320
There's so many ways.

567
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:31,840
Wow.

568
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,560
I would I love this restaurant you're describing earlier in the series.

569
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,280
We made the sector keeper.

570
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,700
Somebody made Jason say a full list of ways to prepare hot dogs.

571
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,600
Wasn't that?

572
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,060
Yes.

573
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,660
Yes, that was again.

574
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,420
It's a fog, but you made it to 10.

575
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,000
I think you've and also I think it bears mentioning Jamie.

576
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:58,360
I don't know if you know, but I feel like the association with I think our show has an association with hot dogs to some extent.

577
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:08,960
But Jason, especially, I feel like maybe since the original city walk saga, there's really a lot of talk cemented about my home preparation of hot dog.

578
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,440
Yes.

579
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,640
I just really listen to this because I was curious.

580
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,840
I was I wanted to relive the mythology.

581
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:23,780
One is that I don't think you said this in your list of hot dog preparations, but one that really stuck with us was Jason in a hurry needs somewhere to go.

582
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,780
I would forget to eat.

583
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:32,480
So he takes just the just the wiener, puts it in a napkin, puts it in the microwave for a minute and steams that.

584
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,240
And then takes it in the car with him to go.

585
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,320
Wow.

586
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,100
I've done something similar.

587
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,660
Not quite.

588
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,560
But yeah, you need you need to wrap it in a wet paper towel.

589
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,740
So that's true.

590
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,880
Say that part of it.

591
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,800
What was your similar iteration there?

592
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,180
I mean, I've Mike, I have microwave hot dogs made microwave or boil.

593
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,440
I feel like you get similar results.

594
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,340
But the wet paper towel is crucial.

595
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:52,960
Yeah.

596
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,720
Because then it like is basically food.

597
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,360
If you do it, it's basically food.

598
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:05,160
And it's it's less likely to kind of like explode in the way that makes a mess.

599
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,280
Are you doing any condiments in that iteration?

600
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,240
Oh, yeah.

601
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,120
No, I got to get some mustard.

602
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,460
They're eating the mustard relish.

603
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,160
But how do you feel like?

604
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,380
No, I don't like to eat and drive.

605
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,660
I feel like I just eat it really quick.

606
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,140
Well, I can't drive.

607
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:28,320
I live with a vegetarian now, so I had already been eating less meat for the sake of my health.

608
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,980
So I feel like I've scaled back on my hot dog consumption.

609
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,720
This was this was a five years ago thing.

610
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,760
You're a different man.

611
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,220
You're a different.

612
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,140
I was a different.

613
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,200
It was that is very much a single man's diet.

614
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,600
No offense, Jamie.

615
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,780
No, that's fine.

616
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,140
It's true.

617
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,280
When was the last time everyone here bought a package of hot dogs?

618
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,180
Two weeks ago.

619
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,980
Two weeks, Jason.

620
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,700
I think it's been a while.

621
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,460
What do you think?

622
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,180
More than six months?

623
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,200
I think a few months.

624
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,980
I don't think since I moved.

625
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:58,920
OK.

626
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,540
Yeah, I think it's been a few months.

627
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,140
I bought, you know, sausages, like the like Kielbasa sausage.

628
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:11,260
Because then I can chop that up, freeze some of it, cook some of it, you know.

629
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,660
OK.

630
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,180
I feel like maybe the Fourth of July last year.

631
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,400
Maybe.

632
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,480
That's a respectable answer.

633
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,420
I bought a hot dog for a bachelor party eight years ago.

634
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,180
Whoa, really?

635
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,460
Yeah, I know.

636
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,980
I'm outnumbered.

637
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,060
It's not a good day to be, Scott.

638
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,220
But that's all direct traffic to Jason.

639
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:37,260
The other thing I, you know, actually, I feel like listeners in I'd forgotten this specific

640
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:42,720
quote and we re-released the original City Walk Saga on Club 3 on our highest Patreon

641
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
channel.

642
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,360
forgot, which is this phrase.

643
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,460
Hot dog buns are the lowest form of bread.

644
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,320
Well, yeah.

645
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,920
So I knew this would come up.

646
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,660
I'm thinking if you're like buying it at Rausser Kroger's and you're buying like a

647
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,880
one dollar pack of hot dog buns.

648
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:06,520
Yeah.

649
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,080
If it's like a real…

650
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,360
You can get a bunch for one dollar.

651
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,320
Occasionally.

652
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,880
It's probably going up now.

653
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,340
Even in Biden's America?

654
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,200
Even in Biden's America?

655
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,000
I don't know what Biden…

656
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,020
It might be 139 in Biden's America.

657
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,600
Yeah, yeah.

658
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,020
I mean, that kind of bread is…

659
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,580
I feel like there's not a good way to prepare it.

660
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,040
It kind of just turns a glue in your mouth a little bit.

661
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,780
It gums really quickly.

662
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:41,580
They usually have better buns, split top buns in some of the parts of New England where you're

663
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:41,960
from.

664
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,260
I love a split top bun.

665
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,640
Yeah.

666
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,660
Wait, describe a split top bun.

667
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,720
It's a little taller.

668
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,360
It's a little breadier.

669
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,240
Yeah, you get to nestle your hot dog in there.

670
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,600
It's more of, yeah, like a little bean bag chair.

671
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,420
It almost falls inside, right?

672
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:58,960
Is that right?

673
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,180
It's a little cute.

674
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:09,140
I've weirdly watched a kitchen staff preparation training video for Skyline, the Cincinnati

675
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,400
chain.

676
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,600
spaghetti stuff.

677
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,080
And I remember part of it was making a little boat, like you're trying to make.

678
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,520
Oh, yeah.

679
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,480
Which that sounds like what the, so you need the height to be able to make a hot dog.

680
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,060
That's cute.

681
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,400
Lobster rolls, you see split top.

682
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,180
Oh, yeah.

683
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,580
Okay, okay.

684
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,060
Right, we're right.

685
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,000
What do you make, though, do you, Jamie, agree with Jason's assessment about lowest form

686
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,400
of bread?

687
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,720
I think it's a little harsh, I'll be honest.

688
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,080
It's a little harsh, but I was talking about, like, home preparation.

689
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,740
Yeah.

690
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:52,340
Because, like, then if you're cooking for one and you end up with a pack and everyone's

691
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,920
like, oh, yeah, there's more hot dogs or more buns than hot dogs.

692
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,520
And you're like, what do I do with the rest of these?

693
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,060
You know?

694
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,440
I don't like when, yeah, when a bun is overly, like, chewy.

695
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,020
I don't know.

696
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,700
I've gone both ways in this because, like, cost factor is always something that hot dog

697
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,120
consumers are keeping in mind.

698
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:18,260
But I feel like if you're making a home hot dog, you can't have a bad hot dog and a bad

699
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:18,660
bun.

700
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,580
But if you have a kind of bad hot dog or a kind of bad bun, you can still have a decent

701
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:25,920
meal.

702
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:32,360
Like, if you had a spectacular, like, Hebrew national nestled in a kind of shitty bun,

703
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,740
I feel like the Hebrew national will win the day, even if the bun isn't great and vice

704
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:37,960
versa.

705
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,980
If you got a nice bun, it's crispy, it's great, but the hot dog inside is, like, mid.

706
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,580
Huh.

707
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,440
You'll be all right.

708
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,920
It's just one of those components.

709
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:55,900
What about if both are mid, but condiments, can condiments rescue an all mid?

710
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,360
Ooh.

711
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,900
Jason, what do you think?

712
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,040
I think kind of no.

713
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,380
Yeah, I think kind of no, too.

714
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:08,560
Unless it's, like, really flavorful, like, red relish or stewed onions.

715
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,180
Yeah, like a real special occasion condiment.

716
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,240
A real special?

717
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,320
Yeah, but then in what scenario do you have bad hot dog ingredients but really good stewed

718
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,660
onions?

719
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,720
Yeah, so that's so much work.

720
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,180
You have a bizarre shopping regimen.

721
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:26,240
But, like, again, I think if you're going to, like, a hot dog place and they're, like,

722
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,640
really proud of, like, their condiments, that might elevate it.

723
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:40,020
I feel like I've had multiple hot dog sellers be very enthusiastic about…

724
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:52,580
There was a guy my senior year, my last semester at Ithaca, and he set up grills in, like, the

725
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:57,820
Commons, like, the downtown pedestrian mall, and he would be making red hots and white

726
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,540
hot dogs.

727
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,480
I mean, well, yeah, that's a great area.

728
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,720
That's a great hot dog area.

729
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,100
Yeah, it's a great hot dog area.

730
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,900
And he was so enthusiastic.

731
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,360
He's like, oh, I get these.

732
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,060
I got a butcher who makes these.

733
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,500
It's really great company.

734
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:17,900
And then once I was at Zuma Beach and there was a hot dog guy, and he's very enthusiastic.

735
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,520
He's like, hey, do you want some?

736
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,640
I have this red relish.

737
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,340
I get this flunid from these goats.

738
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,600
And he was so excited about it in the same way.

739
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,720
And it's just infectious.

740
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,200
But like, I don't have this stuff at home.

741
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,780
Like, like, Ralph's is not super, you know, they don't have this type of red relish.

742
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,640
Not fun.

743
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,900
Yeah, it's infectious.

744
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,740
You're describing an interaction from a long time ago, and this is the most energy to

745
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,420
interaction.

746
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,040
They're all for these are old stories for you, but you are.

747
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,520
You're the most beaming of senior.

748
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,040
I they they just it was so endearing both times.

749
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,580
It was so charming and so endearing.

750
00:35:59,300 --> 00:35:59,680
Wow.

751
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,800
I think it's even more fun when like I there's this place Hye talk about in the book, but

752
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,000
like there's a place in Connecticut where like they had a house relish.

753
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,580
Everyone there was losing it over this house relish.

754
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,780
It did taste good, but it was like gray.

755
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,660
It was like the color gray.

756
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:21,620
It looked scary and like the whole vibe of the building was like scary.

757
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,060
It was like a place that had burned down a bunch of times.

758
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,640
It was like a hundred years old.

759
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,200
There was a sign inside that said no dancing.

760
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,400
What year was that important to put up?

761
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,840
And their house relish was gray.

762
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:41,320
And how it but like everyone was like, this is like the best thing that ever happened

763
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,680
to Cheshire, Connecticut.

764
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,880
This is our legacy.

765
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
This is and it's like it was gray.

766
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:54,820
And that said to any Cheshire heads listening, it was good, but it also was gray and the

767
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,920
building was menacing.

768
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,880
And it's really nice to see someone get like extremely hyped for something.

769
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,500
You're like, well, I don't get it, but I'm glad that the gray relish means a lot.

770
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,980
I'm sure you get into this in the book and I need to read the book and listeners need

771
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,540
to read the book.

772
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,600
I don't know.

773
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,400
As we in this within this conversation, I certainly want to I want to keep it going

774
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,220
at home myself.

775
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:26,800
But the your personal hot dog journey, where does it tip into full on fascination?

776
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,160
Where does the love come from?

777
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,900
I mean, it was just like my my dad.

778
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,460
It was like divorce meals.

779
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:39,000
Like that was like I associated hot dogs with like hanging out with my dad because they

780
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,260
were the things that he knew how to make.

781
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,160
And we like boiled them, which I can't believe that we boiled them.

782
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,880
I have a lot of nostalgia for a boiled hot dog.

783
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,120
But I just like I think the rationalization down the line because I was like, dad, like

784
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,100
why did you boil them?

785
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,980
He's like, we were poor.

786
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:00,260
I was like, we had a grill like we like, what are you talking about?

787
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,680
You sound so stupid.

788
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,720
We had a pan.

789
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,740
We could have pan fried them.

790
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,320
We had all the tools.

791
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,480
You don't need like a rig to make a decent hot dog.

792
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,880
But he was like, no, it's just it was an income issue.

793
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,120
It's like it wasn't.

794
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,540
It was lack of interest and lack of dedication.

795
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,800
So he anyway, so that was how I got in.

796
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,980
And then also just like, I don't know, like I got really into the 7-Eleven hot dog for

797
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,240
a while.

798
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,980
That was like a real point of fascination.

799
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,440
7-Eleven hot dog and sushi in college.

800
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,280
The sushi is going strong at 7-Eleven.

801
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,940
I saw some this morning.

802
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,640
Wow.

803
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,840
Have you had it at this?

804
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,060
This isn't a regional thing.

805
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,020
You've had it out here.

806
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,740
Yeah.

807
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,000
Yeah.

808
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,660
They've got it.

809
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,180
They've got no, but it's never like made me sick, which is honestly what I expected

810
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,160
to happen.

811
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,880
But it's like all like, it's just, you know, like old rice and imitation crab.

812
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,540
Yeah.

813
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,540
But you know, it did the trick.

814
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,840
My, when I like was in college and then when I first moved here and was broke, but was

815
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,040
like, but I want to feel expensive.

816
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,340
I want to have sushi.

817
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,280
It was great.

818
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,620
And then the hot dogs at 7-Eleven are genuinely, I mean, it depends.

819
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,560
They can get pretty old, but.

820
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,060
Uh-huh.

821
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,700
But pretty good if it's like a fresh one.

822
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,260
If it's a fresh one, I think genuinely good.

823
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,000
I don't know where they, if the, where they source the meat from is consistent, like

824
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,860
across the board.

825
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,700
Uh, but the last time I haven't had one in a while because it was my regular 7-Eleven.

826
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,980
I was like, picking it up with the tongs and the guy working there was like, you definitely

827
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,240
don't want that.

828
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,720
Oh, man.

829
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,680
Cause he was like basically caught, I think it was cause I was a regular and he, but he

830
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,420
was like, that's been there for 12 hours.

831
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,500
Like it had been there for so long.

832
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,220
I'm glad it wasn't longer.

833
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,240
I mean, that's long, but I wonder if they can cross.

834
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,800
I mean, I don't think that honestly, like a two day old 7-Eleven hot dog has been left

835
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,220
out at 7-Eleven for two days.

836
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,480
I think it's like not meaningfully different from how it started.

837
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,420
Um, yeah, I guess.

838
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,680
It's just kind of been out for a long time.

839
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,300
Would the person at 7-Eleven, cause you come in so often, if it was just a stranger, would

840
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,140
it like, he would just been like ringing them up.

841
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,760
No problem.

842
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,960
I don't know.

843
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,240
I guess I'm, I want to believe that.

844
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:29,620
I want to believe that my local 7-Eleven feels some loyalty to me and my health, but I'm

845
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,580
not totally sure.

846
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,160
Yeah.

847
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,820
Interesting.

848
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,920
Um, uh, it's a localize it for a second.

849
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,300
What's the hot dog destination in Los Angeles for you at this point?

850
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:46,000
Or are you, uh, a little, have you, has the hot dog consumption gone down post book or,

851
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,620
uh, it's gone down, but it's still pretty consistent.

852
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,320
I, I, it's a bar cause there were like a lot of places I like in LA that I didn't, that

853
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:03,240
didn't make it into the book, but the places I like around here are Walt's, uh, Eagle Rock.

854
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,960
That's a rare recent hot dog I've had.

855
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,240
Yeah.

856
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:05,680
Yeah.

857
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,140
Really good.

858
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,820
So good.

859
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,660
And they have a great vegetarian hot dog, which is like almost impossible to find anywhere.

860
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,660
So big Walt's proponent, uh, which has like, uh, if you're not from around here or haven't

861
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,580
been here and I like also like pinball games, cool patty recommended.

862
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
It's really cool.

863
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,400
Yeah.

864
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,200
And, and so I like, I like going to Walt's, uh, I like for chili dogs, I feel like Tommy's

865
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,120
is genuinely like very, very good.

866
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,820
And there's a couple of those around here and then they reopened.

867
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,300
I'm wearing the pin right now because I feel such loyalty to them.

868
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,720
Uh, they reopened a classic hot dog stand in West Hollywood on Santa Monica called tail

869
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,300
of the pup.

870
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:45,900
Oh yeah.

871
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,340
Oh, the one that was the hot dog.

872
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,560
It's like a hot dog.

873
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,140
Is that back?

874
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:50,560
Yeah.

875
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,540
they had, I knew about the hot dog stick because it was this hot dog stand that used to be

876
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,000
somewhere else.

877
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,240
It's shaped like a hot dog.

878
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,720
It was originally just the stand.

879
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,580
There's a really famous picture of Sigourney Weaver eating a hot dog in front of it.

880
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,100
Whoa.

881
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,700
Um, and it's like a really hot picture.

882
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,700
It's kind of nuts.

883
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,660
Uh, it's, she's going for it.

884
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:21,820
Um, but that, like that stand was in storage for years and I got put in contact with the

885
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,980
guy who owned the storage unit and I was like, what are you guys going to do with it?

886
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,900
And he was like, we're going to reopen.

887
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,460
So now it's like the stand is out front.

888
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,040
You order in the stand, but then there's like a full kitchen and stuff.

889
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,080
Oh, so that there's still the, all right.

890
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,720
There's not the pressure to keep it all in the little box, but you get the fun, you get

891
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,300
what you want.

892
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:47,400
There's one with a really mini stand, but, and then just full food court kitchen, uh,

893
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,620
in Topanga social, which is, uh, in Woodland Hills.

894
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,060
They fancified the mall I used to go to as a kid with, it has like outposts of like cool

895
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,460
local chains and there is a, there's a tale of the pup there.

896
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,900
Tale of the pup at the start of the movie LA story.

897
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,360
Yes.

898
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:03,920
Yeah.

899
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,000
It's carried by a helicopter.

900
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,520
It's like a nod to a Fellini movie, but instead of like the Virgin Mary statue being carried,

901
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,920
it's the hot dog, uh, stand.

902
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,960
It's a really special moment.

903
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,040
Yeah, it is.

904
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,500
Yeah.

905
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,300
It's a very comforting shot.

906
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:21,980
Wow.

907
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,280
Wow.

908
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,760
Um, okay.

909
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:29,500
So we'll take, to get it back to Florida, uh, to where, where the, where the ultimate

910
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,740
game of hot dog is played.

911
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,340
Um, I mean, where did we get first?

912
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,920
I mean, I just, again, that this environment is great.

913
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:43,660
The like theme parkiness of it, the, the, the, like the, the prop design and just, I,

914
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,040
the placement, I don't know.

915
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,940
I just like it spatially a lot.

916
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,480
And then you order from, you order from the bases basically.

917
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,040
Yeah.

918
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,660
Uh, I forget if, I forget if that lines up where then like home plate is now you're up.

919
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,080
I don't quite recall.

920
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,880
Um, but that's really charming.

921
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,780
The only thing I would take away, and maybe you could speak to this from Valentine's Day

922
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,180
or, or maybe it was not at all crowded on Valentine's Day at night.

923
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,560
You order from the outfield.

924
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,260
Oh, it's the opposite way.

925
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:11,800
Oh, okay.

926
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:12,060
Okay.

927
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,540
So it's like that.

928
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,240
Oh, totally.

929
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:14,640
Okay.

930
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:14,880
Okay.

931
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,360
Or second base, I guess.

932
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,500
You begin your line experience at home plate.

933
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,480
Yes, exactly.

934
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,800
Um, the only thing I would say, like, um, I really liked being here and getting to just

935
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,700
walk through the empty turnstiles.

936
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:34,160
I also saw this during the summer one time where the entire thing was full and I had

937
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,820
friends in the line who were not happy.

938
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:42,000
This seems like, as with probably a lot of things in this Orlando city walk, we had a

939
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,820
great time due to emptiness.

940
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,940
This thing's full and you're hot dog all-fame experience is an hour and a half.

941
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,240
That I don't know.

942
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,120
But was that the case when you were there?

943
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,140
I was, it was not for whatever.

944
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,200
I think it was just cause it was like February and it just like was not a super busy weekend.

945
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,620
And I went towards the end of the night, I want to say.

946
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,440
So I feel like more people were there for the coconut club than were there for the hot

947
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,260
dog all-fame.

948
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,400
But yeah, I mean, I feel like that is any time.

949
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,120
That's why, that's part of why I think pinks, I mean, well, I think pink sucks for a lot

950
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,260
of reasons, but the fact that it's like you, you're standing in a line and at the end,

951
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,920
it's like a pretty humble, like a pretty, a pretty small meal.

952
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,440
Like you should be able to get a hot dog quickly.

953
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,560
That should be the, that's part of the point.

954
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,680
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

955
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,120
It's no fault of the people who were, I mean, they're, and I feel like you do get, if you're

956
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,360
into hot dogs, you get a lot of cool stuff.

957
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,060
I was very impressed by the mustard cart.

958
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,480
Yes, yes.

959
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,520
They're like, they have, they, they know what they're doing.

960
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,740
And there's so many different, I just, I don't know if we're talking about the menu yet.

961
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,500
I found the menu thrilling.

962
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,420
I love it.

963
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:56,880
You're basically, it's like, it is like an all-star game where regional hot dogs have

964
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,160
come to play and you have your choice of great hot dogs from around our great nation.

965
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,440
I feel like, I don't know, I have some from a list, but please, Jamie, whatever, what

966
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,800
you ordered or what call that to you.

967
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,320
Yeah, it's the starting lineup, right?

968
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:11,720
Yeah.

969
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:26,900
There's, I generally at hot dog places, especially regionally, but like generally in hot dog

970
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,540
places, you'll only have one provider.

971
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,440
So like at this hot dog place, it's all Nathan's or it's all Vienna beef.

972
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,160
It's all kind.

973
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,580
This has like regionally appropriate meat vendors.

974
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,700
It's so cool.

975
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,440
Like, yeah, we've got.

976
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:40,860
That's kind of nuts.

977
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,460
You could see them like, and maybe I, hopefully they haven't just like, it's not just like

978
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,400
in the menu only and then for real they'd, but I don't think so.

979
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,720
I think you can like, we've all had different types of hot dogs there.

980
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,740
You feel it would be, there would be lawsuits.

981
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,340
There would be.

982
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,280
This is in the Simpsons, like, you know, pleasure where they're just, there's a grave

983
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,700
that they're spearing stuff out of.

984
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,900
And it's like, this is going to this restaurant.

985
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,040
This would be a scandal pretty quickly.

986
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,460
Yeah.

987
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:13,960
No, but it's like, just in scanning the menu, there's at least four or five regions.

988
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:14,660
That's incredible.

989
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,680
And for the most part, and I guess I can't speak to, I haven't eaten a hot dog in all

990
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,600
of these cities, but for the, I mean, Chicago being Vienna beef makes total sense.

991
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,840
Nathan's and Sabret in New York makes total sense.

992
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,960
Kaim in Boston, the Boston one's so good.

993
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:34,280
Kaim all beef hot dog, toasted New England style bun, spicy brown mustard, diced onions

994
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:34,960
and relish.

995
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:35,740
Incredible.

996
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,200
That sounds really good.

997
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:37,960
I didn't get it.

998
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,600
But now if I, if I was going back, maybe that'd be, that's what I would.

999
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:47,320
And you, like in working on the book, did you know, are all these names called out to

1000
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,460
you?

1001
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,600
You know Kaim, you know Sabret.

1002
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,300
Yeah.

1003
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:50,760
Wow.

1004
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,860
And I have rankings and preferences.

1005
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:54,680
Wow.

1006
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:55,580
Yes.

1007
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:01,460
But for the most part, I mean, I think the only ones that I cannot speak to are the,

1008
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,540
like the Kansas city and that might be it.

1009
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,980
And also the, having the Milwaukee bratwurst that I thought was like a really cool touch.

1010
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,640
That's what I got.

1011
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,300
I kind of, cause again, I don't have the, my, I don't love just regular hot dogs.

1012
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,880
I was like, what's something different I could do so that it is, yeah, it's bratwurst, hoagie

1013
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,980
roll, grilled onions, spicy brown mustard.

1014
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:31,000
And then, but not so much of that, that I didn't, wasn't able to then sample each and

1015
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,600
every mustard from the mustard lineup.

1016
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,420
I love the mustard.

1017
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:35,080
Yeah.

1018
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,860
I, I, when I went the second time I got the Boston dog, I wish I'd gotten the Arizona

1019
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,520
dog just cause it's one of my favorites.

1020
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,360
All beef, smoked bacon, pinto beans, grilled onions, peppers and cheese.

1021
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,240
Always great.

1022
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:46,960
That's unique.

1023
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,120
The beans, interesting.

1024
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:55,040
I will say that they do have vegan dogs, but like with considerably fewer options.

1025
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,700
I feel like you should be able, I wonder if you could just be like, can I have a vegan

1026
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:04,020
version of the like Colorado dog if they would just do that for you?

1027
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:09,000
But there's like pretty limited vegan, which I know is a challenge for the hot dog community.

1028
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:15,100
When I went the first time though, I, they had a special that I got, the shrimp po'boy

1029
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,500
dog.

1030
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,340
Oh wow.

1031
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,160
Yeah.

1032
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,400
I can't even pronounce everything on this.

1033
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,260
Smoked andouille?

1034
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,220
Andouille, yeah.

1035
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:22,780
Andouille?

1036
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,280
Okay.

1037
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,420
Smoked andouille, fried shrimp, lemon aioli, Louisiana hot sosh on a hoagie roll.

1038
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,540
And it was pretty good.

1039
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,120
I'd never had anything like it.

1040
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,200
And then of course I went nuts at the mustard cart.

1041
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,720
I like that they cycle in and out like other regions that aren't on the permanent menu.

1042
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,880
Do they change them?

1043
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:41,340
Like, yeah.

1044
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,340
Or are you looking at one, like if I went through mine, are they going to be what's

1045
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,780
on yours?

1046
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,280
Because you were there years before.

1047
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:47,820
I don't know.

1048
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:48,720
I'm not sure.

1049
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,240
I can.

1050
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,380
Is it a curate?

1051
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,620
Yeah.

1052
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,420
Is it a curated?

1053
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh yeah.

1054
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,500
There it is.

1055
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:52,920
Yeah.

1056
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,940
I went through, I did rankings of all of them.

1057
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,380
And by the way, this is one of the joys of that we're going without theme park pressure

1058
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:05,560
to just do everything at CityWalk, that I had time to just leisurely try every mustard

1059
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,900
in a place with a lot of nice mustards.

1060
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,400
Yeah.

1061
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,100
Because this is a component I do.

1062
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,720
I do like, you know, I do like spicy mustards and brown mustards and mustards with the seed

1063
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,880
and it let you kind of do everything.

1064
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,640
I'm going to do a quick ranking and then tell me if any of these weren't on your.

1065
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:27,860
I did one, I set out to do one to 10, but I didn't even go below five because I thought

1066
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,160
a lot of these were fantastic.

1067
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,640
This, okay.

1068
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,360
I'm going to get the last name wrong, I'm sure.

1069
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,740
But it's like boat, boat, boat, jeez.

1070
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,860
Like Dutch mustard or whatever.

1071
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,840
Yeah, yeah.

1072
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,620
It's a guy, a guy's recipe from 1889 that he made in his garage.

1073
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,380
Fred.

1074
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,660
Yes, yes.

1075
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,660
Stone ground Dutch mustard in his garage in Rock, Illinois.

1076
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:59,140
This was my lowest at six, but I still kind of find food and wine, spicy jalapeno, nine.

1077
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,840
I loved a spicy kick on that one.

1078
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,860
House bar height, smoky garlic.

1079
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,960
Be warned, this mustard is not for part-time garlic lovers.

1080
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,080
It shouts summer, baseball and picnic.

1081
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,960
Shouts these things.

1082
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,220
I love copywriting so much.

1083
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,760
Somebody did copywriting for this?

1084
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,440
I don't think there is more than one hot dog hall of fame today.

1085
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,300
I think there have been in the past.

1086
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:27,780
That means that we are getting this, however, you don't want to see signs changed out at

1087
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,160
giant chains at Burger King or whatever.

1088
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,000
This one restaurant took the time to write all this stuff and do mustard pairings.

1089
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,840
It's beautiful.

1090
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:35,540
Wonderful.

1091
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,500
Committed to.

1092
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,500
They're keeping up with the promise of the name.

1093
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,200
I gave this one a seven.

1094
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,700
Silver Spring Beer and Brat, I gave an eight.

1095
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,540
And Burtman Original Ballpark, I couldn't find, so it was not ranked.

1096
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,280
We went back to this place with the level keeper and he was trying to do the same thing,

1097
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,480
try them all and I think he found some ketchups and many more missing.

1098
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,260
I don't think he found the full menu at all.

1099
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,380
So in that ranking, Food and Wine Spicy Alpeno wins at nine.

1100
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,780
If it's still there, when you go check it out, I was like, is this something I could

1101
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,420
buy at home?

1102
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:15,780
I could not find any Google results imprint for this.

1103
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,060
It makes me wonder if they got the name wrong.

1104
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,840
Food and Wine is not a brand.

1105
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,280
If that was the section they bought it from.

1106
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:29,240
I don't know, the winner, I can't have it home.

1107
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,800
Well, help Scott find that mustard people.

1108
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:39,340
That is the thing I think I would, you were talking about Joey Chestnut's special mustard

1109
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,280
that's expensive.

1110
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,340
I don't do a lot of the special ordering.

1111
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:48,920
It's a very shark tank that people pay 20 bucks for one bottle or something.

1112
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,920
I think I might with spicy mustard.

1113
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,760
That's the one thing maybe I'll splurge into.

1114
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,220
You could become a mustard guy.

1115
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,660
Sounds very cool.

1116
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,860
This sounds like a great identity for me a dad.

1117
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,840
That's a dad thing to do.

1118
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,120
Kind of a mustard guy.

1119
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,400
But I do like it.

1120
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,880
Can I say this?

1121
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,600
We did an episode a couple years ago at this point where we went around Disneyland and

1122
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,640
tried all the hot dogs.

1123
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,340
Effort here is just a hundred times more than Disney.

1124
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,140
Because Disney they would put different toppings but all the hot dogs are the exact same hot

1125
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:22,380
dog.

1126
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:27,620
What is the Disneyland Hollywood themed hot dog place?

1127
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,520
Award Wieners.

1128
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,020
Excellent name, I was disappointed.

1129
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,800
Jason's a defender I feel.

1130
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,240
I really like the film strip fries.

1131
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,200
I like those.

1132
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,620
You're pro film strip fries?

1133
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,020
I like the film strip fries.

1134
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,880
I was let down by the hot dog.

1135
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:55,480
I also went there shortly after I got vaccinated.

1136
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:01,540
I was like alright hot dog book we've got to go to Disneyland stat.

1137
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,920
I was looking forward to it because it looked like there was a pretty comprehensive menu

1138
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,180
there.

1139
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,880
But then when I went it was just corn dogs and hot dogs.

1140
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,300
The menu was diminished.

1141
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:18,460
Sometimes when the other corn dog places closed they'll bring the corn dogs over to award

1142
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,480
wieners.

1143
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,440
I've learned that I know that.

1144
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:23,500
Yes.

1145
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,440
They'll bring it over.

1146
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,540
We've got to put them somewhere.

1147
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,860
When corn dog castle is closed.

1148
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,160
Yes it was closed when we went.

1149
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,180
We ate at Grand Californian and we ordered their special hot dog of the month and it

1150
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,680
was the same hot dog that was in every other spot in the park.

1151
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:46,060
I got one really good hot dog at Disneyland before my hot dog era even.

1152
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,480
But it was like a cocoa hot dog.

1153
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,740
And it had street corn on it.

1154
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,100
And it was long.

1155
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,280
It had a toasted bun.

1156
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,060
It was good.

1157
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:55,680
That's interesting.

1158
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,240
It was good.

1159
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,640
I already don't remember what won.

1160
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,660
Was it the main street?

1161
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,120
I think we won with the one at Casey's Corn.

1162
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,420
Is that the one?

1163
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:09,580
I think I voted for it because it was just smothered in fake cheese and neon relish.

1164
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,560
And that's sport pepper.

1165
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,680
It was that one.

1166
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,940
It was a limited time.

1167
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,900
The ingredients is what, the ingredients, or the toppings, excuse me, were what won

1168
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,240
it.

1169
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,340
Because the hot dog and the bun itself was not much different than any other ones we

1170
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:21,400
had.

1171
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,600
Well back to that original thing of can condiments elevate.

1172
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,940
We were really leaning on that at Disneyland.

1173
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:33,340
As opposed to, it feels like you could go really condiment minimal at the hot dog hall

1174
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,880
fame and still have a great experience.

1175
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:43,100
Which I think is, I haven't spent a lot of time in the park at Universal in years.

1176
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,420
So I can't really speak to their current hot dog thing.

1177
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:52,920
But as a seasoned pass holder here, I think that the hot dogs are not doing much inside

1178
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,240
the park there.

1179
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:54,360
No.

1180
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,660
In fact, multiple ones have.

1181
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,980
This is a recurring story on this saga.

1182
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,300
Got me sick.

1183
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,280
The in the park ones.

1184
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:02,660
Yeah.

1185
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,240
The one of the ones.

1186
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,220
Pink's used to be in the park.

1187
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,260
And now I think it's just a generic in that central plaza.

1188
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,540
Do we still got Dodger dogs there?

1189
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,120
I forget what happened to the Dodger.

1190
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,560
I think the Dodger store is still there.

1191
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,140
Yeah.

1192
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,780
I don't think there's dogs anymore.

1193
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,200
At City Walk.

1194
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,460
Yeah.

1195
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,860
I don't know if the dogs are there.

1196
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,340
Did Pink get you sick?

1197
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,120
Pink's got me sick.

1198
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,080
How bad?

1199
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,480
And Mel's like Mel's Diner.

1200
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,100
I think they were both chilly dogs.

1201
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,540
And looking back, I think like they were both probably the same dog.

1202
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,500
I think it was bullshit.

1203
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:41,920
Probably.

1204
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:48,260
It was probably just like lying in bed, like getting up to.

1205
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,260
Pukesick?

1206
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,720
No, I'm not.

1207
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,020
I was a pukey kid.

1208
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,480
I'm not really a pukey adult.

1209
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,600
You're not a pukey man.

1210
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,220
Yeah.

1211
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,360
I would get so nervous as a kid.

1212
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,220
I would like throw up.

1213
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,700
Because of the anxiety.

1214
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,940
Because of anxiety.

1215
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,460
So hot dogs don't put any of that blame on hot dogs.

1216
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,620
Yeah, hot dogs weren't doing it.

1217
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,980
Well, as a child, no.

1218
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:17,560
But Universal Studios Hollywood, yeah, I don't know that food.

1219
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,700
Because they have that.

1220
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,520
I was excited about it.

1221
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,480
They had like a hot dog stand in the Simpsons area.

1222
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,540
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,520
Again, there's only like two types of hot dogs, and they're the same hot dog.

1224
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,700
And the hot dog wasn't good.

1225
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:42,340
Because hot dogs are something you might want to expect to have at a theme park, but they're

1226
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,340
clearly not reliable at all.

1227
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:49,200
But all you got to do is go right outside to this nice spacious setting, where they

1228
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,960
actually do it with quality and with different.

1229
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,400
Curated.

1230
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,760
More types there than Disneyland has in the entire park.

1231
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,280
I think that's the thing in theme parks.

1232
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:04,380
It's the emphasis is on making a lot of them quickly, you know, to feed a lot of people.

1233
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,800
But this philosophy is still in CityWalk in places.

1234
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,940
At other places.

1235
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,600
But the Hot Dog Hall of Fame, it's a little more effort put in.

1236
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:18,040
I was so, I hope it stays that level of effort because I was sort of expecting because by

1237
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,880
the time I went to Hot Dog Hall of Fame, I was excited because I knew what it looked

1238
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,220
like.

1239
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,060
But I was like, I feel like we're going to be in for another award wiener situation

1240
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:32,920
because I was devastated by what the events took place at award wieners.

1241
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:40,820
I also feel like this one is like if any listeners knew when we started, here's the things that

1242
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,560
are at CityWalk.

1243
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:47,220
It doesn't seem, from the name, you might expect this to be like a disaster point for

1244
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:47,580
us.

1245
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,520
Like, oh, and then we all went to the Hot Dog Hall of Fame and got sick.

1246
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,760
But it seems like not to just cut to the chase too much.

1247
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,180
I don't think anyone's had a bad experience here.

1248
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,000
I think this is a reliable place to get elevated hot dogs, right?

1249
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,440
I feel like we're all pretty positive.

1250
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,540
I think so.

1251
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,660
I would say the time I ate there, I was also alone.

1252
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,140
Good for you.

1253
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:09,880
An ally.

1254
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:10,760
An ally.

1255
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:11,380
Yeah.

1256
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,020
It was like 2017.

1257
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,240
I was down with my dad and brother.

1258
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,260
And it was a night where we're like all just like, parks are closed, everyone's different

1259
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,280
levels of hungry.

1260
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,280
We all just split up.

1261
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,200
So I was just walking around CityWalk and I was like, what do I eat?

1262
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,560
And I was like, oh, the Hot Dog Hall of Fame and got a Chicago dog, liked it.

1263
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,820
You know, I had my customary before bed Sunday from Toothsome.

1264
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,180
Customary.

1265
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,700
Even though Toothsome started that year.

1266
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,180
I meant customary ice cream.

1267
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,200
Oh, Sunday in general.

1268
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:48,600
I see.

1269
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:48,980
Sunday.

1270
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:49,320
Yeah.

1271
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,640
To make something customary.

1272
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,360
The first time.

1273
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,440
On the first time.

1274
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,100
No, not Toothsome in particular.

1275
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:02,340
I was just like, and it, yeah, it was filling.

1276
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:09,340
I think Chicago dogs are deceptive because a lot of it is the garden.

1277
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:15,840
Well, I, so it tastes, it all tastes good.

1278
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,200
You know, I don't know.

1279
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:18,760
Portillo's wise.

1280
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,920
You remember when we had Portillo's?

1281
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,320
We've had Portillo's a couple times.

1282
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,760
Do you find it deceptive then?

1283
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:34,820
No, no, I like, or in terms of keeping you full, like the pickled, pickled stuff is like

1284
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:39,080
you get the kick of salt, you know, but it's not the most filling, you know,

1285
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,080
pickles and relish and that sort of thing.

1286
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,280
You're saying that it looks like a large amount of food, but once you eat it,

1287
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,340
it's pretty manageable.

1288
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:48,280
It's manageable and it's not necessarily that you're going to be like packed full.

1289
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,240
That sport pepper spice might fill you up a little.

1290
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:57,440
Yeah, I feel, yeah, I guess the Chicago dog like markets itself as like two meals in one.

1291
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,560
And you're like, well, no, it isn't.

1292
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,840
It's a bit, if so, it's a piece of shit salad on top of a really good hot dog.

1293
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:06,600
I like a bit.

1294
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,760
I mean, I like Portillo's.

1295
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,740
I'm look, I was raised in Chicago.

1296
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:10,660
Portillo's.

1297
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:10,840
Yeah.

1298
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,280
Do you like the big pickle?

1299
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,980
I like the big like pickle slice on the hot dog.

1300
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:15,920
I like the big pick.

1301
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:21,300
I prefer the big pickle to the sport pepper, but I also like, I just am not a sport pepper guy.

1302
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:22,860
I don't know.

1303
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,540
I come down pretty hard on the Chicago dog.

1304
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,940
I got booed at my own book release event in Chicago.

1305
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,080
They're there for you.

1306
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,040
They're there for you.

1307
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,040
And you still manage.

1308
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:34,600
That's great.

1309
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:39,540
And the whole Q and A was just person after person being like, so what was it?

1310
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,760
What was wrong with it?

1311
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:44,660
Wow.

1312
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,780
Deep dish pizza and Chicago hot dogs.

1313
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,940
Are you probably like you were a wrestling heel in Chicago?

1314
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,020
I mean, they did show up, but it was to confront.

1315
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,580
I read your book.

1316
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,400
Are you upset?

1317
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,580
Are you upset about this though?

1318
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,280
Very upset.

1319
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:01,860
Okay.

1320
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:03,360
I'm sorry.

1321
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,120
It's going to be a seething tension.

1322
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,820
What is the Chicago dog?

1323
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:08,940
I have no dog in this fight.

1324
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,060
I have no dog in this fight.

1325
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,280
It's Vienna beef, poppy.

1326
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,780
It's basically the thing they have.

1327
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,140
Poppy seed bun.

1328
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,540
Like that neon relish?

1329
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,280
Neon relish.

1330
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,020
Neon relish raw.

1331
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:22,400
Yeah.

1332
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,360
But what's the, why do you come down hard on it?

1333
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,980
Not to get our Chicago audience upset at you.

1334
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,540
Well, no, I feel like my reasoning is going to make people even madder.

1335
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,800
I think it's a fine hot dog.

1336
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:38,600
I don't buy the whole two meals in one historical marketing.

1337
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:45,880
And just that people are so adamant that it's the best hot dog when it's

1338
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:51,980
demonstrably untrue if you go outside Dodger Stadium.

1339
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,500
There's so many anyways.

1340
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,320
Oh, sure.

1341
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:55,460
Wait.

1342
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,740
So then favorite general preparation for you.

1343
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,780
What is your personal ranking number one?

1344
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:11,340
Ooh, I love, I mean, on my top five list is like the carts outside any LA

1345
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,220
sports stadium, never inside.

1346
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,900
Is this, yeah, because I haven't done this in a long time, but boy, leaving a

1347
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,520
concert, I do love the smell of those carts that are sitting there.

1348
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,020
So good.

1349
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,620
Is that generally, I haven't done it forever.

1350
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,600
Is that a reliable area?

1351
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,040
Those are pretty great.

1352
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:25,500
Yeah.

1353
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,860
And they take Venmo now.

1354
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:27,740
It's great.

1355
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:28,820
It's great.

1356
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:33,660
I got a great danger dog after going to WrestleMania last year.

1357
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,940
And it was one of the most saddest, because I was like, I was so hungry,

1358
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,940
but I'm like, don't get it in the stadium.

1359
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:43,380
Wait, you'll feel, and it was incredible.

1360
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,120
That's really good.

1361
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:48,880
I really, I like a lot of Southwestern hot dogs.

1362
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:53,520
There's the Arizona prep, which is on this menu is really, really good.

1363
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,720
And I like something that I don't think, I guess it would technically be a New

1364
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,240
Jersey hot dog.

1365
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:03,860
Cause I think that, and like New York and Chicago, I think are too cocky

1366
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,040
about their hot dog prep.

1367
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:11,980
And like, it's actually Tucson and Jersey that's holding it down and in

1368
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:12,540
Michigan as well.

1369
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,700
But, but yeah, there's a, it's everyone's favorite hot dog places in New Jersey.

1370
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:21,380
And it's called Rutz Hut.

1371
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:26,060
And they have a hot dog called the Ripper, which is lightly deep fried.

1372
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,060
Oh, wow.

1373
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:30,660
They deep fry it for like five to 10 seconds.

1374
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,540
You can get different levels of deep fry.

1375
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:36,580
There's whole lore attached to it, but it gives like the perfect, like little,

1376
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,120
not, not crunch, but just like the perfect snap.

1377
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:40,620
Yeah.

1378
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,720
As you're, as you're riding into it.

1379
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,220
And, and it's just like kind of a shithole on the side of the highway, but

1380
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,780
like has the best hot dogs in the world.

1381
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,960
I think that's the one, did Anthony Bourdain talk about Rutz Hut?

1382
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:53,420
Yeah.

1383
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,800
It's, and it really is like hanging over the highway.

1384
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,040
It could, the location would not be weirder.

1385
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:05,360
There's a lot of wonderful food in New Jersey that have been there

1386
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,660
for like 50 to 80 years.

1387
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,860
It looks like a death trap, but it might be one of the best things you've ever eaten.

1388
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:13,260
Yeah.

1389
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:18,320
It's like does, again, we were traveling like shortly out of lockdown.

1390
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:22,900
So, but like it did feel like, oh, this is where you would go if you just killed

1391
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,060
somebody and then you would come to Rutz Hut and get two hot dogs.

1392
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:29,000
Wow.

1393
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:30,640
It is like a crooked building.

1394
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,860
It's strange looking.

1395
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,980
I don't know if you addressed the, have you talked about this before?

1396
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,480
Have you ever had at Disney a Ronto wrap?

1397
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,440
Yes.

1398
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:38,180
Yeah.

1399
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,620
We're all big fans of that.

1400
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:44,340
I was, I was expecting to be a hater of the Ronto wrap, but I was pleasantly

1401
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:44,880
surprised.

1402
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:45,380
Okay.

1403
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,100
A good serving size.

1404
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,240
Good serving size.

1405
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,340
That fills you for sure.

1406
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:49,600
Yeah.

1407
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:55,100
I forget what the lore is, but I appreciated that they get, they attributed somewhere.

1408
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:58,120
There's like attributed lore to the Ronto wrap.

1409
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:58,400
Yeah.

1410
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,700
The Ronto is a character you can see in the movies and you're eating it.

1411
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,340
So it's being cooked by a pod racer.

1412
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,640
And being cooked on the engine of the pod racer.

1413
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:08,680
So that is all.

1414
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,500
The most successful part of Galaxy's Edge.

1415
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,420
It very well could be.

1416
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,980
I had one a week ago.

1417
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,920
I want to return to the Ronto.

1418
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:24,600
The Ronto wrap might've been, I mean, I tried to like stay out of the corn dog zone

1419
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,300
because I feel like it's almost a whole different discussion, but like the corn dogs

1420
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,040
are great.

1421
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,940
But the Ronto wrap, I think took it for, for Disney.

1422
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:33,920
Above the corn dog.

1423
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,840
We left it out of the hot dog competition as we end corn dogs, because it felt like

1424
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,980
if we put those in, one of those is going to win.

1425
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,560
I like that the hot dog hall of fame also seems to subscribe to this.

1426
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,540
They're like, we're not fucking with corn dogs.

1427
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,360
That's the same thing.

1428
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,020
Yeah, different thing.

1429
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:50,560
Different thing.

1430
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:56,440
This might be a good time to, Jimmy, you've referred to like whoever put this together.

1431
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,040
You know, you did well for this reason, that reason.

1432
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:04,040
And I'm, it could, to me, it could not be a better answer of who put it together because

1433
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:09,500
it is, it is one guy and it's a guy who we talked about recently and who's come up on

1434
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:15,960
the show here and there because this is, he's becoming a legend to me quickly.

1435
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,500
Steven Schussler.

1436
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,780
Steven Schussler is the inventor of the Rainforest Cafe.

1437
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:24,720
Whoa.

1438
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,880
He personally developed that concept.

1439
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:36,000
And as we've discussed recently, in order to prove it, created a demo Rainforest Cafe,

1440
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:40,220
not just in some industrial space, in his suburban home.

1441
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:46,620
He turned his house next to other houses with neighbors into a fully functioning rainforest.

1442
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:54,280
His house was so humid to prove the point of, that a rainforest inside a building would

1443
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,020
be a good idea.

1444
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:56,360
That rocks.

1445
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1446
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:02,260
This is a guy, this is a, this is a practice what he preaches, like a big swings guy.

1447
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:07,580
I've learned a little, I've, sometimes we do an episode and I do the prep for it and

1448
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,840
then I never think about it again.

1449
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,620
Steve Schussler has stuck with me, especially given that we're going to talk about him a

1450
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:14,360
little more with this.

1451
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,540
I've watched some like motivational speeches that he's done.

1452
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,380
What order do I go in?

1453
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,520
There's so much here.

1454
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:27,640
Also, okay, so T-Rex Cafe is also him, if you're a T-Rex Cafe.

1455
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:28,880
This all makes sense.

1456
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
It all feels like a part of the same.

1457
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,960
Great whimsical, weird premises, concepts.

1458
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,200
You don't need the premise to enjoy the place, but it sure makes it fun.

1459
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,280
Impossible to uninstall kind of.

1460
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,540
Oh yeah, you can't flip them easily.

1461
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,260
You can't like do the 2020s blandify of these places.

1462
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:53,900
I went to the, what's the huge, I was reading a story about malls and I went to this huge

1463
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:57,520
mall in Phoenix where there's a huge.

1464
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,880
The Scottsdale one, there's a massive one.

1465
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,160
Yeah, yeah, kind of right on the border.

1466
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:01,640
Yeah, yeah.

1467
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,760
There was a gigantic rainforest cafe inside and it was quiet.

1468
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:11,420
And I went, I was talking to the waiter who was very candid and I was just like, I'm

1469
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,760
like, surprise, this is still open.

1470
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:18,620
He's like, yeah, honestly, like it would be more expensive to uninstall it and to

1471
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,600
just like leave it here unsuccessfully.

1472
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,840
I was like, wow.

1473
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,320
That's so cool.

1474
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,720
I love that.

1475
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:34,160
I read the story you're talking about and I love that malls now are stuff like that.

1476
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,600
And then a lot of stores that sell.

1477
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,640
Heath Ledger Joker.

1478
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,080
Yes, it was.

1479
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:48,200
I couldn't tell how much of that was just like being in Arizona, but it was all like,

1480
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:54,320
yeah, gigantic theme restaurants and then like think like stores that look like they

1481
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,980
could be like cleaned out within 20 minutes.

1482
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:04,100
That was all like cosplay gear and like, yeah, Joker Joker is Naruto in one piece.

1483
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:09,820
And yeah, and and probably some Scarface and then maybe hopefully fingers crossed

1484
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:12,340
something where all of the Jokers are meeting.

1485
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,980
I think there's some there's some playing poker poker.

1486
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,920
Yeah, I think maybe there's one where they're all in a car like taking a joy ride.

1487
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:20,980
Oh, yeah, I've seen that one.

1488
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:27,820
It reminds me of the image of Paul Walker driving Brian the dog to heaven.

1489
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:28,900
That's what the.

1490
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:34,480
It's like the same angel of the car should be a standard mall shirt as well.

1491
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,340
I think about that.

1492
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,400
Oh, yeah, because Brian the dog died at some point.

1493
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:42,160
Unlike Paul Walker, he came back and he came back.

1494
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,060
Yeah, he did come back.

1495
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,540
But you have so Schussler.

1496
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:50,720
There's so much extra Schussler lore, including even just about the rainforest cafe

1497
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,000
thing, which we're talking about.

1498
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,180
But I watched this long, like motivational speech that he gave

1499
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:59,600
where he talked about the the making of it was so hard.

1500
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,160
I posted this on our on our Twitter and it's worth playing on the show.

1501
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,100
This is like this is an ad for the event that you can buy where he'll come

1502
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:12,280
and motivate your company with his speech called 800 Pound Gorilla.

1503
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:18,100
Hundred Pound Gorilla package includes five thousand books, an inspirational

1504
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:22,820
speech, customized podcast on creativity, innovation,

1505
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,000
the five P's and the eleven commandments.

1506
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:30,260
A one day personalized consultation where I actually go to your office

1507
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:36,020
and speak with your employees and your staff to our ideation and lunch.

1508
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:40,460
I didn't have before me at one of my restaurants and autographed party

1509
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,040
and you support a smile.

1510
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,040
The value of this investment is priceless.

1511
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,780
This is the ultimate 800 Pound Gorilla package.

1512
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,660
Did he say autograph party?

1513
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:53,240
Autograph.

1514
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,840
Yeah, he's got five thousand books to sell.

1515
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,160
It's a party when you're signing.

1516
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:04,800
This is promoting his book called It's a Jungle in there.

1517
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,840
Inspiring lessons, hard won insights and other acts of entrepreneurial daring,

1518
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,480
which has endorsements by both Lee Iacocca and at the time it was written

1519
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,240
President Elect Donald Trump.

1520
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:15,800
Wow.

1521
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:20,800
And he mentioned the five P's personality, product,

1522
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,600
persistence, people and philanthropy.

1523
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:27,200
But the book also preaches the value of passion and caring for like, wait,

1524
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:30,560
you said five P's and then immediately added a sixth P.

1525
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:32,500
But that is not one of the five P's.

1526
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,140
No, not canonically a P.

1527
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:39,400
I mean, it's a P alphabetically,

1528
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,520
but it's not officially one of his.

1529
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,700
This guy thinks outside the box, you know.

1530
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:47,380
Is it is it like self published?

1531
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:52,020
Does it look like I don't think he could publish it like I love.

1532
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,840
I love an entrepreneurial self published book.

1533
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:56,740
Oh, yeah.

1534
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:00,140
I've never thought about this dimension because that implies that nobody's asking.

1535
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:04,580
It's like part of building their own mythology to just do it yourself.

1536
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,200
My favorite.

1537
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:06,720
I have one.

1538
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,420
Oh, my God.

1539
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,440
To mind immediately.

1540
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:15,000
It is the guy who has since passed the creator of one Pollo,

1541
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,260
the chicken restaurant.

1542
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,440
It's just like a rotisserie chicken chain.

1543
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:26,800
And I for some reason, he like bought the original McDonald's on Route 66.

1544
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,900
He really was into McDonald's history.

1545
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,020
He wanted to preserve it.

1546
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:34,180
So they're at that like location.

1547
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:38,640
It's a weird mix of like McDonald's stuff and then this guy's stuff,

1548
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,620
including his book, which I bought called Albert Okura,

1549
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,760
the chicken man with a 50 year plan.

1550
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:46,160
And it's got an incredible cover.

1551
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:46,880
Wow.

1552
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,200
Guy with sunglasses and then just like a regular shirt,

1553
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,940
like a shirt from the from the restaurant in front of 20 rotisserie chickens on fire.

1554
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:56,500
Sorry.

1555
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,560
Can I stare at that again for a second?

1556
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,160
Oh, my.

1557
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,100
Oh, my God.

1558
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,300
It was I was just confused by the pattern.

1559
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,700
I didn't even know what I was looking at.

1560
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,140
Whoa.

1561
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,100
He's in front of a wall of chickens.

1562
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:07,960
Geez, we got a lot to post.

1563
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,280
Sigourney Weaver, this Ruts Hut.

1564
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,260
Oh, my God.

1565
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,700
Have you have you read it?

1566
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,120
Have you looked through it or just aware of it?

1567
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,700
I've skimmed I've skimmed the chicken man with a 50 year plan.

1568
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,080
And it seems like, you know, I don't know.

1569
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,480
I mean, he executed it.

1570
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:27,180
He was like, I will have a successful restaurant chain in 50 years.

1571
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:31,300
And it's just kind of like a reasonable ish goal.

1572
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:31,960
Yeah.

1573
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:32,440
Yeah.

1574
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,820
So it's an easygoing.

1575
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:34,540
That's yeah.

1576
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:34,760
Yeah.

1577
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:34,900
Yeah.

1578
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,020
You still got time to have fun.

1579
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:36,620
He did it.

1580
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,740
See friends plan achieved for him.

1581
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,420
But I think they share some kind of common DNA.

1582
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:42,100
I think so.

1583
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,920
Well, in their in their graphic design, I think this this guy makes

1584
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,940
so many crazy claims about the founding of Rainforest Cafe.

1585
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,760
He says that his neighbors

1586
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:56,360
demanded that he get a psychiatric evaluation

1587
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,560
due after that, but once there were the sheer volume of like that,

1588
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,640
everything's vines and jungle and like a monkey.

1589
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,740
He has monkeys in the house now and that a psychologist called him

1590
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:11,340
and like, your neighbors have paid for me to do this.

1591
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,360
And it's somehow I forget he waved him.

1592
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,700
He waved it off somehow.

1593
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,460
Then he he all the money from Rainforest Cafe.

1594
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,140
We addressed this was it was put up by one of the most successful poker

1595
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:25,060
players of all time named Lyle Berman.

1596
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,960
And he claims in his speech that his father went under velvet

1597
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,920
ropes at a poker at the World Series of Poker.

1598
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,900
When this guy went up to go to the bathroom, his

1599
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:40,800
this guy's father went and sat in the guy's chair

1600
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,760
so that when he came back, a stranger was there.

1601
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,540
And he's like, what are you doing?

1602
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,880
Don't you see the security?

1603
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:48,460
You're crazy.

1604
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:49,780
You have to leave right now.

1605
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,580
And he said, no, first, you need to hear about my son's rainforest restaurant.

1606
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,120
I don't know if I believe this, because how is how are you

1607
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,700
walking up to the rain for it?

1608
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:00,700
And then it goes on.

1609
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,440
And he says how this poker player, he had to get to the rainforest

1610
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,860
house 28 times or something.

1611
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,440
And that the final piece of it to get him to sign up to sign off

1612
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:14,220
and do it was that he said, listen, Lyle, here's what I'm going to do.

1613
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:18,320
I'm getting a big sandwich board that I'm going to wear in the sea.

1614
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,380
And it's going to say Lyle made me do it.

1615
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,520
And then I'm going to jump off a bridge.

1616
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,320
That's what I'm going to do.

1617
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,760
If you don't give me the money for the rainforest cafe.

1618
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:31,820
And he said, here's three million dollars.

1619
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,420
I believe that.

1620
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,940
I believe that this man said, I will kill myself

1621
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,120
unless you give me the money for rainforest cafe.

1622
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:41,760
I do believe that.

1623
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,340
That makes sense to me.

1624
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,440
The first story that adds up.

1625
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:47,420
Just the tone of his speech in that sales pitch he makes.

1626
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,260
So you order this guy to your company and he'll tell you that story.

1627
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:52,000
Right.

1628
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,120
And that's priceless.

1629
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:56,380
I can't tell you he brings five thousand books.

1630
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:59,540
Do you regardless of how many people are there?

1631
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,720
I'm bringing five thousand books.

1632
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,820
This is an autograph party.

1633
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:04,980
I ordered a million.

1634
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:08,560
Does that mean if you have the 800 pound gorilla package,

1635
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,660
have you purchased the books or did he just the part of the package?

1636
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:13,580
Did he just bring them?

1637
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:17,060
It's the presence of the books and the possibility to get them.

1638
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,040
But then the book is extra and the autograph is extra.

1639
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,700
He provides the autograph party, but the autograph itself

1640
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,320
you have to customize an atom.

1641
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,180
It makes sense.

1642
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:26,980
I'm not sure.

1643
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:30,460
He just drive a U-haul up to the party with all the books.

1644
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:31,960
A lot of books.

1645
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:32,480
Yeah.

1646
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,760
Five thousand books.

1647
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:37,440
It does sound like I mean, this guy seems like a nice guy.

1648
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:43,380
He seems like a benign version of this kind of very rich.

1649
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,740
Yeah, I think so.

1650
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,840
The guys that we've talked about yet.

1651
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:52,400
The five thousand books does sound like the conservative publishing racket.

1652
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:52,960
Yeah.

1653
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:54,300
A best selling book.

1654
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,540
And they just buy it for all these insane conferences.

1655
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:01,520
He may have bought a million books to send it up the charts.

1656
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,660
And now he has to get rid of them.

1657
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,520
It's got a really hopeful.

1658
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,520
I love reading about like scams like that, because then you're like,

1659
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:07,400
what the fuck is this?

1660
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:10,120
You're like, oh, it's a liar.

1661
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:15,060
Like, it's just like it's a liar lying about the rainforest cafe.

1662
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:15,780
Yeah.

1663
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:21,240
It's really it's no way that it became this brand that has major placement

1664
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:26,440
in every major city that did at one point, and then it came out of a guy going,

1665
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,920
I'm going to kill myself.

1666
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,520
I got a jungle house.

1667
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:33,060
The psychiatrist calls me on the phone.

1668
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:37,140
If that bridge is high enough, first off, the mechanics of a sandwich board.

1669
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,640
I feel like that sandwich board is flying off.

1670
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,860
Like they might not.

1671
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,500
It might just be a blur for photographers.

1672
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,960
What's the sign that that is 20 feet from the body?

1673
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:49,800
I don't know.

1674
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,520
And I can't read the text anymore.

1675
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:53,680
Throw it in the garbage truck.

1676
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:57,340
God, my day is so much harder than normal.

1677
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:00,820
I was earlier here before we started recording, saying sometimes you maybe

1678
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,740
you don't want to like dig in and interview certain people.

1679
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,880
But maybe we want to interview this guy.

1680
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:06,380
Yeah.

1681
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:09,700
Well, if we I think the price of you think you'll charge us.

1682
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:10,600
Five thousand books.

1683
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:11,320
You think you would charge us?

1684
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,740
But we're promoting him.

1685
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:13,560
We are outlets.

1686
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,220
How much is it for you to be on the show?

1687
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,460
Five thousand bucks?

1688
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,560
No, five thousand books.

1689
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:21,880
I need you to take I know there's three of you

1690
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,660
and only a couple of heads of your network.

1691
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:28,300
But I'm bringing one thousand seven hundred books off my hands

1692
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,900
and then I will do your podcast.

1693
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:35,420
The fact that there is no music in that ad was making my head hurt.

1694
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:39,340
You could hear him taking ragged breaths as it continued.

1695
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,700
I just put the music under it.

1696
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,120
That's like the Chris Farley El Nino sketch.

1697
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:46,860
Or he's just like yelling.

1698
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:47,700
It was a red.

1699
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,660
It was his final sketch.

1700
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:50,700
Yeah.

1701
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,640
That shows you the wrestling promo.

1702
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:59,040
So anyway, he also now we know what his speeches are like and what they promise.

1703
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:05,080
And he gave an opening day speech at the opening of his newest concept.

1704
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:06,860
Hot dog Hall of Fame.

1705
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,580
How amazing is it to now know this is who did it?

1706
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,680
So here this this might be this might be a full minute or so,

1707
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,020
but I think it's worth it.

1708
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,400
How many here love hot dogs?

1709
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,540
Yeah, almost everyone here.

1710
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:22,960
Almost is an American food, obviously.

1711
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,300
Where the fuck is something that we have a great deal of pride in.

1712
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,260
We've been experimenting with hot dogs for the last seven years,

1713
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:35,540
seven years going all over the world to eating some of the best hot dogs.

1714
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:39,820
I promise you that hot dog Hall of Fame here at Universal Studios

1715
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:43,420
will be the best hot dog experience you've ever had.

1716
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:47,980
We're going to serve five different beers, nine different hot dogs,

1717
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:50,840
12 different kinds of mustard.

1718
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,800
We're going to have one of the most exclusive mustard bars you've ever seen.

1719
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:59,440
The things that we're going to be known for is some of the little stuff.

1720
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:02,080
For instance, our two foot hot dogs.

1721
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,400
I can imagine a two foot hot dog.

1722
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:06,780
That big.

1723
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:10,440
Two people can pull it from both sides.

1724
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,860
We have special hot dog hats.

1725
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,840
We have all kinds of things for the family and for children and

1726
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,500
paint your own wiener.

1727
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,400
Oh, bring that back.

1728
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:22,280
Yeah.

1729
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,120
It's your home of paint your own wiener.

1730
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:28,740
You can buy these hot dogs inside and they get they get painted.

1731
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:29,760
They get collected.

1732
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:30,960
They get saved.

1733
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,520
And I am the commissioner of hot dog Hall of Fame.

1734
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:35,160
The commissioner.

1735
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,020
Wow.

1736
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:36,700
Wow.

1737
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,680
This predates a certain Mr.

1738
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:40,080
Susser.

1739
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,120
Wow.

1740
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,200
Maybe this guy's got a lawsuit on it.

1741
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:43,820
I think so.

1742
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,100
Yeah.

1743
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,280
There is like a surprising amount of crossover between like

1744
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,880
hot dog, like celebrities and like professional wrestling cadences.

1745
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:54,800
Yeah.

1746
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:55,140
Yeah.

1747
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:59,820
This does feel like like he's kind of issuing a threat to no one.

1748
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,520
It's confrontational.

1749
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:07,380
But to what today to like any other restaurant that doesn't do any of this

1750
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,220
to somebody wouldn't want to come in.

1751
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,940
I feel challenged by that.

1752
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,700
I think this has to be like the attitude you have to like

1753
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,400
convince someone to give you millions of dollars.

1754
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:17,840
Yeah.

1755
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,700
There's no way you're like, excuse me, could I have three million dollars?

1756
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:24,060
I have a rainforest idea for like that's not happening.

1757
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,560
You have to come in aggressively.

1758
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,940
And that makes either people scared, annoyed

1759
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:30,820
or just like convinced, you know, you're doing.

1760
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,320
Or we'll give you three million dollars to stop talking to them.

1761
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,400
That's also true, too.

1762
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,300
I've got poker games to play.

1763
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:39,000
Yeah.

1764
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,380
Stop badgering me.

1765
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,140
And maybe it'll work.

1766
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,860
God, I feel OK.

1767
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:45,680
That speech was great.

1768
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:46,040
Yeah.

1769
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,160
It did feel like he was yelling at them.

1770
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:48,580
Yeah.

1771
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,040
I OK.

1772
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:55,760
He said he went he traveled worldwide for what he has already admitted

1773
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,220
is a very domestic event.

1774
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:58,680
Yeah.

1775
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,540
But he has traveled worldwide.

1776
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,860
And there's less mustards now.

1777
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,880
There were 12 mustards at inception.

1778
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:05,880
That's heartbreaking.

1779
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:06,600
Five mustards.

1780
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:09,600
I've never seen the collectible wieners either.

1781
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,100
Or even hot dog hats.

1782
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:14,840
I was like, I surely would have gotten a hat if they had one.

1783
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:20,720
Well, they've also betrayed his original vision in another way, which is so,

1784
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,680
you know, they've got the big screen.

1785
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,240
You can watch games there.

1786
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,540
Just this morning, texting a friend of the show, Kevin Tully.

1787
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:31,480
He said he went and just sat in the grandstands.

1788
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,640
He didn't even get a hot dog.

1789
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,900
Watched an entire baseball game there and said it was wonderful.

1790
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,220
Very pleasant time.

1791
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:37,800
So that's good.

1792
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,360
They created this great environment to watch baseball games.

1793
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,340
But that's not what Steve wanted.

1794
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:47,280
He goes on in this interview to say he wanted the big screen at all times

1795
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,460
to be playing videos of people eating hot dogs.

1796
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,860
Oh, that's great.

1797
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:58,280
Are you going to find a long enough loop of that?

1798
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,420
You're going to make it.

1799
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,160
I guess so.

1800
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,780
It's going to be custom done from the ground up.

1801
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:06,060
Hire a famous director to travel the country for months.

1802
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,800
Or a collection like they should have made like the.

1803
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,340
Oh, every director makes their own little.

1804
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:12,880
Yes.

1805
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,140
Like there was that run of like New York, I love you.

1806
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:20,860
Paris, they should make an anthology of just like hot dog shit.

1807
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:21,080
Shit.

1808
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:21,920
Yeah.

1809
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,520
God, I would love that.

1810
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,160
So he was he maybe wanted this thing to be a little bit more of what I was saying

1811
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:32,660
at the start, a little more hot dog centric versus baseball centric.

1812
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:33,340
Sporty.

1813
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,740
That's really good to know.

1814
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,280
I mean, I wonder.

1815
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:39,760
I mean, I guess I know why they were like, we're not going to do that.

1816
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:45,200
But it's already even still we've lost some of this,

1817
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:49,100
but it's still like kind of an unusual for just a counter restaurant.

1818
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,000
It's unusual and as weird gimmicks.

1819
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:55,060
And he wanted there to be twice as many gimmicks.

1820
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:58,280
The buy in to be here is so much.

1821
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,160
God bless.

1822
01:24:59,160 --> 01:24:59,920
This is that.

1823
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:00,020
Yeah.

1824
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:03,760
Like rare businessman who is a eccentric creative.

1825
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:04,680
Yeah.

1826
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:07,540
Not always like not usually it's too practical.

1827
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,520
The thinking for these type of guys.

1828
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,880
But no, this guy is an artist.

1829
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,840
I feel like in this guy, you know, if you go in the rainforest cafe now,

1830
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:19,400
of course, they're selling Tillman for Tito's very aggressive self-help.

1831
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:19,760
Sure.

1832
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:20,120
Yeah.

1833
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,160
Motivational book.

1834
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:22,300
The now owner.

1835
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:22,960
The now.

1836
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:23,660
ownership.

1837
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:24,080
Yeah.

1838
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,780
Now it's owned by Landry's, which owns Bubba Gump.

1839
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:27,080
Right.

1840
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,220
And he's not a creative guy in this way.

1841
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:29,580
No.

1842
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:30,260
He just purchased.

1843
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:30,720
No.

1844
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:31,840
Just mean numbers.

1845
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:32,660
Yeah.

1846
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:34,960
But I feel like his book,

1847
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,860
I mean, they're not my cup of tea, those business motivation books.

1848
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,740
I feel like his book is probably less like intent.

1849
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:47,440
Tillman for D is this book starts with warning you that a paddle is coming

1850
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:51,960
for your ass and you must be aware of that at any given time.

1851
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:55,660
And that is his like five steps.

1852
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,360
You know, I don't know.

1853
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,960
His book has death threats.

1854
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:01,260
And they sell it.

1855
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,560
They have it like at the cash register.

1856
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:04,920
There's a sack of them.

1857
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:07,720
A black and white in the most colorful environment.

1858
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,780
What could stand out and get your attention for us?

1859
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:14,260
It was being in the Schomburg mall and seeing this black and white photo

1860
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:19,220
of the meanest man ever seen amidst all the friendly frogs and birds

1861
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:21,300
and whatever that really jumped out.

1862
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,360
I would like to read it.

1863
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,140
I love business books are like so demented.

1864
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:31,260
And the target audience, I don't think, recognizes that all of the time.

1865
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:34,100
But if you're just like reading one for fun, yeah, like that

1866
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:38,460
self mythologizing, you're like, how how are you going to tell me

1867
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,780
this book would survive a fact check?

1868
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,440
Like it's.

1869
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:42,840
Yeah.

1870
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:43,280
Yeah.

1871
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,080
And if you're putting it out yourself there, then nobody's ever.

1872
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:49,160
Maybe God, these are books I should I should read.

1873
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,100
We've never read.

1874
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:50,800
Yeah, we should.

1875
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,040
How come for your ass book?

1876
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:56,920
No, I tried to get when we were talking about it initially when it came up,

1877
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:59,220
like it was it was on hold.

1878
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:00,960
Oh, there was too much demand.

1879
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,860
And the library there was too much demand.

1880
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:05,280
It was already out so I could only see a sample.

1881
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,080
And that's how I found the paddle coming from your ass.

1882
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:11,080
Well, I think I think you got a paddle coming from your ass.

1883
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,000
If you don't put down your heart and money and buy it,

1884
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,920
how do you expect to make money if you won't pay me money?

1885
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,280
Yeah, my paddle stories.

1886
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,420
I'm sure that guy,

1887
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,980
I'm sure that guy shows up on like cable news

1888
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:27,320
and was like, no one wants to work anymore.

1889
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:29,020
Oh, yeah, 100 percent.

1890
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,280
I'm sure he owns the Houston Rockets.

1891
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:33,680
Yeah.

1892
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,900
As well, in addition to Landry's restaurants.

1893
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:38,780
Well, I might have to.

1894
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,020
Yeah, these are probably all good areas for episodes for us.

1895
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:42,980
These crazy books.

1896
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,920
I bet they're like that.

1897
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:46,520
Maybe I don't know if you've read anything in this genre, Jamie,

1898
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:50,300
but it seems like it's I bet it's like so boring for 100 pages

1899
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:51,440
and then the craziest thing.

1900
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:53,900
And then they really starts to kick in.

1901
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:58,340
That was how I found the Chicken Man with the 50 Year Plan to be.

1902
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:02,880
Where like it's a very like sort of, you know, generic upbringing.

1903
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:07,820
And then but then when he gets the chicken idea, you're like, well,

1904
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,560
you know, that he's really locking into business speak and like real

1905
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:15,660
manifest destiny sort of talk about the chicken idea.

1906
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:19,700
Yeah, you can get Tillman for T to shut up and listen for eight dollars.

1907
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,540
Thirty cents used on eBay.

1908
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:21,980
Wow.

1909
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,260
All right.

1910
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,420
Shut up and listen.

1911
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:29,280
So imagine you just had like you met Cha Cha the Frog.

1912
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:33,460
You had like a tropical drink and you're walking through the gift shop.

1913
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:38,100
You're like, oh, I'm going to get a panda for my my nephew or niece.

1914
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,520
And then you're like, what?

1915
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,300
He shut up and listen.

1916
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,600
Like, why is it in the restaurant that where there's a thunderstorm

1917
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,440
every 20, 30 minutes?

1918
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,360
Wait, this has like a really good Goodreads rating.

1919
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:52,800
Wow, really?

1920
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,280
Yeah.

1921
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:56,160
Is this awesome?

1922
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,860
It's got a three point nine one on Goodreads.

1923
01:28:58,940 --> 01:28:59,540
That's solid.

1924
01:28:59,540 --> 01:28:59,920
Oh, wow.

1925
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:01,860
Scott, look at this Tillman for Tita.

1926
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:03,200
It's six ninety nine on eBay.

1927
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:07,640
It's a copy of the magazine Wine Spectator and Tillman.

1928
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,140
There he is.

1929
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:09,220
Maybe in his house.

1930
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:11,520
It's a whole cover story on him.

1931
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,000
Tillman for Tita with six hundred plus restaurants.

1932
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,660
He's betting big on wine.

1933
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:17,460
Wow.

1934
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:18,140
Legacy.

1935
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:18,720
Yeah.

1936
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,720
Well, I don't know.

1937
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,620
I've only had crap wine at his restaurant.

1938
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,020
I guess he saves it for himself.

1939
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:26,060
Have you ever read Wine Spectator magazine?

1940
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:30,860
Oh, I can't say I am curious who else is on the cover of Wine Spectator magazine.

1941
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,800
I'll try to gather that here.

1942
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:34,020
Well, maybe I need to.

1943
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:35,500
These are all future episodes.

1944
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,580
Wine Spectator.

1945
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:37,560
Wine Spectator.

1946
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,000
It's less self-help book.

1947
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:42,240
Less goofy than a cigar aficionado.

1948
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,320
I think so.

1949
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:43,740
Yeah.

1950
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:44,540
Yeah.

1951
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:48,360
It doesn't seem like everyone on it is boring so far.

1952
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,180
Oh, yeah.

1953
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:49,820
There's wine.

1954
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,320
Yeah, there's usually it's just a bottle.

1955
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,660
It's just a picture of a bottle.

1956
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,460
That sucks.

1957
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:59,860
I want I want some doofus getting my lips wet with or red with the.

1958
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:02,320
Here's just a person on the front just looking at wines.

1959
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,580
Like, it's not as exciting as Tillman.

1960
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,500
Could we do an episode with listeners be into an episode where we just

1961
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:11,360
review cigar aficionado covers?

1962
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,680
We just like because there's got to be a lot of good ones.

1963
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:14,980
Yeah.

1964
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:15,940
Let's rank them.

1965
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:19,780
Acroid, Jim Belushi are on, you know, for sure.

1966
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:21,060
They're on there every three months.

1967
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:25,420
Yeah, I feel like they didn't know they were such aficionados.

1968
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,260
Oh, yeah.

1969
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:26,820
Oh, wait a minute.

1970
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,940
We got a few Bon Jovi's been on.

1971
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:29,720
Oh, yeah.

1972
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:30,960
Hampton, Hampton Water.

1973
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:31,800
Oh, he has Hampton.

1974
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,100
Oh, God, that's an annoying water.

1975
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,120
Oh, my God.

1976
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:35,680
Yeah.

1977
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:39,820
And and then and Carmelo Anthony, we got.

1978
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:40,200
OK.

1979
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:41,200
But that's a good cover.

1980
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:41,780
That is cool.

1981
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:42,520
Oh, wow.

1982
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,700
He's so happy to be drinking that wine.

1983
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,160
I'm expecting you on the cover of this.

1984
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:49,740
Oh, sure.

1985
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:50,640
I like that.

1986
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:54,680
I like that he's not Carmelo Anthony is not drinking the wine

1987
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,620
and he is just spectating it.

1988
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,720
Oh, yeah.

1989
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:58,780
Can't drink.

1990
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,020
Why is that the name?

1991
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,680
Wine Spectator Wine Drinker.

1992
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,020
Yeah, that sounds bad.

1993
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:10,200
Oh, let me ask while we're talking about beverages, what do you think?

1994
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,720
Is the best company

1995
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:16,300
beverage to accompany hot dogs?

1996
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:16,900
Oh, good question.

1997
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,900
Oh, I mean, if you're going

1998
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:24,900
for like booze, I do feel like a cheap light beer.

1999
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,680
You can't feel don't pair it with an IPA.

2000
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:28,580
Don't mess around.

2001
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:32,380
Do you want anything that's going to dominate the dog?

2002
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:39,220
Or a or like honestly any any soda, any soda that's not fruity.

2003
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:44,780
Like, no, I I'm I would discourage an orange soda with a hot dog.

2004
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,520
Again, just a familiar, a familiar flavor.

2005
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:49,720
I don't know what it's Dr.

2006
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:50,880
Pepper a Coke.

2007
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,320
Yeah, not water.

2008
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:55,380
I think it's so weird when you see someone like

2009
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:01,340
I've got a hot dog and a water bottle like I not it can't be water.

2010
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:04,880
It has to like not appear naturally in the world.

2011
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:08,540
In order to be an appropriate drink for the hot dog.

2012
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:08,780
I don't know.

2013
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:09,600
What's your preference?

2014
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:10,900
I don't know.

2015
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:15,200
I drink a lot of water and I'm only starting to drink more.

2016
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,680
I don't want to say I'm drinking more soda, but I'm a little more like,

2017
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,660
oh, if I'm having a burger and fries or I'm having pizza,

2018
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,160
you want soda with that?

2019
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:24,820
Yeah.

2020
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,440
It sounds like you're drinking more soda.

2021
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:31,380
I don't want to say the phrase I'm drinking more soda.

2022
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:32,460
You want to say it out loud.

2023
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,940
I think if I drink more, I'm drinking more soda,

2024
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:39,820
but then I am cognizant of like, oh, I need to drink more water

2025
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:41,480
the rest of the day to flush it.

2026
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:41,920
The flush.

2027
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,960
As long as I be disturbed if you said I've been trying to drink more.

2028
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,160
That's where the problem is.

2029
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:52,460
I drink more soda, but then it's just like, OK, that's my sugar for the like.

2030
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,580
I can't like have ice cream or cookies or something.

2031
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,720
Oh, that's heartbreaking.

2032
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:59,820
I look like I'm you know what?

2033
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:02,340
I hate to do this around this episode because I don't want to get in the whole thing.

2034
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,160
But the last City Walk Saga five years ago, there's a long stretch

2035
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:09,440
where I just question you about how many times a month you're eating cookies and milk.

2036
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,080
Yes.

2037
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,900
And I said like five.

2038
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,260
And you said like five or six.

2039
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,520
That's a lot of times.

2040
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:15,620
Yeah, it is.

2041
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:18,340
And can we just check in here five years later?

2042
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:22,340
How many times a month are you sitting down with a big glass of milk

2043
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:23,820
and dunking Oreos in it?

2044
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,700
Whole milk, by the way.

2045
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,320
Whole milk.

2046
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:25,740
Yes.

2047
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:26,160
OK.

2048
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,280
Go hard or go home.

2049
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,580
Well, look.

2050
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:32,740
This is important.

2051
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:41,480
Less because I've decreased my cookies, milk and increase my anxiety medication.

2052
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:43,880
OK, OK.

2053
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:45,000
Those don't pair.

2054
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:52,220
I yeah, I feel like we usually keep oat milk or like almond milk in the house.

2055
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,640
And I think I'm less likely to.

2056
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:55,200
I just need it.

2057
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,100
I just need it.

2058
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:56,740
I know.

2059
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:57,520
I know.

2060
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,500
I need a number, though.

2061
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,460
You haven't said a number.

2062
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:00,440
Once or twice.

2063
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,160
OK.

2064
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:02,180
Once or twice.

2065
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:04,340
Yeah, he's still in the game.

2066
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:04,900
Still there.

2067
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,980
So I am not I have left my old self behind totally.

2068
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:12,240
But you know, we all grow up single at some point.

2069
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,960
Growing up, I guess this is growing up means two times a month.

2070
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,580
Sitting down with a big glass and dunking.

2071
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,820
Sitting down with cookies and milk.

2072
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:24,820
And wearing a propeller beanie, but not necessarily making a point to spin it.

2073
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:25,240
Right.

2074
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,420
No, no.

2075
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:30,660
Buying it for live shows at the beautiful Dynasty typewriter.

2076
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:32,980
You know, yes, I do.

2077
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,620
Complimenting the beauty of theaters.

2078
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,600
That's the yeah, live theater.

2079
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,400
You know, the carpet you see.

2080
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,840
OK, actually, one more thing about Schussler, he in his little

2081
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:46,140
interview is the rounds of press he was doing when this place opened.

2082
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:50,060
Something that he said about the philosophy of this place.

2083
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,500
He's talking about the mustard selection.

2084
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:56,500
And then he then he says we're talking about his challenging nature, he says.

2085
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,080
And never ketchup.

2086
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:01,620
Never, ever, ever ketchup.

2087
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,140
What's the what's the room's feeling about?

2088
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,420
Well, that's technically the Chicago thing.

2089
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:07,600
Yeah, that's the Chicago.

2090
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,960
It's very they're very aggressive about that there.

2091
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,740
I will say I don't completely agree with that.

2092
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,000
And I do like ketchup sometimes on it.

2093
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:19,380
It's always nice to spend time with an open minded Chicago.

2094
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,140
I'm a little progressive.

2095
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:26,260
I'm a little more progressive in that way, in my beliefs.

2096
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:31,640
I grew up with I didn't I didn't I wasn't aware that ketchup was not allowed

2097
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,060
until I went to Chicago for the first time.

2098
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:38,180
And I find that that is actually a big part of why I got put off

2099
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:41,560
by the Chicago dog, for I was it was so aggrieved.

2100
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,760
Like there are places where they threaten to cut your hand off.

2101
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:49,800
If you put ketchup on like it's really intense.

2102
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:50,740
I'm pro.

2103
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:51,480
I don't know.

2104
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:53,520
Yeah, seems like an odd thing to be.

2105
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,700
I'm pro to growing up.

2106
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:59,260
I was, you know, always doing ketchup, mustard, relish.

2107
01:35:59,380 --> 01:35:59,680
Yeah.

2108
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:04,000
If I go to like Costco, if I get the famous Costco hot dog soda combo,

2109
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:09,240
I think I'm relish mustard onions like the Boston dog here.

2110
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,080
I think it's fine without ketchup.

2111
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:16,120
I just get I just I'm like, but it's not generally worse for it being there.

2112
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,120
Is it does he explain why no ketchup?

2113
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:20,680
No.

2114
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,120
12 mustards, no ketchup.

2115
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:24,180
He just believes maybe in just that old.

2116
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:24,740
Yeah.

2117
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:25,160
Yeah.

2118
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,140
Feeling or whatever.

2119
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,120
Minnesota guy.

2120
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:31,380
So I don't know how that factors into this whole philosophy,

2121
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:33,940
because I don't see that represented in Milwaukee.

2122
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,600
But I understand the ketchup.

2123
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,020
So like, especially if you put a lot on it or it's like a specific catch up,

2124
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:41,180
like it can't overtake the taste of everything.

2125
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:41,680
Right.

2126
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:43,680
It's a very like strong taste.

2127
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,420
But I don't know.

2128
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,920
It's fun to have ketchup, mustard and relish on it.

2129
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:48,960
I feel like.

2130
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:49,320
Yeah.

2131
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:49,660
Yeah.

2132
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:49,900
Yeah.

2133
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:52,080
So it makes me feel seven.

2134
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,160
That's what it's.

2135
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:53,480
Yes.

2136
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,580
Ketchup is a childhood thing.

2137
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,120
I think it's an infantilizing thing.

2138
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:00,680
I get like a fancy ketchup now to sort of like take the edge off.

2139
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,460
I'm like, sure.

2140
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:02,540
This is adult ketchup.

2141
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,680
Ketchup and white bread, though, is still like, you know,

2142
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,340
a silver fondness for the flavor combination.

2143
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,880
Ketchup and white bread, like white bread or hot dog bun.

2144
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:13,560
You know.

2145
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,120
Oh, OK.

2146
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:14,500
Yeah.

2147
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:15,580
Not just the two together.

2148
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,480
That's what I was asking.

2149
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:17,680
You're not just having a ketchup.

2150
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,240
Oh, no, I'm not just having a ketchup.

2151
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,840
No, I don't live in the depression.

2152
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,180
Not anymore.

2153
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,220
Not anymore.

2154
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,200
Not anymore.

2155
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:24,860
Yeah.

2156
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:25,980
Not since the time.

2157
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:26,560
Not since.

2158
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:26,960
Yeah.

2159
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:27,700
Yeah.

2160
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,180
Not since you got here.

2161
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:29,840
Yeah.

2162
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,100
In the time machine.

2163
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,340
Um, maybe one last question.

2164
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,660
You've you've sampled.

2165
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:39,320
I know Steve talked a big game about his hot dog tour

2166
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:42,540
to get everything he needed to bring to this base.

2167
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:45,820
But I feel like it's very possible you've had more hot dogs.

2168
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:46,600
I don't.

2169
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:47,940
I don't say that I have.

2170
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:48,980
I'll say that I have.

2171
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:49,300
I think.

2172
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,080
I'm willing to bet that.

2173
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,940
I'm sorry if he ends up shouting at you in some later form for having said that.

2174
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:54,880
Shut up and listen.

2175
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:02,760
But if you could bring if there's something missing from the hot dog

2176
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:06,500
hall of fame that you've experienced in your travels, they cover a lot of ground.

2177
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,900
But what what is not represented that should be?

2178
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,940
Gosh, I'd have to look at the menu.

2179
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:16,080
I think that honestly, the menu is surprisingly comprehensive.

2180
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,920
And that but that seems like that's Steve's whole thing.

2181
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:24,420
Like you wouldn't think there would be so much rainforest at the rainforest cafe.

2182
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,360
You wouldn't think that there would be a million options.

2183
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:33,640
I think honestly, that for vegetarian hot dog fans,

2184
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,340
there's not enough here.

2185
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:39,260
That's my main thing.

2186
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,840
They got one vegan field dog.

2187
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:42,300
Yeah.

2188
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:42,520
Yeah.

2189
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,820
Micro cilantro.

2190
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:44,700
This sounds like I don't know.

2191
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:46,740
Don't you want like still kind of base?

2192
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,080
I feel like they overthought.

2193
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:51,320
That that I think is a newer menu addition,

2194
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,940
because I have an older menu and there's no vegan on this.

2195
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:55,180
It's a micro cilantro.

2196
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,220
What is micro?

2197
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,680
Is it like micro plastics or like it's so tiny?

2198
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:05,760
And they invade the blood, brain, the blood, brain barrier is penetrated

2199
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,080
by these micro cilantro.

2200
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,400
What does that mean?

2201
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:11,440
Not sure.

2202
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:15,140
Yeah, it's like I've never had a complaint about the size of cilantro.

2203
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:15,740
Yeah.

2204
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:16,900
Is that a vegan thing?

2205
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:17,940
They can have cilantro.

2206
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:18,700
It's got to be micro.

2207
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:19,580
Just got to be little.

2208
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,100
It's got to be little.

2209
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:24,540
Yeah, I feel like if at the Hot Dog Hall of Fame,

2210
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:30,000
if you could get any of the meat hot dogs with a good vegan alternative,

2211
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:32,500
it would be it would be great.

2212
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:34,920
I also I haven't tried enough of them.

2213
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:36,760
I'm not seeing.

2214
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,460
There's no LA street dog.

2215
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,760
There's no danger dog.

2216
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:42,900
Yeah, there's no danger dog.

2217
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:46,040
And there's no they have two Washington dogs.

2218
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:48,540
I don't know what Washington they're really referring to.

2219
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:50,460
They have blue cheese dressing on this dog.

2220
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:54,340
I'm looking for the cream cheese dog in Washington state,

2221
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:58,820
which I don't believe is represented on this menu for some reason.

2222
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,260
But yeah, the danger dog is missing.

2223
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:06,620
The the cream cheese dog from the Pacific Northwest is missing

2224
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:08,160
and good vegan alternatives.

2225
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,300
But like there's still like more hot.

2226
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,820
Did he say there were nine?

2227
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:14,200
There's way more now.

2228
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,400
Well, that is standard boy.

2229
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:22,040
They're like, they're, you know, and also, of course, I want all 12 mustards back.

2230
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:23,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2231
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,080
Back all 12.

2232
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:26,760
Yeah, we were impressed by six, but imagine 12.

2233
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:27,180
12.

2234
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:28,740
I can't even conceive of 12.

2235
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:33,700
After Jamie, after doing all this work, a hot dog based work, how how many days?

2236
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:36,480
If I said here's three million dollars, you were going to put together

2237
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,740
your own Hot Dog Hall of Fame.

2238
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:42,200
How fast do you think you could draw up the plans for your own version of this?

2239
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:47,180
Oh, I think I who I think pretty quickly menu wise,

2240
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,720
the menu I could bring together in a couple of hours.

2241
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:51,380
Oh, OK.

2242
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,440
But the vision.

2243
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:55,820
What would it look like?

2244
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:56,160
Yeah.

2245
01:40:56,700 --> 01:41:02,340
I I would love a gosh, a medieval times kind of hot dog thing.

2246
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:03,200
I don't know.

2247
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,960
I would want to combine the elements of Chuck E.

2248
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,100
Cheese that I like with a hot dog themed restaurant.

2249
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:12,920
But every time that's been attempted, it hasn't gone over very well.

2250
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:16,660
Like, there's not really a lot of hot dog chains for that reason.

2251
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:21,120
Because there's one of the I wanted to write about more in the book,

2252
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,800
but it's just like almost impossible to learn about.

2253
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:28,260
I happened to read a biography of Mickey Rooney ten years ago,

2254
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:31,060
which is the only reason I have this information.

2255
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:31,960
Wow.

2256
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:33,000
Here's some podcast.

2257
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:34,780
We've been talking about Mickey recently.

2258
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:35,600
He has come up on.

2259
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:36,140
Yeah, yeah.

2260
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:39,760
He's I mean, he's he's he really lived.

2261
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,220
I was I was working at a bookstore at the time.

2262
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:46,080
I was just like reading this over the course of weeks.

2263
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:49,520
But it was in his bad investments era.

2264
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:53,540
And and during that.

2265
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,720
And I think there was just one, maybe two.

2266
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:00,260
They were not open for a long, but it was called like Mickey Rooney's Weenie World.

2267
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,900
And the special dish they would serve was like

2268
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:10,020
a circular hot dog, like an Ouroboros

2269
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:13,380
style hot dog served on the hot dog eating its own tail.

2270
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:21,380
It wasn't successful.

2271
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:24,760
It only survives in like a few newspaper clippings.

2272
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:27,660
So I don't think it would have been in the 70s.

2273
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,660
Like I've had a really hard time.

2274
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,260
Again, because here's the thing.

2275
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:35,660
Some that we've been sent this and we've I think fallen for this.

2276
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:35,900
Yes.

2277
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:38,400
There's something called that helped inspire our celebrity

2278
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,800
where our celebrity owned restaurant.

2279
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:40,180
Right.

2280
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:41,000
That's there's something.

2281
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,460
Sometimes you'll see something go around called Mickey Rooney's potato fantasy.

2282
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,660
But that is a parody, a very well done parody.

2283
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,300
Just yeah, you should know it's a fake.

2284
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:53,100
But so I'm shocked to now discover right next to that.

2285
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:54,440
That's a real there was a real one.

2286
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:56,980
I didn't know that the sillier sounding one is.

2287
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:57,420
Yeah.

2288
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:58,120
Whoa.

2289
01:42:58,360 --> 01:42:59,180
It's OK.

2290
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:03,880
I'm seeing there's there's been a new article written about it since I last checked.

2291
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:04,960
This is great.

2292
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,860
A meandering journey in a search for a restaurant that may or may not exist.

2293
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:11,680
I mean, God, I hope it exists.

2294
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:12,200
Yes.

2295
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:12,860
No, wait.

2296
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:13,780
Potato fantasy.

2297
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:15,000
That's the fake one.

2298
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16,720
But we need world seems to be.

2299
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:19,060
I mean, if it's in his book, it's got to be.

2300
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,380
But also, like, I don't I.

2301
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:22,400
Maybe he made it up.

2302
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:23,920
Is that what people are speculating?

2303
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,580
I need to I own the Mickey Rooney book.

2304
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:29,840
I'll go back and check, because if I'm remembering correctly,

2305
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:33,080
there was like a newspaper clipping like printed in the book.

2306
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,060
That's someone's got what I'm looking at.

2307
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:38,080
There's also and then it's this picture and it's and it's a quote.

2308
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:40,460
Hi, Long Island, you're number one.

2309
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:43,740
The Mick wants you to come to his grand opening.

2310
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:47,860
And then does anyone want to take a quick guess at what the

2311
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:51,280
the themed French fries are called at Mickey Rooney's Weenie World?

2312
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:53,000
Oh, boy.

2313
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,360
It is weenie.

2314
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:58,060
Well, it's really it's very I love this answer.

2315
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:02,600
Anything about any pun he might like turn it into.

2316
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:05,680
Oh, a small fries.

2317
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:06,860
Oh, that's good.

2318
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:07,720
That's very good.

2319
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:08,420
He wishes.

2320
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:09,040
Yes.

2321
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:12,420
The answer is Mickey Rooney French fries.

2322
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:19,340
Free Mickey Rooney French fries with this Mickey Rooney French fries.

2323
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:20,720
Rooney French fries.

2324
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:23,900
That's right up there with my favorite every week.

2325
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:28,660
My favorite bad menu item name was at

2326
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:31,860
was that it was at Universal.

2327
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:34,100
I don't know if it's still there, but it's at the Minions Cafe

2328
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:36,680
and it's just called Evil Mac and Cheese.

2329
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:40,400
And it's disgusting.

2330
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,280
Was that Hollywood?

2331
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,460
Was that at the Hollywood?

2332
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:42,700
Yeah.

2333
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,480
Well, this is why, because guests of this saga,

2334
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:49,580
Evan Susser and Van Roeber Show wrote the menu items for the one in Florida.

2335
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:52,200
So clearly they needed some professional comedy

2336
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:56,460
and some funny people to get a little more clever than Evil Mac and Cheese.

2337
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:57,040
Yeah.

2338
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,640
I was doing the writer's strike.

2339
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,380
I'm like, maybe people were taking a stand.

2340
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:03,360
Scabs are writing this.

2341
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:03,960
Right.

2342
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:05,280
Right.

2343
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,860
Anyway, I mean, what I there's so much we could.

2344
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:10,940
Now I just want to spin it off.

2345
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:12,180
The Mickey Rooney's weenie world.

2346
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:12,700
It's the Mickey.

2347
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,920
There was a tweet going around.

2348
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,960
Is it real where it's like the Property Brothers said

2349
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:21,000
Mickey Rooney kept trying to steal food on this set?

2350
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,600
Yeah, I saw that too.

2351
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:23,480
Celebrity.

2352
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:26,160
Somebody said that was a picture of them with Leslie Jordan.

2353
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,540
Oh, I'm not sure.

2354
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:29,560
I actually I just don't know.

2355
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,240
I didn't look at it very closely too much.

2356
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,320
So I like the idea.

2357
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:37,700
Anyway, that's so I mean, the world was very real.

2358
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:38,700
I'm looking at this.

2359
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:39,420
OK, good.

2360
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:40,520
Him at the opening.

2361
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:41,180
Oh, great.

2362
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:42,540
He's beaming.

2363
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:43,700
Oh, that makes me happy.

2364
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:44,880
That makes me really.

2365
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,500
I'm looking at it.

2366
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:46,740
The picture is so small.

2367
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,240
His smile just like shouts through it somehow.

2368
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:51,520
He's a star.

2369
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,160
Wow.

2370
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:53,980
Was the biggest star in the world.

2371
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,980
How did we miss this during?

2372
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:56,640
Yeah, really?

2373
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:59,720
It's this on the website snack stack.

2374
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:00,200
Yeah.

2375
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:00,540
Yeah.

2376
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:02,440
How did we miss that?

2377
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:03,040
Geez.

2378
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:04,120
I mean, we still have more.

2379
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:06,120
I mentioned in the article that's exciting.

2380
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:06,960
Oh, wow.

2381
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,160
You're in this article.

2382
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:09,140
Wow.

2383
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,500
I just thought as Loftus mentioned before, I was like, what?

2384
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,440
Whoa.

2385
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,140
Damn.

2386
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:15,240
We just what a great.

2387
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,040
It's so nice to be a part of something bigger than yourself.

2388
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:22,500
To be associated with the mixture, to have your name even in his

2389
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:23,860
in the same breath.

2390
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:26,940
Well, it's it's well deserved.

2391
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,020
As I see you, you've more than earned

2392
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:34,540
my earlier poll quote about you being one of America's leading hot dog voices.

2393
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:37,920
And this this was so it's saying a lot.

2394
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:39,480
We've a lot of these have been very fun.

2395
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,520
This is this might be the most fun I've had doing one of these.

2396
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:46,160
Jamie Loftus, he survived podcast, The Ride, The City

2397
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:48,180
Rock, Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness.

2398
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:51,040
Let's exit through the plug portal.

2399
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:52,680
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2400
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:54,440
Besides this article that mentions you.

2401
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Yeah.

2402
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:57,380
Yeah, I'd like to I'd like to plug this snack.

2403
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:59,760
I'm really looking forward to reading this whole thing.

2404
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:04,460
This this writer did a very thorough investigation and confirmed

2405
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,580
the circular hot dog.

2406
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:08,180
Wow.

2407
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:12,540
Wait, and you're in your quote, it's a failed franchise of 52 hot.

2408
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:13,660
They did there were many.

2409
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:15,780
I don't remember what I said in the book.

2410
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:20,880
I I'm assuming I had reason to do it in a relish called McLeish.

2411
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:21,460
Yes.

2412
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,460
No way.

2413
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:26,520
I wish I had known about making really fresh fries.

2414
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:30,440
Oh, not even Andy Hardee's.

2415
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:30,920
No.

2416
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:31,760
Where was this?

2417
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:32,780
Do we know where this was?

2418
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,060
This was in Jersey City.

2419
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:34,460
OK.

2420
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,300
Yeah, but there were multiple locations.

2421
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:40,200
Does the audience want celebrity to let us know just generally?

2422
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,460
If I would never know what to bring back, if you want more celebrity,

2423
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:44,580
I think we could do it.

2424
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:45,000
Especially this.

2425
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:46,420
This makes me want to do this.

2426
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:47,400
I went to the gym.

2427
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,460
Oh, but anyway, plugs officially.

2428
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:51,800
Oh, yeah.

2429
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:52,880
Read raw dog.

2430
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,820
That feels like the thing to plug.

2431
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:57,340
Yeah, I need to.

2432
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:57,780
I'm sold.

2433
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,980
It's every it's everywhere.

2434
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:01,460
I think I don't know.

2435
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:05,040
I think it'll be I don't think it'll be back everywhere closer to hot dog season

2436
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,140
to what's hot dog season.

2437
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,000
Oh, well, I'm going on there.

2438
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:12,120
I it's my publisher has started being like, well, we're going to put you

2439
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:14,500
on the road for a little bit during hot dog season.

2440
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:17,200
Cool.

2441
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:20,000
Is that line up with the paperback release?

2442
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:20,880
Maybe it will.

2443
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,840
The paperback releases next year, but they're like,

2444
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:25,080
we're still going to send you out during the peak season.

2445
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:25,660
Wow.

2446
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:26,480
Yes.

2447
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:26,820
Great.

2448
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,700
So like, you know, June into July, the summer, there's a great

2449
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:35,120
I don't know if hopefully this will like have been announced by the time

2450
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:37,020
this episode comes out.

2451
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:40,360
But there's going to be like a 60 foot long

2452
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:44,640
Times Square hot dog sculpture opening in the spring.

2453
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:45,160
Oh, my God.

2454
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:48,660
And all the hot dog heads are going out.

2455
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:49,760
So I'll be I'll be there.

2456
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,120
So find find me there.

2457
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:52,540
I'll be right now.

2458
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:57,000
The plan is I'll be giving a speech in front of the big hot dog.

2459
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:57,720
Wow.

2460
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:58,600
I can't wait.

2461
01:48:58,760 --> 01:48:59,220
It shoots out.

2462
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:01,760
It also raises up

2463
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:04,420
every couple of hours and shoots out confetti.

2464
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:05,000
What?

2465
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:09,420
I know this is the this is a throwback to like fun 90s.

2466
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:11,800
The David Copperfield restaurant that never opened.

2467
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:13,260
Like, this is some silly stuff.

2468
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:13,680
Wow.

2469
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:15,580
I won't believe it until I see it.

2470
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:16,960
But it is there.

2471
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,200
They're like booking the hot dog.

2472
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:21,920
They're booking people to do stuff at the hot dog.

2473
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:22,600
Wow.

2474
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:24,160
You got a big summer.

2475
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:25,960
If it all ends perfectly.

2476
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:27,540
Congratulations.

2477
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:28,400
Well learned.

2478
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:29,400
Oh, and wait a minute.

2479
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,840
The sector stone.

2480
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:31,680
Oh, there it is.

2481
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:32,900
Sector stone is appearing.

2482
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:34,860
And I think it's huh.

2483
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:36,680
It looks like a sandwich.

2484
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,300
What's in it's hard to say.

2485
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:38,680
Wait a minute.

2486
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,140
Oh, it's got a little like pink style label of what's in it.

2487
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:41,540
Wow.

2488
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:43,740
This is called the Jason

2489
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:45,300
Sarah Sheridan sandwich.

2490
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:45,780
Oh, wow.

2491
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:46,840
And look what's in it.

2492
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:47,620
It's OK.

2493
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:51,060
Ketchup, white bread and anxiety medication.

2494
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:55,900
Oh, that really brings out the oomph of the Lexapro.

2495
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:00,120
All right.

2496
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:02,040
Well, that'll do it.

2497
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:03,140
Jamie, thank you for being here.

2498
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:06,480
We're going to let you go so that we can check in and see where we're at

2499
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,760
at this point, if we're getting anywhere close to the finish line with the sector

2500
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,120
keeper.

2501
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:12,160
So let's see if we can call to him.

2502
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:14,020
Boys, boys.

2503
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:15,120
Hey, hey.

2504
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:15,140
Hey.

2505
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,300
Oh, it's good.

2506
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:17,760
It's good to hear from you.

2507
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:20,460
I mean, you were kind of keeping tabs on that episode, right?

2508
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:21,900
With Jamie Hot Dog, all of fame.

2509
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,460
That was really that was a blast.

2510
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:25,100
I thought that was wonderful, boys.

2511
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:26,060
Thank you.

2512
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:27,060
Oh, boys.

2513
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,720
Things are not good.

2514
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:29,020
What?

2515
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:30,540
How could they?

2516
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:34,900
I mean, isn't that like that's one of the last things we had to do.

2517
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:39,060
We've been doing this for more days now than the original.

2518
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:41,220
Like, we got to be close to the end, right?

2519
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:42,100
Yeah, we've covered everything.

2520
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:42,680
No, boys.

2521
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:44,880
The rift is stronger than ever.

2522
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:49,820
The worst part, it's it's because of me.

2523
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:50,420
What?

2524
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:51,300
How can that be true?

2525
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:52,360
What did you do?

2526
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,140
That doesn't make sense.

2527
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:56,960
The entire multiverse is crumbling because of because of my actions.

2528
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,140
Many, many years ago, boys.

2529
01:50:59,180 --> 01:50:59,640
My.

2530
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:01,440
Yeah, that's something you are.

2531
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:02,080
That you did.

2532
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,600
You don't do bad stuff.

2533
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,220
Yeah, I know.

2534
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:05,380
Sometimes it's smoke or whatever.

2535
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:06,280
I'd like to be bad.

2536
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:08,200
But that's a cheeky thing you usually say.

2537
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:10,520
Sometimes it feels good to be bad.

2538
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:11,040
Yeah.

2539
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:11,380
Yeah.

2540
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,500
But this isn't one of those times.

2541
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:16,540
No, no, this is not bad to be bad.

2542
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:19,260
No, this time it feels bad to be bad.

2543
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:20,700
This time it's bad to be.

2544
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:21,740
OK, well, then what are we?

2545
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:22,060
All right.

2546
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:23,360
So how do we fix it?

2547
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,000
Where do we go?

2548
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:24,640
What do we do?

2549
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:25,340
Just tell us where.

2550
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,760
If I tell you directly, the evil forces will find us.

2551
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:32,800
I can't guide you or the listeners, boys, to the to the next jump point.

2552
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,480
It's it's too dicey.

2553
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:37,940
It's cosmically dicey.

2554
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:38,820
Dicey.

2555
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:42,100
So we have to do another episode,

2556
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:44,540
but we don't know where or what.

2557
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:47,040
No, it might it might be in front of you.

2558
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:50,680
Like like Fassbender, Mr.

2559
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,580
Policeman, I gave you all the clues.

2560
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,700
Oh, it's like a podcast puzzle.

2561
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:58,040
OK, let me think.

2562
01:51:58,200 --> 01:51:59,060
I'm racking my brain.

2563
01:51:59,260 --> 01:51:59,940
Wait a minute.

2564
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,320
Think.

2565
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:01,880
Wait, wait a minute.

2566
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:05,680
I have the I'm looking at the logo

2567
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:09,280
for the Sharon's logo for for the multiverse.

2568
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:09,620
The great logo.

2569
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:10,560
Yes, yes.

2570
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:11,160
Mr.

2571
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:12,640
Scott, look, yes.

2572
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,100
I don't think I've ever called you Mr.

2573
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:15,560
Scott.

2574
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:16,140
Mr.

2575
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:16,520
Scott.

2576
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:18,380
I appreciate it.

2577
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:19,460
It feels very professional.

2578
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:21,860
It's not my last name, but it sounded cool.

2579
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:22,820
Wait a minute.

2580
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:23,660
I'm looking.

2581
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,180
OK, yeah, I mean, I'm zooming way in on the hemisphere dancer.

2582
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:30,420
Playing with a very interesting story behind it.

2583
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:30,820
Of course.

2584
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:33,820
Yes, there's something I've never noticed in this.

2585
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:37,060
From afar, it looks like windows.

2586
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:40,940
But if you look really closely, right, there's numbers.

2587
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:41,880
Zoom, zoom.

2588
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:42,660
I'm zooming.

2589
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:43,300
Yeah, I see.

2590
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,160
OK, I'm looking at it.

2591
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:45,040
Michael, what do you see?

2592
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:45,740
Do you see it?

2593
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:49,380
Michael, you know this plane better than anyone.

2594
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:51,400
I do, but that's yeah, it does.

2595
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:53,520
No, those are the official numbers of the plane.

2596
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:55,500
Yeah, the plane doesn't have that in for in real life.

2597
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:56,360
I would know about it.

2598
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:59,680
But on the image, it says is it an S and a 16?

2599
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:01,380
S16.

2600
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:02,340
Oh, my God.

2601
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,040
What?

2602
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:04,180
What is it, Jason?

2603
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:06,820
We have to go back.

2604
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:08,360
Go back where?

2605
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:08,940
What do you mean?

2606
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:09,160
Go.

2607
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:10,760
We have to go back.

2608
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,180
Oh, wait, S6.

2609
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:14,360
Hang on a second.

2610
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:19,900
Is this the fucking the food court sector

2611
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:24,860
that is that we never did in the city walk original saga?

2612
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,380
And it was my fault.

2613
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:27,240
You told us.

2614
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:27,860
I know.

2615
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:29,400
You told us not to.

2616
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:30,120
I know.

2617
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:30,880
Which way?

2618
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,060
Hang on.

2619
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:31,640
We can't do this.

2620
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:32,920
We can't gang up on him.

2621
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:34,660
I was just a boy.

2622
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:36,980
He was just a boy and he still is.

2623
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:39,800
Clearly, he's wracked with regret over this whole thing.

2624
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:43,640
I'm just frustrated because like at the time, it seemed like a fun break

2625
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:45,340
after 19 days in a row.

2626
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:48,140
And now all it's doing is adding time to this.

2627
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:49,280
So we have to.

2628
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:52,920
Well, you're not adding time if you're not adding time.

2629
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:54,180
If you know what I mean.

2630
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:56,420
That's dense.

2631
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:58,260
I don't know if I do.

2632
01:53:58,440 --> 01:53:59,740
Let me see if I can.

2633
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:02,900
And again, we'll try to do this while evading the evil forces.

2634
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:03,300
Yeah.

2635
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:04,480
We'll try to speak in code.

2636
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:06,120
But hopefully what I.

2637
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:10,120
OK, so there's been new sectors every day of the saga.

2638
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:14,540
I guess tomorrow people can go on the main feed

2639
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:18,960
and hear an episode that covers city food or whatever.

2640
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:22,400
City food, the thing that we didn't do five and a half years ago.

2641
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:22,860
Yeah.

2642
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:23,260
Yeah.

2643
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:23,880
So we'll do it.

2644
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:24,620
So that'll be all right.

2645
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:28,080
That'll be up whatever midnight tonight, whatever.

2646
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:28,620
Yeah.

2647
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:29,440
Right.

2648
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,460
No, no.

2649
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:40,520
The timeline can only be corrected in the exact spot

2650
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,980
where the original sin occurred.

2651
01:54:43,860 --> 01:54:44,440
Oh, my God.

2652
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:45,000
Mr.

2653
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,580
Scott, I can't say anymore.

2654
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:47,100
Mr.

2655
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,100
Scott, Mr.

2656
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:49,760
Scott, you don't.

2657
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,400
I know what he means.

2658
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:53,420
We have to go back.

2659
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,300
We have to go back.

2660
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:55,880
We have to go back.

2661
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:56,920
That's right, Mr.

2662
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:57,520
Jason.

2663
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:58,120
Yes.

2664
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:01,240
You hearing this have to go back.

2665
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:02,460
Have to go back.

2666
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:02,940
They.

2667
01:55:03,180 --> 01:55:03,980
Oh, they have.

2668
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,620
They have to go back.

2669
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:08,560
This series so far has only moved forward.

2670
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:14,480
But in this case, the only way to hear tomorrow's sector is to go back.

2671
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:15,100
That's right.

2672
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:19,320
It's like I've always said the end is in the beginning and the beginning is in the end.

2673
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:23,400
You're always saying that, you know, everything you need is there.

2674
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,080
I can't say anymore.

2675
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:26,040
I'm sorry.

2676
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:27,040
Wow.

2677
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:27,540
OK.

2678
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:28,760
But it's all right.

2679
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:33,920
If we've gone back and fixed what the mistake was, then in theory,

2680
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,300
they don't have to wait till tomorrow.

2681
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,300
Everything you need, you have.

2682
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:39,940
Everything you have right now.

2683
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:40,320
Wow.

2684
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:41,860
And stay paired up.

2685
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,140
You're the ghost.

2686
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:45,780
Forever.

2687
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:47,300
Dog.

2688
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,160
This has been a forever dog production.

2689
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:55,860
Executive produced by Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner, Brett

2690
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:58,720
