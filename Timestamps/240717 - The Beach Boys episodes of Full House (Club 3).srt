1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,360
Hey, Club 3 subscribers.

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,360
If every word I said could make you laugh, I'd talk forever, especially because you voted

3
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,760
for my topic, the Beach Boys episodes of Full House in this month's Club 3 poll.

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,120
Mike Jason, how you feeling?

5
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
Hi, fine.

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
I feel fine.

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,920
The Weirdos made it farther than I thought.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
That's really the victory.

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Yeah.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,840
I don't remember where we left this.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,200
Mike threw a last-minute candidate in, which is a puppet band that's been playing with

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,600
Coldplay in recent, but you just caught in an unrelated, the video was about somebody

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,240
falling off, they're trying to invade their stage and falling, but you're like, wait,

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
there's puppets.

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
Right.

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,260
And they are called the Weirdos, maybe this is something to throw into the poll.

17
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,000
This was a much better faring than Madam, than your previous puppet campaign.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,160
My theory is that the Henson connection made a lot of people interested.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,880
You say Henson, and I think a bunch of people go, their ears perk up.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,320
If Madam was Henson, I feel like maybe I could have gotten another 10%.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,000
But this is all, this is in hindsight.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,560
If Hillary went to Wisconsin, what would have happened?

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,720
These are all hypotheticals and we don't know what if Madam was a Henson, would it have

26
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
made a difference?

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
I don't know.

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,400
Would Henson make a version of Madam?

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,440
Maybe they did.

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,560
Maybe if I say now we're only going to talk about Madam, who was a Henson created Madam

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,100
that was in a specific kind of show and we put it back up on the poll, maybe Madam runs

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,100
away with it.

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,100
I don't know.

34
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,460
Are you proposing that we lie about the source and history of Madam just to prop up, to

35
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,300
lie about Madam's background?

36
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,980
But I'm saying there's been, what I should have said, there's multiple Madams, I think

37
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,000
after Wayland Flowers passed away, there were different people doing Madam.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,820
Perhaps one of these times, Henson company made a Madam for someone.

39
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,820
Perhaps, perhaps.

40
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,820
Well they have a puppet workshop.

41
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,820
We can perhaps all day.

42
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,220
They could make anything, they could probably make anything if you pay them.

43
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,380
Well, they could make Puppets of the Beach Boys, therefore keep doing more Beach Boys

44
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,380
episodes.

45
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,300
I'm saying hypothetically, this is my theory of why the Weirdos did better than most of

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,860
my choices do.

47
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,860
That's what I'm saying.

48
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,780
I think the world of puppeteering is pretty specialized and pretty small, so the likelihood

49
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:46,100
of a person who worked for Henson working on a Madam at some point is very high.

50
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,140
Well, I'm not saying we're going to do it, I'm just saying perhaps.

51
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,700
We are trying everything we can to get Madam on.

52
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,940
It's possible that one of Madam's finger flaps was brushed by somebody who elsewhere had

53
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,100
their hand up a Ralph.

54
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,180
I may know a guy who did a post-Wayland Flowers, Madam.

55
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,420
I do know, well yes, I have the same source, there's a source.

56
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,100
These are the saddest humble brags in history.

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,820
Your source also contacted me about this situation as well.

58
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,060
I may know a latter-day unknown operator of Madam.

59
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,660
A later Madam, a later operator of Madam.

60
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,340
Post-Madam, post-Wayland, P.W. post-Wayland.

61
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:38,580
I know somebody who disposed of a moth-eaten, unwanted old Charlie horse from Mallory Lewis,

62
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,620
Sherry Lewis' daughter, who has a strange Instagram now.

63
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,380
Well, that's a brag I would be interested in at least.

64
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:54,140
I will say this about me, most of my name drops in real life, not on microphone, do sound like that.

65
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:01,020
That is true, because the amount of times that I've said on the show and then seen you in reality say,

66
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,460
well, you know, I used to work for, and I already don't remember the name, I used to work for so-and-so, Crosby.

67
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,180
Catherine Crosby, I was going to go Mary's Widow.

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,500
And then I wait for the moment where people are like, OK, I know Crosby, but Catherine, I don't know.

69
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,340
Is this a daughter? Is this an ex-wife? Who are we dealing with here?

70
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,860
Second wife, yeah. Yeah.

71
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,340
So my name drops are like this.

72
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,500
This is what I'm most proud to name drop in my life.

73
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,100
Are you almost, do you know that people are not going to know these things,

74
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,060
which gives you the in to do the second sentence, which like pulls them in deeper?

75
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,380
Because, you know, if you say it all in the first sentence, then maybe the story is done.

76
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,620
That's a good question. If you want to psychoanalyze me why I do it.

77
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,980
I think it's funny that in particular, I think that's funny and I do want to talk about it.

78
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:54,020
That's probably the blanket way is like I do want to tell that story because I can't really believe that it happened.

79
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:00,500
I can't believe that I had many days spent with Bing Crosby's widow working on her like live show

80
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,140
that she performed to the Magic Castle and other places.

81
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,900
By the way, potential future Club 3. Yes.

82
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,300
Hear Mike's Catherine Crosby stories.

83
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,260
That will be better than my high school story.

84
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,780
Well, it's not amazing or anything.

85
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,940
But not as good as the Crosby nights, you know.

86
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,940
What? What?

87
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,820
What do you know?

88
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,540
You spent many days, you know, but one of the many nights.

89
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,580
I don't know.

90
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,780
30 seconds ago.

91
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,740
I appreciate it now.

92
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,580
I thought if flying Mike had an illicit affair with Hollywood royalty, I thought it would be fun.

93
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,220
One of my favorite.

94
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,500
I thought it would be funny.

95
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,540
We don't get enough credit for like we're not just idiots.

96
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,380
We're craftsmen, you know.

97
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,260
Us?

98
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
Yeah, all of us, you know.

99
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,660
We shred these boards, you know.

100
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,140
What boards are we shredding?

101
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,140
Well, we are technically on a stage right now, you know.

102
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,540
This is an elevator.

103
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,900
You keep introducing.

104
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,020
Jason keeps introducing new words into the sentence that makes it harder to tie it all together.

105
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,380
Yeah, what did the joke refer to?

106
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,660
We shred these boards.

107
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,420
We shred these boards like so many before us.

108
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,260
A joke was a little disconnected.

109
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,940
Then he got to the point where he was saying we don't get enough credit for being craftsmen.

110
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,100
Then he also said that what we're doing, we're technically on a stage, which I guess that's true too.

111
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,780
If they're listening, they get it.

112
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,260
Now, yes, you know, we're part of the tradition of Tin Pan Alley, you see.

113
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,060
We who have done 10 live shows in seven years.

114
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,140
This is like that is like something like Bono would say on stage or something, you know.

115
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,500
That's my main association.

116
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,140
I stay.

117
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,500
Yeah, well, you know, Tin Pan Alley, Andrew Lloyd Webber.

118
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,020
Anyway, here's what we've been working on.

119
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,740
Well, if you're looking for another, sorry, I made you turn down the levels due to my.

120
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,260
Yeah, well, it might happen later if I start.

121
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,540
We don't get enough credit for.

122
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,820
You know, I'm glad you turned the levels down because at some point I will be doing

123
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,100
an impression of Brian Wilson's acting, which is loud.

124
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
So I'm glad that you've adjusted.

125
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,060
And I'm but look, I'm heading in that direction.

126
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,940
But I want to just before we close out talking about the poll,

127
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,140
the runner up Olympics opening and closing ceremonies, fun area.

128
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,940
I like that.

129
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,260
But there's something bigger going on here.

130
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,260
And this wasn't everybody, but I definitely saw some comments to the effect of

131
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,060
I don't like any of these choices.

132
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,980
I was going to bring this up to you.

133
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,180
This is the worst group that we've had.

134
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,220
And Mike, I'm sorry.

135
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,340
I've been hitting you already in this episode.

136
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,780
Mixed with a lot of hitting and other ways.

137
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,660
This isn't my fault from this choice.

138
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,060
No.

139
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,500
But well, look, I saw the list of what you could have chosen.

140
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,220
There were arts related things or a number of things that you could have picked

141
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,020
because you sort of got a second choice the way we do it.

142
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,940
There was the weirdos and then you got another one and you're like,

143
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,140
I guess I'll go with the Beverly Hillbillies album from 1965.

144
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,420
I knew it wasn't going to win.

145
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,380
But not only did it not win, it is now and I've crunched numbers on this.

146
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,220
It is the lowest performing topic in the history of the club three poll.

147
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,580
It is a three point one percent down from like a three point two eight percent.

148
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,060
I guess.

149
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,020
But this these comments about hating all these choices were all the choices, not just this.

150
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,500
I agree.

151
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,140
I'm just saying I'm just giving context that in addition to this overall thought

152
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,980
that also we did have this month the lowest performing topic ever in the world.

153
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,220
Do we know what the actual voter turnout was for this time?

154
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,660
Because perhaps were that there was a depression of voting because of the poor topic.

155
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,580
So that's why my obscure choice didn't fare so well.

156
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,340
This is what happens during presidential races that have low voter turnout.

157
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,540
That is that's a good point.

158
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,580
That is something that happened except here where there was very good turnout

159
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,220
and a lot of people.

160
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,540
OK, well, OK, that's information I needed to have to know.

161
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,540
Now, actually, if we're getting really granular here, there was a lower turnout.

162
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,180
OK, and literal people, 44 people voted for the Beverly Hillbillies album.

163
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,860
OK, if we're going now, this is not this is percentage wise out of the whole did better.

164
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,540
The literal people, Ford's Garage, the Ford themed restaurant was 32 people.

165
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,100
So if we're lining them up, literally, that is the lowest in terms of turnout.

166
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,420
OK.

167
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,140
They were in the if we saw 32 people in the room.

168
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,340
OK, so 44.

169
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,300
So I guess you have that to tout that.

170
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,660
But you only lost percent.

171
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,940
I will not pander to the audience.

172
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:32,020
I will not with things that go right up to things that an actual like 80 to 90 percent

173
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,780
of the audience would be interested in hearing.

174
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,580
I want in a world where it's already niche, where already the winner is the Beach Boys

175
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,860
on full house.

176
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,660
I went I will not be niche in general.

177
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,500
I will be niche within a niche within a niche.

178
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,900
I will pick next time if somebody proposes a less known TV show, a more obscure TV show

179
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,740
that has an album, I will choose that.

180
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,660
OK, then my mother, the car album actually comes out.

181
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,540
Is there such a thing?

182
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,260
I don't think so.

183
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,100
But if there is, I would choose it.

184
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,060
Yeah, I think now the challenge is for Mike to go see if you can go further.

185
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,740
We're building our T levels on the opposite end.

186
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,260
Can you get lower than three percent of the vote with still

187
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,820
within within the listener has picked?

188
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,100
Yeah, I believe I can.

189
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,820
Yeah. OK.

190
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,660
Well, this is a new other.

191
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
If you're this is like kind of like playing.

192
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:20,900
All right.

193
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,260
I'm playing, you know, just the zeros on the roulette.

194
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,820
But, you know, you can do different kind of tax here.

195
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,500
I'm doing just odds, whatever.

196
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,660
Right.

197
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,780
You know, if listener, if you don't think you can win the club three poll,

198
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,340
see if you can give Mike fuel for the lowest, the new lowest performing topic ever.

199
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,700
I believe I can get.

200
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,300
Let me let me call my shot here.

201
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,500
I believe I can get.

202
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,580
Well, see, the problem is now people are maybe going to do this to ruin my fun.

203
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,100
I believe I could get zero.

204
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,340
I believe I could find a topic that is so unappealing to the vast majority of listeners

205
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,420
or every listener that they would not vote for it.

206
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,020
And we can't even start brainstorming because then they'll know.

207
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,820
Yeah, exactly.

208
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,460
We can't.

209
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,900
And it can't be next month.

210
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,700
I don't think we can.

211
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,180
No, they'll forget about a very fun challenge.

212
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,700
I believe I can get a zero.

213
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,260
Wow.

214
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,780
I believe I can do it.

215
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,220
And listener, if you have a suspicion that you think that might be Mike's zero attempt,

216
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,180
I mean, it's up to you.

217
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,220
You can ruin the zero attempts if you're mad at Mike.

218
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,420
But if you want to really support Mike, don't vote for his topic.

219
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,660
Right.

220
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,340
Unless you do want to hear it legitimate.

221
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,780
I think everybody needs to be honest.

222
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,460
That really is what it is.

223
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,940
Everybody now listening has to be honest.

224
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,940
Do you want to hear this or not?

225
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,580
So just don't vote for it if you don't want to hear it.

226
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,340
They still have to propose it, too, which is so great.

227
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
I guess, OK, OK, OK.

228
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,020
I have to amend this now.

229
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,900
It has to be one.

230
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,020
It has to be a vote of one because the person who proposed it likely will vote for it.

231
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,420
You're right.

232
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,420
Yeah, we can't put zero expectation on it.

233
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,620
One, zero would be impossible unless they just did it for fun, which is fine.

234
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,460
But one is what I'm going to call a shot.

235
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,900
I have no objection to this.

236
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,980
I picked the Donkey Kong Country cartoon because I thought it was nice.

237
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,060
And that didn't dance with third and fourth for a while.

238
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,940
It was going back.

239
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,700
It had the edge on Weirdos for a little while.

240
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,140
One percent, the Weirdos squeaked it out to third.

241
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,140
Well, and look, and I have to commend you because that is a thing for merely,

242
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:21,140
what, 25 years ago, 27 years ago, as opposed to look, I'm putting it all on you, Mike,

243
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:27,780
but mine, which did win, is still a topic that's about old men appearing on an old sitcom.

244
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,540
So I think that's where the overage came, maybe, is a lot of sitcom.

245
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,300
I don't think any of them were theme park related.

246
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,180
And what I'm driving to is a solution to the problem.

247
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,540
If there was the general feeling that this group was amiss and we need fresh blood,

248
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,100
I think it's time to put our fingers on the scale.

249
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,740
And I reached out to a potential guest, and I have his permission to say,

250
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,700
and it still requires parliamentary procedure.

251
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,980
Somebody has to submit this.

252
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,300
But we are open in August next month to Disney Lorcona with Nick Weiger.

253
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,540
Wow.

254
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,340
He is game.

255
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,780
You give a good Weiger wow to this.

256
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,460
So if that is something that we want, that's a way that we can shake things up.

257
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,380
Weiger Lorcona, presumably, will be in the next.

258
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:11,700
Right.

259
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,180
So some but still a listener has to propose it.

260
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,900
Yes, I think so.

261
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,060
And then there will be a formal vote as well.

262
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,700
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,740
So feel free to, if you want to hear your name read on the show,

264
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,140
get to it first.

265
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,180
Throw it in there first.

266
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,340
I would love a professional polling company to do some polls for our listeners,

267
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,580
because sometimes I feel like there's three different warring factions of listeners.

268
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,180
There probably is one faction that's just like whatever you lunatics want to do is fine.

269
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,740
Yeah.

270
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,220
But then there's people that are like befuddled by like,

271
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,540
why are we talking about full house?

272
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,180
What?

273
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,620
And then there's other people that are like, why?

274
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,260
Like, I do think maybe it's actually more than three.

275
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,300
Maybe there's like 10 different factions that are like,

276
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,820
well, I love theme parks in Jay Leno.

277
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,780
So this is my podcast.

278
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,020
But I do not understand why we're talking about some of this other stuff.

279
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,340
Yeah.

280
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,140
So maybe there's going to be some overlap on the Venn diagram.

281
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,620
I think what I think is fascinating about the polls is it's where all of the factions

282
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,340
kind of like get to fight jockey for control.

283
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,380
We get a sense of how many of what faction are out there.

284
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,700
Yeah.

285
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,900
You know, now we get it.

286
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,220
All right.

287
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,300
So like roughly, it's not the whole audience that just

288
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,900
who subscribes and who subscribes to Club 3.

289
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,540
But of that, only 3% want to hear about the Beverly O'Billy album.

290
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,660
Yes, 3%.

291
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,700
I should do a podcast solo just for the 3% for 50 people.

292
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,100
That's the show they want.

293
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
And the show I want to do, perhaps.

294
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,020
Maybe that's what I should be doing, just a show for 50 people.

295
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,420
Sure.

296
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:36,980
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,740
I mean, it would be those 50 people.

298
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,140
And again, you didn't quite get the 50 on the numbers.

299
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,740
So that would be that's in success.

300
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,300
You get to 50.

301
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
A couple people maybe forgot to vote.

302
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,180
There's always that.

303
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,740
That's true.

304
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,020
Anyway, we still need other topics, though.

305
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:56,100
Hey, you might be vying for second place because Weiger Lorcan might be the one to beat.

306
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,420
As for this month, Augustine Macias, Club 3 suggestion.

307
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,460
In honor of the Beach Boys documentary on Disney Plus next month, this is back in April,

308
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,780
the boys should discuss all the episodes of Full House with the Beach Boys.

309
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,180
And I was thrilled to see this, I think.

310
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,780
I mean, not for obvious reasons, but also I think this is a very good way to section off.

311
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,020
We've talked to some TGIF stuff.

312
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,460
I did a Beach Boys episode.

313
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:29,060
I think this is probably the smartest way to kind of corral a bunch of Beach Boys stuff.

314
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,700
It's definitely its own thing and plenty to talk about right here.

315
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:40,020
I'm also really happy that you said, due to the documentary, talk about this other thing,

316
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,980
because in referring to the Frank Marshall directed Disney Plus documentary,

317
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,340
which came out in May, which I have watched, and it stinks.

318
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,340
It's fucking awful.

319
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,340
And I feel bad doing this because I've already gone at you a bunch, Mike.

320
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,420
However, your boy fucked up.

321
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,460
Mr. Marshall fucked up.

322
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,180
I think this guy should stick to not giving speeches because this was the dullest,

323
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,660
most corporate AI produced.

324
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,140
Yeah.

325
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,060
I hated the Frank Marshall.

326
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,140
Did you guys watch it for any reason?

327
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,340
A little bit of it.

328
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,420
My dad watched it and he said you were right about it.

329
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:18,920
Yay.

330
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:20,980
Thanks, Mike's dad.

331
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,420
I did.

332
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,220
Would you say that if you went in, you maybe were an alien that just landed in your flying saucer

333
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,140
and you put Disney Plus on and you watched this,

334
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,500
would at least give you like a basic explainer or was even like not suitable for that scenario?

335
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,540
I think it is acceptable as that only.

336
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:37,860
Okay.

337
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,180
You'd want just like a general, I don't know why this would happen,

338
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,180
but if some teacher in your school who's as out of touch as me,

339
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,220
assigned you a report about the Beach Boys,

340
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,420
and you needed to process a bunch of information really quickly,

341
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,940
maybe the documentary would be a good way to soak it all up.

342
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,980
But if you want any level of, I think it's so bizarre because post Get Back,

343
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,260
I feel like there was a boom in like retro music documentaries,

344
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,180
but Get Back is all about like granular and nitty gritty and like,

345
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,220
wow, this goes so deep and we're seeing these things just at their origin.

346
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,820
And it's like flipping the story we thought we knew on its head.

347
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,020
And then this is just like, well, you know, Dennis was the only surfer.

348
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,180
You know, I said, why don't we try a song about surfing?

349
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,420
And Brian said, all right.

350
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,740
It's like there's nothing in this you haven't heard a hundred times.

351
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,340
It's almost like reheated leftovers of a documentary.

352
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,580
Yeah.

353
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,540
I saw some like a film critic complaining about like Disney Plus

354
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,340
keeps doing these like A-list documentaries, either subject matter

355
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,660
or behind the person like Ron Howard did the Henshin one.

356
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,220
And it's just like they're not nailing it.

357
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,980
I have no idea.

358
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm not the person to assess the Henshin documentary.

359
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,140
When I was complaining about this on our group chat with Griffin,

360
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,300
where Frank Marshall is the topic frequently,

361
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,100
he said, well, I'm worried about this with the I don't know where he landed.

362
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
We haven't talked to him about that, about the Ron Howard.

363
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,500
I'm like, I'm not the person because I'm not a Henshin encyclopedist.

364
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,460
I watched him was fine with it, but I could see maybe somebody who's

365
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,100
super Henshin obsessed is like, no, they completely brushed over this and that.

366
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,820
And it didn't the same thing I'm doing because I'm a super fan.

367
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,220
Sure.

368
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,420
Yeah, that makes sense.

369
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,460
It's fine for me, though.

370
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,420
I don't know of all the things.

371
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,140
But you're right, Jason, that that is a big area.

372
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,100
Or these like it's I feel like all the streamers are doing documentaries

373
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,540
where the participants or the subjects are participants.

374
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,140
And that's a great way to make it a warts and no warts.

375
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,740
No warts whatsoever, a no warts documentary.

376
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,820
If there's new footage of the subject in the documentary talking,

377
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,500
generally speaking, you're not getting a full story.

378
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Yeah, usually, usually.

379
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,780
Unless that's part of like they really like the idea or the pitch of like,

380
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,860
I'm really going to tell this crazy story or this crazy period of my life.

381
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,780
The thing that drove me crazy about this documentary, it all builds up to well,

382
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,900
for the first time in years, because the boys don't get together a lot.

383
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,780
And it's like not everybody's in great shape.

384
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,940
And so what if we reunite them at the spot where they took the first album cover

385
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,940
in Paradise Cove and Malibu?

386
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,460
And what if we got them together, put guitars in their hands and just

387
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,660
see what happens, see what they talk about, see what they do.

388
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,980
After all these years in this shared history, I wonder what they'll say and do.

389
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,580
And keep wondering because they don't show you any of it.

390
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,540
Like the cameras like jibs away.

391
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,100
Really?

392
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,460
Yes, that is how it ends.

393
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,340
And not only that, I found a press junket interview where Al Jardine,

394
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,900
one of the Beach Boys, is sitting with Frank Marshall and that comes up.

395
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,140
And he turns to Frank and says, yeah, why didn't you show any of the stuff we shot?

396
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,100
That was some great stuff.

397
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,140
We did a lot of good.

398
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,940
He yells at Frank promoting the movie about why would you end it that way?

399
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Oh, because you had to walk down a lot of stairs to get to Paradise Cove.

400
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,140
And all these old men were just wheezing for an hour.

401
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,260
That's very possible.

402
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,860
It's very possible.

403
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,980
These are old.

404
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,620
Hold some items now that you've climbed.

405
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,700
Could be it.

406
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,500
Well, I don't know.

407
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,980
It doesn't seem like the world is particularly opposed to showing

408
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,740
ghastly footage of 80-year-olds on a giant stage.

409
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,500
Maybe now that's been normalized.

410
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,620
That's entertainment.

411
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,900
Now release the footage.

412
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,460
Actually now, Mike Love is running for president.

413
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,740
In 40 years, like Get Back, maybe that footage will come out and we'll get to see what that

414
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,860
beach day was like.

415
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,900
Maybe I can do it.

416
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,140
And you can do it.

417
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:34,660
And then make the narrative like enterprising by then 68-year-old filmmaker usurps

418
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,860
a deceased hack Frank Marshall.

419
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,940
I'm going to get it back.

420
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,980
It's my Get Back.

421
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,020
This young whippersnapper who probably spends all his money on freaking avocado toast.

422
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,940
That's what they're still saying.

423
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,140
They're still thinking about it.

424
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,260
In the year 2052.

425
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,780
Stop buying coffee.

426
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,140
Yeah, in 2052.

427
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,500
Stop buying coffee out.

428
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,020
Stop eating avocado toast.

429
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,980
That does seem accurate.

430
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,540
I also think we're probably heading for a world where the boomers are still alive somehow.

431
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,780
Where Gen X are starting to die off.

432
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,020
But only boomers are alive.

433
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,580
They're 132 years old and they are mad at us about everything still.

434
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,820
And they have the biggest phones with the largest font possible.

435
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,700
And they are tapping so slowly.

436
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,780
Did you know Frank is almost 80 years old?

437
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,180
Wow.

438
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,380
Frank's 78 years old.

439
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,620
I looked this up because Andrew Grissom and I went to see a magic show that he directed

440
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,060
a week ago.

441
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,540
We can't talk about another thing.

442
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,060
Another possible thing.

443
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,740
There were good magic tricks in the show, though.

444
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,460
He was not there.

445
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,060
He's producing the new Jurassic Park.

446
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,660
He's on location in Thailand.

447
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,540
Right, right.

448
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,340
So he was not there.

449
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,020
Because I was really hoping he'd be there.

450
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,180
Yeah, popping up, giving notes, whispering stuff.

451
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,060
Whispering stuff.

452
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,460
And then I could say some of the most confusing sentences he's ever heard in his life to him

453
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,100
after the show.

454
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,100
I have a podcast.

455
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,540
I don't know how I'd ever be able to explain to him that he comes up so often.

456
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,300
Honey, a man's attacking me.

457
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,940
Yeah, exactly.

458
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,580
Yes.

459
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,460
So I would have cried.

460
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,180
This is actually a running argument because we went to the Jurassic World premiere and

461
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,420
we talked about how you gave a speech but it turned out you didn't give a speech.

462
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,180
But I still argued that you did give a speech.

463
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,860
There's no way to have done it.

464
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,100
But I was fantasizing about it.

465
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,900
But then I saw that day he was in Thailand for Jurassic Park 5 or 7, whatever it is.

466
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,500
For him.

467
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,060
So yeah.

468
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,340
God, they're starting that, really?

469
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:16,900
That's up and running.

470
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,500
Scarlett Johansson's in.

471
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:18,980
Wow.

472
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,500
It's like David Kep is back.

473
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,140
He's writing.

474
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,020
He wrote the script.

475
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,900
It's going to be great.

476
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,540
Mm-hmm.

477
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,500
Everything's going to be good.

478
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
We're not here to talk about those dinosaurs.

479
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,940
We're here to talk about the Beach Boys.

480
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,380
And they're episodes of Full House.

481
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,980
And again, thrilled about this topic.

482
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:44,020
And I think in terms of where this sits in their story, in general, I just look.

483
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,740
I love Full House and I love the Beach Boys separately.

484
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,820
And these things are tied together.

485
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:55,540
The collision of these two is just this ultimate mix-up of pop culture kitch.

486
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:04,820
I feel like these episodes, which happened all from like 88 to 92, I think they genuinely

487
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:12,340
did expose the Beach Boys to a new generation that has kept the Beach Boys in their mind.

488
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:19,220
But perhaps as a kind of out of it oldies band who can't act and wear terrible clothes

489
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,940
and say hokey punch lines on a show.

490
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:28,340
And I've found this to be, with people I know and with my own wife, the biggest hurdle

491
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,860
to saying the Beach Boys made a lot of really remarkable music.

492
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,260
And maybe you've heard of Fett Sounds, but it's this late 60s, early 70s stuff I think

493
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,220
is so special.

494
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,380
And they just didn't get attention at the time.

495
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,660
And it matters so much to me.

496
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,180
And there are people who are like, the Beach Boys did?

497
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,060
From Full House?

498
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,420
The guys in the hats?

499
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:56,340
So I think while this was important that they do this, it also solidified a certain kind

500
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,580
of Beach Boys to people forever.

501
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,800
Right.

502
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,980
Yes, because watching it back, it was like, how old could they be in these clips?

503
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,580
They're not that old.

504
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,140
But as a kid, you were like, these old guys come into the house.

505
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,500
And they were hanging out with Uncle Jesse, who's a cool young guy.

506
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,220
I think Dave Coulier is way cooler than these old men.

507
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
Yeah, by my scale, man.

508
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,300
I'm like, Dave Coulier is funny.

509
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,300
These guys aren't funny.

510
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,420
I know these songs.

511
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,300
I like the songs.

512
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,260
But they very much felt like they were all 70 years old then.

513
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:38,740
Yeah, I think also in an era where eras and decades, I think everything moved more rapidly.

514
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,500
So they seemed like relics.

515
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,860
They seemed like, here's some time travelers from another era.

516
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,380
And they were never particularly charismatic in that way.

517
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,780
So that doesn't help either.

518
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,580
Because you would see other old rock stars, at least had personality.

519
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,100
None of them have personality on Full House, really.

520
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,820
No.

521
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,540
Think about a McCartney who does cameos on things.

522
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,540
And he just doesn't even try to act.

523
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,580
I remember him coming out on a live 30 Rock.

524
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,020
And he just doesn't really do anything.

525
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,580
He just finger points and soaks up, it's me and I'm here.

526
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,980
And that's how he is in an SNL sketch or whatever.

527
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,460
Yes.

528
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,660
This is much more sedate because you're still making Mike.

529
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,620
Well, as long as I get some of Becky's famous homey cooking.

530
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,300
It's really...

531
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,180
It's lascivious.

532
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,900
I don't want to jump too far ahead.

533
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,020
But I got to say, a lot of Mike's lines sound like threats.

534
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,060
That's what he's like all the time.

535
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:43,140
When he says, I wasn't paying close attention at first,

536
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,420
but I was watching with Jane.

537
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,580
And I had to rewind because she went, which one is that?

538
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,380
When he goes, let's order a vegetarian pizza.

539
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,780
It sounds like he pulled out a gun.

540
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,260
And I'm like, oh.

541
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,380
He has the family hostage.

542
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,420
His demand is just a pizza, but still a demand.

543
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,100
Don't know how many weapons.

544
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,420
They're guns hiding under his hat.

545
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,380
I think Michelle says, play Kokomo.

546
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,060
And he went, oh, great, a request.

547
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,700
Mike Hale's just like, oh, no.

548
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,580
Yeah.

549
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,340
It's just that he just squints those eyes in a real...

550
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,300
He does squint.

551
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,380
I don't know if it's how it's...

552
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,500
It's not how it's meant to read.

553
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,660
I don't know if it reads this way to everybody, but I'm just like...

554
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,180
You're Clint Eastwood and you're angry at somebody.

555
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,660
Yeah.

556
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,180
That is a great comparison.

557
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,100
He's just 24-7 unpleasant.

558
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,180
That's the only way he is.

559
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,900
He can exist.

560
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,340
You feel the chip on the shoulder in every action he does.

561
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,860
Even when good vibrations surf in sand.

562
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,540
Like, why are you saying it like that?

563
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,300
I'm totally with you.

564
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,780
Yeah, yeah.

565
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,820
It's really strange.

566
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,020
And I'm not trying to get off on an Aerosmith tangent,

567
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,700
but Aerosmith on rock and roller coaster, I knew they weren't young.

568
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,140
But I was like, this guy's kind of fun.

569
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,820
This main guy's kind of fun.

570
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,380
They're goofing.

571
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,980
There were bands that were old that you would see in the various media

572
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,940
that I think in your kid brain, you'd be like, oh, this is fun.

573
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,940
This guy seems cool or whatever.

574
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,500
The Beach Boys did not at the time to me seem cool.

575
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,860
They don't seem cool watching it at this age.

576
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,860
I can see what you're saying about that defining them for a bunch of people.

577
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,900
I saw this stuff at the time that it aired.

578
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,220
Probably not the first one, but I definitely caught up

579
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,980
and probably watched it live, the last one from 92.

580
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,660
And just the way I was raised, I did think they were cool.

581
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,980
I thought the way they dressed was cool.

582
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,980
And then I would kind of dress like that.

583
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,460
I just found a neon orange hat with a little rope,

584
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,020
like the kind Mike wears, which I remember wearing.

585
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,340
And that and a Hawaiian shirt ties into this episode.

586
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,020
I saw Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego after a Padres game.

587
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,100
This is the thing they would do for a long time, was like,

588
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,100
come see a baseball game and stick around for the Beach Boys.

589
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,420
And I was dancing in the rows.

590
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,740
I was the dorkiest little boy.

591
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,900
Just loving it.

592
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,540
I did.

593
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,660
I think Mike loves cool.

594
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,540
I want to dress like him.

595
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,020
Wow.

596
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,540
Stamos was at that, I remember.

597
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,260
I remember he ran all the way out and did a guitar solo up on top of the dugout.

598
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,260
Cherished memories.

599
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,860
This is who I am.

600
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,900
This is where I came from.

601
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,620
That's so funny.

602
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,900
Even The Beatles, who I liked, when The Beatles Anthology aired on ABC,

603
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,340
and you watch those clips now,

604
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,500
I think they seem like such dorky older guys in those anthology clips.

605
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,300
Their style.

606
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,420
None of them were styling.

607
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,860
None of them had any sort of style.

608
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,620
Cardi actually got more timeless the way he dresses.

609
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,380
Cardi looks great now at 80.

610
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,300
And Ringo kind of, too, versus back then when you're just like,

611
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,260
these are just some dorky 50-year-olds who don't know how to dress.

612
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,380
Yeah, he's got a mullet and a denim shirt.

613
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,940
They are wearing just the goofiest looking clothes,

614
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,620
and they're not that old, obviously.

615
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,740
But at the time, even watching that, you go, oh, they're uncool.

616
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,940
I'm not thinking that actively, but I had that feeling about them

617
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,180
where, oh, they're just sort of old, uncool.

618
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,260
Beatles are cooler now, maybe, than they were.

619
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,220
100%, I think.

620
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,620
They were not doing themselves any favors in the 90s.

621
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,300
What were you saying, Jason?

622
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:13,780
I interrupted you.

623
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:19,300
Oh, I was going to say the concert after a baseball game is still a thing,

624
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,540
and I just remember last year watching the Phillies,

625
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,380
and they're like, hey, stick around.

626
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,820
If you come out in two weeks,

627
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,820
there's a free concert after the game, a free concert by DJ Diesel.

628
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,980
DJ Diesel?

629
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,540
Yes, that's Shaquille O'Neal's DJ days.

630
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,340
Wow, it worked on me.

631
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,660
His Sergeant Pepper-esque thin disguise.

632
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,580
I'd love to know more about DJ Diesel and what those sets are like.

633
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,660
I feel strongly that there's a lot of Shaq in our future.

634
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,620
I hope so.

635
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,860
Yes, I would love for there to be plenty.

636
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,380
He's left Dark Harbor in a...

637
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,740
Yeah, yeah, unfortunately.

638
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,420
So we're going to have to get our Shaq fixed elsewhere.

639
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,060
Thankfully, there are dozens and dozens of other places.

640
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,140
Let's get to these episodes.

641
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,940
A Beach Boy, at least, appears in three different episodes of Full House,

642
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,340
though their music is present in many more,

643
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,900
a constant thread through John Stamos and his character Jesse

644
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,860
and his band, The Rippers, who seem to primarily do covers of Beach Boys

645
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,180
and of songs like Hippie Hippie Shake.

646
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,700
In these episodes, they're referred to as a cool new Bay Area band,

647
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,660
and you almost never hear them do anything that isn't like,

648
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,620
I don't know, Monster Mash.

649
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,620
I don't know if they did the Monster Mash, but it seems like...

650
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,820
That seems like something they would do.

651
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,740
I think in Fuller House at some point, they perform What I Like About You,

652
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:55,620
and I think that's a cool song in the spectrum of Jesse and the Rippers.

653
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,460
I'm surprised they wouldn't have them covering Rick Springfield or something.

654
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,980
That feels like the vibe,

655
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,700
and it would have been more era-appropriate for somebody Stamos' age.

656
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,660
But I think he...

657
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,140
Well, look, like us, we have things in common with this man.

658
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,060
My own Beach Boys fandom, big Disney fan, as we know.

659
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,940
Yeah, that's true.

660
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:24,340
And I think like him, and we all together want to live in our childhoods

661
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,620
in a bigger way than most.

662
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,140
And I think he's like, I'm a star on a show that is working.

663
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,100
I want to sing the songs I loved growing up.

664
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,700
I want to dress up like Elvis.

665
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,660
Did it ever occur to you that I might be a little dorky?

666
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,300
No.

667
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,580
It's cool to me.

668
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,260
I was just thinking about watching him in the 90s.

669
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,220
I think it is cool.

670
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,140
There's a real sincerity to all of his Beach Boys and his old music,

671
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,620
which I think is cringy.

672
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,900
I get embarrassment goosebumps a lot while watching moments from these episodes,

673
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,900
from a lot of any Jesse and the Rippers.

674
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,780
My hair stands up on its arm.

675
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,300
It's definitely very cringy, but so much fun.

676
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,500
And I think that's what makes it...

677
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,500
Again, we're pretty thin and our theme park tie together,

678
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,620
but it's silly and embarrassing in the way a theme park show is sometimes.

679
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,420
You know what I mean?

680
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,740
Yes, there's a lack of true coolness.

681
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,020
He's kind of handsome and cool in ways.

682
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,500
Sort of.

683
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,540
Sort of.

684
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,700
To a child.

685
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,020
He was passionately cool to a child.

686
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,740
To a child.

687
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,740
But if you knew Nirvana then or whatever, then no.

688
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:38,100
I think that's a through line in a lot of the non-theme parkie topics

689
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,220
is that this shares a DNA with a theme park stunt show.

690
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,140
I hope it doesn't sound like we're just falsifying,

691
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,740
but to me, it's the same part of my brain that's lit up for sure.

692
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,620
It's like cheesiness, but they mean it and I don't know.

693
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,500
They're working really hard and everything.

694
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,900
So episode one, Beach Boy Bingo is their first appearance.

695
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,460
This is season two, episode six, November 18th, 1988.

696
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,420
88 is a really big year for the Beach Boys.

697
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,620
I think I talked about it in my Big Beach Boys episode last year.

698
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,100
This is when the infamous Rock and Roll Hall of Fame speech occurred.

699
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,380
Brian did his first solo record that year.

700
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,660
A few weeks before this airs, Kokomo goes to number one.

701
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:32,020
So we're getting the Beach Boys on Full House at the ultimate moment of Mike Love's control.

702
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,180
He's never been further from having to go back to the sheet metal factory.

703
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,820
Brian's literally doing other things.

704
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,460
Kokomo, he was not even invited to the session and he's like,

705
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:49,460
we got the number one record and my buddy, a guy I've been associating with for years,

706
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,780
is now not just on a TV show.

707
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,220
He's on the biggest TV, a massive TV show.

708
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,540
Everything is lined up, Mike Love, in 1988.

709
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,980
And now that's what he's in.

710
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,300
He used to be like, let's get back to the 60s.

711
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,700
And now he's like, let's get back to 1988.

712
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,580
In terms of my life and politically as well.

713
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,980
So I want to focus on the boys.

714
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,620
I don't want to say too much about the entire stories of these things.

715
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,380
So just like Cliff Note's version, the Beach Boys are in town.

716
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,580
They're going to do a concert.

717
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,260
Their helicopter doesn't arrive in time to be on Wake Up San Francisco.

718
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,660
But the Beach Boys are in San Francisco, right?

719
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,820
There's a radio contest or something.

720
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,580
DJ is the seventh caller, oldest daughter DJ, Candice Cameron.

721
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,780
And she wins the contest.

722
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,300
And the prize is not just going to a Beach Boys concert

723
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,580
and two tickets to a Beach Boys concert, but a limousine ride.

724
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:49,220
The Beach Boys themselves are going to go pick up the winner

725
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,420
and another person and go take them to their concert.

726
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,420
Now, the winner and their guests will have to ride up front with the driver.

727
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,540
The Beach Boys don't even want to look at them.

728
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,300
Well, they're trying to focus before the stage.

729
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,020
Yeah, but yeah.

730
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,060
And also, yeah, they don't want that regular people stink on them.

731
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,780
It's like a similar rock and roller coaster plot.

732
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,660
Oh, yeah, it kind of is.

733
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,940
Yeah, the show is starting.

734
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,180
Hey, you know how we feel about our fans?

735
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,900
I wish we could pick up every one of them and stretch limo.

736
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,580
Really not how this happens.

737
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,940
You also, there's the realism question maybe of like,

738
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,020
they're taking a limo to the concert.

739
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,540
Wouldn't they want to get there a lot earlier?

740
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,700
And then I actually just found, I found, you know,

741
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,460
as I do a bunch of just raw footage of the Beach Boys on a tour,

742
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,300
unedited from 1993.

743
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,620
Yeah.

744
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,980
And they do literally just drive up and walk onto the stage.

745
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,180
There's no sound check.

746
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,500
They just.

747
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:36,980
Oh, really?

748
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,260
This is how little they were.

749
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,740
Well, you say, oh, really, but if you watch and soon,

750
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,860
I will play you what they sounded like live at the time.

751
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,300
I think you wouldn't say, oh, really, once you hear the results of that.

752
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:47,780
OK.

753
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,460
Do you know they sound check these days?

754
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,460
I couldn't tell you that.

755
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,980
Somebody sound checks, probably.

756
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,380
They, you know, yeah, you know what?

757
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,060
I think actually the touring Beach Boys have musicians who care a little bit more.

758
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,660
I think at the time they were doing these episodes,

759
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,940
I think they hated each other.

760
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,700
I think they didn't speak to each other until they were getting onto the stage.

761
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,660
I think it's the little Beach Boy downtime as there could be.

762
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,020
That's funny.

763
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,340
Keep that tension in your mind as you watch these scenes where they all pretend to be buddies.

764
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,580
It's like I follow like I think I think the account's name is Spring Nuts,

765
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,820
Bruce Springsteen fans, and they will report what they've played at sound check.

766
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,260
Yeah, so people will hang out outside the arena and they will list

767
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,980
the songs they've heard the band sound check like, oh,

768
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,740
maybe there'll be these new songs they'll play tonight.

769
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,260
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

770
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,620
But obviously Bruce is there.

771
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,540
He's old, but he's had some health issues in the last few years.

772
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,740
But obviously he's still showing up at whatever two in the afternoon sound checking.

773
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,060
But he is a musician who cares about the music being good.

774
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,620
That's fair.

775
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,940
The way it breaks down is Mike just wants to like do his little schtick

776
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,580
and like point to the girls and here's the cheerleaders.

777
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,100
Carl Wilson, my favorite Beach Boy, heart of the band,

778
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,820
was the only one who cared about how they sound.

779
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,980
But by the 90s he kind of thrown in the towel because we're playing in state fair venues.

780
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,540
Right.

781
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,340
And that's not a knock.

782
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,460
That's not saying like they're only doing they're playing state fair venues with

783
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,060
in front of 20,000 people where you can't even hear how they sit.

784
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,780
Nobody's going to notice the clock and the glockenspiel part.

785
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,260
Right.

786
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,340
So like he just was like, I'm not going to be I'm not going to be a micromanager here.

787
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,140
I'm going to show up.

788
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,940
I'm just going to.

789
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,260
Yeah.

790
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,740
They'll be more mad at me if I try to make this good.

791
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:26,980
Right.

792
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,020
So that's where we're at.

793
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,660
That's the Beach Boys.

794
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,300
Got it.

795
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,940
Anyway, DJ only gets one ticket.

796
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,580
So she's got to pick which of the tanners she's going to take.

797
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,060
She ends up choosing Jesse because he's a musician.

798
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,860
Wouldn't he want to?

799
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,020
And she betrays her own dad.

800
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,220
And then there's a heart to heart between Danny and Jesse

801
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:52,980
who Danny at some point says, I guess I just can't compete with Uncle Rock and Roll.

802
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,500
I like that line a lot.

803
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,620
That is I as a kid thought all these people were a million years old.

804
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:07,060
At some point in one of these episodes or maybe a later one, it said that Uncle Jesse is 29.

805
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,460
He's supposed to be 29.

806
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:14,420
I think he has the twins and he's married and he's 29 in the show.

807
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,820
That is why especially I was like thinking about the music choices.

808
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,460
Yeah.

809
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,020
He literally is picking the stuff he heard when he was little.

810
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,580
Yes, yeah.

811
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,740
I think I mentioned once I looked in his book and he discovered the Beach Boys in the 70s

812
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,780
at Disneyland from the cover band that is in the rising Tomorrowland stage.

813
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,460
It's not like he grew up with them.

814
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,740
He's like us.

815
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,860
He's kind of nostalgic for an era that wasn't even a unit.

816
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,220
And he wasn't alive for Elvis or barely.

817
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,340
I forget how that lines up.

818
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:46,740
Sure.

819
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:57,140
As a child, they did Kokomo on some of the Disney parades or an opening special or something.

820
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:04,020
So the presence of them on Full House, the music video on TV, the presence on Disney specials,

821
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,380
I was like, oh, these guys are big rock and rollers.

822
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,860
With all that put together, it was almost like the play is let's be for kids.

823
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,340
We're a band for kids now.

824
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,380
I think that's what they were kind of aiming for and sort of successfully.

825
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,860
Because that's where the money is if we could get the new generation.

826
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,820
It's all about generations and good vibrations.

827
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,740
Speaking of Hanson, Muppets and Kokomo go together.

828
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,580
And I do think that's also responsible for a bunch of people liking

829
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,220
Kokomo and then Beach Boys when they were kids.

830
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

831
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,020
It just all, yeah, I don't know.

832
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,740
It was like kid safe music in an era where there wasn't maybe a lot of that.

833
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:51,860
You know, Motley Crue, all this, you know, and Twisted Sister and Tipper Gore and the

834
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,980
putting the labels that Mike Love incidentally was on the other side of that.

835
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,740
Mike Love was a person who fought for the labels to be on records.

836
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,620
Mike Love fought for the Confederacy.

837
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,380
He would have.

838
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,020
He would have.

839
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,820
I mean, you just got to get back to those good old days.

840
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,780
What days are you talking about?

841
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,260
I don't know.

842
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,660
1840 or something.

843
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,460
That's the day.

844
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,020
You know, it's pure evil.

845
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,580
Mike Love.

846
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,740
Southern gentry.

847
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,140
Plantation Dixieland.

848
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,980
He's at Mar-a-Lago all the time.

849
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

850
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,260
There's some there's some scary photos, just like red eye flash bad.

851
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:30,740
He is.

852
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,620
Yeah, he is.

853
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,740
So you think he's scarier now than he is?

854
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,660
I feel like the opposite sometimes happens.

855
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,500
Joe Biden to me actually seems friendlier now than he did in these like old hearings.

856
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,180
Mike Love actually seems like he's getting even scarier in some ways.

857
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,980
It's hard to say.

858
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,620
It's hard to say.

859
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,900
Scariest era of Mike.

860
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,500
What's the scariest era?

861
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,940
Well, some of these lines will help him compete here in this era.

862
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,260
Anyway, there's so much fighting that DJ is like,

863
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,020
I don't even want to go to the concert anymore.

864
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,980
And they're like, no, that's great.

865
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,100
Somebody's got to go.

866
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,060
Don't say that, DJ.

867
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,140
And then all of a sudden, before they're in a big fight,

868
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,580
before you know it, the Beach Boys are at their door.

869
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,100
They made good on their prom.

870
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,900
This is what the contest was.

871
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,100
And they're in no rush.

872
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,380
They're like, we're going to hang out here for a little bit.

873
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,020
And I mean, the full band is at the door.

874
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:25,300
Mike Love, Carl Wilson, Al Jardine, the strange sprite one,

875
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,420
Bruce Johnston, who's a little hard to quantify.

876
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,860
I'll explain Bruce better later.

877
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,740
And then mainly, Brian Wilson.

878
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,420
Brian Wilson acting.

879
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:34,900
Yeah.

880
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,060
Brian Wilson acting performance.

881
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,420
When they all say hello at the door, I think he's blocked.

882
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,540
Yeah, you can't see him.

883
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,180
Yeah, yeah.

884
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,100
Yeah, yeah, I noted that as well.

885
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,620
You're like, is he in the back?

886
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,660
Yeah, yeah, which makes you go, was Brian ever on the show?

887
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,180
OK, and then they all enter.

888
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,300
And you're like, I guess he was.

889
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,900
That said, Brian did a Reddit AMA a number of years ago,

890
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,460
which almost every answer of which is very quotable.

891
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,780
And he, at some point, got the question,

892
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,180
how was it filming with the cast of Full House?

893
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,580
His response, I've never been on Full House.

894
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,100
Oh, man.

895
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,900
Poor Brian.

896
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,420
Yeah, yeah.

897
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,700
Because he was, if you know the movie Love and Mercy,

898
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,460
if you know his real story, you know he was under the control

899
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,140
and microscope of this corrupt doctor who inserted himself

900
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,140
in his life and his every move was.

901
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,100
And what I find so interesting about movies like that is that,

902
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,260
like, yes, that's all true.

903
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,860
And that's what you should focus on.

904
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,980
But I'm like, but also, he was on Full House.

905
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,100
He was not.

906
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,620
He was, like, in a trap.

907
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,780
But also, then he'd go do this.

908
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,820
It's really weird.

909
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,300
Really weird.

910
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,460
And I don't know how you put that in the movie.

911
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,220
It doesn't really go along with the narrative.

912
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,860
But I always think that about things.

913
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,380
Like, there was this David Bowie, IMAX documentary,

914
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,900
tone poem kind of thing.

915
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,780
I don't know if you saw it.

916
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,660
The Moon Age Daydream?

917
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,540
Moon Age Daydream.

918
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,140
Yeah, I actually watched only a part of it.

919
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,740
Well, it's a good presentation of the music,

920
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,660
but it's very pretentious.

921
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:07,140
It's definitely very weighty and kind of about the legend

922
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,860
and the alien that he even walked among us

923
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,220
is impossible to comprehend.

924
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,460
And you're like, he was the man who fell to Earth.

925
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,620
Yes, he was literally the man who fell to Earth.

926
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,500
And then you're like, yeah, but also, wasn't he on Extras once?

927
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,020
Like, he was pretty, he was funny on talk shows around.

928
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,580
These things kind of build these people up,

929
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,380
and then you forget.

930
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,140
Kind of like, and also, they were around.

931
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,020
They're like, cool guys.

932
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,940
He did a Conan confession.

933
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,220
Yeah, he did, right?

934
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,820
Yeah, very funny.

935
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,860
Those are always very funny.

936
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,140
Anyways, something you realize at the door

937
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,940
is that they all dress like psychopaths.

938
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,100
Yeah, I wanted to bring this up.

939
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,780
This immediately struck me to the point where I was like,

940
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,220
are they all wearing their own clothes?

941
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,220
And I looked again, and I'm like,

942
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:55,140
no, this has to be Costumer because they're all perfectly different.

943
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,580
Or that's just all what they like to wear

944
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,020
and showed up in their own clothes.

945
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,700
Well, I think possibly that.

946
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,780
Yeah, maybe they took, all right,

947
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,780
let's take inspiration for what you guys wear.

948
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,700
Here's the thing, though.

949
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,100
It's an interesting question of whether they chose them or not.

950
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,700
But I know a lot of concerts.

951
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:18,020
It's definitely how Mike Love would wear a lot of full American flag jumpers and stuff.

952
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,940
Weird thing is, Al and Mike are wearing the same hat.

953
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,580
They both are wearing a hat.

954
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,580
It's a black hat with purple stripes, and it says,

955
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:31,460
the Beach Boys high surf, which is not a song of theirs.

956
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,380
So now they did. I don't know what it means.

957
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,500
So that's a weird thing.

958
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,220
It took me a minute to go like, wait, they're wearing the same hat.

959
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:42,580
And then Al is wearing, he's wearing pants that are full of letters.

960
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,780
R, A, F, all decanted.

961
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:53,540
And then like this huge blue, like a Michael Jackson jacket,

962
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,060
except that's like three sizes too big for him.

963
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,820
And I was watching with Erin, and she's like,

964
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,220
this is like if you let a toddler dress himself.

965
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,460
This is an insane way.

966
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:09,220
You'd think it was cute if an 18-month-old was in clothes way too big for them.

967
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:17,620
So that's, that's, Al Jardine may be the least cool person to be in any big popular band.

968
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,780
All the Rolling Stones are a little cool.

969
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,100
Yeah.

970
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,180
Even Ringo's a little cool.

971
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:22,500
Yeah.

972
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,700
It's on some level.

973
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,500
Al Jardine, who's a ponytail a lot of the time with a bald spot.

974
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,740
You can't do a bald spot on a ponytail.

975
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,940
I feel like Max Weinberg is a big dork,

976
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:40,180
but the Conan Association gives him some cool, I think it's both.

977
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,060
I think it's like part why you kind of think of him as uptight kind of guy.

978
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,340
But also I think that being on Conan makes him a little cooler.

979
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,180
I think just due to how they cast him in dozens and dozens of sketches,

980
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,060
I think of him as a sex freak.

981
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,220
Yeah.

982
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,300
I think they took something, not that he's a sex freak,

983
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,620
they took things, they took an uptight guy and they decided to make him a joke often.

984
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,020
Yeah.

985
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:04,500
Yeah.

986
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,460
Did you know Max Weinberg's son is the drummer for Slipknot?

987
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:07,780
Jay, yeah.

988
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,380
But I believe he was fired or left Slipknot the other day.

989
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,380
He was just playing with Slipknot.

990
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,900
He was just playing with East Street Band.

991
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,020
Hot off the presses.

992
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,420
He filled in for Max when The Tonight Show started, I believe.

993
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:20,820
Oh, really?

994
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,940
For a few weeks, I think.

995
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,540
Yeah, Jay.

996
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,260
Jay Weinberg, now a character on the show.

997
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:31,300
So this is the speed we're going to go at because they haven't even entered the door

998
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,340
and this is where we're at.

999
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,900
But then they enter, they're all introduced, Jesse shakes all their hands,

1000
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,180
and he says to Mike Love, hey, Dr. Love.

1001
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,060
That was confusing to me.

1002
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,700
This happens every single time Mike Love shows up.

1003
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,740
I, as you know, am an Encyclopedic Beach Boys fan.

1004
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,140
There is no other media in which Mike Love is referred to as Dr. Love.

1005
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:59,060
This is a John Stamos exclusive that is consistent in every episode, every time it happens.

1006
00:46:59,060 --> 00:46:59,700
I'm like, why?

1007
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,620
No one has agreed to this.

1008
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,100
Feel good kind of thing, like a nickname.

1009
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,380
I don't know, it's something about just how esteemed he is, you know?

1010
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,100
How long he's been around and how wise.

1011
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,740
Calling somebody like Dr. Cosby, you know?

1012
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,980
Only the best of the wisest.

1013
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,140
Yeah, that's like a cute little nickname, I feel.

1014
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,740
Dr. So-and-so, I guess.

1015
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,900
Unless there's some other thing we don't know.

1016
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,260
Dr. Love.

1017
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:22,980
Dr. Love.

1018
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,500
I guess that's just like a cool, like, oh, that's a cool thing I do with my friend here.

1019
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,660
It's a nickname I have with my friend.

1020
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,060
He has to be a little cagey here, right?

1021
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:35,860
He has to act as if Jesse is meeting Mike for the first time,

1022
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,500
rather than that they are good buddies.

1023
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,540
Imagine him having to stifle what good buddies he is

1024
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,900
with this guy who he thinks everyone will be very impressed that he's good buddies.

1025
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:51,060
Uh, then the acting begins, and here I go to my first clip.

1026
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:55,940
Here is the Beach Boys doing the action.

1027
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,260
What was your phrase about the boards being, like, here they are.

1028
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,460
Ah, treading the boards.

1029
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,820
Here's the Beach Boys treading the boards, not the surf boards this time.

1030
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,340
Brian, you're Carl, you're Mike.

1031
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:04,980
Hi.

1032
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,460
Bruce, how are you?

1033
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,100
How are you, Carl?

1034
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,220
How are you, Carl?

1035
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,260
Love you so much.

1036
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:08,820
Love you, Bruce.

1037
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:09,300
How are you, Mike?

1038
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,340
Is there a DJ Tanner here?

1039
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,460
Yeah, that's me.

1040
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:13,700
Hi.

1041
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,020
We hear you're not coming to the concert.

1042
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,060
Bon Jovian Town?

1043
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,180
No, it's a long story.

1044
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,380
Well, we've got time.

1045
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,740
They never start the show without us.

1046
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,340
Let's order a vegetarian pizza.

1047
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,100
That was Mike.

1048
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,580
Let's order a vegetarian pizza.

1049
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,780
Why, yes, why the malice.

1050
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,700
Bon Jovian Town.

1051
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,380
Boy, I love.

1052
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,140
Also, if you're a fan of this stuff,

1053
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:46,500
if you're trying to now collect all of the Beach Boys acting,

1054
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,300
don't sleep on Al Jardine on Decker.

1055
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,580
That Heidegger got him to be a villain in an episode,

1056
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:56,100
and he has, I think, not learned anything about acting.

1057
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,780
No, but also it's not his deal.

1058
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,740
Why should he?

1059
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,420
I'm so delighted by all of it.

1060
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,780
I love these strange men.

1061
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,460
How could they be so uncharismatic for being performers their whole life?

1062
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,460
There's a good bit in there, I think,

1063
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,580
where they all introduce themselves to the tanners,

1064
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,420
and then the camera cuts,

1065
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,660
and they all introduce themselves to each other.

1066
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,420
That's a funny bit.

1067
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,580
That's a solid sitcom gag.

1068
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,580
Monkey-style way to put it.

1069
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,860
In my head, I was like, what is it?

1070
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,060
It's kind of like Hard Day's Night.

1071
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,500
It's like the way that, yeah, the musicians are all kind of our-

1072
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,540
Kooky eyes.

1073
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,820
Yeah, a little kooky plays on, yeah, we flip it on you.

1074
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,660
We see things in a different way.

1075
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,500
Yeah, if you've ever watched the old monkey show,

1076
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,340
it feels very much like that to me.

1077
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1078
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,500
Which all is sort of like-

1079
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,620
Head-warpy, I can't pin these guys down.

1080
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,340
They say something weird, everything you say to them.

1081
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,460
Yeah, but they're not like that.

1082
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,180
But they're so clever.

1083
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,260
Mickey Dolan's just try to kind of be like that still,

1084
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,940
I feel like, where he's got to quip a minute,

1085
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,540
and they're not always so funny, but-

1086
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,860
Something tells me if you let him talk for a while,

1087
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,340
he might start talking about some unsavory things.

1088
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,100
Perhaps, but-

1089
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,100
Knowing nothing except looking at him.

1090
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,940
I have my guesses about Mickey Dolan.

1091
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,140
Possible.

1092
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,780
I haven't heard anything like that, especially,

1093
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,980
I've heard some funny stories about him being ridiculous.

1094
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,460
But my point just is that there's something in

1095
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,540
the monkey's actual as human beings and the Beatles,

1096
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,180
where you can see they like to have some fun.

1097
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,260
I don't get that sense from the Beach Boys.

1098
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,340
No, well, now it's on these writers to figure out

1099
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,420
what the Beach Boys are like.

1100
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,620
And I do like where they land.

1101
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,020
I like that they're like quippy 60s people,

1102
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,060
and I like that Mike is, that he likes food,

1103
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,660
he likes to eat, he's like shaggy.

1104
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,340
Why not?

1105
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,100
I gotta add, they're gonna land somewhere,

1106
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,140
I gotta give them characters.

1107
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,980
Anyway, then they sing Kokomo all in the living room,

1108
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,060
and the kids clap along, and it's cute,

1109
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,100
and it's for everybody.

1110
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,860
And Stamos is playing guitar with them.

1111
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,340
I know he played guitar on the show,

1112
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,060
but that's kind of presumptuous for a guy

1113
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,140
who doesn't know the Beach Boys.

1114
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,220
Because if the Beach Boys were in my living room,

1115
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,740
and they didn't know who I was,

1116
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,500
and they decided to play Kokomo,

1117
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,340
I would not say, can I play guitar with you?

1118
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,420
Unless maybe they offered, I suppose,

1119
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,860
or said, hey, you play?

1120
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,980
Maybe that's the drive that a Stamos has.

1121
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,580
Well, he does like to be seen with them.

1122
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,060
That is part of what he loves.

1123
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,860
Extremely.

1124
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,100
And he jumps around, and he still runs around.

1125
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,420
I don't know if he's bragging that he can run around on stage,

1126
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,860
and these old men can't.

1127
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,820
Yeah, that's got to help in these shows, you think,

1128
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,020
that at least one guy is being physical.

1129
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,540
He's a youthful 60 years old now at this point.

1130
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,180
He is, though.

1131
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,580
Boy, if you compare current Stamos to...

1132
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,540
He's got to be older now than the Beach Boys were in that clip.

1133
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:47,860
Yeah.

1134
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,420
Oh, he must be.

1135
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,140
For sure.

1136
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,780
Yeah, yeah.

1137
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,380
And he looks like a different species.

1138
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,940
Yeah, yeah.

1139
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,740
But I guess if you've been in actor mode,

1140
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,300
then you'll be...

1141
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,900
Because he's probably particularly with it for his age.

1142
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,460
Probably.

1143
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,020
I don't know what the excuses of these Beach Boys...

1144
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:14,020
At least, look, Brian has lost hundreds of pounds, literally.

1145
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:19,060
But that is less of a fitness and more of a you're going to die.

1146
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,820
So that's the thing.

1147
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,700
That's the strange thing.

1148
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,380
I don't know how much I explained the doctor,

1149
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,260
but that's what's weird.

1150
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,220
The doctor saved his life, Dr. Eugene Landy,

1151
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,900
but then he went too far.

1152
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,020
Another strange thing is that he also worked with Maureen McCormick,

1153
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,140
Marcia Brady.

1154
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,380
Yeah.

1155
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,020
This is just a strange lineup of folks who...

1156
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,740
Yeah, really.

1157
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,300
I forget what her issues were, but yeah, he was like...

1158
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,900
If you want on Club 3 to dive into Maureen McCormick's,

1159
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,500
Dr. Landy experience, go ahead and vote for it.

1160
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,260
I will do as much Brady as humanly possible.

1161
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,580
I even earlier this week...

1162
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,060
I had the frazzled day for whatever reason,

1163
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,100
and the way I calmed down at the end of the day

1164
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,180
was watching the full TV movie,

1165
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,420
Dawn Portrait of a Teenage Runaway,

1166
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,100
Eve Plum's Serious Turn,

1167
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,380
which kept her out of the Brady Bunch variety hour.

1168
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,660
I really liked Dawn Portrait of a Teenage Runaway.

1169
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,620
I recommend it.

1170
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,340
I recommend it more than another movie by the same director,

1171
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,700
Boy in the Plastic Bubble.

1172
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,700
I got a little more of the Travolta movie.

1173
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,420
You've probably heard of that one.

1174
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,220
Yeah, of course.

1175
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,820
I got a little more bored during that one.

1176
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,180
Dawn, I feel like had it.

1177
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,900
Really?

1178
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,740
I was with it, and here's what's really weird.

1179
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,940
The director of both of those movies,

1180
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,980
also the director of Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

1181
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:33,620
Wow.

1182
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,180
Yeah.

1183
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,300
And Grease.

1184
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,580
And Grease as well.

1185
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,700
All the same Disney's white thing, I think.

1186
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,100
That's funny.

1187
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,540
Randall Kleiser is the guy.

1188
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,860
It's the strangest filmography.

1189
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,660
Interesting.

1190
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,260
Anyways, that's the top...

1191
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,900
Hey, that could be a losing topic in the future,

1192
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,620
but then you'll know it's mine and you don't have to vote.

1193
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:51,860
Right.

1194
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,900
You could vote for it.

1195
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,100
The Christopher Knight VH1 reality show.

1196
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,340
You could vote for it with Adrian Curry.

1197
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,060
Admittedly, I've watched a lot of Brady stuff.

1198
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,540
I've drawn the line at the reality shows,

1199
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,700
but maybe the home renovation show's good.

1200
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,020
I don't know.

1201
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:06,500
Oh, yeah.

1202
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,140
I haven't seen that.

1203
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,620
Jason used to live right by their house.

1204
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,100
That's right.

1205
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,100
I lived by the original Brady house.

1206
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,140
Yeah, they renovated it inside to make it look like a real house.

1207
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,740
I was walking through the neighborhood once,

1208
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,580
and there was a bunch of bleachers and a fake marching band,

1209
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,540
a fake audience, because they were filming an HGTV spot.

1210
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,540
I haven't seen it.

1211
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,100
So yeah, anyway...

1212
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,500
Yeah, they saw with your own eyes that they didn't have a window.

1213
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,860
Well, we haven't done Barry's Branson show yet.

1214
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,140
We teased that years ago.

1215
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,500
Man, there's a lot of good Brady out there.

1216
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,380
It's just to be clear, if you see Brady in a poll,

1217
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,780
that's not you trying to get zero votes or one vote?

1218
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,580
At this point, it doesn't.

1219
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,220
It seems like there's actually too much enthusiasm for Brady stuff,

1220
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,660
even though we haven't seen it.

1221
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:48,820
But...

1222
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,260
Well, there's more group enthusiasm.

1223
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,780
Yeah, I think it has to literally be you two are turned off.

1224
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,780
Jason's usually on board for most things,

1225
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,100
but I would have to try to turn Jason off, I think.

1226
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,580
It'd have to be so repellent that Jason has no interest.

1227
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,580
It'd be hard, though, because he's usually on board.

1228
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,620
Yeah, I usually try to be a sport, even if I'm not interested.

1229
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,980
Jesus, Jason is a sport.

1230
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,100
I try to be a sport.

1231
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,460
My end of the day wind down movie the other day was the...

1232
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:18,580
I think it was the late 60s, early 70s adaptation of The Big Sleep

1233
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:22,980
with a older Robert Mitchum and a very old Jimmy Stewart.

1234
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,340
Really, it's Mitchum mania for you right now.

1235
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:30,340
I love Mitchum and Burt Lancaster as I've gotten older

1236
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,340
are the actors that I appreciate.

1237
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,140
For me, it's Eve Plumb.

1238
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:42,180
For me, it's YouTube toy reviewer Pixel Dan.

1239
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:51,940
Actually, I think you turned Jason off with toy YouTubers, maybe,

1240
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:55,300
and then political stuff you shouldn't be paying attention to also.

1241
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,180
Well, maybe.

1242
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,940
It would have to be so unpleasant.

1243
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,700
He likes some of the toy-Tuber talk, though.

1244
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,980
So you'd be like, I was watching Mickey Dolenz's nephew

1245
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,540
who's very right-wing neo-Nazi.

1246
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,220
I'm making this person.

1247
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,380
Yeah, I'm not saying I don't know if there is this.

1248
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,580
He might have a wonderful nephew or no nephews at all.

1249
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,900
Anyways, they're having fun.

1250
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,260
They even like, whoa, look at this.

1251
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,500
Hanging out with the Beach Boys, eating pizza.

1252
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,780
The pizza's a big part of it.

1253
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,420
But ultimately, things come to a head.

1254
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,580
OK, DJ, who's coming with you?

1255
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:28,660
And somehow, they make the decision that it's everybody.

1256
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:33,220
And then smash cut to a big stadium show.

1257
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:37,060
Beach Boys playing Kokomo there.

1258
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,780
And the Tanner family just off to the side

1259
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,380
with the best seats in the house.

1260
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,020
No seats.

1261
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,020
They're just right off to the side of the stage.

1262
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,380
The kind of setup I saw where they're in the center of the field.

1263
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:51,860
And then mostly, it's just empty field around them,

1264
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,260
except for so many cheerleaders.

1265
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,220
We were trying to figure out, is this the Rose Bowl?

1266
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,180
It is not the Rose Bowl.

1267
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,540
It's the LA Coliseum.

1268
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,180
It's the Coliseum.

1269
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,740
The then home of the Raiders, I believe.

1270
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,980
Yes, not San Francisco.

1271
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,740
I think this was after a USC Trojans game,

1272
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,940
which if eagle-eyed viewers might notice,

1273
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,540
whenever they cut to the crowd, there are 60 USC shirts

1274
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,980
in every single crowd shot.

1275
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,020
That makes sense.

1276
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,100
Sort of takes away the San Francisco of it all.

1277
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:24,980
I mentioned the fact before, which is that Brian Wilson

1278
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,900
had nothing to do with Kokomo.

1279
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,540
And this was such a shot in the arm for Mike

1280
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,740
that finally the genius wasn't even here,

1281
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,860
and I abandoned one.

1282
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:40,180
I just needed that guy, that sex creep from the mamas

1283
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,500
and the papas, and the guy who Manson was trying to kill.

1284
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:48,500
The strangest group of ne'er-do-wells who made Kokomo.

1285
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,260
Is it three credited?

1286
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:50,740
Four.

1287
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,460
There's another guy.

1288
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,300
Scott McKenzie, I think, is the name.

1289
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,620
I'm not sure his deal, but it was like an old demo

1290
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,060
by the guy from mamas and the papas.

1291
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:01,300
So they get kind of bought by Mike Love and the Melcher,

1292
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:01,940
Terry Melcher.

1293
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:06,820
But anyway, Brian not part of Kokomo,

1294
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:10,420
yet here he is on stage singing it with him.

1295
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,420
Can you tell from this performance?

1296
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,740
Just listen for a voice that maybe

1297
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:18,500
seems a little bit lost as to the melody or the lyrics.

1298
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,140
Did you catch that?

1299
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,540
Like the kind of high pitch?

1300
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,040
Yeah.

1301
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,380
Yeah, we got a little more here.

1302
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,580
Actually, they cut to him too.

1303
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,140
See you later.

1304
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,380
Brian.

1305
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:53,220
OK, so was Brian playing live with them in this year?

1306
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,700
It was a weird thing where you just wouldn't know.

1307
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,020
For a long time, it's like, is he going to be there or not?

1308
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,380
Open door question of, I don't know,

1309
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,220
technically open door if he wants.

1310
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,300
So sometimes you would see him with them this year.

1311
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,340
Once in a while.

1312
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,140
Mostly not.

1313
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,820
The vast majority not.

1314
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,140
And you'd hear that they hate each other.

1315
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,340
There were lawsuits.

1316
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,940
And then we'd still be on stage.

1317
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:18,420
It's like you really couldn't predict it.

1318
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,780
Brian for many, many years has just stood behind a keyboard

1319
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,700
that isn't plugged in, doesn't do anything,

1320
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,140
but it makes him comfortable.

1321
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:30,740
I believe in fashion check, I think he's maybe wearing a shirt

1322
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,100
for Mike Tukakis.

1323
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,900
Post-election, I guess.

1324
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,100
Or an aired post.

1325
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,900
No, wait.

1326
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,400
No.

1327
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:40,680
Right.

1328
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,720
What year was it again?

1329
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,960
It aired post-election November night.

1330
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:49,320
But maybe they filmed it when Tukakis was Bush's opponent.

1331
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,040
So all right.

1332
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,080
That dates it.

1333
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:57,480
Scott, you real quick slipped in the name Terry Melcher in there

1334
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,400
without mentioning the fact, Dwight,

1335
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,120
that that is Doris Day's son.

1336
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:02,760
Yes.

1337
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,320
Yeah.

1338
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,800
I likely probably would have gotten too excited

1339
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,680
if you said that.

1340
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,200
So I know why you didn't.

1341
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,800
I would have gotten rambunctious.

1342
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,840
I would have gotten Ramey.

1343
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:15,160
You know, it's not a bad thing, Jason, getting Ramey.

1344
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,800
It might have been the intended Manson family,

1345
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,840
intended victim.

1346
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:25,320
I learned from doing the oh, hello piece with Mulaney.

1347
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,280
I learned from a Mulaney riff that he was dating

1348
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,640
Candice Bergen at the time.

1349
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,120
Oh, right.

1350
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,440
That she was maybe the possible target.

1351
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,720
If you don't know that, that the Mansons were after the people

1352
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,840
who Manson sent were after Terry Melcher, this music guy,

1353
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,280
because he wasn't helping him out with the music.

1354
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,280
And he like, all right, well, you're the Hollywood pig.

1355
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,080
And that's why.

1356
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,920
And then they got confused about the house.

1357
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,720
And it was other people.

1358
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,920
They had moved out.

1359
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,720
So that's why it was Tate and the others.

1360
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,200
Right.

1361
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,280
But they were after the guy who ended up writing and producing

1362
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,240
Kokomo, who is also Doris Day's son.

1363
01:00:59,240 --> 01:00:59,480
Yeah.

1364
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,920
And also a weird thing I just learned.

1365
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,480
My grandfather was an entertainment reporter.

1366
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,880
He wrote for Modern Screen magazine.

1367
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,040
And I did a search for him somewhere, Carl Schrader.

1368
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,000
I did a search for him in some form that I'd never checked.

1369
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,560
And I found a big profile he wrote about Doris Day.

1370
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,840
And who is Doris Day married to?

1371
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,560
I think the name was Al Jordan.

1372
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,680
OK.

1373
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,000
Wow.

1374
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,640
He's a good pull.

1375
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,960
No, I just saw it on Google.

1376
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,040
Family tree.

1377
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,640
But yeah, he followed Doris Day on a vacation.

1378
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,640
He took a vacation with them and wrote about it.

1379
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,720
And there's a part where, like, I went to their lovely home

1380
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,120
and saw their little son Terry running around.

1381
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,160
Holy shit.

1382
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,040
My grandfather was around Melcher.

1383
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,760
This guy was in this strange pocket in history.

1384
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,120
So what year is that around?

1385
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,320
60?

1386
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:45,800
I don't know.

1387
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,360
60s?

1388
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:46,760
Well, no.

1389
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,160
No.

1390
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:47,960
No, earlier.

1391
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:48,440
Earlier.

1392
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,000
Yeah.

1393
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,040
Maybe like later 50s.

1394
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:50,920
Yeah, because 60s.

1395
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:51,320
Right.

1396
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,880
By the end of the 60s, Manson's looking for him.

1397
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,200
Yeah.

1398
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,000
I think that's what Terry Melchrom was renting the house

1399
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,720
that Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski took over.

1400
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,920
He still owned it.

1401
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,120
And then they.

1402
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:02,680
OK.

1403
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,560
And then Polanski was out of town.

1404
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:05,960
Yeah, he was out of town.

1405
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,320
Was he filming something?

1406
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:07,880
Yeah.

1407
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,360
Yeah.

1408
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,400
Yeah, I think that's right.

1409
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,480
Yeah, wild.

1410
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,280
The Beach Boys Association has a whole other thing

1411
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,080
that we barely touched on.

1412
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,920
You could vote for it for Club 3 if you want more Beach Boys.

1413
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,480
Yeah, that's true.

1414
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,440
Yeah, a lot of sub times here.

1415
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,360
What if the Manson Beach Boys connection outvotes a Weiger

1416
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,240
Lorcan episode?

1417
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,520
Yeah.

1418
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,160
Weiger.

1419
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,600
Yeah, I did ask if the school.

1420
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,640
A different psychopath has been beaten.

1421
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,120
Scarier.

1422
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,880
In a lot of ways, scarier than Manson.

1423
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,520
Not every way, but a lot of ways.

1424
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:48,200
My teacher gave me a lot of notes early.

1425
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,080
Positive notes.

1426
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:49,720
Weiger, not Manson.

1427
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,440
Very encouraging.

1428
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,240
Not Manson.

1429
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,400
Well, Manson inspired me in other ways.

1430
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,400
Manson did your 201.

1431
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:55,880
Yeah.

1432
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:00,440
Tell a lesson from UCB.

1433
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,280
They were so hard up for teachers.

1434
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,080
They let Charles Manson do it from prison.

1435
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:05,720
Yeah, of course.

1436
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,200
Jason, pretty good.

1437
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:08,920
My note for you.

1438
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,120
Just one quick note would be like.

1439
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:13,480
Jack.

1440
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,760
Sorry, I'm writing that down.

1441
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,960
Could you say it again?

1442
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,280
Got it.

1443
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,160
Thank you.

1444
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:21,960
Thank you, Jack.

1445
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,640
Anyway, I don't have a ton to say about this.

1446
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,440
They invite the Tanner's up on stage with them.

1447
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,600
And it's all in the character of the show.

1448
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:35,400
So like, please welcome some new friends of ours, the Tanner family.

1449
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:40,040
And then the audience for this concert narratively

1450
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,280
just watches a random family up on stage swimming with them, which is weird.

1451
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,400
We were recently talking about just stuff feeling a little wrong

1452
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,600
about when talk shows have a segment in a movie or a TV show.

1453
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,160
This is something as a kid I kind of clocked that.

1454
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,120
This isn't really what happens.

1455
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:58,680
But it is.

1456
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,440
Of all the things, they definitely did send them out at a real concert.

1457
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:02,920
Yes, they did.

1458
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,400
That's the old ad.

1459
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,040
That's true.

1460
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:04,600
That's true.

1461
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,040
Oh, but you're saying that, yeah, that a random family would not suddenly be up.

1462
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,120
Yeah, usually not.

1463
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:15,320
That's true, except I think Barbara Ann, which is what they perform, is the.

1464
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:15,640
Is it?

1465
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:15,960
Yeah.

1466
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,440
No, it's Barbara Ann and Fun Fun Fall in the Credits.

1467
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,440
The credits, yeah, Barbara Ann.

1468
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,000
OK, OK.

1469
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,520
But I think this is the zone where like,

1470
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,920
if we know somebody, just send them up because it's just bedlam by this point.

1471
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,520
Just give them a tambourine.

1472
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:30,760
Right.

1473
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,920
Because I just saw in the period of time where I got to work with Rob Lowe,

1474
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,760
somehow the Beach Boys came up and he's like,

1475
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,560
I remember singing Barbara Ann with them on stage back in 88.

1476
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,200
Whoa, what?

1477
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,720
I was like, what, did Stamos get you up there?

1478
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,920
And I think he said, it might have been Glenn Fry.

1479
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,280
What the fuck?

1480
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,720
I can't believe I'm talking to you.

1481
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,240
You know these people.

1482
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,280
So possibly this is just the arrow and they were just like,

1483
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,200
whoever's backstage, come on up.

1484
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,640
Yeah, I think so.

1485
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:57,960
I think it's possible.

1486
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,240
Yeah, trot out this well again.

1487
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,680
Mike's quest for relevance.

1488
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,840
And if there's a young, hot star there.

1489
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,480
And I did, today I found footage of that.

1490
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,760
I didn't know there was footage of that.

1491
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,960
That there's Rob Lowe in a sleeveless shirt and sunglasses.

1492
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,440
Wow.

1493
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,560
Singing Barbara Ann with them.

1494
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,200
And then Dave Coulier takes over on the drums.

1495
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,400
Really?

1496
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,120
He drums?

1497
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,320
Wow.

1498
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:17,880
Yeah.

1499
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,360
OK.

1500
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,760
The hottest stars, Coulier.

1501
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,280
Does he play drums on the show?

1502
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,520
Because there's a plot, one of the part of the,

1503
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,320
there's a joke I should say, that they want to pass Mike

1504
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,600
their demo tape.

1505
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,880
Stamos and Coulier.

1506
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,520
And then Mike makes a comment of like,

1507
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,400
I'm so glad that no one tried to make me listen

1508
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,920
to one of their songs or something.

1509
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,880
He says something like that.

1510
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:38,520
And they back up.

1511
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,480
And they back away.

1512
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,080
Which I actually, then I was kind of impressed

1513
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,560
that they followed up on the plot in the concert.

1514
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,520
They had to track that.

1515
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,280
And Joey sneaks a tape into his shirt pocket.

1516
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,240
And then Mike makes a face while still singing.

1517
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,200
It was pretty good.

1518
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:54,760
That is, yeah.

1519
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,320
This is a pro.

1520
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,800
You're doing your business of doing the concert

1521
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,360
and the sitcom plot.

1522
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,880
I'm just trying to remember, did he play,

1523
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,720
he was not in Jesse and the Rippers.

1524
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,200
No.

1525
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:02,360
No.

1526
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,960
They were DJs together.

1527
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,800
This might have been an off series.

1528
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,920
I don't know if they ever did.

1529
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:07,400
Yeah.

1530
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,120
Because that's overkill.

1531
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,280
They have two characters who play the drums, right?

1532
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,520
They were trying to sell jingles.

1533
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,080
They were.

1534
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,160
Yes, they did work together musically.

1535
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,640
I thought of Joey as more the lyricist.

1536
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,880
They also were the rush hour renegades.

1537
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,520
They were DJs.

1538
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,520
They were a lot of jobs.

1539
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,720
They were like Homer Simpson.

1540
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,920
Yeah, they all get involved in local regional media

1541
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,120
at a certain point.

1542
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,880
Which is my big thing for a long time, Gro,

1543
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,240
is the people in San Francisco ever clocked

1544
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,120
that all of the titans of media in this city

1545
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,720
all live in the same home?

1546
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,280
Right.

1547
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,160
Everyone who could.

1548
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,120
All the airwaves.

1549
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,080
Doesn't it seem like a monopoly is afoot over in this one?

1550
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,280
Yeah, that's pretty weird.

1551
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,120
I mean, that happens, though.

1552
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,920
UCB, New York, and it's late 2000.

1553
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,560
All these people ended up being on TV.

1554
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,200
All the people that lived in the full house house

1555
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,880
ended up having big careers.

1556
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:56,680
That's what happens.

1557
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,680
Sometimes Laurel Canyon.

1558
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,400
Frank Marshall makes a documentary about Laurel Canyon,

1559
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,080
and you can learn all about it there.

1560
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,520
It's similar to other ones.

1561
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,840
I forget if I've seen that one.

1562
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,080
I liked his Bee Gees documentary.

1563
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,240
Well, what happened to that?

1564
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,920
Was he just so handcuffed by the boys?

1565
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,480
But did you know as much about the Bee Gees?

1566
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,480
Yeah, I liked that one, too.

1567
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:13,980
No.

1568
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,580
Maybe if I was more of a.

1569
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:16,080
Maybe.

1570
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,820
But I also feel like they got real.

1571
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,860
I feel like they actually had, there were teary moments.

1572
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:23,820
Well, Barry, is it the one where Barry

1573
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:26,340
says that he would give all the success up

1574
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,180
if his brothers were alive?

1575
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:31,180
And you just fucking fall out of your chair with sadness

1576
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,540
when you hear that?

1577
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,580
That's crazy.

1578
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,660
I think if it's that one, then yes.

1579
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:40,420
That's a heavy fucking line, if that's what it is.

1580
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,220
Wow.

1581
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:41,980
Yeah.

1582
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,780
It's like the Beach Boys, actually.

1583
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:47,740
And only one of the brothers, kind of a leader brother

1584
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,140
in a way, is the only one still remaining.

1585
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:50,740
Yeah.

1586
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,060
Boy.

1587
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:52,700
So I don't know.

1588
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,420
Maybe he just got lucky.

1589
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,940
I can't remember if it's that one.

1590
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:57,580
They were more vulnerable.

1591
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:58,900
I don't know.

1592
01:07:58,900 --> 01:07:59,420
I don't know.

1593
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:03,500
Maybe you got to deal with Beach Boys, Inc. so much.

1594
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,140
The Laurel Canyon one he did was just

1595
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,700
sort of like the other Laurel Canyon ones you've ever seen.

1596
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,580
That's another.

1597
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,460
Yes.

1598
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,580
It's all the same sanitized sort of story.

1599
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:14,100
Everyone's agreed on that narrative.

1600
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,140
Yeah, and it's all just sort of fun.

1601
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,500
Maybe they'll talk about somebody streaking once,

1602
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,260
and that's about as raunchy as it gets or something,

1603
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,260
when you know it was fucking nuts.

1604
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,540
Like theme park rides, needing to get to them early

1605
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,420
so that when they stop doing certain tricks,

1606
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,420
you could say that you saw it, or they just

1607
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,380
settle into what the ride's really going to be.

1608
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,900
It's like how documentaries, you need

1609
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,380
to catch real stuff early, or maybe where they don't even

1610
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:41,380
know there's a documentary that's going to get used.

1611
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,980
Is it called Endless Harmony?

1612
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:47,900
There's one from like 98 that's vastly superior to the Frank

1613
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,980
Marshall one, just a made for TV.

1614
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:54,260
And then they talk about Kokomo and glorify it for a while,

1615
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,380
and then we were back on top, and the boys

1616
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,860
and the generations, you see, they loved it.

1617
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:01,460
And then it just cuts to Brian, and it's silent for a second.

1618
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,020
And he's like, don't get to be part of that one.

1619
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,420
Cut, next thing.

1620
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:09,660
That's more raw than anything that happened in the Marshall

1621
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,140
one.

1622
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:13,340
It's like giving Brian the iPad from The Last Dance

1623
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,900
or something, where you get an honest reaction from a thing

1624
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,300
they just told him.

1625
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,300
That's the vibe.

1626
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,500
Knowing all of the drama of The Beach Boys,

1627
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:25,700
I think that if The Last Dance was only an hour and a half,

1628
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,980
it was like, so was Michael ever hard to work with?

1629
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,420
Nope, it was just good vibrations.

1630
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,900
The mic and The Last Dance.

1631
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,980
For The Beach Bulls, it was nothing but good vibrations.

1632
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,980
At the very least, though, The Last Dance

1633
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:41,540
is a documentary totally from the point of view

1634
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,300
of Michael Jordan.

1635
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,420
So at least you've got that going for it,

1636
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,060
because The Last Dance is fantastic.

1637
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:50,820
Obviously, a lot of the players are upset with it,

1638
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,140
because it's completely Jordan's point of view.

1639
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:54,260
Oh, sure, sure.

1640
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:58,460
And he has the cigar and the glass of whiskey,

1641
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,820
and you can see the levels changing

1642
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,660
as they're cutting the different clips.

1643
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,100
So when he's trying to settle scores,

1644
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,340
he's trying to change narratives.

1645
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,740
And I took that personally.

1646
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,420
Right, and there's so many meme-able things from it,

1647
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:10,620
so many memorable.

1648
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:13,820
And the bulls themselves were so cool at that time.

1649
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,980
So at the very least, it's not just a here's what happened,

1650
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,420
and that's the sanitized version.

1651
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,700
You're getting one of the most fascinating men of all time's

1652
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:22,900
point of view.

1653
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,460
So that's what makes that compelling,

1654
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,340
even though it might not be the whole truth of the situation.

1655
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:31,300
He's willing to showcase his own villainy in it.

1656
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,500
Yes, and it's so good.

1657
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,300
It's so compelling.

1658
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,620
That's why if there was a raw Mike Love documentary,

1659
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,060
I think it'd be one of the greatest things.

1660
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:38,740
Exactly.

1661
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,740
If you could get that from him, at the very least,

1662
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:43,380
it would be some of the most compelling television.

1663
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,500
It does exist.

1664
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,900
You just have to piecemeal it yourself, as I have done.

1665
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:52,660
It's a documentary that exists in 200 YouTube clips,

1666
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:55,660
basically, one of which I think I'll play.

1667
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:58,780
You have to hear that I took it personally in your own head.

1668
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:00,060
He's not going to say it.

1669
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:04,020
Other than at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when he did say it.

1670
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:08,620
You said it in many more words.

1671
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,540
Michael Jordan, also kind of a weird, vindictive Hall

1672
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:11,740
of Fame speech, right?

1673
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:12,300
This is the.

1674
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,860
Yeah, certainly.

1675
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:18,700
And yeah, and certainly still carrying grudges in Last Dance.

1676
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,980
Yeah.

1677
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,860
Mike Love should not grow a mustache

1678
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,620
like Michael Jordan had for a while there.

1679
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:26,740
Jordan still, I'd rather hang out with him

1680
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,220
100 times than Mike Love.

1681
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:32,180
This is a strange statement to say as a surprise.

1682
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,020
I know, it's not.

1683
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:33,660
I'm just saying.

1684
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:34,580
You'd rather hang out.

1685
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:37,020
You'd like to hang out with the greatest basketball

1686
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,220
player of all time.

1687
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:41,540
And somebody who is like, how many times richer?

1688
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,260
10,000?

1689
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,620
Well, that rich, whatever.

1690
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,420
But I'm just saying, it seems like you

1691
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,620
could have a fun time with Jordan.

1692
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,300
I can't see a scenario where you would ever

1693
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,380
have any fun with Mike Love.

1694
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,660
Well, I would.

1695
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,500
I know I would.

1696
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,420
Well, I would choose to hang out with him.

1697
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,960
If somebody said, do you want to hang out with Mike Love tonight,

1698
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,540
I would say 100% I do.

1699
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:01,500
But I can't imagine it going well in any scenario.

1700
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:05,100
Jordan, I can imagine it like we go in like a bender

1701
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,460
and play like 48 holes of golf or something.

1702
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,660
Either way, you're starting at a steakhouse.

1703
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:15,460
You're starting at minimum like a Ruth's Chris steakhouse.

1704
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,540
I think you and Mike Love are hanging out

1705
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,060
at the Lake Tahoe Sizzler.

1706
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,380
Yeah, and he's not paying for you.

1707
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,860
Yeah, no, no, no.

1708
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:24,900
Yeah, you got this.

1709
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:25,940
Separate checks.

1710
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:28,100
I mean, I gave you a lot of music for free.

1711
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,060
Decades of music for the whole generation.

1712
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,660
You actually owe me.

1713
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:34,020
In the story of Full House, the Tanners

1714
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,220
definitely paid for that pizza.

1715
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1716
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,420
Yeah, yeah.

1717
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,220
Then they were kind of like, let us get this.

1718
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,380
And he's like, yeah.

1719
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,140
Jordan would like bet.

1720
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,980
You would be Jordan would pay, but you'd

1721
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:48,340
have to like beat him in like a betting scenario or something.

1722
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,780
Like there's a sports game on or something in the room,

1723
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:53,760
and you have to bet that like he has to lose a bet for him

1724
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,180
to pay for your whole meal.

1725
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,020
And he's a little upset.

1726
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,180
And then he wants to go double or nothing

1727
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,380
on something else afterward.

1728
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:01,060
Then you end up paying for 20 pizzas.

1729
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,260
Yeah, probably.

1730
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,300
But it's more fun.

1731
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,580
It's a lot more energy, a lot more fun.

1732
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:10,500
You know, this is kind of like the clean episode, right?

1733
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,980
The whole baby's in it, and they do a concert,

1734
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,180
and there's the Tanners.

1735
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:16,620
Imagine being in that crowd if you liked Full House.

1736
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:20,820
Wow, the Full House cast is up there with the Beach Boys.

1737
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,860
And it's a little less hokey, and they kind of just

1738
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:27,900
get to do what they do, and it all works out for them.

1739
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,540
So you're like pretty good clean, right?

1740
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:34,100
Let me just, let me back this up a tiny bit to,

1741
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,940
because this, you know, as I've said,

1742
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:40,420
this all comes from the deep Stamos love friendship.

1743
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,620
They truly are best friends,

1744
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:46,620
love performed Stamos' wedding ceremony.

1745
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,420
It's really, I think it's a matter of,

1746
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:50,260
it's what kind of,

1747
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:54,540
what's your tropical musician best friendship?

1748
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:59,260
Is it Marshall Buffett, or is it Stamos' love?

1749
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,100
And I'm sorry.

1750
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,780
I know what sounds much more attractive,

1751
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:02,820
hanging out-wise.

1752
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,540
Yes.

1753
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,460
Well, one, not more.

1754
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,140
Musically you can, well, look.

1755
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,700
Musically you can debate it, I think.

1756
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:15,300
But as far as fun times, I don't think there's any debate.

1757
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,740
I suppose, yeah, well, yeah, one of them flew a plane.

1758
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:22,820
But anyways, because this friendship goes way back,

1759
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,900
so do their sitcom appearances.

1760
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,580
This did not begin on Full House.

1761
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:30,980
There was a kind of less popular show that Stamos was on.

1762
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:33,460
He was a soap opera star, which is why it all happened.

1763
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,820
He showed up at a Beach Boys show.

1764
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,860
Girls are screaming, who's that guy?

1765
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,940
Why are all the girls screaming for him?

1766
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:40,180
Get him on stage.

1767
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:41,860
And then he rode that relevant,

1768
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:44,860
and boy did he put money on the right horse with Stamos,

1769
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,860
because he made it out of soap.

1770
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,540
But he was already, that's a big enough star for me.

1771
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:50,740
Then he made it to prime time,

1772
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,380
and then to a much bigger prime time show.

1773
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,860
And then perennial TV star, he's always on something.

1774
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,060
But it started on prime time TV

1775
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,340
with a show called You Again with Jack Klugman.

1776
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:04,380
And this is where the onscreen collaboration

1777
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:09,140
between the Beach Boys and Stamos begin.

1778
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,740
Really quick context here.

1779
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,980
Stamos' character in that show, if you can believe it,

1780
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:17,860
is a drummer, and he is asked to fill in

1781
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,900
for Beach Boys' gig.

1782
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,580
He's nervous about it, but it ends up,

1783
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,420
he prepares, and it ends up going great,

1784
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,980
and he knows all the songs by heart,

1785
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,660
and they kill a whole act of the show

1786
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:29,740
just letting the Beach Boys do a concert together.

1787
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:32,180
Great, let's write, wonderful, wrap that up.

1788
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:35,060
But then, here's the sitcom lesson,

1789
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,900
that he's cocky, went great,

1790
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,900
it's gonna keep going great for me.

1791
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,700
Shows up in the morning to get ready for the next show,

1792
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,140
and they come in with new shit they wanna do.

1793
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,900
And that does not go nearly as well.

1794
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,940
So that's the context of this moment.

1795
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:51,180
And this is everybody again,

1796
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:53,980
this is full band lineup, including Brian Wilson,

1797
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:57,500
and see if you can guess which voice is Brian Wilson's.

1798
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,060
You were some hit last night.

1799
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:01,900
Thanks, Bruce.

1800
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,740
That's great.

1801
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:03,980
Glad I didn't make a fool out of myself, you know?

1802
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:06,140
You knew all the tunes, that's for sure.

1803
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,300
Sorry I'm late, try these, Matt.

1804
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,060
What are they?

1805
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,820
Some new arrangements.

1806
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:12,660
Oh, really?

1807
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:15,220
I like the old arrangements.

1808
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,660
So do we, gotta keep it fresh.

1809
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:18,500
Oh.

1810
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:20,660
All right.

1811
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,700
And then he fumbles with the song.

1812
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,700
Has that ever happened?

1813
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,780
We have to do a new arrangement.

1814
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,020
I love what they're painting,

1815
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:31,340
but live perfection is, yeah.

1816
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:34,900
I just, I'm always perfect, I gotta try new ways.

1817
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,260
Never satisfied.

1818
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,100
Gotta keep it fresh.

1819
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:40,540
I'm every bit of the guy who wasn't doing pet sounds.

1820
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,860
Try these, Matt.

1821
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,180
Sorry I'm late.

1822
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,060
Try these, Matt.

1823
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,620
He's not as bad as he could be though.

1824
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,460
I will say this,

1825
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,140
cause I was watching some of this and I was like,

1826
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,460
he's okay.

1827
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,900
Well, let me keep making the argument here.

1828
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,100
Let's see if you remain at he's okay.

1829
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:59,820
As I show you another clip from the same era.

1830
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,100
This is without Stamos.

1831
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,420
This is Brian Wilson solo on a show from earlier,

1832
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:08,260
in 1988, the biggest year for them.

1833
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:11,260
A show called The New Leave It To Beaver.

1834
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,260
The context here, these are,

1835
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,100
I think it's like the kids of the original

1836
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,340
Leave It To Beaver characters.

1837
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,180
Of course.

1838
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,860
And they're passing notes in class.

1839
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:22,940
And then their teacher catches wind of what's going on.

1840
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:23,780
Uh oh.

1841
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,380
What seems to be the problem, Mr. Haskell?

1842
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:30,780
Well, Mr. Hawthorne,

1843
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,460
I was just explaining to our new classmate how

1844
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:35,700
you really brought history to life for me.

1845
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,020
Cut the ballparky and give me the note, huh?

1846
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,740
I'm not the culprit here.

1847
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:42,500
As you know, I only use a number two and a half pencil.

1848
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,660
Who wrote this?

1849
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:46,660
Who wrote this?

1850
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,500
Very well.

1851
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,260
I'll see you all here after school,

1852
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,820
and we can just sit until somebody comes forward.

1853
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,340
Cut the ballparky and show me who.

1854
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,820
He could be worse.

1855
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:01,900
I'm not sure.

1856
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,780
I mean, for a person who's having like,

1857
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:09,380
one of the most severe decades long traumatic episodes

1858
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,260
anybody's ever had.

1859
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:12,900
I mean, he's holding it together.

1860
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:13,860
The New Leave It To Beaver,

1861
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,260
did it go for like seven seasons or something?

1862
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,180
It was a hundred episodes.

1863
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,020
What's it that many?

1864
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,460
Made it to a hundred episodes.

1865
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:20,300
So what is that?

1866
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,620
Five seasons or six seasons?

1867
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:23,260
Four long ones, I think.

1868
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,100
Yeah, I know.

1869
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,500
You're like, there was a New Leave It To Beaver?

1870
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,660
Yeah, a hundred episodes.

1871
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,660
That's like that newer Munsters from the 90s

1872
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:30,940
going longer than the original show.

1873
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,420
No one's ever seen that.

1874
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:36,100
That's only 14 episodes less than the odd couple

1875
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,700
that Jack Klugman was on.

1876
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:38,540
I'm learning.

1877
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,620
I immediately was Googling.

1878
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,620
You mentioned Jack Klugman,

1879
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,980
and I was just like, Quincy.

1880
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:46,820
You got Rammy.

1881
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:47,660
Quincy himself.

1882
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,500
I got Rammy.

1883
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,340
Quincy.

1884
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,180
Rammy for Quincy.

1885
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:51,020
A long dead.

1886
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,740
It only passed in 2012.

1887
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:54,820
It lived very long.

1888
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,660
He did?

1889
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,500
Yeah.

1890
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,340
Yeah, he was born in 1922.

1891
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,140
We haven't said Klugman's name on this show enough.

1892
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,100
Wow, that was the first utterance of Klugman.

1893
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:03,940
I don't think it's the first.

1894
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:04,780
I don't think so.

1895
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:05,620
I don't think so.

1896
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,460
I don't think so.

1897
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:07,860
But it has been a while.

1898
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:12,060
Odd couple, 12 angry men, Quincy.

1899
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,740
It's just a killer.

1900
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:16,500
Guys, cut the bullpucky and let's move on.

1901
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:19,900
If you don't stop saying names to Jack Klugman's shows,

1902
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:23,100
then we're going to have to end this podcast early.

1903
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:23,940
Very well.

1904
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:25,100
Let's continue.

1905
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,780
Was he a one-off on this show?

1906
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,820
Yes, I believe the character of Mr. Hawthorne.

1907
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:30,860
Mr. Hawthorne only appeared once.

1908
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:32,140
It's a musical episode.

1909
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,260
What ends up happening is that it turns in,

1910
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:35,580
then the character starts singing,

1911
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:36,500
and then he gets into it,

1912
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,660
and he pulls a keyboard out of his stiff teacher desk

1913
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:40,500
and is playing along.

1914
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,780
Oh, so they almost like they cool,

1915
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,940
or they thaw his icy heart in a way?

1916
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:45,780
I think so, yeah.

1917
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:50,140
Well, yeah, once a magical rhythm kicks through the room,

1918
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:52,820
then even he can't get up and tap a toe.

1919
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,620
I know you brought this up before.

1920
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:57,500
I think you have.

1921
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:02,140
It was on Disney Channel or TBS?

1922
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:02,980
Was it?

1923
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,380
It says Networks, Disney Channel, and TBS,

1924
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,220
so I don't know if it, like, re-arranged.

1925
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,060
Yeah.

1926
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,500
Wow, that's so wild.

1927
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,340
Yeah.

1928
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:10,180
For you.

1929
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,420
And everybody got rich off of working on it.

1930
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,940
Not me, that scared me to sandwich.

1931
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,020
Everybody finds, somebody finds a way

1932
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,340
to screw old Brian Wilson,

1933
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,540
whatever ends, no matter what.

1934
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:23,380
Wow.

1935
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:24,540
Anyway, yeah, the kids, well.

1936
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:25,820
Wait a minute, why'd I end up paying

1937
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:29,740
all my Labor to Beaver day rate to my manager dad?

1938
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:30,700
He's dead.

1939
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,700
I had to join the guilt.

1940
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,060
I've got a cut of all of it, Brian, goddammit.

1941
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:40,820
I had to join the guilt, join the guilt for this?

1942
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,620
I don't want to pay those dues, man.

1943
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,540
Wait, this is new Labor to Beaver?

1944
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:48,500
I thought it was the original.

1945
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:49,980
I thought it was still on TV.

1946
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,100
Brian, that has been on TV for decades.

1947
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:52,940
Oh, man.

1948
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:55,020
We gotta meet Tony Dow.

1949
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,940
This kid, I gotta do a scene with Tony Dow's kid?

1950
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:58,780
What do you mean?

1951
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,180
Since when are sag dudes $100,000 a year?

1952
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:07,020
I think somebody's trying,

1953
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,580
new sag president, Mike Love, what?

1954
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:14,060
All right, fine, I'll fork it over.

1955
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:14,980
Poor Brian.

1956
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,140
Let's, well, anyway, that's the last Brian

1957
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:19,980
that we'll be hearing,

1958
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,540
because he never appears on it again.

1959
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:23,700
In fact, it starts becoming slim pickings

1960
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:26,900
in terms of which Beach Boys are willing to return.

1961
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,980
We get to the second episode, our very first telethon,

1962
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,060
season three, episode 24.

1963
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,500
This is the finale of season three of Full House.

1964
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:38,420
Context here, Danny Tanner is hosting a telethon

1965
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:40,500
for kids or something,

1966
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,460
but he's very sleep deprived, putting the show together,

1967
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:46,460
so he ends up dozing through most of the show,

1968
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:48,340
doesn't really have control over what's happening,

1969
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,860
so it just becomes a big talent show

1970
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:52,260
for everybody in the family.

1971
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:55,860
He's gotta fill in and do their stuff,

1972
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:58,140
which I love at this point.

1973
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,700
Look, I liked all of the kids.

1974
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:05,700
As a kid, in this era, I loved all of the daughters.

1975
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,380
Like, Erin attested to this.

1976
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:12,020
She's like, Stephanie Tanner, aspirational for me.

1977
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,420
We watched the part of the episode.

1978
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:17,660
In that episode, she does a dance to what is called

1979
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:21,380
Love Shack Baby, and she does this dance

1980
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:24,060
to a bad sound-alike of Love Shack,

1981
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,820
where they make Fridg-Snyder British

1982
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:29,220
at the side of the road and well.

1983
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,140
But the dance is so good.

1984
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:34,300
She's in a cool sweater and rules,

1985
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:36,100
and then she introduces another one.

1986
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,820
I'd be remiss not to play just a quick clip

1987
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:43,820
of the song that DJ sings to Michelle.

1988
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:47,660
I'll let Stephanie introduce it with her big,

1989
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:49,740
her sweater, which has five colors,

1990
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,180
and then it says friends in yarn.

1991
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,020
That's cool.

1992
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,580
Oh man, all right, here's this.

1993
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:58,420
Everybody give it up for DJ Tanner!

1994
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,540
Here's a shopping cart with Michelle in it.

1995
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:05,420
I'm riding down the aisle in a shopping cart.

1996
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:08,780
I ask my dad, please, can we get some of these?

1997
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:11,180
He says you're going to the dentist

1998
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:12,580
to get your teeth cleaned

1999
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:16,220
so you can't have any of those sweets.

2000
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:19,500
So we're headed for the check-in and I think...

2001
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,260
I'm going to go to the dentist.

2002
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,500
I'm going to go to the dentist.

2003
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:23,900
I'm going to go to the dentist.

2004
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,220
I'm going to go to the dentist.

2005
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:26,540
I'm going to go to the dentist.

2006
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:28,540
D-d-d-d-d-d-d!

2007
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,500
Just every once in a while,

2008
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:32,300
send in the loudest, just an ear-shattering drum machine.

2009
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,300
They also just ripped off.

2010
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,900
It's like Jingle Bell Rock.

2011
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:35,740
Oh yeah!

2012
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,860
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

2013
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,540
Yeah, it ends the same.

2014
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:43,980
Happy as I can be, lollipops and gummy bears

2015
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:46,140
are my favorite treat.

2016
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,060
This is such a funny, dopey song.

2017
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,860
I've always liked this a lot.

2018
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:50,980
Yeah.

2019
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,620
But they saved the big guns

2020
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:54,020
for where they got to get over the hump.

2021
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:56,140
They got to hit their million dollar goal

2022
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:59,180
and the producer of the station comes in and like,

2023
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:00,260
guess what, guess what?

2024
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,980
One of the Beach Boys is here.

2025
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,340
Mike Love!

2026
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:08,140
And he, what's the Mike Love business?

2027
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:09,700
Well, earlier in the show,

2028
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:12,900
there was a performance by some cheerleaders.

2029
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:13,740
So when he comes out and they're like,

2030
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:14,980
would you be willing to do a,

2031
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:19,220
well, maybe if we can get those cheerleaders back here.

2032
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,300
Always about the cheerleaders.

2033
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,580
Nothing strange about the way that's said.

2034
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,340
He, in this one, is wearing a big jacket with a,

2035
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:29,180
he's wearing the same hat as the other episode

2036
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,700
and he's wearing a jacket

2037
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,660
with like a big treasure map on the back.

2038
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,740
It's amazing fashion.

2039
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:38,860
And at this point, they can no longer pretend,

2040
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:41,420
Stamos can't stifle the friendship anymore.

2041
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:45,900
He has to, Jesse, in addition to John himself,

2042
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:49,060
has to show that he is best of friends with Mike Love.

2043
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:50,180
I don't know when it happened

2044
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:51,580
because he was just a contest winner,

2045
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,180
but his niece was a contest winner before.

2046
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:56,780
But it's clearly they've gotten to be very chummy

2047
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,500
in the time stamp, but they are because of,

2048
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,700
Dr. Love, hey, Dr. Love.

2049
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:04,580
And then it's like, they're razzin' each other,

2050
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,880
of course I'll jump in on drums.

2051
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,580
There's this schtick that happens

2052
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:14,100
where they do the song, Be True to Your School,

2053
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:17,020
and Mike tells him,

2054
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:18,900
all right, when I sing this line,

2055
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,340
then you just gotta do a little,

2056
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:23,060
just a little light drum fill, okay?

2057
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:25,660
And then he does like a massive drum solo,

2058
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:28,380
and then Mike has to throw a towel at him

2059
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:29,740
to get him to stop.

2060
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,500
And I think the joke is,

2061
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,100
ever since Ringo started touring,

2062
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,060
we've had this problem with drummers.

2063
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,220
What is that?

2064
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,460
That really doesn't really work as a joke.

2065
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,180
I guess the idea that a drummer is front and center

2066
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:44,260
in a concert means, I don't know.

2067
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,880
Yeah, it's a hard one to track.

2068
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:52,340
This is schtick that remains in Beach Boys shows

2069
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:53,260
to this day.

2070
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:54,820
That's what we are watching.

2071
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,540
Is little, they put into the sitcom

2072
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,980
the little bit of business that these guys do,

2073
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:02,180
but they get a little raunchier

2074
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:04,740
than they would be willing to do on Full House.

2075
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:05,580
Oh, wow.

2076
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:06,420
And I'll let it explain for itself,

2077
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,260
but this is the same thing.

2078
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:08,700
This is Stamos playing with them.

2079
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,620
This is from 13 years ago,

2080
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:13,780
and yeah, they did this bit a lot.

2081
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:15,620
So they're setting up for Be True to Your School

2082
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,780
and to do a little drum thing.

2083
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:19,660
I forget if that matters for the clip, but here it is.

2084
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:24,220
So, John, because you are part-time,

2085
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:25,340
I want to refresh your memory

2086
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,100
on something we'd like to do.

2087
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,340
It's a patriotic song.

2088
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,780
It's inspired by people in uniform,

2089
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,700
in particular cheerleading uniforms.

2090
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,340
She's still, yeah.

2091
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:38,580
Something more fundamentally patriotic

2092
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,380
than Friday Night Football in the United States.

2093
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:44,020
Okay, as long as they're cheerleaders,

2094
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:45,220
or Saturday or Sunday.

2095
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,220
John, we're gonna do this song

2096
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:49,460
recorded quite some time ago,

2097
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,780
actually, we recorded it in 1963.

2098
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:58,780
That was the year I was born.

2099
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,620
The year I was born.

2100
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:03,780
John says, 63 was the year he was born.

2101
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:05,460
John, you really don't have to remind me of that

2102
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,260
because your mother Loretta and I

2103
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,340
had some great times back then.

2104
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,340
It wasn't my fault, John, it was the 60s.

2105
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:16,180
Come on.

2106
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:18,860
Pshh.

2107
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:19,700
Wow, Mike.

2108
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,980
And Loretta's here tonight, too.

2109
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,940
It's like deja vu all over him.

2110
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:24,780
Aw.

2111
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,460
Okay, John, we're gonna begin the song.

2112
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:30,860
Would they do these jokes the same way?

2113
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:32,380
Then he says, yes, daddy.

2114
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,660
Oh, sorry, sorry, I missed.

2115
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:37,140
So we have a run of bits here implying

2116
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:40,060
that Mike Love is the secret biological father

2117
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:43,700
of John Stamos, which kind of drags.

2118
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:47,180
November 22nd, 1963, America Moores

2119
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,900
for the young president,

2120
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:51,940
killed in mysterious circumstances.

2121
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:54,420
You know, they say everybody remembers where they were

2122
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:56,060
when they heard Kennedy was shot.

2123
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,460
I was fucking John Stamos' mom.

2124
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:05,580
I want you to give birth to our new drummer.

2125
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,860
I know, to keep, it's a family band,

2126
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:11,380
but brothers, what do you know,

2127
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:13,340
is eventually they're gonna start dying off.

2128
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:16,020
How do we get the new generation?

2129
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,620
I guess I gotta make them myself.

2130
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:21,140
It is funny to see Mike a little more alive.

2131
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:21,980
Yeah, yeah.

2132
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:22,820
There.

2133
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:23,660
He's got it there, yeah.

2134
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:26,460
Holding court, raunchy jokes.

2135
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:28,940
And they do the same,

2136
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:30,620
he's playing too much of a drum solo bit.

2137
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:31,460
Yeah, exact same thing.

2138
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:35,580
And also, there's a crazy thing he does

2139
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,340
where he, when he sings,

2140
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:39,820
I've said before that Beecher Your School

2141
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,580
is not one of my Beach Boys' favorites,

2142
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:43,500
I don't know if I can get this out.

2143
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,820
This might explain why, the note that he hits.

2144
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:50,340
Here we go, maestro, my note, my note, please.

2145
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:53,180
Jeez.

2146
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:55,380
I'm afraid of that.

2147
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:01,500
Sorry, big lead up.

2148
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:03,780
Sorry, daddy.

2149
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:05,740
This is too honest.

2150
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,580
A lot of feedback, a lot of feedback.

2151
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:09,580
Do I make fun of your hairdo on the poor house?

2152
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:10,420
Oh.

2153
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:11,260
Wow.

2154
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:15,500
This is just minutes, you go to see them live

2155
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,020
and he just gives them the business.

2156
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,420
Is he still, like, if we go see him,

2157
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:23,500
you refuse to see this lineup of the Beach Boys.

2158
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,540
Yeah, yeah, I don't think I'm gonna enjoy that.

2159
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:27,860
I think we should make a pact,

2160
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:30,620
or not a pact, whatever, you should agree

2161
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,780
that if they're still touring in 10 years,

2162
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:33,660
you will go see them.

2163
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,740
Yeah, that sounds good, yes.

2164
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:38,220
Yeah, yeah, I'm with you on that.

2165
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:40,500
The tour in 10 years, we should make a date,

2166
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,180
we should date it.

2167
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:46,220
It should be Friday, July 5th.

2168
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:48,900
Well, 4th of July is always a big show for them.

2169
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,740
Oh, right, that's what we'll do then.

2170
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,060
Yeah, so 2034.

2171
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:55,980
2034, if the Beach Boys, whoever is in the band still,

2172
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:58,140
if it's just Stamos and a bunch of other people

2173
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:01,420
and all the originals are dead, you have to go see them.

2174
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:02,820
I mean, that sounds great, yeah, yeah.

2175
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:06,020
So yeah, he's just in a hospital bed

2176
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:08,220
that they put, like, Lays and stuff on.

2177
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:09,980
Lays and an American flag.

2178
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:12,820
We're accustomed to this point that he lies down

2179
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:16,020
while doing it, they just put a microphone on top of him

2180
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:20,780
and then just even more, hey, happy 4th of July.

2181
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,980
He zooms in from a hospital.

2182
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,820
Just put a screen up.

2183
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,580
Hey, and just a big, you know,

2184
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:30,340
God just wanna say God bless America

2185
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:32,580
and God bless President Trump

2186
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:35,100
now in his third consecutive term.

2187
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:37,100
Oh, God.

2188
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:39,660
I'll try to avoid those jokes.

2189
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:41,940
We're all a little edgy.

2190
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:44,540
But yeah, okay, 10 years from now.

2191
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:45,380
Yeah, yeah, I'm in.

2192
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:47,620
I'm excited for you to see, and it has to be, yeah,

2193
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:50,060
any version of it, as long as the official,

2194
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:52,980
even if it's just whoever they sold the name to,

2195
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,820
is running an official Beach Boys show

2196
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,940
and Stamos is there and they're pretending

2197
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:00,580
it's the original members, you have to see it too.

2198
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:03,780
Imagine Dragons presents the Beach Boys.

2199
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:05,220
If that's what it is.

2200
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:06,060
Yeah, that's great.

2201
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:10,220
I think by then, Mark McGrath is a full-time member.

2202
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,380
I think they're gonna draft him.

2203
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:14,500
I think he's gonna do the math and like,

2204
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,500
all right, here's what I'll do.

2205
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,340
I'll get, all right, the one Sugar Ray guy

2206
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:20,580
I still get along with, he's just coming with me.

2207
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:22,380
He'll be in the Beach Boys.

2208
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:24,140
I only, it's all about the, isn't he already,

2209
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:26,260
it's like, it's all about those three songs.

2210
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:28,100
The three mother songs for me.

2211
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,300
Isn't that something that Mark talks about?

2212
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,660
Oh yeah, that's familiar.

2213
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:33,780
These songs, they give me life.

2214
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:35,020
They gave us all this.

2215
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:37,620
They gave us this lifestyle and I honored these songs.

2216
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:40,740
So as long as he gets to do the Sugar Ray songs mid-set,

2217
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,540
then he'll just be, he'll be the new singer

2218
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,380
of the Beach Boys forever.

2219
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:46,620
I think that's, yeah, like a 70-year-old Stamos

2220
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:47,460
will still be in the band.

2221
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,940
Yeah, McGrath, Stamos, the last surviving member

2222
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:51,340
of the Wrecking Crew.

2223
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:54,940
What, at the end, 10 years from now?

2224
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:57,660
Yeah, they were real young in the Wrecking Crew.

2225
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:59,380
Luckily, it's the Triangle player.

2226
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:02,300
He just has to bash his head into it every once in a while.

2227
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,340
But yeah, if Podcast the Ride's still happening,

2228
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:06,340
that's gonna be an episode in 10 years.

2229
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:07,380
Sure.

2230
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:08,660
10 years from now.

2231
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:09,500
Yeah, yeah.

2232
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:14,500
Siri, Siri set a reminder for 10 years from now

2233
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,780
that Scott has to go see the Beach Boys.

2234
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:20,140
Is she gonna talk?

2235
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,660
Is this the first appearance of Siri on the show?

2236
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,100
If you have Do Not Disturb, I want you to line up.

2237
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,900
Oh yeah, it doesn't, but it did set it.

2238
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:26,740
It did set the date.

2239
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,380
All right, new rule, always have,

2240
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:30,900
all of us always have Do Not Disturb off

2241
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,460
when we record episodes. Yeah, that's a good point.

2242
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:33,620
So that we can talk to Siri.

2243
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,460
I should've turned it on.

2244
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:36,860
The main time I turned it on, okay.

2245
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:39,020
Anyway, performance at Be True to Your School,

2246
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:41,460
the cheerleader, the cheerleaders come out,

2247
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:44,340
John manages to play drums at the start

2248
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:46,460
and then guitar for the bulk of it.

2249
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,940
He goes back to back with Mike, and as I've said,

2250
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:52,220
nobody plays instruments more than John Stamos.

2251
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:54,180
I don't mean amount of time that he plays them,

2252
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:56,260
I mean amount of playing.

2253
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:58,460
Like Dick Van Dyke and Mary Poppins.

2254
01:32:58,460 --> 01:32:59,500
Yes.

2255
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,940
Like a one-man band.

2256
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:03,060
Well, I mean, not only that, but also just that he like,

2257
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,220
he doesn't just play the guitar regularly.

2258
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:06,060
Right, right.

2259
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,540
He puts it all the way above his head.

2260
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,140
He stands while drumming.

2261
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:11,380
He's very- He lifts his arms so high.

2262
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:14,220
He shows you, I am playing instruments right now.

2263
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,060
Do you see?

2264
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:18,060
He very much wants you to know he's playing instruments.

2265
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,860
He's, and that bit, that joke, quote unquote,

2266
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:22,740
is also like, look at me.

2267
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:25,300
Yeah, he's like standing up on the stool.

2268
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:27,340
He's making a big- It's a joke made

2269
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:28,740
so he can drum solo.

2270
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:29,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2271
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:30,700
Yes.

2272
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,260
Mike doing that joke over the course of two minutes,

2273
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:34,220
10 years from now.

2274
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:35,060
Yeah.

2275
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:35,900
Oh.

2276
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:36,740
Oh, boy.

2277
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:37,580
And I remember.

2278
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:39,380
Because.

2279
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:40,220
It's a-

2280
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:42,820
Because.

2281
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:46,580
He'll have a neural link from Elon Musk's company

2282
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,620
and he'll just think his thoughts and they'll,

2283
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:52,220
AI will then use his voice and he'll come

2284
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:53,060
through the speaker.

2285
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,460
Oh, the first.

2286
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:57,140
He'll just like kind of make like a grimace

2287
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:58,660
and he'll go, ugh.

2288
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,620
That's the grimace that means he's telling the joke.

2289
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,540
And then you'll, but you'll hear it.

2290
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:05,660
The AI will speak his voice via his thoughts,

2291
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:06,740
via the technology.

2292
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:10,540
So he won't actually have to use his decaying vocal cords.

2293
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:13,140
You will hear Mike Love's voice via AI

2294
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:15,420
straight from his decaying brain.

2295
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:16,260
It's kind of beautiful.

2296
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,380
We'll get more, this is why AI helps us.

2297
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,100
We all get more life out of it.

2298
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:22,100
The only problem is sometimes his brain wanders

2299
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:25,580
and he'll have like a dark thought that you will hear.

2300
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:29,500
You will hear a dark thought once in a while on stage.

2301
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:33,980
It was me who told the Mansons to kill.

2302
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:36,540
I pinned it on Dennis, but it was always me.

2303
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:37,980
It was always me.

2304
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,700
That's right in the middle of good vibrations.

2305
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:42,220
They were peaceful up at Spahn Ranch.

2306
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,420
They just played with flowers.

2307
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:46,180
Mike, and then you see somebody like.

2308
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,380
I told them to kill dirty hippies.

2309
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:50,940
Backstage.

2310
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:52,580
They're threatening our way of life.

2311
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:54,420
At the booth, like somebody's like, kill us.

2312
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:55,380
Kill us, slash him up.

2313
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:56,740
Kill us, Neuralink.

2314
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:57,580
I went back.

2315
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:58,420
Passes out on the stage.

2316
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:01,020
I tried to get Dakota Fanning and Lena Dunham

2317
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:01,860
and Austin Butler.

2318
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:03,500
I tried to get them to do it.

2319
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:07,020
And then everyone told me they were actors and I left.

2320
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:09,220
Tarantino's gonna want you to go method.

2321
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:10,620
You gotta kill him for real.

2322
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:12,180
Gotta kill him.

2323
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:14,380
Margaret Qualley, I know you can do it.

2324
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:15,780
Vibrations.

2325
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:18,300
I don't like Leo and Brad Pitt

2326
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:20,780
because everybody says they're more handsome than me.

2327
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:24,780
I'll show them who's handsome.

2328
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:26,540
Neuralink Mike Lowe.

2329
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:29,140
You can't be handsome when Austin Butler slashed up

2330
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:29,980
your face.

2331
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:36,420
So anyways, I mean, that sums that up.

2332
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:38,100
Let's move on to the third episode,

2333
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,460
which is a two-parter captain video,

2334
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:42,180
season five, episode 25.

2335
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:44,380
At this point, the Beach Boys are finale only.

2336
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:47,660
That's how big of a deal it is to have them on the show.

2337
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:52,020
This is May 5th, 1992, and by this point, much has changed.

2338
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:55,140
The Beach Boys being on Full House is no mere lark.

2339
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:57,700
It's part of the business model.

2340
01:35:57,700 --> 01:36:00,940
Mike has realized, look what happened separately

2341
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:03,140
with Kokomo and us being on Full House.

2342
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:05,780
Now I look in the audience, there's seven-year-olds

2343
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:07,300
with the 70-year-olds.

2344
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,060
We gotta keep that train flowing.

2345
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,860
So they've got a new album coming out,

2346
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:14,500
and this is their attempt to triangulate everything

2347
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,100
with the big Full House appearance.

2348
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:19,540
And look, I know people liked, our song was in Cocktail

2349
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:20,900
and everybody likes Tom Cruise,

2350
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,580
but it wasn't Tom Cruise singing the song.

2351
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:26,540
What if we could get our heartthrob pal

2352
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,140
to sing our new song?

2353
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:31,860
It's got primetime placement, 20 million people watching it.

2354
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:35,340
That will make our new album, Summer in Paradise,

2355
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:38,260
the biggest success we've ever had.

2356
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:39,900
This is the first album they've ever made

2357
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:43,100
with zero participation from Brian Wilson.

2358
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:45,260
I'll show you who's the genius.

2359
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:47,780
I go, oh, watch me, watch me do without him.

2360
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:51,020
I'll run circles around that old psycho.

2361
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:53,980
So he is real cocky heading into this one.

2362
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:59,100
Episode story doesn't particularly matter.

2363
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:03,300
I think there's, I think Jesse,

2364
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:05,380
now Jesse and the Rippers are fully a part of it,

2365
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:07,540
and they're trying to get signed.

2366
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:10,020
They're struggling to get signed by a label.

2367
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:13,860
Well, because Jesse gets fired from the kids' show that...

2368
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:14,700
That happened in this one?

2369
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:15,540
Oh, really? Yes.

2370
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:16,360
Oh, okay.

2371
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:18,460
Dave Goullier, he fires him.

2372
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,700
He fires him from Ranger Rick?

2373
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:22,780
Whoa, I didn't realize that.

2374
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:25,980
And he says, why can't you fire the puppet?

2375
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:28,900
It's like, because he's a puppet, we don't pay him.

2376
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,340
Boy, I feel you.

2377
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,940
I got a lot of rage towards puppets myself.

2378
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:34,420
I can relate to this episode.

2379
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:38,020
Sure, and then he was like, you know what?

2380
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:39,260
I'm gonna put my mind to it.

2381
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:41,460
I'm really gonna work on my music.

2382
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:45,940
And he gets a record contract, then like two days later.

2383
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:46,780
In 20 minutes.

2384
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:49,300
He gets an offer very quickly.

2385
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:50,300
All right, I'm glad you...

2386
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:54,260
I go to these episodes, I go right to the boys.

2387
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:55,540
This is all on Macs, by the way,

2388
01:37:55,540 --> 01:37:56,380
if you wanna watch any of it.

2389
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,300
And Hulu.

2390
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:58,140
And Hulu too, oh really?

2391
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,380
Yeah.

2392
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:01,520
Okay, so at this point,

2393
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,260
they just kind of randomly show up

2394
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,540
at the kitchen door or the other door.

2395
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,700
This time it's just Mike and Bruce Johnston,

2396
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:11,500
who if you see them today, those are the only two left.

2397
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:14,860
Bruce is the only one with allegiance to Mike.

2398
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,140
There's not much to say about him.

2399
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,700
I always liked him a lot musically.

2400
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:19,380
He wrote great songs.

2401
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:21,740
A song called Deedra is really loved.

2402
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:23,380
Deedri, I guess you'd say.

2403
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:25,980
A song called Disney Girls actually is quite lovely.

2404
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:30,780
Personally, he's kind of a strange guy.

2405
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:31,700
Two weird facts about him.

2406
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:34,380
He was on a Weekend song on the last record.

2407
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:35,620
Oh yeah, you mentioned this.

2408
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:36,940
Called Here We Go Again.

2409
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:39,940
Him and Mike Love's son sing together.

2410
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:43,020
Even though apparently he never met the Weekend during,

2411
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,100
he was like over, I was in Malibu

2412
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:48,660
when I laid down some vocals at Skrillex's house.

2413
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:50,180
What, okay.

2414
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:51,260
That's why he's on there.

2415
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:53,300
Kenny G's on a Weekend song too.

2416
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:54,140
Is he really?

2417
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:54,980
I believe.

2418
01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:56,620
Kenny, all right.

2419
01:38:56,620 --> 01:39:00,140
My guys, he knows, Weekend knows.

2420
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,220
I like Jim Carrey on that album too,

2421
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:03,460
doing the interstitials.

2422
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,900
He also is a weird guy who at one point,

2423
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,460
he was just signing autographs for people

2424
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:09,300
and started saying,

2425
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:11,820
Obama's a socialist asshole.

2426
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:14,380
Don't vote for him if you want to keep any of your money.

2427
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:17,260
So weirdness to Bruce either way.

2428
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:20,780
But here he's all smiles, big quaffed hair.

2429
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:24,460
He's wearing a, maybe the craziest shirt any of them wear.

2430
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,500
Yeah, I hooded on this too.

2431
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:29,300
This massive bright blue big dog shirt.

2432
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:32,940
It's a big dog woven sweater, isn't it?

2433
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:34,380
So funny.

2434
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:36,900
It's a sweater or a sweatshirt.

2435
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,140
I couldn't tell, but I was like,

2436
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:41,740
he immediately walks in the Tanner door

2437
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:42,980
and I'm like, big dog.

2438
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:46,260
Big dog, yeah, I kind of remember these shirts being around.

2439
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,820
Did you have a big dog shirt ever?

2440
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:48,660
Sure, of course.

2441
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:49,500
You think so?

2442
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,180
I didn't, not that I was against it,

2443
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,020
I'm just saying I didn't have one.

2444
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:53,180
We had a lot of the,

2445
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:57,780
I think we had travel coffee mugs of the Star Wars ones,

2446
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:00,540
the dog bites back, I think it was.

2447
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,980
There was a big dog outlets

2448
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:05,940
at some of the Pennsylvania outlet mugs.

2449
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:08,340
So we would always like to look at all the parody mugs.

2450
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,180
Big dog's still going.

2451
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:11,060
It was an all big dog store?

2452
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:11,900
Yo, yeah.

2453
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,740
Whoa.

2454
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:13,580
Yeah.

2455
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:15,380
You could still get, this is big dogs.

2456
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:17,820
Is that the same big dog or big dogs?

2457
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,060
There's a website called big dogs

2458
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:21,980
and this has different big dog shirts.

2459
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:26,980
Big Bow Wow Wow Ski with a Big Lebowski parody.

2460
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:30,100
But it's, yeah, big dogs trademark.

2461
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:32,220
Is that the same as big dog or is this a rip off?

2462
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,060
That's a good question.

2463
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:33,900
I'm not sure.

2464
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:35,780
Big dog, oh, it is dogs plural.

2465
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:38,420
Oh, I've been saying dog singular this whole time.

2466
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:40,220
I think I've just been going back and forth

2467
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:42,380
with whatever I say when I think of it.

2468
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:43,860
There's some good shirts here.

2469
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:46,580
I feel like I wanted to buy a couple new shirts

2470
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:47,420
for the summer.

2471
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:48,620
I'd like to buy the one Bruce is wearing.

2472
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:51,500
Oh yeah, there's one where a dog is in a hammock.

2473
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:54,380
It says Department of Relaxation and it's a tank top.

2474
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:56,380
Wow.

2475
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:57,200
That's pretty good.

2476
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,040
Jason, you would wear that.

2477
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:58,880
Oh yeah, I love that.

2478
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,180
That's what Rob Lowe wears on stage

2479
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:02,140
when we think of that old concert.

2480
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:04,540
Big dogs, that could be a club three.

2481
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:06,340
I think big dogs.

2482
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:08,460
Mike revealed that not,

2483
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:11,340
like big dogs was always a little bawdy,

2484
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:12,660
but not that often.

2485
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:13,500
They were?

2486
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:17,860
You and Gio would always talk about the Big Johnson shirts.

2487
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:19,700
Oh, you want to talk about bawdy, Jason.

2488
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:22,340
The Big Johnson was dirty.

2489
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:23,180
Those were dirt.

2490
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,940
They sold those at the Wisconsin Dells.

2491
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:27,180
You would see those in a Spencer's Gifts

2492
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:31,580
and that was like a Leisure Suit Larry style humor.

2493
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:32,420
That was like a-

2494
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:33,380
It was nastier.

2495
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:35,180
Nastier than any big dogs.

2496
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:37,940
That was a bosomy cartoon woman

2497
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:41,100
and then like a lewd remark perhaps.

2498
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:41,920
I did not own any of that.

2499
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:43,800
A lewd remark on ties.

2500
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,640
If the bosoms weren't enough,

2501
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:47,400
a lewd remark would come into play.

2502
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,080
But no, I did not have any of those.

2503
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:49,920
Oh my goodness.

2504
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,640
I would never have one of those.

2505
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,480
You would turn your back.

2506
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,200
You would leave the town you were in

2507
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,280
if you saw one of those.

2508
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,800
I'm not a good guy like me, isn't wanted here.

2509
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:00,840
Oh, they've got, I'm on the Big Johnson website now,

2510
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,680
which still is around.

2511
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:05,040
They have Hawk Tua shirts, of course.

2512
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,160
Oh, that was fast.

2513
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:07,000
Hawk Tua girl.

2514
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Was it fast?

2515
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:11,720
Fast for a t-shirt production designing?

2516
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,040
They're not so-

2517
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:15,920
It's not fast for like a guy to make,

2518
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,640
but for a company to mobilize.

2519
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:20,360
They have to, the Big Johnson brain trust has to meet

2520
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,960
and go, so there's a girl.

2521
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,800
She has described the act of oral sex

2522
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,680
in a very colorful way.

2523
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:28,080
So like Big Johnson fishing gear

2524
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,640
and there's these cartoon characters,

2525
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:31,720
the Big Johnson characters, of course.

2526
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,520
And it says, she'll be ready to bite

2527
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,080
as soon as your fly drops.

2528
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,880
So that's the type of thing you would wear on your shirt.

2529
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,220
And then they're still doing it decades later.

2530
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,660
That's still the brand.

2531
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:44,260
Yeah, because the Wisconsin Dells

2532
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:46,580
and Myrtle Beach are still cities.

2533
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:48,620
Yeah, so I, yeah, I did not,

2534
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:50,220
you had Big Dog, but not Big Johnson.

2535
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:52,340
You never heard of Big Johnson.

2536
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:54,340
I'm sure I saw it on the beach,

2537
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:56,900
but like sold at the boardwalk.

2538
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:57,740
I think it was much more-

2539
01:42:57,740 --> 01:42:59,620
Would you wear this Big Johnson shirt

2540
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:01,580
that just says, I love hot moms?

2541
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:05,780
Well, does Jason really wanna broadcast

2542
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:07,540
his inner thoughts like that?

2543
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:08,980
Like Mike loves Neuralink?

2544
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:12,220
Would you rather do that one

2545
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:14,500
or wear like Big Johnson bass boats

2546
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:17,180
that says, cause nothing beats landing a large mouth

2547
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:19,260
on your Big Johnson.

2548
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:20,100
Would you wear that shirt?

2549
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:22,500
I don't think I'd wear any of these.

2550
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,780
I'm gonna find one you're gonna wear by the end of this.

2551
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:25,620
And I will-

2552
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:27,340
Can you find me, like the Big Dog shirts

2553
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:28,180
are a lot more cute and marvelous.

2554
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:29,020
You brought up Big Johnson.

2555
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:31,620
You opened up this Pandora's box.

2556
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:33,120
It had, there was no other way

2557
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,780
than going through every single shirt

2558
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:35,820
you're seeing on a website.

2559
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:36,940
Exactly.

2560
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:37,820
So I'll find one.

2561
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:39,140
This is on you, Jason.

2562
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:39,980
I'll find one.

2563
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:42,900
Well, if you start adding to eBay and Depop,

2564
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,540
you're gonna be here all night.

2565
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:45,980
Well, if we have to, we have to.

2566
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,700
If you need to tune out, Mike,

2567
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:50,260
while I say things and to find Jason

2568
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:52,820
a tasteful Big Johnson shirt.

2569
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:55,300
I mean, it's not gonna be fully tasteful, but-

2570
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:56,540
No.

2571
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,700
Well, look, this, the Big Dog shirt

2572
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:00,980
that Bruce is wearing is just a big,

2573
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,740
it's just the biggest dog head

2574
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:05,180
that could possibly fit onto a shirt.

2575
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:06,620
There's nothing wrong with that.

2576
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:09,780
And now that we're back to food with this,

2577
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:11,220
it's a lot of like, yeah, we're picky.

2578
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:14,020
We heard about your famous home cooking.

2579
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:15,340
And then she can't cook is the-

2580
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:16,180
Yeah, yeah.

2581
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:17,180
So they have to fake that the-

2582
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,020
Right.

2583
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:18,900
She has to keep lying about that.

2584
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:19,740
The site crashed.

2585
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:22,060
The Big Johnson site crashed on me.

2586
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:22,900
It just-

2587
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:23,740
Someone's on it.

2588
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:26,220
Oh, Jason's on it looking for shirts for himself.

2589
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:27,060
You guys are crazy.

2590
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:27,900
You're crazy.

2591
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:28,740
The traffic is so high.

2592
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:30,140
Wait, they're giving me two people.

2593
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:30,980
No, they can't.

2594
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:31,820
They didn't pay.

2595
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:32,660
In the same city?

2596
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:33,500
Big Johnson isn't that wealthy.

2597
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,860
Now that's no Big Johnson shirts

2598
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:36,340
for anybody for the next month.

2599
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:37,900
We used up the bandwidth.

2600
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:39,740
Right in the time where they were trying to strike.

2601
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:40,980
It's hoctuamania.

2602
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:41,820
Yeah.

2603
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:45,580
I saw someone post a picture from a Trump rally

2604
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:47,460
and two people had a shirt that said,

2605
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:50,780
Trump 2024 and then a cartoon drawing of him.

2606
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:54,180
And then on top it said, spit on that thing.

2607
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:57,420
And it seemed like the gist was like,

2608
01:44:57,420 --> 01:44:59,860
they didn't fully learn what the meme was

2609
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:01,500
before making these shirts.

2610
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:02,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2611
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:05,140
I like him because he's gonna spit on Biden.

2612
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:05,980
Yeah.

2613
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:07,460
I don't know what this hoctua is about,

2614
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:09,780
but I would love to see Trump do some of this hoctua

2615
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:10,620
to Biden.

2616
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:14,700
Presidential debates just devolved

2617
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:18,140
into octogenarian spitting on each other.

2618
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:18,980
We're not far.

2619
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:20,700
We're not far.

2620
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:21,540
You know what?

2621
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,620
You know who took a photo with this hoctua girl?

2622
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:25,620
Shaq.

2623
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:26,460
Wow.

2624
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:27,300
Two days ago.

2625
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:28,120
Oh, DJ Diesel.

2626
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:28,960
DJ Diesel took a photo.

2627
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:29,800
Yeah, they were together.

2628
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:30,860
Wow, wow.

2629
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:31,700
How about it?

2630
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:34,540
A gigantic star and Shaq.

2631
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:35,380
That's right.

2632
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:40,620
So once again, Dr. Love, what are you doing here?

2633
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:41,820
And his hair looks weird.

2634
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:44,180
He's tending to his hair, him, a man.

2635
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:45,780
So it was just very embarrassing.

2636
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:46,620
Yeah.

2637
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:48,340
And this is the wrong time for the Beach Boys

2638
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:49,460
to come over and say that they heard,

2639
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:52,380
you have a home studio now and they wanna jam.

2640
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:54,100
The Beach Boys are here to jam.

2641
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:55,420
So he calls the Rippers over.

2642
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:58,900
We're gonna jam down there and enter Forever.

2643
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:01,660
Now we are dealing with Forever.

2644
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:05,100
They are mid song of this song Forever.

2645
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:08,440
It's being performed by Jesse in this very moany.

2646
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:11,220
That's the sky.

2647
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:15,580
He could not be, that's his angle on the singing.

2648
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:17,060
It's so breathy.

2649
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:18,740
It's so hoctuey.

2650
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:22,340
And he really spits on the vocals, you see.

2651
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:23,540
Yeah, of course.

2652
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:25,980
This finishes, he says, God, man.

2653
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,340
Ah, that is such a cool song.

2654
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:29,500
Boy, I tell ya, if I had a song like Forever,

2655
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:32,100
Fatfish Records would sign us like that.

2656
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:34,100
Bruce says, you want it?

2657
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:35,340
You got it.

2658
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:36,180
Wait, what do you mean?

2659
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:38,140
Really, you'd let me record Forever?

2660
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:41,760
Sure, as long as Becky keeps cooking up food like this.

2661
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,620
Now, so what has just happened?

2662
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:48,060
If you didn't know, they don't really explain it

2663
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:49,980
to the viewer necessarily.

2664
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,780
Forever is a lesser known Beach Boys song

2665
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:54,300
from the early 70s.

2666
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,980
They were just jamming together.

2667
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:58,320
Now the Beach Boys have given permission

2668
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,820
to Jesse and the Rippers to record their own version of it.

2669
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:03,140
Here's what's strange.

2670
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:05,660
This has bugged me for a very long time.

2671
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:08,340
This song's from maybe my favorite album

2672
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:10,940
besides Pet Sand, Sunflower.

2673
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:12,420
Maybe one of the only Beach Boys albums

2674
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:14,020
that's like perfect front to back.

2675
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:18,340
Just like, oh, what a, that's exactly where the good,

2676
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:21,660
just mellow, beautiful, gentle Beach Boys music lives.

2677
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:25,340
And a big part of it is Forever, the original version.

2678
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:27,380
If you've never heard it, I encourage you to look it up.

2679
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:28,900
And this is one of the more prominent songs

2680
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:31,220
by Dennis Wilson, drummer of the Beach Boys,

2681
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:33,660
who was not putting himself out there as a songwriter

2682
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:35,380
too much up until this point.

2683
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:37,420
And then he starts contributing songs to the albums

2684
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:38,580
because Brian started checked out.

2685
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:39,780
So like, who's gonna be writing?

2686
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:42,780
He starts giving songs like this and they're wonderful.

2687
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:45,020
Everyone's like, who knew he had this in him?

2688
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:48,540
It's like, it's his primary song at this point.

2689
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:51,240
And when this episode is made,

2690
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:53,460
he's the only member who has passed away.

2691
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:55,500
He's the only dead Beach Boy.

2692
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,600
Cut to, boy, I wish we could do that.

2693
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:58,440
You want it?

2694
01:47:58,440 --> 01:47:59,280
You got it.

2695
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,860
Yeah, as long as they get more cooking.

2696
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:04,540
How are all of the songs in the catalog,

2697
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:09,260
how is the one that they give over to be done

2698
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:13,540
in this schlocky sitcom way, the one by the dead guy?

2699
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:16,900
Does this not seem somewhat disrespectful?

2700
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:21,020
Yeah, it seems, well, what is your opinion?

2701
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:22,220
Cause I really don't have one.

2702
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:24,220
Like, is your opinion that they were like,

2703
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,580
well, he's the one who did it,

2704
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:27,740
that's why we're giving it away.

2705
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:30,260
Or did they think that this would have the best chances

2706
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:32,300
as a hit with Stamos?

2707
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:35,340
I think, according to his book,

2708
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:36,420
I think that he had,

2709
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:37,780
maybe it comes from a more innocent place.

2710
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:39,500
Maybe he had a fascination with this song,

2711
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,540
loved the song as do I.

2712
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:41,380
John, you mean?

2713
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:42,220
Yeah, Stamos, yeah.

2714
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:43,740
And maybe he proposed it all himself.

2715
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:45,300
This might not have been some nefarious,

2716
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:46,460
oh, I know what we could do.

2717
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:47,300
Cause it seems weird.

2718
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:48,820
If we're gonna trash one of these songs,

2719
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:50,380
we could give him, you know,

2720
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:52,020
Dennis's pile of shit.

2721
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:55,380
Dennis, fuck with me, and I don't have to fuck with him.

2722
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:57,460
Because this wasn't a song in the vernacular.

2723
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:58,980
They wouldn't have played this live.

2724
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:01,380
This was sort of, with Dennis's passing,

2725
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:02,820
this was not a song that they really talked about.

2726
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:05,540
Well, maybe John also strategically,

2727
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:06,780
was there any strategy involved?

2728
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:08,540
Or was it just literally a song he really liked

2729
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:10,420
that they maybe didn't pay so much attention to?

2730
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:13,780
That is how he friends him, certainly.

2731
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:15,980
Now, it certainly ends up lending itself

2732
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:18,380
to this sort of power ballad arrangement.

2733
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:21,460
But I'm really, my Beach Boys episodes

2734
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:23,740
have been about celebrating the bad,

2735
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:25,500
the recognizing the good.

2736
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,300
And if you've never heard the original forever,

2737
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:28,340
what a lovely song.

2738
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:31,260
It's so much malware and just like,

2739
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:32,100
it's just introspective.

2740
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:34,060
It's so like what's in Dennis's heart.

2741
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:35,180
It's wonderful.

2742
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:38,260
And that it becomes that most people think, I think,

2743
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:41,340
that's that stupid song from Full House.

2744
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:42,180
Yeah.

2745
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:43,780
Well, we've talked a little bit about it,

2746
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:46,060
Dennis's solo album, which like,

2747
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:49,300
the Dennis songs like, almost in the same way

2748
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:51,420
that like some big star hits me,

2749
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:54,180
or like Chris Bell solo, where you're like,

2750
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:55,740
this is even beyond like,

2751
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:58,660
this is truly transferring like a feeling,

2752
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:01,820
like what's in your brain or your heart is being like,

2753
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:05,300
just, it hurts you, yeah.

2754
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,900
And forever is such a funny,

2755
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:09,620
for the version that Stamos does is so cheesy.

2756
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:11,340
It's really funny.

2757
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:13,860
It is just, boy, did they cheese it up.

2758
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:15,620
And this is where, I'm glad, it's funny,

2759
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:17,220
this is the end of it because like,

2760
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:19,260
it does really culminate in almost like,

2761
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:22,420
the Beach Boys have collaborated with a sitcom

2762
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:24,140
to make up a new pop hit.

2763
01:50:24,140 --> 01:50:24,980
If you're Stamos though.

2764
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:27,220
On the corpse of the one dead member.

2765
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:29,740
Cause if you're Stamos though,

2766
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:31,500
and you've been playing with the Beach Boys now

2767
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:35,620
for a couple of years, you're kind of in the band.

2768
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:37,260
What is then the next step?

2769
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:38,820
The next step is that,

2770
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:42,020
why am I not singing one of the songs?

2771
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:45,020
So I don't want to make him seem so nefarious,

2772
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:47,700
but I bet there was some strategy

2773
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:49,460
cause he certainly likes people to know

2774
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:50,780
he's in the Beach Boys.

2775
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:52,220
Even if you've gone to the concert,

2776
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:53,060
he's making you know,

2777
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:54,540
hey, hey, everybody notice this,

2778
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:55,820
I'm in the Beach Boys.

2779
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:58,740
He's also, let's think about what else he is.

2780
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:00,180
This whole episode we've been talking about

2781
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:03,140
kind of the lack of charisma of these gentlemen.

2782
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:05,540
There's nothing cool about Al Jardine.

2783
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:08,540
Brian Wilson was always an uncomfortable,

2784
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:11,340
even younger days, even before his troubles.

2785
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:12,900
He was not at ease as,

2786
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:15,180
he was not a John or a Paul, right?

2787
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:18,260
Dennis was always the comfortable one,

2788
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:20,580
the hot one, the only hot one, the only one.

2789
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:22,340
Aaron said that he's the only one

2790
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:24,340
who could be construed as attractive.

2791
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:26,700
And especially, and he looked great in the 70s too.

2792
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,380
Like, you know, once he grew the hair out

2793
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:29,420
and he's a little more rugged,

2794
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:32,780
he's the rugged long-haired drummer of the Beach Boys.

2795
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:34,260
Who does that become?

2796
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:35,220
John Stamos.

2797
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:37,620
So it's almost like his way of like,

2798
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:38,940
I'm gonna do Dennis's,

2799
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:41,220
I'm officially taking the mantle.

2800
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:42,060
Yeah, and I'm doing his song too.

2801
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,660
And for such a big Beach Boys fan,

2802
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:45,980
I could see that being like premeditated.

2803
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:48,300
I could see him thinking that too.

2804
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:49,540
Cause Mike has even said like,

2805
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:52,060
you're the young stud in the band.

2806
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:54,220
He's a scholar of Beach Boys history.

2807
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:55,460
He knows Dennis.

2808
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:57,900
I mean, following that thread of like,

2809
01:51:57,900 --> 01:52:00,140
what if I sang the song?

2810
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:02,700
Do you think he cushioned that?

2811
01:52:02,700 --> 01:52:05,100
Cause the events of the episode

2812
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:08,100
make Uncle Jesse look very foolish.

2813
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:09,060
Yes, indeed.

2814
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:09,900
Yeah. Sure.

2815
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:11,780
Yeah, things end up very silly.

2816
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:14,060
Yeah, they really piss on the song

2817
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,500
even further as it goes.

2818
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,140
Yeah, I don't know.

2819
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:20,340
I mean, if I were jockeying to get in there,

2820
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:22,780
I wouldn't be so bold as to be the new Dennis.

2821
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:24,900
I'd fish for being the new Al Jardine.

2822
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:25,740
Right.

2823
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:28,420
Where I just kind of do like long rambles

2824
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:31,220
about like Robert Frost between songs.

2825
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:32,500
And then like,

2826
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:35,340
hey, here's a song about the Santa Ana winds.

2827
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:37,140
Fire wind.

2828
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:38,380
It's a real one if you don't know.

2829
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:39,220
I don't know that.

2830
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:40,340
He expires, at the top of the song,

2831
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:42,020
he's like, there's a condition.

2832
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:43,580
He expires like a doctor.

2833
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:45,100
There's a condition in California

2834
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:46,980
called the Santa Ana winds.

2835
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:48,420
Fire wind.

2836
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:50,940
What's the environmental song

2837
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:53,060
where like there's a video with like Paul McCartney

2838
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:54,860
at the end walking out of some Grammy ceremony.

2839
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:55,860
Don't Fight the Sea.

2840
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:57,100
Don't Fight the Sea, thank you.

2841
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:58,140
Yes, yeah.

2842
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,700
He got a half interest, like,

2843
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:01,060
hey Paul, I made this video,

2844
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:02,740
it's called Don't Fight the Sea.

2845
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:04,700
You just really quickly look down the barrel of the lens

2846
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:05,940
and say, don't fight the sea.

2847
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:08,580
And then he does with as much Paul,

2848
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:12,740
as much of like Paul Panache as a tired Paul can do.

2849
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:14,580
He's like, don't fight the sea.

2850
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:17,380
And he by the halfway through that four word sentence,

2851
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:18,220
he's looking the other way.

2852
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:19,900
Yeah, he's leaving.

2853
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:21,380
He's clearly like, can we do one more?

2854
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:23,420
Nope, nope, good, peace and love.

2855
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:25,420
Hey, all right, love you buddy.

2856
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:31,340
Anyway, so a really, really quick clip as they,

2857
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,780
I don't know, I don't think it needs any,

2858
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:37,620
so the jam session continues.

2859
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,940
I mean, this is cool.

2860
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:39,940
That would be great if we did that.

2861
01:53:39,940 --> 01:53:42,420
I mean, you know, normally record stuff would be right,

2862
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:45,340
but quite frankly, who's buying it?

2863
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:47,620
You know what, Elvis never recorded anything he wrote.

2864
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:48,700
I wonder what it would have been like

2865
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:50,660
if Elvis had done a Beach Boys song.

2866
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:54,660
If everybody had an ocean across the USA.

2867
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:56,620
That's scary.

2868
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:01,820
How about a like this, though?

2869
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:03,980
If everybody had an ocean.

2870
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:08,660
How about a like this, though?

2871
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:11,540
How about a like this, though?

2872
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:16,740
Your Mike Love voice and Boogmane voice are very similar.

2873
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:20,180
Well, yeah, yeah, there's some crossover in energy.

2874
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:21,260
Yeah.

2875
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:24,380
Sometimes I think he and I have a light

2876
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:26,020
Mike and Brian dynamic.

2877
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:30,380
Yes, yes.

2878
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:36,620
So anyways, also later in this song,

2879
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:39,020
he sings the line in Surfing USA,

2880
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:41,300
a bushy, bushy blonde hairdo,

2881
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:44,740
and he picks up some of DJ Tanner's hair.

2882
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:45,700
No!

2883
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:47,300
And then kind of drop, lets it go.

2884
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:48,140
Evil.

2885
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:49,980
She is 16 years old.

2886
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:50,820
When this is occurring.

2887
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:51,660
It's terrifying.

2888
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:52,500
This has always creeped me out.

2889
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:53,900
Thank you for voting for this topic

2890
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:55,300
so I could get that off my chest.

2891
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:57,540
I had crushes on other girls, too, growing up.

2892
01:54:57,540 --> 01:54:59,100
They were my age.

2893
01:54:59,100 --> 01:54:59,940
Yes, yes.

2894
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:03,820
I am like two months older than the Olsen twins.

2895
01:55:03,820 --> 01:55:04,860
Do you have a crush on?

2896
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:05,900
Not then, you didn't.

2897
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:07,340
Not as much, not Michelle.

2898
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:08,860
No, I am like DJ. You're this two months

2899
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:10,100
older than the Olsen twins?

2900
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:11,660
They are about my age.

2901
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:12,740
Maybe it's six months.

2902
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:14,140
They're right around.

2903
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:15,700
They're right around.

2904
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:18,700
But that's more that you're waiting for.

2905
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:20,300
DJ and Stephanie.

2906
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:21,140
Yeah, yeah.

2907
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:22,340
I definitely had crushes on them.

2908
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:23,180
Olsen's is later.

2909
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:26,020
Olsen's is when they're doing like Island in the Sun

2910
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:27,100
and all these movies.

2911
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:28,140
So old time.

2912
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:29,380
They're 86.

2913
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:30,820
They're 86, okay.

2914
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:35,340
So anyway, he does record forever.

2915
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:37,340
He takes it to Fatfish Music.

2916
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:39,060
They say we're in.

2917
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:40,900
Fatfish Music signs him.

2918
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:42,740
David Janellori, in fact.

2919
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:45,700
Hey guys, David Janellori from Fatfish Records

2920
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:47,340
is coming over.

2921
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,700
This actor comes out like,

2922
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:50,420
yeah, oh Jesse, you love it.

2923
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:52,460
Duh, you're just gonna do gangbusters.

2924
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:55,540
I'm like, this guy, why does he look so familiar?

2925
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:56,500
Who is this actor?

2926
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:57,780
I look it up.

2927
01:55:57,780 --> 01:56:00,900
The record executive is played by Brian Robbins,

2928
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:04,460
who is currently the CEO of Paramount Pictures

2929
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:06,500
and the president of Nickelodeon.

2930
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,340
Wow.

2931
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:10,660
And in a recent power shift after Bob Bakish left,

2932
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:12,460
all of Paramount is controlled by three people

2933
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:14,140
and he's one of them.

2934
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:14,980
Whoa.

2935
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:17,140
Yeah, so he's a real life David Janellori

2936
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:19,020
of Fatfish Music now.

2937
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:21,780
He also, his directorial filmography

2938
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:24,380
on the way to being an executive is pretty amazing.

2939
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:27,580
Good Burger, Ready to Rumble, Hardfall,

2940
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:31,140
Disney Shaggy Dog, Meet Dave,

2941
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:34,220
and Brian Wilson's favorite movie, Norbit.

2942
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:35,780
Right, yes.

2943
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:37,500
Geez, wait a minute.

2944
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:40,100
You guys are in an episode with a director in Norbit?

2945
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:41,660
Man, that's out of sight.

2946
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:43,500
Isn't there a thing recently on Twitter

2947
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,100
where people are talking about how much Brian Wilson

2948
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:46,900
thinks the song Shorten and Bread

2949
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:47,740
is the greatest song of all time?

2950
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:48,900
Yeah, there's Shorten and Bread.

2951
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:50,180
I think that's from a book,

2952
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:51,020
His Obsession with Shorten and Bread.

2953
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:54,260
There is a story and this might have been,

2954
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:55,740
this might have been with Elton John.

2955
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:56,620
It might have been with Elton John

2956
01:56:56,620 --> 01:56:58,500
and even Brian Toppin, perhaps.

2957
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:01,660
I could be wrong, but it's big people like that

2958
01:57:01,660 --> 01:57:03,500
who are like, hey, do you wanna come hang out

2959
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:04,900
at Brian Wilson's house?

2960
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,380
Yes, I do, that's great.

2961
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:08,220
Hey, come to the piano, you guys are great.

2962
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:09,220
You're out of sight.

2963
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:10,740
You're piano man, just like me.

2964
01:57:10,820 --> 01:57:12,060
All right, here, let's,

2965
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:14,140
why don't we do a little bit of Shorten and Bread?

2966
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:17,300
And then, mama's little bit, and then they start

2967
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:18,500
and it's a song kind of like,

2968
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:20,180
it's like in a round, right, a little bit.

2969
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:23,220
So it keeps going and going and going

2970
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:24,860
and it does not end.

2971
01:57:24,860 --> 01:57:29,820
And like maybe hours in, Elton John backs out of the room.

2972
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:33,340
All right, I think I've had my fill of Shorten and Bread.

2973
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,860
There are multiple Shorten and Bread anecdotes.

2974
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:36,700
Yeah, somebody's posting them.

2975
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:38,580
Are you recording it?

2976
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:39,420
And then.

2977
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:40,260
Yeah, I was trying to find it.

2978
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:41,100
There's a recorded version of it.

2979
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:41,940
I know that.

2980
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:44,500
Trying to get people to jam on it or.

2981
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,940
This is only just because I literally just saw it,

2982
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:50,140
a picture of Elton, Bernie, Alice Cooper, and Paul Linde

2983
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:52,940
all hanging out, completely drunk and smoking.

2984
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:55,300
Damn.

2985
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:56,140
Pretty good picture.

2986
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:58,100
Geez, these are the days.

2987
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:00,140
Put that on a big Johnson shirt.

2988
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:02,620
Well, let me know any further

2989
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:04,100
Shorten and Bread information you find.

2990
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:07,620
Anyway, David Janellori is, you know,

2991
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:08,860
he signs him, that's the dream,

2992
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:11,780
but he's a little bit of a sleaze

2993
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:14,420
and he just kind of runs some game on Jesse

2994
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,900
and says, yeah, we're gonna film

2995
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:18,220
the hottest dance video you ever seen.

2996
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:19,620
And he's like, dance video?

2997
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:20,460
I don't dance.

2998
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,540
Oh, by the time we're through with you,

2999
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:23,860
everybody's gonna be doing the Jess Man.

3000
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:25,500
And then that's the story of part two

3001
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:29,620
is that he's manipulated into doing a hammer type,

3002
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:33,420
baggy pants, Arabian Nights themed number.

3003
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:35,140
And when I play this,

3004
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:37,820
I understand that it's supposed to be bad.

3005
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:39,220
What they're showing us is

3006
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:40,620
that he's being asked to do a song

3007
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:42,020
that's very out of character

3008
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:45,180
and so that then later on, he can do it my way.

3009
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:48,900
That said, again, Dead Beach Boys song,

3010
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:51,340
and this is being done to it on television.

3011
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:52,580
More people are seeing this

3012
01:58:52,580 --> 01:58:55,380
than anybody who heard the original song.

3013
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:57,180
This is unforgivable.

3014
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:58,000
Ooh.

3015
01:58:58,440 --> 01:59:01,440
["Dead Beach Boys"]

3016
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:20,280
It's really bad.

3017
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:23,880
This is a meaningful song to this man who has died.

3018
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:24,720
He's gone.

3019
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:25,560
Yeah.

3020
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:26,880
Drowned.

3021
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:30,160
He was just looking for memories,

3022
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:34,000
just getting a framed photo

3023
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,760
from off his Marina Del Rey boat.

3024
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:40,560
And he went down just because he was on a lot of cocaine

3025
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,840
and alcohol and we lost him.

3026
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:46,440
And now this is happening.

3027
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:51,080
He's dressed like Aladdin and we're doing a wrap.

3028
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:52,200
Oh boy.

3029
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:53,640
Rough, rough, rough stuff.

3030
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:58,520
So anyway, this is proof, ultimately.

3031
01:59:58,520 --> 01:59:59,760
Fat Fish is gonna drop him,

3032
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:02,080
but then he pretends he has another offer,

3033
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:05,000
even though that's just Michelle from her piggy bank.

3034
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,680
But they start telling the Fat Fish guy,

3035
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,520
hey, you know what?

3036
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:11,040
If you don't sign him, you're gonna be the biggest fool.

3037
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,080
You'll be like the guy who didn't sign the Beatles.

3038
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,200
I mean, you're looking at a number one record here.

3039
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,120
Just file that away,

3040
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:19,320
that they keep saying this is a number one record.

3041
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:22,920
And then we get to Forever, the music video.

3042
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:24,760
You guys remembered that.

3043
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,680
You have like strong memories of Forever.

3044
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:27,520
Of course.

3045
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,720
What do you remember thinking about it at the time?

3046
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:31,120
That I didn't like it.

3047
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,640
That I didn't like any part of it.

3048
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:37,040
That I'm like, when will this part of the show be over?

3049
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:40,240
Yeah, because we leave the style of the show.

3050
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:41,880
It just becomes like kind of a big

3051
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:44,400
post-November rain music video.

3052
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,960
Yeah, a lot of candles.

3053
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:46,960
So many candles.

3054
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:50,440
I was likely nervous by all the lit candles everywhere.

3055
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:51,800
How old is that church?

3056
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,600
That thing could go in a second.

3057
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,400
Tinder box.

3058
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:56,240
Yes, yes.

3059
02:00:56,240 --> 02:00:57,080
Just a powder gag.

3060
02:00:57,080 --> 02:01:00,800
A lot of arbitrary sepia and black and white.

3061
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:05,800
And then him, he's naked in a bed outside the church

3062
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:08,360
and just so just brooding

3063
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:10,480
and the most overproduced drums ever.

3064
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:12,680
And a lot of him holding up babies

3065
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:17,480
to where you see their little ball sacks from behind.

3066
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:19,520
And you're like, I don't know.

3067
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:23,200
I'm not inherently bothered by a naked baby.

3068
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:27,640
I don't post a lot of, even the green circle.

3069
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:30,240
I'm not posting naked pictures of my son.

3070
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:35,480
But anyway, even if that is your deal,

3071
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:38,480
it's like, that's not his babies though.

3072
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:40,360
These are actor babies.

3073
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:43,320
This is a guy, this is like a weird shirtless guy,

3074
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:46,840
unshaven, holding up not his own babies.

3075
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:48,200
I'm looking at their butts.

3076
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:49,840
It's very uncomfortable.

3077
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:54,200
This, does he talk about this video in his book at all?

3078
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:55,560
I don't know if they really go into the video.

3079
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:58,360
Okay, cause like this is a sincere attempt

3080
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:00,200
at something cool.

3081
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,040
Yeah.

3082
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:01,880
Like on his part.

3083
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,520
Which I feel like these things always try to avoid.

3084
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:05,200
How can we not get back into a corner

3085
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:07,160
where we have to actually convey that?

3086
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:09,120
And then the thing works and it's good.

3087
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:09,960
Yeah.

3088
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:10,800
They do it here, they go for it.

3089
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:11,640
They go for it.

3090
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:16,640
And it's just, yes, it's for a kid swinging a huge mess.

3091
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:19,360
Cause like the audience is kids and families.

3092
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:21,200
So what were you think,

3093
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:24,720
what was the thought process behind this type of a video?

3094
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:26,120
I never want to see this video again

3095
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:27,520
is I'm sure what I thought as a kid,

3096
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,200
I wasn't not in like that mean a term.

3097
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,800
I think I was probably like,

3098
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:34,920
oh, he's in a grownup rock star

3099
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:37,080
and this is what music videos.

3100
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:38,920
But you didn't like it, did you?

3101
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:40,560
I don't really remember it.

3102
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:41,400
You probably just didn't process it.

3103
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,960
This is a thing for adults.

3104
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,120
You blacked it out.

3105
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:44,960
Yeah.

3106
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:45,800
Yeah.

3107
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:46,620
Yeah.

3108
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:47,680
I don't know when you're told,

3109
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,920
like I could see that actually.

3110
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:50,280
I'll take their word for it.

3111
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:53,320
The John Stamos, big adult contemporary star.

3112
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:58,320
I definitely more remembered the sleazy record producer

3113
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:03,680
cause that was such a go-to in like 90s sitcoms.

3114
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:06,800
It's like, oh, yeah, hey, we really liked this song

3115
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:09,080
you recorded with your friends at the mall.

3116
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:10,680
I'm John sleaze bag.

3117
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:12,320
I'd like to give you a deal.

3118
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:15,120
And like there's a creepiest character

3119
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:17,160
which looking back on now, it's like,

3120
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:19,560
oh, this is sitcom writer is going like,

3121
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:21,680
I've met a lot of fucking scumbags in this town.

3122
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:24,840
So I'm gonna make, put all of them into this one guy.

3123
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:27,280
The creator of the show, full house.

3124
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:30,120
Oh, right, right, right, I forgot.

3125
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:31,240
Take a look, Google that.

3126
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:32,480
Real life David Janeler.

3127
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,800
Google that.

3128
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:36,040
But like, I'm just like as a kid, even a five-year-old,

3129
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:37,800
I would watch the monkeys in Nickelodeon.

3130
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:40,640
I would see, you see the, you can call me Al video

3131
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:42,800
or something and you're like, this is, I like this.

3132
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:44,400
This is fun.

3133
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,640
This is not fun for a kid.

3134
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:48,840
I mean, look, I love it now.

3135
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:50,560
Well, sure, I'm not saying it's bad now.

3136
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:51,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3137
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:55,520
I'm just saying it's a, what a weird choice for a kid's,

3138
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:58,160
I'd say the song would be different, I suppose.

3139
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:59,400
Song choice would be different.

3140
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,400
Would you not, I mean, I think,

3141
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:04,920
would you not think of it as a success for full house?

3142
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:07,120
Because I feel like it's like a very memorable part

3143
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:07,960
of the show.

3144
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:08,800
I guess that's true.

3145
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:10,360
And then the show comes back in fuller house

3146
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:11,920
and we're still, you know, like, we,

3147
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:13,720
But do you think forever is the reason?

3148
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:15,640
Not the reason, but do you, just like,

3149
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:17,480
as far as memorable episodes,

3150
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:21,880
even if some of the memorable memorableness is cheesiness,

3151
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:23,400
it's still like, if you had, all right,

3152
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:25,000
flash to 10 full house episodes.

3153
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,120
It was, it was an interesting choice.

3154
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:27,960
Yeah.

3155
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:28,800
That sticks out.

3156
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,640
Yeah.

3157
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:30,480
That's true.

3158
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:31,840
I think it's more of a success for full house

3159
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,560
than it is for the Beach Boys.

3160
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:34,400
Yeah.

3161
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:35,600
Who did include it on their album.

3162
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:38,640
The album ends with, so the 92 album Summer in Paradise

3163
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:40,800
ends with this.

3164
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,480
Is this a backdoor pilot for Stamos's music career?

3165
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:45,320
Probably, yeah.

3166
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:47,680
Sneaking on to a, he must have occurred to him,

3167
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:49,880
like, I could get a full album out, oh, totally.

3168
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:51,360
I never thought about that, but yeah, yeah, you're right.

3169
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:52,200
Yeah, that's what it is.

3170
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:54,360
Because if this was a hit, then there absolutely would be.

3171
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:55,200
Right.

3172
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:56,760
Because look, he is a good musician.

3173
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:57,600
Sure.

3174
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:58,440
And he sings it fine.

3175
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:00,040
It's just all, it's all steeped in cheesiness

3176
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:01,560
and the fact that he's like usually performing

3177
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:04,120
in like a black leather vest and the hair,

3178
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:04,960
like he's, I don't know.

3179
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:07,240
He's in this, is Brian Adams the only thing

3180
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:10,520
that's like kind of, like what else is in the genre

3181
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:12,000
of forever?

3182
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:12,840
That's a good question.

3183
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:13,680
That's all I can think of.

3184
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:17,480
Well, like, do you count like air supply in this show?

3185
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:18,320
I mean, sort of?

3186
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:19,360
No, that's a different thing.

3187
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:21,400
That's like 80s easy listening.

3188
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:22,240
Yeah, I guess so.

3189
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:23,680
I'm like 90s where it's, that's all,

3190
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:25,520
because he feels, because he's got that

3191
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,600
like open-shirt lethario thing.

3192
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:29,640
It's like that song, like,

3193
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:32,960
have you ever really, really, really, really, really,

3194
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:34,840
or it's kind of like, not how he looks,

3195
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:38,040
but it's kind of like 90s Don Henley.

3196
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:38,880
Yes.

3197
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:39,840
It's a little like divorce rock.

3198
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:40,680
Yes.

3199
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:44,080
I like the version of like a hammer,

3200
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:47,680
like what the record labels were looking for at the time.

3201
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:50,680
This is still, this made such an impact

3202
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:53,080
on the popular consciousness.

3203
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:56,440
There is still a generation or two who thinks this what,

3204
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:58,280
this is what rap music is.

3205
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:00,360
You're saying the hammer did?

3206
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:02,880
The hammer like kind of dance,

3207
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:06,000
like the full house version of hip hop.

3208
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,440
Oh, that that's what hip hop was in a certain time.

3209
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:09,720
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

3210
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:13,280
Anyway, it's like, yeah, it's just,

3211
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:15,440
or I'm making, do we got all the details?

3212
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:18,040
Okay, yeah, Naked Babies, Icky, great, said it.

3213
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:19,800
Drumming on Gems said it.

3214
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:24,880
Last Piano Note, he blows out the candle on it.

3215
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:27,040
It's just, oh, what a big pile of cheese.

3216
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:28,000
It's incredible.

3217
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:30,920
But yeah, you're right.

3218
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:32,160
It just, it's weird.

3219
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:33,000
It's weird.

3220
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,160
And I don't think, and I don't think like if you actually,

3221
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:37,560
he shows up on a fake MTV show

3222
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:40,600
hosted by Martha Quinn to get on the air.

3223
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,200
Martha Quinn appearance, yeah.

3224
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:44,200
Martha Quinn's on it.

3225
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:48,280
The guy who tries to cheat Jesse out of dance,

3226
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:51,760
it's like the coolest character who's ever on full,

3227
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:55,520
like he's a legitimately like cool guy.

3228
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,400
I like his jacket and hat.

3229
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:58,640
I'm jealous of that.

3230
02:06:58,640 --> 02:06:59,840
Oh, all right.

3231
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:02,520
I never had a big Letterman's jacket,

3232
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,320
fake money jacket like that.

3233
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,720
They did convey genuine cool with somebody.

3234
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:11,800
But anyway, also a quick note about the music video.

3235
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:14,840
Carl Wilson didn't return to be on the sitcom,

3236
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:16,520
but he does sing in the song.

3237
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:17,560
And it's why I like him.

3238
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:18,960
Is it even in this cheesy song?

3239
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:19,800
He's giving his all.

3240
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,040
He sounds fantastic.

3241
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,440
He's in the music video.

3242
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,960
Al Jardine is not in it because at the time,

3243
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:28,000
and this is per an article that Doug Jones wrote

3244
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,640
about this album, Summer in Paradise,

3245
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:31,120
Al Jardine was suspended

3246
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:33,520
due to having a severe attitude problem.

3247
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:37,280
So he's not on the show or on the thing.

3248
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:40,280
So again, they keep saying this could be big number one.

3249
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:41,120
And then later on,

3250
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:44,360
they convey that the song is number one in Japan.

3251
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:46,200
At least in the world of Full House,

3252
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:50,080
this song is a gigantic hit in real life.

3253
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:52,560
Forever on the Beach Boys album, Summer in Paradise,

3254
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:56,920
as a single makes it to number 100 in Australia.

3255
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:59,880
And that is the end of the charting of Forever.

3256
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:04,320
Also, the album that it came from, Summer in Paradise,

3257
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:08,560
which again, we're putting our eggs into this basket.

3258
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:10,600
We're using the mechanism of this show.

3259
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:11,960
We're gonna launch a full album

3260
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:13,960
with all the might of Full House.

3261
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:15,600
And the album comes out,

3262
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:18,160
supposedly sold less than a thousand copies.

3263
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:19,760
Whoa.

3264
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:20,600
Wow.

3265
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:21,440
Back then.

3266
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:25,880
Yes, in peak CD sales.

3267
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:27,400
Also per Doug,

3268
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:30,960
he said that they shifted to another number at some point.

3269
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:33,000
They're like, no, it's 125,000.

3270
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:33,840
That's crazy.

3271
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:34,760
It's not a thousand.

3272
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:37,320
And he claims that people were saying that like,

3273
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:38,840
no, that's how many you shipped.

3274
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:40,160
That's not how many it sold.

3275
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:41,480
Oh.

3276
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:44,040
So all that, and it, I think,

3277
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:47,040
bankrupted the independent label that it was released on.

3278
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:47,880
Whoa.

3279
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:52,120
So this blew up in Mike's face in a massive way.

3280
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:55,120
Brian Wilson vindicated this album.

3281
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:57,880
The album received nightmarish reviews.

3282
02:08:57,880 --> 02:08:58,880
People still are like,

3283
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:01,160
is this one of the worst albums ever recorded?

3284
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:03,880
Forever is part of the conversation of why it's so bad.

3285
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:06,720
The Beach Boys do not record a mostly original album

3286
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:10,000
for 20 years after this.

3287
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,160
This thing was a huge fail.

3288
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:14,880
Now Wondry wanted some of Aunt Becky's cooking.

3289
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,080
He's nearly penniless.

3290
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:19,760
He's like, who have I ever,

3291
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,040
all right, let me think about anybody

3292
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:23,160
who ever won one of our contests.

3293
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:25,360
Maybe I can impress my way into the door

3294
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:27,040
and eat some of their home cooking.

3295
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:30,200
He's so filled with rage of being broke.

3296
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:33,200
He didn't even notice that he was essentially eating

3297
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:38,200
California Chicken Cafe on China platters.

3298
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:39,120
He wouldn't know.

3299
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:41,520
He doesn't go to, he can't go to restaurants anymore.

3300
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:43,600
I don't know what Cuckoo Roos is.

3301
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:45,320
It's been out of business for 10 years.

3302
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:47,880
It's out of cover and reference in it.

3303
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:48,720
Yeah.

3304
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:51,360
Yeah, Cuckoo Roos feels like,

3305
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:54,560
well everybody knows a little place like Cuckoo Roos.

3306
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:57,160
It's where you wanna go, get away from it all.

3307
02:09:58,040 --> 02:10:00,560
Anyway, this is the last Beach Boys appearance

3308
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,360
forever returns because they have to convey

3309
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:03,840
that it's number one in Japan

3310
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,640
in an episode called Road to Tokyo

3311
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:09,000
where there's a big produced performance of it

3312
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,240
with a rabid crowd.

3313
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:13,640
This taping was attended by Doug Jones as a child

3314
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:16,640
who in a DJ fashion won a raffle

3315
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:18,000
to get to go to the taping.

3316
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,120
Wow.

3317
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:21,400
But I think with that, that closes out really

3318
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:23,880
the Beach Boys full house involvement.

3319
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:25,880
Stamos later appeared in a music video,

3320
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:27,880
a cover of Crocodile Rock,

3321
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:30,640
one of the most embarrassing things I've ever seen.

3322
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:32,600
The Beach Boys all wear the worst suits

3323
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:34,680
ever worn by 50 year old men.

3324
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:38,080
They dance around the golfing stuff in Ventura.

3325
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:41,440
It's really something worth checking out.

3326
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:42,560
That's quite a statement,

3327
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,040
the worst suits 50 year olds have ever worn.

3328
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:46,520
That's doing a lot.

3329
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:48,840
I guess I'd have to see a full, I mean, I don't know.

3330
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:51,440
If you're in, maybe like,

3331
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:54,360
if you're a white guy wearing like a Steve Harvey

3332
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:56,280
like brick pattern type suit.

3333
02:10:56,280 --> 02:10:58,960
Oh yeah, like a Roger Stone kind of.

3334
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:01,880
Oh yes, all right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3335
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:02,720
Actually, you know what?

3336
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:04,040
They do all look like Roger Stone.

3337
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:06,280
That's who I can only assume is a pal of mine.

3338
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:08,920
Who they is at Mar-a-Lago a lot.

3339
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:12,520
Yeah, in his part time Roger Stone manages the band.

3340
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:15,880
He works his men at Stone Magic.

3341
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:19,320
Anyway, that's sort of the story of that

3342
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:20,920
from the dream of the first one

3343
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:25,800
to the record sale collapse of the last one.

3344
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:29,560
But thank you Augustine for setting this one up.

3345
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:30,920
I mean, clearly a ton to say.

3346
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:33,800
And once again, one of the longest episodes.

3347
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:38,800
I do feel like I talked forever as Dennis

3348
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:42,120
and then Stamos threaten to in the song.

3349
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:44,120
Oh wait, one more little postscript.

3350
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:49,120
I love stiff acting on a family sitcom of a band

3351
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:52,360
so much that I got an incredible opportunity

3352
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:55,080
to reproduce my love of these episodes

3353
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:57,080
with the resources of Funny or Die

3354
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:59,640
because we heard that the band Chicago

3355
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:02,480
wanted to make a video with Funny or Die.

3356
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,960
And somebody ran down the hall and said,

3357
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:07,520
didn't you write a sketch about Chicago?

3358
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:10,560
Yes I did, get down there right now.

3359
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:12,520
I just had written it for fun.

3360
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:15,120
I was maybe gonna put like whoever be in it

3361
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:16,760
because nobody knows what Chicago looks like

3362
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:17,720
for the most part.

3363
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:19,160
And then I got to make this.

3364
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:20,560
I got on a set.

3365
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:22,240
I made what was essentially my tribute.

3366
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:23,800
It's called Chicago and Me.

3367
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:24,880
It's on YouTube, look it up.

3368
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:26,920
The premise is that the whole band Chicago

3369
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:28,520
adopts a kid together.

3370
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:30,480
They all signed the adoption form together

3371
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:31,360
and they're all in it

3372
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:33,760
but they didn't get the rights to Chicago's music.

3373
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:36,880
So they act but don't perform any of their songs

3374
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,320
which is the only reason why you'd ever want

3375
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:40,320
to have Chicago do a sitcom.

3376
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:42,200
So that's on YouTube, check that out.

3377
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:46,000
And I got to like live the fantasy of directing

3378
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,960
a Beach Boys Full House episode with like their peers.

3379
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,480
I fucking love Chicago.

3380
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:52,240
This is crazy to do.

3381
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:53,920
It was the real horn section.

3382
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:55,960
I got to direct Jimmy Pankow.

3383
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:57,800
I got to direct Robert Lamb.

3384
02:12:57,800 --> 02:12:59,360
I got to direct Jason Scheff

3385
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:01,240
who was then the singer of this band.

3386
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:03,920
Now has gone solo and he often performs

3387
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:05,520
at Epcot's Eat to the Beat.

3388
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:07,000
Of course he does.

3389
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,400
Yeah so imagine me shoulder to shoulder

3390
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:11,400
with a real Eat to the Beat performer.

3391
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:13,080
Eat to the Beat lineup just came out I believe

3392
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:13,920
a day or two ago.

3393
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:15,000
Oh whoa.

3394
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,960
That should be, it's too late now to,

3395
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:18,800
this is a long episode.

3396
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:19,640
We should have live streamed.

3397
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:22,960
I want to figure out a way to on microphone reveal that.

3398
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,000
But anyway, check that out.

3399
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,720
My love letter to these episodes as was this.

3400
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:29,680
Thanks for Augustine for letting us do it.

3401
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:30,840
Just telling us to do it.

3402
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:32,120
Thank you for voting for it.

3403
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:33,400
You survived podcast the ride.

3404
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:34,800
Thanks for subscribing to Club 3.

3405
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:35,960
Your bravery saved the podcast.

3406
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:38,320
Well done freedom fighters.

3407
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:39,880
And I hope you enjoyed that

3408
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:42,360
but I guess apologies for the poll otherwise.

3409
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:43,200
Yeah sorry.

3410
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:44,560
We'll try to rectify that

3411
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:47,600
with a cool cat named Nick Weinger.

3412
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:48,440
Yeah.

3413
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:49,280
What are you heading for Mike?

3414
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:52,320
Well I have a shirt here I'd like Jason to wear.

3415
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:56,560
It's $70 on eBay but it says big Johnson revolvers

3416
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:58,960
and then there's like sort of a busty lady cop

3417
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:02,040
and then sort of like a smaller like meek man

3418
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:02,960
who's holding a big gun.

3419
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:04,760
It says you never shoot blanks

3420
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:07,280
when you're packing a big Johnson.

3421
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:09,320
So I think I'll be getting that for you.

3422
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:10,200
Would you wear it?

3423
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:12,280
A lot of upsetting elements of that shirt.

3424
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:14,400
Which part is upsetting other than the slogan?

3425
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:17,040
I think the casual gun use, the cop,

3426
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:18,680
that sexy lady cop.

3427
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:20,840
Well it sounds like a no

3428
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:24,400
but maybe if you want an episode of Club 3 vote for,

3429
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:27,120
ask Jason if he would wear this shirt as a topic.

3430
02:14:27,120 --> 02:14:28,960
Pitch shirts for Jason to wear yeah.

3431
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:30,360
I don't know I think that's cool.

3432
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:32,400
I think you put that on and now you're getting

3433
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:34,560
some attention from a couple of cheerleaders.
