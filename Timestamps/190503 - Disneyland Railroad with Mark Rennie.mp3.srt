1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,360
Warning, the following podcast contains billowing steam,

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,360
hard steel rails, a teetering bridge on the verge of collapse,

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,720
choo-choos, and a look at the Disneyland Railroad

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,740
with guest Mark Rennie.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,000
All aboard, it's Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast,

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,800
where two of the three hosts have taken a special

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
photo shoot on the Disneyland Railroad.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,280
I'm Mike Carlson, joining me as always,

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,800
my photo shoot buddy, Jason Sheridan.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,520
I, yeah, that's me.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,320
Scott Gertner is our other co-host,

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,240
he has a really weird look on his face,

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,080
disgusted I might say.

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,200
I don't know to what you refer.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,800
Tell me about your special time.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,960
Well, it was my birthday.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,120
This is a true story.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,680
Let's bring our guest actually real quick

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,600
so he can make fun of us too.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,920
Our guest, a co-host of the Fantasy Flix League podcast

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,840
and a writer for Gay of Thrones,

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,720
which is returning soon, Mark Rennie.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,560
Hello.

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,320
Hi Mark. Hi Mark, thanks for being here.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,400
Thank you for having, I'm thrilled to be here.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,480
Wonderful, so good to have you.

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,520
Yeah, thank you for making time to talk about trains today.

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,120
Love trains.

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,200
Yeah, we all do, I think, love trains,

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,680
but so back to this story real quick.

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
It was Jason's birthday, and we went with our friend,

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Aaron, to Disneyland, and I learned of a trick,

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,640
and I don't know if it's still the way

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,240
to get something like this done.

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,560
Is you go up to a photographer

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,400
that's not somebody with a tripod,

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,240
and you ask them, are they inspired?

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,400
That's what it said on micechat.com,

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,880
which also sounds like a pick up of some kind,

43
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,720
or like a code.

44
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,880
It sounds like cafe gratitude stuff.

45
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,720
I don't know what you.

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,680
No.

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,520
I feel like I've heard you say,

49
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,480
are you inspired, upwards of 30 times at this point?

50
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,320
Yes.

51
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,200
And it's always the same, it's the pause,

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,680
and then so much wonder when you say it.

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,120
You say it so, are you inspired?

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,240
I think you love this.

55
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,560
If you put a little zhuzh on it,

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,920
then the photographers are more likely to go like,

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,040
oh right, I have to do this thing once a week.

58
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,680
Not just a spit, are you inspired?

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,520
Yeah.

60
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,000
Hey, you inspired?

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
Hey, dummy.

62
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,680
I should do with that.

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,500
Don't say it with an F word.

64
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,440
Hey, hey, hey you.

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,640
You inspired?

66
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,720
So what happens when you.

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,600
So what happens or happened,

68
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,360
I've only done this like twice,

69
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,920
is that if they are indeed someone who roams

70
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,920
as a photographer in Disneyland,

71
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,520
they will give you a little bit of a photo shoot somewhere,

72
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,640
maybe in a special place that they don't normally do this.

73
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,920
This happened to Lindsay and I

74
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,680
for the first time at California Adventure.

75
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,840
I tried it out, we were on like the main,

76
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,280
whatever you'd call it, street.

77
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
Is it Sunset, what is it?

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,960
It's the street.

79
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
Buena Vista Street.

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
Buena Vista Street, there you go.

81
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,920
Sure.

82
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,320
And the person I said, are you inspired to,

83
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,200
and she kind of honestly internalized a sigh.

84
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,040
Oh.

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,400
And it was like, all right, come over here.

86
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,880
And then proceeded to take photos of Lindsay and I

87
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,720
like peeking around the corner of the shops.

88
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,200
And it was honestly. Wow.

89
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
Honestly, too much.

90
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,680
She kept, like we did like 10 different spots.

91
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,800
Like your engagement photos or something.

92
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,840
Yes it was.

93
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,340
We were caught way off guard.

94
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,280
I just thought it would be fun,

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,160
like oh, we'll get to go up in a little spot

96
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,420
on the like Carthay Circle or whatever.

97
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,260
Not the case.

98
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,680
We did like 10 different spots all along the street.

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,520
And by the end we were like, what happened?

100
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,120
What just happened to us?

101
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,920
Get up on this lamp post, twirl around, claim it.

102
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,560
She didn't, other than stuff that wouldn't be dangerous,

103
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,640
she was saying like commanding us to do stuff.

104
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,280
All right, you over here, hands on her hips, do that.

105
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,920
Like, and just kind of shouting stuff.

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,800
And she was nice, but it was clear she was like,

107
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,360
all right, here, we're gonna give you

108
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,160
all the stuff you want, here you go.

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,680
So we were honestly, we're like, oh, that was too much.

110
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,720
Okay.

111
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,880
So what did we do when Jason's birthday ran around

112
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,480
or came around?

113
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,440
We were with our friend Aaron.

114
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,360
Lindsay was not there.

115
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,840
Probably was still freaked out from the other experience.

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,320
And I went up to a photographer.

117
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,840
By the way, the Disneyland Railroad was shut down

118
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,680
at this point. Shut down.

119
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Because they were doing all the work for Star Wars land.

120
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,020
Yeah, so the trains were parked

121
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,880
at the New Orleans Square Station.

122
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,040
Or at least one of them was.

123
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,920
So there were two photographers, they were walking around

124
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,880
and I went up to one of them.

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
I asked if they were inspired.

126
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,980
They gave me some like fake banter of like they weren't.

127
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,760
And then one of them kind of was just like,

128
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,120
all right, I'll take this.

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
Oh god.

130
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,800
Oh god.

131
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,640
Wow.

132
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,840
Put out her cigarette.

133
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,040
So I, and I think I tried to stress, I go,

134
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,840
if there's, you know, it's Jason's birthday.

135
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,920
I go, if there's just like one fun spot or something,

136
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,460
I go, it doesn't need to be long.

137
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,520
It doesn't need to be a whole thing.

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,360
And she's like, no, I got it.

139
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,720
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

140
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,960
She led us to the train that was parked

141
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,000
over in the New Orleans Square Station.

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,480
And we went inside and did a series of photos.

143
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,080
Like our heads out the window.

144
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,360
In the passenger car, in the locomotive.

145
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Like the three of us like stacked,

146
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,600
like peeking out of the locomotive.

147
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,120
Like Jason climbing the ladder on the back of the train.

148
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,940
Yeah.

149
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,940
And then like snuck us into the back

150
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,400
of like the haunted mansion.

151
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,240
The haunted mansion, yeah,

152
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,440
like the little mausoleum crypt kind of thing.

153
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
By the mausoleum.

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,640
Whoa.

155
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,120
So we have so many pictures of this day.

156
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,400
Did you pay for these photos?

157
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
No. No payment.

158
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,840
So you had free photos.

159
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,400
Yes, I mean I have photos on a train.

160
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,720
Photo pass, so it would be free.

161
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,980
But there's no, cause there's no way

162
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,040
to exchange money with a photographer in Disney.

163
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,080
I would feel the need to tip.

164
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,920
Like honestly I should have one.

165
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,240
But I'm sure you're not allowed to.

166
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
You probably could.

167
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,800
What's the Disney general thing about tipping?

168
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,480
I feel like they wouldn't take a tip.

169
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,320
Yeah.

170
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,840
Well the guides take tips.

171
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,680
They do.

172
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,880
The guides and the table service waiters.

173
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,720
But yeah.

174
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,640
Oh waiters, photographers.

175
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,080
They told us as a universal tram tour guide,

176
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,200
which I was, they explicitly told us not to accept them.

177
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,400
But one guy offered me a 20 once

178
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,080
and another guy offered me a beer once.

179
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,920
What are you supposed to do?

180
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,040
You better believe I took both of those.

181
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,880
Yeah.

182
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,360
Did he have a loose beer in his hand?

183
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,520
It was closed.

184
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,360
Oh okay.

185
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,840
And it wasn't like, you know,

186
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,120
yeah it wasn't like draft.

187
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,400
It wasn't an open container.

188
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,340
He just like had a bunch in his pockets

189
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,840
and like hey, here's, and it was like,

190
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,440
it was like a cold day too.

191
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,320
So like a warm pocket beer.

192
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,160
And work.

193
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,560
Now what's the doctor already?

194
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,160
What you got in trouble for was leaning out of the tram

195
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,520
when it was parked at the station

196
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,320
and drinking it like above your head,

197
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,240
like Steve Austin does pouring the beer

198
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
like a foot above your head.

199
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,320
And then crushing it.

200
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,160
And crushing it.

201
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah.

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
By a forehead.

203
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,280
Whipping it at a customer.

204
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,120
Yeah.

205
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,760
And yelling at everyone on the tram,

206
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,480
you're mine now bitches.

207
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,320
Wow.

208
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,640
One beer does that to you, huh?

209
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,320
Yeah, you're real lightweight.

210
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm a lightweight, what can I say?

211
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,800
Yeah, so we'll post some of these photos.

212
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
But anyway, Jason and I had a special little photo shoot.

213
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
Mark, have you had any fun shoots on a train?

214
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,800
Doesn't have to be Disneyland.

215
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,640
Shoots on a train?

216
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,960
My parents, well you went to the,

217
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,880
it wasn't a photo shoot,

218
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,520
but the first thing came to mind,

219
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,760
my parents, we were well,

220
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,440
I was like 16, my parents were like,

221
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,200
we're going to the Grand Canyon for vacation.

222
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,040
Like great.

223
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,780
But we took a train, like a fun train,

224
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,220
and then like it got, the train stopped,

225
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,900
and we got robbed.

226
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,740
Oh.

227
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,580
Like when Bandit showed up,

228
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,740
but my brother and I, we were like,

229
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,460
I was like 15 and he was like 17, 18.

230
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,780
And we were like, this is lame.

231
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,220
We were like not in the mood,

232
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,780
because like it was all children,

233
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,620
except for us and my parents.

234
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,540
So it didn't feel cool.

235
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,380
Right.

236
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,700
The only age is that age range where that,

237
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,940
you think all the theme park stuff is lame,

238
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,420
and then you grow out of it.

239
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,140
Yeah, you know, you get over yourself.

240
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,980
Yeah.

241
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,660
So there is, we were talking about how I've never seen

242
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,260
like the Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore,

243
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,100
all these famous things,

244
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,680
but you're saying there is some sort of themed.

245
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,700
There was some sort of, I don't know where we got,

246
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,860
cause we arrived at the Grand Canyon on this old timey train.

247
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,980
Like it looked like something out of like the old west.

248
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,180
Interesting.

249
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,640
So now I'm- Where do you take that from, I wonder?

250
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,660
I have no idea.

251
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,940
I was like, I wasn't paying attention.

252
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,580
I was busy being bitter.

253
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,420
Yeah, yeah.

254
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,240
Right.

255
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,540
You're on your- This is the same trip when the-

256
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,740
CD plate, you're on a Walkman.

257
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,260
Well also, this was when the Jeffrey Dahmer story broke.

258
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,420
So like on that vacation,

259
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,820
I was like dying for like that week's People Magazine.

260
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,860
So every time we stopped in like a drug store or anything,

261
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,620
I was looking for this People Magazine,

262
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,740
cause I wanted to know everything about Jeffrey Dahmer.

263
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,580
Wow.

264
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,300
And then also- If he was fighting in the Grand Canyon.

265
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,140
Maybe.

266
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,100
There's a bunch of drums down there.

267
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,100
And then also, Divinals, I Touched Myself was big.

268
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
What a trip we had.

269
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,620
What a specific.

270
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,060
Yeah, I don't know why I remember that.

271
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,060
I remember hearing that song in the car with my parents

272
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,140
when like, I just want to read my Jeffrey Dahmer magazine.

273
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,140
There is weird, songs do stick out of my head

274
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,300
on like family vacations.

275
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,660
Like when I went to Disney World, by the way,

276
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,660
by the Red Hot Chili Peppers was in heavy rotation.

277
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,500
And I just remember hearing it.

278
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,700
In your brain, you mean?

279
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,780
Yeah, sure.

280
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,620
I'm just saying I can remember certain songs

281
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,820
are like burned into like trips.

282
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,660
It's weird.

283
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,480
Yeah.

284
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,620
I remember going to grad night at Disneyland

285
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,580
and hearing ushers, yeah, constantly.

286
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,460
And I was like, hell no, not at my Disneyland.

287
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,620
Cause you don't want modern hip hop hits.

288
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,460
Cause they play one ain't you?

289
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,980
I want shit like the Grand Canyon,

290
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,180
that dopey music that's supposed to play.

291
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,180
Some ragtime.

292
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,020
Yeah.

293
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,260
I once took a, I was a junior high,

294
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,660
a friend of mine was in this church group

295
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,500
and I lived in San Jose and like, oh, we were going down.

296
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,140
I went along on their Disneyland trip

297
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,640
and we took a late night bus ride.

298
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
So like I left at like 10 at night.

299
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,900
We arrived at like six in the morning, whatever,

300
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,020
but someone had a boom box and they played MC Hammers,

301
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,500
please hammer, don't hurt him.

302
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,340
But the entire time the CD was on repeat.

303
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,900
So we heard it seven hours.

304
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,020
So that's what I said.

305
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,900
She fell asleep, but the boom box was still playing.

306
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,740
Wow.

307
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,580
Oh no.

308
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,900
The entire bus ride.

309
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,100
And also like, all right, you got, you can't touch this.

310
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,780
You may have got that prey song,

311
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,260
it's samples when doves cry.

312
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,100
Yeah.

313
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,920
The rest of the album.

314
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,760
Pretty forgettable.

315
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,700
Yeah. I would have to think.

316
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,980
I, I, I'm not sure I've ever heard another.

317
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,740
I was fond of too legit to quit.

318
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,820
Cause you got three hits.

319
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,700
You got Adam's groove to the,

320
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,580
the titular to be legit to quit.

321
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,660
And this is the way we roll.

322
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,740
We roll.

323
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,220
But first record kind of just a delivery mechanism

324
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,100
for the single.

325
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,940
Absolutely.

326
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,780
Calling out.

327
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,620
Ouch.

328
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,620
I think I can take much more of this.

329
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,620
I remember a trip to Orlando where in heavy rotation

330
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,060
were California Dreamin and Life is a Highway.

331
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,500
The original Life is a Highway.

332
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,460
I think because the one was in rotation at Mills

333
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,700
at Universal and the other was in rotation

334
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,420
of like the area soundtracks of the Hard Rock Hotel.

335
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,260
I thought.

336
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,220
And I just heard those a lot.

337
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,780
I was hoping that you were revealing

338
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,100
that you were really like 65 years old

339
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,780
and California Dreamin was sort of like on the radio

340
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,620
when you went down.

341
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,460
Oh yeah.

342
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,580
Summer of 69, Los Angeles.

343
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,460
The man says terrorized.

344
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,180
Yeah, the man says terrorized.

345
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,020
Keep an eye out for me in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood

346
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,060
coming this summer.

347
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,940
I don't want to sound too old

348
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,060
but there was a remake of Life is a Highway

349
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,060
or someone covered it.

350
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,620
Oh, it's a cover on the car soundtrack.

351
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,660
Rascal Flatts and Tom Cochran.

352
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,700
I know the Tom Cochran original, thank you.

353
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,020
Tom Cochran.

354
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,380
Also talk about music forgotten factoids.

355
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,220
Right, I don't know why I know that.

356
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,180
Where's the rest of that artist?

357
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,020
Where else did Tom Cochran do that?

358
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,020
Couldn't tell you who the seventh president is

359
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,700
but I know the original artist of Life is a Highway.

360
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,540
Mm-hmm.

361
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,500
Need a sec.

362
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,340
You okay?

363
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,540
Jason's, we'll cut this up.

364
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,940
Sorry.

365
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,100
Wrong pipe?

366
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,940
Yeah.

367
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,780
Okay.

368
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,780
Too excited about Tom Cochran.

369
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,380
I just got thinking about driving down that highway.

370
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,220
Life is a highway.

371
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,060
Life is a highway.

372
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,860
Mark, you, I mean we're talking about

373
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,940
the main Disneyland train today

374
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,540
but I know you're a fan of one of the other trains

375
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,540
at Disneyland because of your tat.

376
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,380
You got a cool tat.

377
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,220
I got a sick tat.

378
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,060
What's the tat?

379
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,220
I got a tattoo of the goat with a stick of dynamite

380
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,300
in its mouth from Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

381
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,140
Yay.

382
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,380
It's my favorite goat. It's great.

383
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,220
Thank you.

384
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,620
And it's like a, it is a really specific,

385
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,900
it's almost like the character,

386
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,900
super closeups that would start

387
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,140
like a Mickey or a Goofy shoot.

388
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,980
Right.

389
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,800
Because he's straight on.

390
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,340
It's an angle that you wouldn't get.

391
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,780
It's like not him in an action pose.

392
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,860
It's more of like his head shot.

393
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,420
It almost needs like a starburst behind.

394
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,620
I thought about adding like a starburst behind it.

395
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,460
Oh, absolutely.

396
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,280
A sunburst behind it.

397
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,120
Yeah.

398
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,180
Like a pork, or like a porky pig, loony jams.

399
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,300
Like when they come out of that thing.

401
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,660
Yeah, I just love, it's always, I had a,

402
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,660
my boyfriend at the time gave me a gift card for a tattoo

403
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,780
and I was like, I didn't know what,

404
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,740
I like sat on it for like months and months.

405
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,420
And then one time I was really stoned

406
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,660
and went on Splash Mountain.

407
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,700
And when I got off Splash Mountain,

408
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,140
we had planned to go on Big Thunder.

409
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,500
I was like, I gotta keep an eye out for that goat.

410
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,740
Because I always loved that goat.

411
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,980
So I was like, that's my tattoo I think.

412
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,540
And then I Googled it, made sure no one else had it.

413
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,740
I Googled goat dynamite tattoo, nothing.

414
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,580
Really?

415
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,400
Wow, interesting.

416
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,800
I clicked images.

417
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,780
If I were to Google it now, do you come up?

418
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,500
I don't know, I haven't Googled it since.

419
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,340
Interesting.

420
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,180
I hope so.

421
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,260
You haven't like heavily featured it in a tweet

422
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,460
or anything to like own it in an actual property way.

423
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,300
So many people think I'm like a Satanist or an Aries.

424
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,420
I am neither.

425
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,260
I have no problems with either.

426
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,340
Sure.

427
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,460
I could see it, yeah, like a goat with a dynamite.

428
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,580
It does seem like you're an anarchist or something maybe.

429
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,020
I just like that there's mischief ahead.

430
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,100
That's what I like about the goat.

431
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,500
From a storytelling standpoint, on the ride he tells you,

432
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,420
uh-oh, things are not going according to plan.

433
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,140
When goats are the dynamite.

434
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,980
Sure.

435
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,660
It's sort of a Jurassic Park moment.

436
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,260
Like nature is being reclaimed.

437
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,420
Nature finds a way, doesn't it?

438
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,260
It is also.

439
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,340
In a very stupider version.

440
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,700
Yeah, yeah, much so.

441
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,460
If I think about it, it is sort of implying

442
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,340
that maybe that goat is about to die.

443
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,140
Like the goat is gonna blow itself up.

444
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,980
Could be.

445
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,620
I like to think he drops it in someone's bathtub

446
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,140
and then scampers away.

447
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,380
He kills the humans and he's fine.

448
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,220
Yeah.

449
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,060
Got it.

450
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,900
That's better to think about.

451
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,940
But it's not sparking.

452
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,980
He could just eat it.

453
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,540
I mean, goats will eat anything.

454
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,740
He could just, once you turn the corner,

455
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,500
he could just consume it.

456
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,860
So he'll just die a slow painful death then.

457
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,700
Yeah.

458
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,220
But then he cans and stuff.

459
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,980
Like if you drink a bunch of detergent or something.

460
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,820
Sure.

461
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,300
It would happen to slowly your bowels would

462
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,380
kind of collapse.

463
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,260
But I also love, that's one of the reasons

464
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,140
I like the railroads,

465
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,260
because I like any ride with critters.

466
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,100
Oh yeah, sure.

467
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,940
I like that word.

468
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,380
So I'm very pro-critter.

469
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,220
Yay.

470
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,700
Are you, it's not that word.

471
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,900
Critter country, your favorite land in Disneyland?

472
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,740
It's not actually.

473
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,580
It's not.

474
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,420
Okay.

475
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,260
That means it.

476
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,100
That's fine.

477
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,580
I love the candy shop.

478
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,420
Yeah.

479
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,260
Great candy shop.

480
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,100
Once had the manager of the candy shop

481
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,100
flirt very heavily with my boyfriend and I at the time.

482
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,900
He gave us free peanut butter cookie thing.

483
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,460
The peanut butter, oh yeah.

484
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,020
The chocolate covered peanut butter graham cracker.

485
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,860
He just gave it to us guys.

486
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,700
That's a heavy flirt.

487
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,220
That's a heavy flirt.

488
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,420
So I married him.

489
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,340
It would be fun to find your partner in critter country.

490
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,460
Oh, that would make sense.

491
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,300
Yeah.

492
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,300
I mean for anybody too.

493
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,180
Like what a story in general.

494
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,900
I mean it's also, that could be the name of a gay bar,

495
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,740
critter country.

496
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,580
You know?

497
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,420
Sure, that's a good point.

498
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,260
That's where I would go.

499
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,700
I do like critter, I like the aesthetics of it.

500
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,340
Like I like things like buildings made of wood.

501
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,940
Like I like that whole west side of the frontier land.

502
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,180
You know, I love all that.

503
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,020
Yeah.

504
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,860
Big time.

505
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,680
Yeah.

506
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,780
I love the waterfall that's right next to the shops

507
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,940
and it's kind of between the shops and the Winnie the Pooh

508
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,780
ride.

509
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,620
Oh yeah.

510
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,260
I find that to be a nice little calm corner.

511
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,060
It's all the way in the corner of the park.

512
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,180
You gotta like make a point of going over there.

513
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,900
That's where Santa is though.

514
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,740
Oh really?

515
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,580
Is that where they do Santa?

516
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,420
Yeah, Santa is back there.

517
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,620
Santa is back there sorted by that meet and greet.

518
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,460
Yeah.

519
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,140
I mean it's where of course the country bears used to be.

520
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,740
I've never seen the country bears.

521
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,460
Wow, that's another podcast.

522
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,300
I'm sorry.

523
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,660
We can't.

524
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,460
But they're not critters, they're too big to be critters.

525
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,340
No, are they critters?

526
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,540
Critters have to be a little smaller.

527
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,100
I think critters are like the size of like

528
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,220
no bigger than a raccoon or like a fox.

529
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,780
Is a go to critter?

530
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,700
I'd say so.

531
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,980
Isn't that like a critter?

532
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,100
So you gotta make, you gotta say they're bigger.

533
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,940
I'm not sure.

534
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,420
I think maybe critters can't talk.

535
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,780
Or they can't know because critters sing in critter country.

536
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,140
They felt the need to change it

537
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,140
because it used to be bear country, right?

538
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,100
That part of the park.

539
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,460
And then it became critter country when more critters

540
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,060
moved in and the bears were executed.

541
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,260
Executed.

542
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,100
Shot in the back of the head.

543
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,260
The critters took over.

544
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,220
That's a good point that that definition,

545
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,060
that implies that bears are not critters.

546
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,140
Critters are vegetarians?

547
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,180
Or you can eat grubs.

548
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,020
You can eat nuts or whatever.

549
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,820
You can eat nuts and grubs.

550
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,620
I'm sure a listener now is screaming at their podcast.

551
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,460
Whatever they listen.

552
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,300
What defines a critter?

553
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,620
They know exactly what a critter is.

554
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,460
So tell us please.

555
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,980
Well critters are defined in a different way

556
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,300
in the film critters.

557
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,420
But I don't think, I think that is a different,

558
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,500
it's a different entomology.

559
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
No, Michael Iser wanted a critter's land.

560
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,340
It just didn't happen.

561
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,020
It was gonna be in the beastly kingdom, the unfiltered.

562
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,780
The animal kingdom.

563
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,660
The property he's kicking himself he didn't get.

564
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,500
All this, oh go ahead.

565
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,300
I was gonna do an Eisner, talk about critters.

566
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,140
It's not worth it.

567
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,980
It's not worth it.

568
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,820
You go ahead.

569
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,460
Well all this talk about definitions

570
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,700
had me thinking about something involving today's topic.

571
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,500
I learned reading about this,

572
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,180
the difference between trains and locomotives.

573
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,180
Colloquially I think they're kind of used interchangeably,

574
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,380
but the locomotive is that front car with the engine

575
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,380
or the boiler that generates the force to pull the train,

576
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,820
which is the series of interconnected cars.

577
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,100
It seems like though train could also refer

578
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,740
to the whole kitten caboodle.

579
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,180
The cars being pulled and the locomotive pulling it.

580
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,340
Oh, so a locomotive can't be a train,

581
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,140
but a train can have a locomotive in it.

582
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,500
I think that's right.

583
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,660
Like a caboose just can't be a train.

584
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,020
No, that's just a car.

585
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,540
That's just a train car.

586
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,380
Hell no.

587
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,060
Not on my watch.

588
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,420
Get out of here you stinking cabooses.

589
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,620
And I'm excited to see if this whole episode

590
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,940
brings out the people who really like trains.

591
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,300
Well I'm sure they're all very reasonable folks

592
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,420
who are just like easy breezy going,

593
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,140
let's get some facts wrong, but whatever.

594
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,980
Absolutely.

595
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,460
Sure as hell a level of train knowledge

596
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,260
is gonna satisfy a hardcore train head.

597
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,300
I did watch. Is a monorail a train?

598
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,180
Interesting.

599
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,740
Of the future.

600
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,380
Now that's a good question because for a long time

601
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,820
the roundhouse where the trains and locomotives are parked

602
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,660
also serviced the monorail.

603
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,300
The original roundhouse that serviced both

604
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,300
has been demolished and I think other stuff rebuilt since.

605
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,860
So where do they go now?

606
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,220
A different roundhouse.

607
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,060
Wow.

608
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,180
Some of the history of this attraction is very dry.

609
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,620
Train facts are dry?

610
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,460
No.

611
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,820
I do.

612
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,540
I mean listeners will know I love riding the train.

613
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,620
Yeah.

614
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,460
I love trains.

615
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,300
I love riding the train.

616
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,140
I have looked into and I'm thinking of like,

617
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,740
oh maybe next time I go back east

618
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,300
I will take the train back.

619
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,420
I will get a sleeper car and do that.

620
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,460
Nowadays you have to change,

621
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,180
you probably had to do this back in the day too.

622
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,020
I think it's like three trains to get to

623
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,700
Harrisburg, I would probably take it not,

624
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,220
get off before Philadelphia but it's like LA to Chicago,

625
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,980
Chicago to somewhere else, somewhere else to Harrisburg.

626
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,540
Can you give us the full route

627
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,140
and look up some times that they might be leaving?

628
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,620
But I'm just thinking about,

629
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,500
I've always wanted to eat a sleeper to sleeper car

630
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,740
and just see the country by train.

631
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,060
That's nice, you should.

632
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,100
What's stopping you?

633
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,300
Take a big train ride.

634
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,180
It's not that much more than like flying back.

635
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,860
I mean it takes four days about.

636
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,300
What are some other reasons?

637
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,900
What are some other reasons you would do it?

638
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,220
Oh it just seems nice.

639
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,500
Jason's top 19 things about trains.

640
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,780
I hear you meet some real interesting characters

641
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,020
who will talk to you about why they don't like flying

642
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,780
but they do like trains.

643
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,020
Because they're deeply neurotic probably.

644
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,740
I would think unless there's, yeah,

645
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,660
maybe there are conspiracy theorists on the train

646
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,620
that could tell you some fun conspiracy theories

647
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,780
about planes.

648
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,860
Oh yeah like radiation kind of stuff.

649
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,940
Something like that. Chemtrails.

650
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,580
That weird Boeing fix in the news a lot.

651
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,260
Let me ask Jason and then I'll throw this out to everyone.

652
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,420
As a child or now, did you have a conductor's hat

653
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
and a train whistle?

654
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,460
Didn't have a train whistle.

655
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,420
My parents were pretty good about tricking us into not,

656
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,260
like pushing us towards non-noisy toys.

657
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,620
I don't think I was a child.

658
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,740
I think I had some like kazoos.

659
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,540
How about the hat though?

660
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,740
That's what I'm really looking forward to here.

661
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,660
I feel like there had to have been a conductor's hat.

662
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,380
I feel like maybe.

663
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,700
Because we went to a lot of,

664
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,580
I feel like there was,

665
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,940
Strasburg, Pennsylvania has a historic train museum

666
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,940
and exhibits and stuff.

667
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,940
And a short steam locomotive circuit that you can ride back.

668
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,540
Why'd you move here then?

669
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,380
Yeah, sounds like heaven on earth.

670
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,860
Well to see Travel Town, which I still haven't been to.

671
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,060
Oh go to Travel Town, it's free and fun.

672
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,900
You get your fix.

673
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,860
There's this wonderful thing called Travel Town

674
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,700
that's very close to the Disney lot

675
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,700
where he almost built his original little train park.

676
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,740
And apparently he was talking to the city of Burbank

677
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,260
about how can I connect.

678
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,180
They were trying to figure out,

679
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,980
they were on the way to building Travel Town

680
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,460
and Walt reached out, can there be a big train

681
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,260
that connects to where I'm building a train?

682
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,020
Yeah, there's a ton of connections with the train

683
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,100
and Disney and Travel Town and the LA Live steamers,

684
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,300
which they have a bunch of old trains there.

685
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,100
Walt was inspired by some of those train cars of like,

686
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,980
oh let's make ours look like this.

687
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,420
And then the Carrollwood Society is over there.

688
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,460
The Carrollwood barn that Walt built in his backyard

689
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,060
was preserved and is in Griffith Park

690
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,380
and open one day a month.

691
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,900
And they have a lot of the original miniatures

692
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,860
Disney had in his backyard.

693
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,220
Now that I have not done

694
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,820
and I probably should have done before this podcast.

695
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,500
Yikes.

696
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,540
I wanna make sure we've covered

697
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,060
everybody's childhood hats though.

698
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,580
Yeah, that's what I would have to get back to.

699
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,220
Scott, yes, train hat?

700
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,220
No train hat.

701
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,900
Whistle?

702
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,820
No whistle.

703
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,540
I think I liked Travel Town a lot

704
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,300
because I grew up around here, but I had no other.

705
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,780
I didn't have any take home train affinity.

706
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,580
What I did do at home was I had a little raft

707
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,260
that will inflatable raft in the pool

708
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,540
that was themed after the jungle cruise.

709
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,540
And I would do little mini jungle cruises for my sister

710
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,740
and I'd be the skipper.

711
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,860
And I'd leave toy animals around.

712
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,500
I'd put a snake in the pool filter area.

713
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,500
That's cute.

714
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,900
Yeah, and there were kinda like rocks surrounding my pool.

715
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,260
So I pretended like they were little caves and stuff.

716
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,300
I liked that raft a lot.

717
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,700
I remember it having a cool design.

718
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,340
That's my observation.

719
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,820
I had a raft with a cool design.

720
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,660
Cool design.

721
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,620
I'm not bragging.

722
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,220
Mark, hat, whistle?

723
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,860
No hat, yes whistle.

724
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,700
Really?

725
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,540
I'm in the boat too.

726
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,540
I've been to, Sacramento has a great railroad museum.

727
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,940
You get to walk into a dining car.

728
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,100
There's no food.

729
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,300
But you get to see how people used to ride the rails.

730
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
It's a real hoot.

731
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,340
There's one part you could walk underneath the train

732
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,940
that's very scary.

733
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,900
Cause you're walking underneath the engine.

734
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,580
Oh, interesting.

735
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,460
You're like, oh, this thing is so heavy.

736
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,100
I would just be turned into a puddle if this fell on me.

737
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,940
Oh, sure.

738
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,100
It's like elevated mass, but with a train.

739
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,940
That exhibit at LACMA.

740
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,660
The big rock at Los Angeles art museum.

741
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,020
You mean the big rock.

742
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,980
The rock one.

743
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

744
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,300
So I love a train also though.

745
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,700
What a hoot.

746
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,540
Literally a hoot.

747
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,820
I'm trying to think.

748
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,620
I said no hat, but now that I'm thinking about it,

749
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,380
I may have had a hat.

750
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,660
I had bandanas.

751
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,860
I had for sure a bandana.

752
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,420
I feel like there's a picture of me.

753
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,260
Now I'm thinking it might be a different kid.

754
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,140
I may have been tricker.

755
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,860
I'm thinking of a photo specifically.

756
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,300
I'm thinking that there's a different kid

757
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,660
with a conductor's hat and a bandana.

758
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,140
I don't think hat for me, but for sure whistle.

759
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,980
You got it.

760
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,820
For sure whistle.

761
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,260
Are you thinking of a milk carton?

762
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,140
No, I'm not.

763
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,620
There was a kid's trick or treating.

764
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,860
A kid had a conductor's hat.

765
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,780
It was not me though.

766
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,020
I think I was Oscar the Grouch.

767
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,620
Hey, that's neat.

768
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,740
You were jealous of that train.

769
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,660
You didn't know costumes could be so cool

770
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,580
until you saw that conductor kid.

771
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,100
I think I thought trains were boring as a kid.

772
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,140
I think maybe I still do.

773
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,580
It's a real flipping attitude.

774
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,700
You could list, as Jason is doing,

775
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,220
you're listing cool train things,

776
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,540
and then my counter is just like,

777
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,140
I don't know, it's boring.

778
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,660
It's like a dumb opinion to have,

779
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,900
but I liked any mode of transportation

780
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,340
that was just different than a car.

781
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,380
My favorite thing, the St. Louis Arch,

782
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,220
have you ever been in that?

783
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,060
Oh, I've taken that.

784
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,540
Those little round spheres,

785
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,300
they go up and then left, up and then left, up.

786
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,980
It feels like you're taking a shuttlecraft.

787
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,540
Inside the St. Louis Arch?

788
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,380
That takes you up to the top.

789
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,220
Yeah, you're in these little round elevators.

790
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,340
I didn't think I knew you could go in there.

791
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,180
Oh yeah.

792
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,660
Yeah, there's an observation deck at the top.

793
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,820
Oh, terrifying.

794
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,580
But isn't it just, are there windows in the arch?

795
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,900
Yeah, there's like four windows.

796
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,740
What?

797
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,540
I feel like I've only pictured stone.

798
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,900
It's like the Washington Monument.

799
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,140
No, in some ways, the elevator ride's the best part.

800
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,780
You can also go in that.

801
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,540
You can go in the Washington Monument.

802
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,500
Yeah. Yeah.

803
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,820
Are there windows in it?

804
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,180
Yeah, did you see Spider-Man homecoming?

805
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,500
He saved his friends.

806
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,340
No.

807
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,340
Boy, I don't know anything about our monuments.

808
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,180
Wow.

809
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,420
And when I drove across country to move out here,

810
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,140
I did the, you could buy a combo ticket.

811
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,580
We got there just in time because it was about to like,

812
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,540
the last ones for the day were ending,

813
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,860
where you got to ride a riverboat up and down the Mississippi

814
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,020
and then also go in the arch.

815
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,820
The Mississippi at that point, muddy and disgusting.

816
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,420
And you get to see it from a boat

817
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,300
and from above equally muddy.

818
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,580
And did you know you can go inside

819
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,260
of Thomas Jefferson's head on Mount Rushmore

820
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,500
and look through his eyes?

821
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,700
That's available to you too.

822
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,500
I know that one's not true.

823
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,380
And Washington's mouth is a slide.

824
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,740
You got to spit out the bottom.

825
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,580
It's a big tongue.

826
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,420
Yeah.

827
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,500
You just fall to your death?

828
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,580
Yeah.

829
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,820
Mike has a pad down there.

830
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,660
Oh, okay.

831
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,100
It was a crash pad.

832
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,060
But you drop like 300 feet per fight.

833
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,900
That's terrifying.

834
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,460
It's a taller pad than a normal pad.

835
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,460
Oh, I love a tall pad.

836
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,300
Yeah.

837
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,020
It'll get you, don't worry.

838
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,260
Mike is recalling when he saw pictures

839
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,980
from the filming of North by Northwest.

840
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,820
Sure.

841
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,540
His brain is as muddy as the Mississippi.

842
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,740
The old Mississippi.

843
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,180
Mm-hmm.

844
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,220
So yeah, as a kid, I think trains for me, boring.

845
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,780
No offense, but I wasn't, I now really like,

846
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,260
I'm not some insane train person,

847
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,100
but I like riding the train.

848
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,380
I think it's fun.

849
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,340
It harkens back to an old time transportation.

850
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,180
It's nice.

851
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,020
I like all that stuff.

852
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,540
But as a kid, it was like,

853
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,660
I don't want to ride the train.

854
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,820
Space Mountain, please.

855
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,820
Like fast, cool space.

856
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,820
Go on the Disney train.

857
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,740
I did, I think, but it's not a memory

858
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,460
I cherish as a kid in Orlando.

859
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,860
Well, the Disney World one is a lot simpler.

860
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,180
That's, yes, that's also true.

861
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,020
It is more practical, I think.

862
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,540
I mean, the trains are good for getting

863
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,580
to the other side of the park,

864
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,100
especially in Florida, where it's much bigger.

865
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,860
I think it was many years before I went

866
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,500
on the Disneyland train actually

867
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,580
and realized there was cool stuff on it.

868
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,420
I don't think, I think it was many years

869
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,260
into going to Disneyland before I even made that loop

870
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,100
to see all the fun stuff.

871
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,940
It's also one of those things,

872
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,860
once you get older, like, oh, I just,

873
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,980
I would love a good sit.

874
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,820
Oh yeah.

875
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,660
It's like a nice 20 minutes.

876
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,620
And also the people watching is great.

877
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,460
Yeah.

878
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,220
You get a nice aerial view of the park,

879
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,340
especially like towards the background,

880
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,020
Toontown and stuff.

881
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,980
I like to get on at New Orleans Square

882
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,860
and get off on Main Street.

883
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,700
Oh yeah.

884
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
That gets you most of it.

885
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,500
There's nothing in between Main Street

886
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,340
and New Orleans Square.

887
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,460
You see some like Mardi Gras heads, that's about it.

888
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,740
And there is one Jaguar.

889
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,580
Right.

890
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,460
And it's built up by the narration.

891
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,100
So be careful in Adventureland.

892
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,460
You don't know what could be around,

893
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,060
lurking around any corner.

894
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,700
And then it's one still Jaguar.

895
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,540
A statue.

896
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,380
Yes.

897
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,980
A false Jaguar.

898
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,020
That's a good route.

899
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,860
Yeah.

900
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,380
I've never thought about what a favorite one is for me.

901
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,540
That's definitely a, I like the,

902
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,180
I think I like New Orleans Square Station the most

903
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,540
besides the main one.

904
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,380
Yeah.

905
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,420
I think that's the best one.

906
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,620
That's a good one too.

907
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,780
This isn't very far,

908
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,980
but taking that up to Fantasyland

909
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,220
can save you a lot of walking

910
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,420
because it's up at the north part of the park.

911
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,060
And also you end with the big finish.

912
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,660
You end with the dioramas, with the Grand Canyon

913
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,100
and the dinosaurs.

914
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,300
You might have picked the best route

915
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,220
if you're not gonna do a full circle.

916
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,780
That's a pretty good one.

917
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,820
The Grand Circle Tour.

918
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,660
Slightly less than a full circle.

919
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,900
I do like doing a three-quarters circle.

920
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,500
I like doing the Grand Circle Tour

921
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,180
and then I get off where I wanna go.

922
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,060
What do you mean?

923
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,660
You like go all the way around once,

924
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,460
do the Grand Circle Tour

925
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,980
and then get off at New Orleans Square or Toontown Station.

926
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,380
Okay, so you're using it, you get a full ride.

927
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,220
I get a full ride.

928
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,260
You get the full fun ride

929
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,100
and then you use it as a practical thing.

930
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,580
And then I get to where I need to go.

931
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,420
Interesting.

932
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,260
Really?

933
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,100
I don't think I've ever done that.

934
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,020
You stick, you loop around more than.

935
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,900
I think that's what I did the last time I was there.

936
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,060
I've never done that.

937
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,900
I like it.

938
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,380
I love going through Splash Mountain.

939
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,220
Sure, yes.

940
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,780
Yeah, and of course the Grand Canyon,

941
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,260
which I didn't realize until researching this episode,

942
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,460
the Grand Canyon came first

943
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,980
and then after the World's Fair ended,

944
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,540
they moved the dinosaurs from Ford's Magic Skyway.

945
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,860
They moved that scene next to it.

946
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,540
I also didn't know that.

947
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,340
So, yeah.

948
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,180
If you, if you.

949
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,020
If you were.

950
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,860
I know what I did.

951
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,100
That's just a fact.

952
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
I was just trying to, I wrote down all these facts.

953
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,900
No, no, no, no, no, I actually, I did,

954
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,740
that sounded weird.

955
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,660
I did find that interesting.

956
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,500
Yeah.

957
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,980
Yeah, the Grand Canyon was there in like 1958.

958
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,060
I think what's weird about it

959
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,380
is that it's presented as one full experience.

960
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,820
This, by the way, it's possible you're listening to this

961
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
and you've not been to Disneyland

962
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,460
or you don't even know that thing is there

963
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,620
because Disney World doesn't have this.

964
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,980
No, no.

965
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,940
Disneyland Paris does not have anything special

966
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,620
on the train, but I didn't know also

967
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,500
until researching Tokyo Disneyland

968
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,700
does have Primeval World.

969
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,460
There is one other Primeval World.

970
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,300
I missed it.

971
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,140
On the train.

972
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,780
I missed that too in Tokyo.

973
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,500
Yep, yeah, guess you did.

974
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,740
I may have as well, but maybe now

975
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,100
I gotta do it.

976
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,100
But the, anyway, if you get on at Tomorrowland

977
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
or anywhere before it,

978
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,500
anywhere approaching the Main Street station,

979
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,820
it's this really fun grand finale

980
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,180
where you see some cool dioramas.

981
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,780
One is mainly a diorama with some animatronics

982
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,700
and then you go back in time

983
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,580
to the kingdom of the dinosaurs.

984
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,580
And I think my takeaway thinking about Grand Canyon diorama

985
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,540
and Primeval World for a while,

986
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,940
there's always been a disconnect to me

987
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,660
that they presented like you are in the past

988
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,980
of the Grand Canyon.

989
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,900
Is that what's going on?

990
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,540
It seems like it.

991
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,180
But now we take you to millions of years ago.

992
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,220
But are you, but you don't see canyons really.

993
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,300
I thought it started, you see Grand Canyon

994
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,620
as it is now and then you go back in time.

995
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,780
No, that's correct.

996
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,780
But in that transition, are we time traveling

997
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,500
somewhere else or is it like back to the future

998
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,580
where you travel in the same physical space?

999
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,820
Oh, I never thought about it, I don't know.

1000
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,420
Because is that, yeah, is the dinosaurs,

1001
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,260
are they in the Grand Canyon in the past?

1002
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,460
Well, they don't show the Grand Canyon.

1003
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,300
They don't.

1004
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,620
Maybe it's just not formed yet.

1005
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,460
Are they implying?

1006
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,660
Oh, maybe, maybe it's pre-canyon.

1007
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,620
Pre-canyon?

1008
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,180
Are they implying the asteroid?

1009
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,340
The asteroid made the canyon.

1010
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,180
That is shoddy science.

1011
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,060
It's erosion made the canyon.

1012
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,900
Mmm.

1013
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,740
Mmm.

1014
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,580
Mmm.

1015
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,140
Not every school child knows that.

1016
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,460
There's a river.

1017
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,300
All right.

1018
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,940
There's layers of sediment.

1019
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,500
It would be fun though if the asteroid did it.

1020
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,220
Very strange strike.

1021
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,700
Yeah, that's all over the map.

1022
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,540
That's not a big round hole.

1023
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,660
Maybe it bounced around a lot.

1024
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,380
This asteroid needs to get its act together.

1025
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,100
It's pretty goofy.

1026
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,940
It's like a...

1027
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,900
It's a crazy hole, you mean.

1028
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,140
Disney history, that's a little bit,

1029
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,820
it's like the Inglorious Bastards history

1030
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,220
where Hitler got killed.

1031
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,780
Right, that didn't happen?

1032
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,620
It's a flight of fancy.

1033
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,620
Yeah, apparently it didn't.

1034
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,460
I'm surprised to learn that too.

1035
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,380
I wonder if he's gonna do something

1036
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,860
in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood

1037
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,180
if Manson gets shot in a bank or something.

1038
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,620
I do feel like that is gonna happen

1039
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,180
in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

1040
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,020
Like some false...

1041
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,980
Sharon Tate lives in Manson.

1042
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,820
Oh.

1043
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,780
Something weird like that.

1044
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,620
That'd be cool.

1045
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,460
We'll see.

1046
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,740
Hmm.

1047
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,620
Can we also incorporate that the asteroid

1048
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,180
was a fireball that Zeus threw or something?

1049
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,220
Oh, from Hercules?

1050
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,060
Yeah, yeah.

1051
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,900
Oh yeah.

1052
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,660
He's up in Greek heaven.

1053
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,100
I'm showing also how much I know about mythology.

1054
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,780
He was mad at somebody and he threw a lightning bolt

1055
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,260
and then turned into a comet that killed the dinosaurs

1056
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,700
and formed the Grand Canyon.

1057
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,700
Is it a character from Disney's Hercules as well?

1058
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,980
I guess we're talking Disney, so we might as well, yes.

1059
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,820
Let's tie it into that.

1060
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,860
All right, that makes sense to me.

1061
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,100
Rip, torn, wait, who was Zeus?

1062
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,780
James Woods, of course, Hades.

1063
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,780
That's Danny DeVito, the other one.

1064
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,620
The sidekick.

1065
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,740
Rip, torn was somebody.

1066
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,580
Was he?

1067
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,660
Was Rip, Jason, are you looking it up?

1068
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,980
I'm looking it up.

1069
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,020
Rip, torn.

1070
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,140
People are screaming right now.

1071
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,500
It keeps happening.

1072
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,340
Locomotive.

1073
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,860
Just yell train.

1074
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,980
Well, doesn't matter, we'll figure it out.

1075
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,500
Just interrupt any sentence.

1076
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,540
Horde.

1077
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,380
In the middle.

1078
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,420
Rip, torn was Zeus.

1079
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,340
There's a great lightning strike effect.

1080
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,180
Oh yeah, it's great.

1081
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,020
On the diorama.

1082
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,860
Yeah, yes.

1083
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,660
Very effective. That's kind of new.

1084
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,140
Because they just redid the diorama,

1085
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,860
they made them pretty, plus them up, I guess.

1086
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,700
Yeah.

1087
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,100
There's very striking, beautiful dioramas.

1088
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,340
There's a storm in the background.

1089
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,460
Yeah, that new stuff.

1090
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,940
There's a bunch of pterodactyls swirling.

1091
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,780
Pterodactyls, very scary.

1092
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,140
Children do not like them, so I think they're great.

1093
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,100
Have you witnessed that?

1094
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Like kids freaking out a little.

1095
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,460
It's also one of the few rides,

1096
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,740
and also another I love any ride with quitters,

1097
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,300
and any ride that has pitch darkness in it.

1098
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,820
I feel like pitch darkness, like in our highly,

1099
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,620
everyone loves to sue everybody.

1100
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,940
It feels like so dangerous.

1101
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,820
There's something edgy about taking the mass public

1102
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,940
into pitch darkness to me.

1103
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,100
Like it feels like it seems like dangerous in a way.

1104
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,700
Like, ooh, this is like a real old timey thrill.

1105
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,900
And enclosed spaces.

1106
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,700
Yeah, seatbelted in.

1107
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,380
No, anything can happen.

1108
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,220
So like, yeah, you could switch positions.

1109
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,140
Rip toward a Zeus.

1110
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,980
Rip toward a Zeus.

1111
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,420
Oh, thank God, thank God.

1112
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,740
Good pulse, guys.

1113
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,980
Jason Sheridan with a breaking news alert.

1114
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,500
Return is Zeus.

1115
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,100
Both the motor and the engine trains,

1116
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,580
the cars are the whole thing.

1117
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,260
In spring, as of spring 2019, rip torn.

1118
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,100
Zeus.

1119
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,740
But back to your regular-

1120
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,580
Columbia Gorge is what they call the new thing.

1121
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,260
When you talk about lawsuits,

1122
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,180
and people bumping around and stuff,

1123
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,020
my favorite thing that I found in my research

1124
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,940
was that in the early days of the Disneyland Railroad,

1125
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,820
they had cars that were themed after cattle cars.

1126
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,660
And so, you know, there were no seats.

1127
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,220
They're just like, it's big planks,

1128
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,100
like you're keeping animals in a pen.

1129
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,380
And so you're like, okay, so there were like a couple cars

1130
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,900
that passengers didn't get on, they were just themed

1131
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,900
as if there were livestock in there.

1132
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,900
No, Walt put people, guests could go in the cattle cars

1133
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,980
where there were no seats or restraints of any kind.

1134
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,300
And specifically, old Imagineer and animator Ward Kimball,

1135
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,220
who is a train enthusiast like Walt,

1136
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,820
said, hey, that's weird, don't you think?

1137
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,180
Maybe that's not safe to have people

1138
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,780
just standing on a train.

1139
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,260
And he's like, no, I want people to feel like they're cattle.

1140
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,900
Well, mission accomplished.

1141
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,060
In a lot of ways in Disneyland.

1142
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,660
Space Mountain Lion, geez.

1143
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,500
Yeah, yeah.

1144
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,860
I also, I came across a crazy thing

1145
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,740
from like the opening month,

1146
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,740
within a week of Disneyland's opening on July 17th, 1955,

1147
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,180
a brake man pulled the switch

1148
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,540
connecting the Disneyland Railroad's main line

1149
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,980
with a siding at Main Street USA,

1150
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,540
station too soon as the Retlaw 2,

1151
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,820
they called them Retlaw 1 and 2, the original trains.

1152
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,140
And what's Retlaw?

1153
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,540
That is Walter Backward.

1154
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,260
Walter Backward's Retlaw.

1155
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,500
Yeah, really laying it on thick.

1156
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,260
That's the kind of thing that I saw in books as a kid

1157
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,500
and thought, that is so clever.

1158
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,340
And then I go tell my fellow students,

1159
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,740
don't you think that's clever?

1160
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,500
And they would turn and walk away.

1161
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,700
As my childhood.

1162
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,100
So we pulled the brake too soon.

1163
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
The caboose at the end of the freight train

1164
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,980
had not fully made it across the switch when it was pulled.

1165
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,540
And as a result, the caboose's front set of wheels

1166
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,820
traveled, like basically jumped the tracks,

1167
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,220
traveled along the main line towards the passenger's chain,

1168
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,980
swung to the side, colliding with a concrete slab

1169
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,780
and derailing on impact.

1170
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,340
During the ensuing commotion,

1171
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:39,980
the erring brake man, presumably to avoid disciplinary action,

1172
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,180
quietly left the scene, exited the park

1173
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,700
and was not seen again.

1174
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,500
So this guy disappeared.

1175
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,980
He got the first ghost in him.

1176
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,820
He ghosted him.

1177
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,660
Yeah.

1178
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,700
Anyway, I was trying to read that

1179
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,660
and got very confused reading that.

1180
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,300
But basically, yeah, the brake man disappeared into a crowd

1181
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,700
never to be heard from again.

1182
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,700
What year was that?

1183
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,900
That was 55.

1184
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
That was within the opening month.

1185
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,420
Wow.

1186
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,220
When you could do that, when you could disappear

1187
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,300
and start life afresh.

1188
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,780
Right, start a new name.

1189
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,620
Good old days.

1190
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,460
Yeah.

1191
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,340
Like Mad Men, Don Draper style.

1192
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,740
Yeah. Exactly, yeah.

1193
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,540
Now people would find you.

1194
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,860
I've said multiple times before,

1195
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,860
have I dreamed about driving east from Los Angeles

1196
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,740
until I run out of gas and starting life anew?

1197
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,540
Yes, many times.

1198
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,380
Will I do it?

1199
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,260
You get to like Arizona?

1200
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,580
Yeah, Arizona, maybe even still in California.

1201
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,940
Who knows?

1202
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,660
Who knows what adventures await?

1203
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,940
Don't just do it, derail a train first.

1204
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,780
Yeah, go for it.

1205
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,740
I mean, that's, yeah, that is good.

1206
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,940
You know, if we're going back into the history of the thing,

1207
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,100
not that we have to be super detailed in all this,

1208
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,100
but okay, Disneyland really exists because of the train.

1209
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,460
That's what's important about the train.

1210
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:00,700
It was that Walt got into model railroads

1211
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,580
and he started thinking, is there some place

1212
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,220
that I could put up a train and have people come ride it

1213
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,140
and have dads and kids and moms all hang out together?

1214
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,260
So it's so crucial to the DNA of the park.

1215
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,340
And it grew out of him having a train in his backyard,

1216
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,700
which was the Carrollwood Pacific Railroad.

1217
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,620
Which he had because he was a polo enthusiast

1218
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,180
and suffered too many polo injuries.

1219
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,660
So he had to find a new.

1220
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,180
A doctor suggested a safer hobby,

1221
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,100
and that's why Disneyland exists,

1222
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,900
because Walt got fucked up.

1223
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,180
People are so weird.

1224
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,140
Polo is an insane sport.

1225
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,980
Yeah.

1226
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,940
Horses and clubs.

1227
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,780
Oh, it's that one.

1228
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,620
That's what polo is.

1229
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,220
Yeah, you're swinging, whacking hard balls while on a horse.

1230
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,980
Because Walt had, what a fun,

1231
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,820
I mean, it's not funny if you had to live with it,

1232
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,780
but what a funny ailment where he'd be like,

1233
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,580
ah, my polo injury's acting up.

1234
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,500
Because that's what would happen.

1235
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,180
That's written about in many a biography of Walt Disney

1236
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,500
is old polo injury.

1237
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,620
That comes up, really?

1238
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,540
Yeah, we were talking about it a little bit with the crafts

1239
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,060
when we were at Club 33.

1240
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,380
He was talking about Walt's old polo injury.

1241
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,220
Oh, right.

1242
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,540
And he was quizzing waitresses on Walt's polo injury

1243
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,380
and his nurse.

1244
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,820
Because he had a nurse.

1245
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,660
Yes.

1246
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,340
And the theory was that there was something going on.

1247
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,660
Right, right, right.

1248
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,940
But the polo injury, I think it looms large

1249
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,300
in his history in general.

1250
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,140
So then I imagine Walt had an old smoking doctor

1251
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,780
who was like, I don't know, take up trains, maybe?

1252
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,180
Just do something different.

1253
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,940
What else do rich people do?

1254
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,780
Trains.

1255
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,380
First things first, keep drinking.

1256
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,460
Yeah, right.

1257
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,860
Smoking, smoking, of course, yeah, keep at it.

1258
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,500
A lot of butter on your steak.

1259
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,260
They were drinking in the doctor's office too, I assume.

1260
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,900
He had a little bar over weblogger.

1261
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,740
Big bottles of chili.

1262
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,580
Yeah.

1263
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,900
So anyway, so.

1264
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,540
I went back to the polo.

1265
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,140
Polo too dangerous.

1266
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,660
But remember, diet custards.

1267
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,900
Stick to diet custards.

1268
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,740
Yeah.

1269
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,740
In all, I just got that big Disneyland history book

1270
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,540
and I've seen pictures like this before,

1271
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,900
but there's a lot of pictures of Walt in a tiny train

1272
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,300
with the hat on with his kids going around.

1273
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,900
He was way into this.

1274
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,060
My neighbor growing up, he was a British guy,

1275
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,780
he had in his garage a train set that would lower

1276
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,260
from the ceiling of the garage

1277
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,260
and take up the whole two-car garage.

1278
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,180
He built this whole mechanism himself.

1279
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,260
So there's something about,

1280
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,780
I don't know what it is about like older,

1281
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,620
when you get older, you wanna play with,

1282
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,300
you wanna be master of a domain or something, I don't know.

1283
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,140
What is this?

1284
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,140
Psychologically.

1285
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,260
Yeah, is it like a God complex?

1286
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,100
Is it a, you're trying to like.

1287
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,220
Maybe we're like, I have, my life is chaos,

1288
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,460
but at least this has order.

1289
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,940
This makes sense.

1290
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,860
It's like a Reverend Lovejoy's trains on the Simpsons.

1291
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,780
Bobby Bockela too on The Sopranos.

1292
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,060
That's like a later Sopranos thing,

1293
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,740
is Bobby's love of trains.

1294
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,580
Right.

1295
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,660
My great uncle got me a train set for Christmas as a kid

1296
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,020
and it was very hard to put up.

1297
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,460
And I didn't know, I thought it was fun

1298
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,300
to make a little track and then send them around,

1299
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,940
but I think I put it together maybe twice and that was it.

1300
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,780
Yeah.

1301
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,420
So I'm trying to think like now that I'm an older person

1302
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,460
and I collect many a toy,

1303
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,420
would I, if I had room, would I have a train set?

1304
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,900
A train going around?

1305
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,540
I'm not sure, I don't know.

1306
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,940
I think there's a meditative quality to it,

1307
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,780
like setting up the tracks and the little buildings

1308
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,420
and the trains and if you're painting,

1309
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,140
I mean, once you get to painting miniatures,

1310
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,860
that's a next level sort of thing.

1311
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,580
But anyone who is mechanically,

1312
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:54,460
like my stepdad is an engineer and he,

1313
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,900
yeah, he likes train stuff.

1314
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,340
He has a train set up in his basement

1315
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,260
and yeah, likes going to museums, this sort of thing.

1316
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,300
I think he doesn't really work on cars though.

1317
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,100
I think there might also be people who like tinker with cars

1318
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,540
and like train stuff is kind of adjacent to that.

1319
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,580
So.

1320
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,660
It's like they all got a touch of that welcome to Marwin.

1321
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,500
Yeah.

1322
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,340
You know?

1323
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,460
They're all processing something.

1324
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,300
Yeah, it's like that.

1325
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,100
It's a world where you didn't get beaten up

1326
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,100
and you don't have bad war memories.

1327
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,180
Yeah.

1328
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,060
Janelle Monáe loves you.

1329
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,700
But I think if you are inclined to taking stuff apart

1330
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:44,380
and putting stuff together, like the train thing.

1331
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,380
I was never into like die cast.

1332
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,420
I remember the first time my dad got me a,

1333
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,460
like a, there was like a car on a box

1334
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,780
and like, oh cool, like my Batmobile toy.

1335
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,180
No, this one you put together yourself and you paint it.

1336
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,020
Oh right.

1337
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,500
And he took out that little particular paint

1338
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,420
with the tiny brush and that smelled really crazy

1339
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,780
and I just totally glazed over.

1340
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,620
I don't want to put my toy together.

1341
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,740
Are you crazy?

1342
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,260
I think I had a Batmobile model

1343
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,100
that I never put together, I'm pretty sure.

1344
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,420
I had a next generation enterprise.

1345
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,260
Oh, did you put that together?

1346
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,980
I put it together.

1347
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,260
Whoa, that must've been hard.

1348
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,340
It was hard, but I would never put the stickers on

1349
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,540
because I would always get the stickers wrong.

1350
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,100
So I would just leave them off.

1351
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
And I was bad at painting, so I never painted them.

1352
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:27,940
How big was it?

1353
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,340
It was like a foot.

1354
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,180
Okay.

1355
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,300
Pretty good foot and a half maybe.

1356
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,020
I hung it from my ceiling.

1357
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,260
That was a toy I always wanted.

1358
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,500
I'm talking about more of the action figure one that came.

1359
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,340
Sure, sure.

1360
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,180
That was one I always wanted but never got.

1361
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,340
I think that design holds up, next generation.

1362
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,580
Oh, it's fantastic.

1363
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,260
It's also the best TV show ever made.

1364
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,580
Did you guys ever do, have you guys ever talked about

1365
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,260
the Star Trek experience at the Las Vegas Hilton?

1366
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,060
It's on the list.

1367
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,580
It's probably coming up.

1368
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,420
We've been wanting to get to that one.

1369
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,900
It's probably coming soon.

1370
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,740
And more fun Star Trek stuff

1371
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,540
that I discovered in the last month or two.

1372
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,500
I did it and I was very sad when it went away.

1373
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,340
Oh really?

1374
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,180
How was it?

1375
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,020
It's amazing.

1376
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,420
It was amazing.

1377
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,100
I won't talk about it if you're gonna talk about it later.

1378
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,700
Well, I don't know, give us something though.

1379
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,540
Something we might not know about.

1380
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,380
Well the cool thing is, they make it,

1381
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,860
when you're in line for the ride part of it,

1382
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,380
they make it seem like you're just in a line

1383
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,220
for like a Star Tours type thing.

1384
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,180
So like you queue up in your rows like that.

1385
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,820
Like you're waiting for the Star Tours door to open.

1386
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,620
But when you're on that, when it's about to start,

1387
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,300
the lights go down, the lights turn off.

1388
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,820
And when they come back on,

1389
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,580
you're standing on the transporter bay

1390
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,180
of the Star Trek Enterprise.

1391
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,020
Oh right.

1392
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,860
I've read about this.

1393
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,980
And that was like in a crazy effect.

1394
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,180
I was like, and then you're walking through the hallways

1395
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,660
of the Enterprise and then you walk onto the bridge.

1396
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,220
Do you have any idea how they did that effect?

1397
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,020
I think there was four walls around you

1398
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,500
and then like they raised.

1399
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,380
Wow.

1400
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,740
When you're in the dark.

1401
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:45,620
That's pretty nuts.

1402
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,460
It was great.

1403
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,700
And then you walk through, get onto a shuttlecraft

1404
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,660
and have like a Star Tours type regular

1405
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,740
flight simulator thing.

1406
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,580
This is a thing.

1407
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,420
It was great.

1408
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,240
It sounds great.

1409
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,980
There was multiple versions of it I've learned.

1410
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,340
There was a scarier version.

1411
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,700
Maybe the board were involved.

1412
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,420
But I think as a kid, as soon as I saw space stuff,

1413
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,460
fuck you trains.

1414
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,340
Like I was not interested.

1415
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,180
No, sure.

1416
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,380
The end I saw Star Trek or Star Wars

1417
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,980
and I was like, this is awesome.

1418
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,620
Trains boring snooze by frontier land.

1419
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,260
I like big thunder, but this isn't a spaceship I'm in.

1420
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,740
Like I was way more.

1421
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,220
Once you've seen space, how do you go back down to a train?

1422
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,060
No.

1423
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,220
A mine cart maybe.

1424
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,060
Maybe.

1425
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,940
Maybe.

1426
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,740
But everybody be leaping from tracks

1427
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,900
and landing on other tracks.

1428
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,060
It's still got some adrenaline.

1429
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,060
I bet there's, I bet by virtue of this,

1430
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,700
I think in 1955, having a train be one of the primary

1431
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,340
attractions in your new amusement park,

1432
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,660
it reflected the times.

1433
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,500
Of course.

1434
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,060
But I bet today there's a lot of people

1435
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,540
who are into trains primarily because of Disney land.

1436
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,500
As opposed to it because it's not,

1437
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
there's not as much affection for that in the culture

1438
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,380
and people don't grow up with Westerns

1439
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,740
and Davy Crockett and that world of stuff.

1440
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,460
Like it feels as alien to them

1441
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,940
as any actual alien thing is to us.

1442
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1443
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,340
Like what is that?

1444
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,620
It could be from the future.

1445
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,460
Who knows what it is?

1446
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,780
It's so crazy looking.

1447
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,580
Disney ingrained in the train enthusiast community

1448
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,460
in America because the machine shop at Disney,

1449
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,900
the Disney Studios built the first two trains.

1450
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,660
And as they added trains, they just kept buying old trains

1451
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,060
to restore as they needed new ones.

1452
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,140
So that's where a lot of those came from.

1453
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,460
Some were custom made but some were decommissioned

1454
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,580
and let's get it in the park.

1455
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,740
Yeah, get it in the park and repaint it.

1456
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:47,740
And Disney has gifted or donated or in one case

1457
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:52,260
there was like a trade, like older train cars

1458
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:56,500
or older locomotives to museums or collectors

1459
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,980
or sold stuff to collectors.

1460
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,580
Well, so here's a crazy thing that happened

1461
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,180
to me a number of years ago.

1462
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,940
I went up to San Luis Obispo or a little bit above it,

1463
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,700
there is Santa Margarita.

1464
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,140
It was a wedding at a place called

1465
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,020
the Santa Margarita Ranch

1466
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,580
and there was this sprawling property, super insane.

1467
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,100
The reception's in a giant barn.

1468
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,420
And then after the ceremony is done, a train pulls up.

1469
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,020
What do you mean a train at this property?

1470
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,500
And the train says Disneyland Railroad.

1471
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,340
Whoa.

1472
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,340
And they tell us this was the original Disneyland train.

1473
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,980
And I'd never looked further into it.

1474
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,380
And like, so what do you mean?

1475
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,940
When was it decommissioned?

1476
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,740
So this was ret law one is what I was on.

1477
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,900
If anyone's lucky enough to go to some event there

1478
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,980
or sometimes they do public events up there.

1479
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,420
But that's what they have.

1480
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,220
It is one of the original like day one trains.

1481
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:01,340
And what happened is they are more of like

1482
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,100
traditional train cars, like interior cars with windows.

1483
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,260
And if you've been on the train lately,

1484
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,700
by that I mean since the 60s,

1485
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,540
you know that it is not, it's not enclosed cars, right?

1486
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:20,300
It's like the stacked seating so that you can facing out

1487
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,260
so that you can look at the dioramas.

1488
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:27,020
When they put in the Grand Canyon thing in the 50s,

1489
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,780
people did not wanna have to be peering

1490
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,180
through these tiny windows.

1491
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,740
And they started like getting rid of those cars.

1492
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,220
And plus they were falling into disrepair anyway.

1493
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,740
So these train cars were, they were,

1494
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,660
the theatrical ones quote unquote went in.

1495
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,820
They were all commissioned around the 74 I think.

1496
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,580
And they got moved up to this ranch,

1497
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,980
which was like a blast.

1498
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,220
I think they were like falling apart when they left Disney

1499
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,540
and just bumming around the property.

1500
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,620
But they have been beautifully restored up there.

1501
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,820
And the coolest thing is that apparently one time

1502
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,180
there was a film festival on this ranch.

1503
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,940
And as part of it, there were robbers who rode up on horses

1504
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,260
and robbed the train.

1505
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,140
And one of the guys was in a bandana.

1506
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,020
And when he pulled down the bandana,

1507
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,700
it was David Carradine.

1508
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,540
Whoa!

1509
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,380
Kung Fu!

1510
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,220
Yeah!

1511
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,460
Kung Fu was robbing your train.

1512
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,620
He doesn't need this money, you rich actor.

1513
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,460
Unless he didn't play it.

1514
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,900
It might've been pre-Kill Bill resurgence yet.

1515
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,700
Those enclosed cars I believe are called combine cars.

1516
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,860
And Walt liked them because it reminded him

1517
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,500
of his days as a boy.

1518
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,340
He was a news butcher selling newspapers and candy.

1519
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,180
A news butcher?

1520
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,020
News butcher.

1521
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:39,860
They called it a news butcher.

1522
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,860
News boys were called if you went up and down train cars.

1523
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,300
That's what I call Jeff Zucker, you know what I mean?

1524
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,100
I'll tell you.

1525
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,460
I'll tell you what.

1526
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,220
Yeah, he was a news butcher.

1527
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,460
If they had had a news butcher on that train,

1528
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,660
you could've gotten one of your

1529
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,580
Jeffrey Dahmer People magazines right on the train.

1530
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,500
Can't you imagine?

1531
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,340
And a big lolly.

1532
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,180
A dream.

1533
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,060
And a big lolly and a big stogie.

1534
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,700
You could've been sitting there having a stogie.

1535
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,420
What an obnoxious teenager I would've been.

1536
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,420
What an obnoxious, yeah.

1537
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,220
It's closed now,

1538
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,300
but there used to be a restaurant called Poe Folks

1539
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,780
down by Disneyland in Orange.

1540
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,940
It was like a Southern theme.

1541
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,700
And they'd had a thing where up towards the ceiling,

1542
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,260
a train, a little model train would go around.

1543
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,740
Those are some of my favorite trains.

1544
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,580
Whenever you see a train in a restaurant,

1545
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,060
going through little fun dioramas.

1546
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,780
Let me tell you another good Orange County train.

1547
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,260
Mike, you know where I'm going with this.

1548
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,820
Well, maybe.

1549
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,980
We were there once together.

1550
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,340
But in Buena Park on Beach Boulevard,

1551
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,140
on the way into Knott's Berry Farm,

1552
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,940
there is a McDonald's that has a model train inside.

1553
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,300
That's robust.

1554
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,740
It's like a, you know,

1555
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,900
I mean, not a bigger than usual,

1556
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,020
but like on the larger end of McDonald's.

1557
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,380
And the train goes all around it.

1558
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,460
Super detailed miniature.

1559
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,020
But the craziest thing about this McDonald's

1560
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,540
is that the sign in really big,

1561
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,220
like kind of like fancier,

1562
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,900
more like fiber optic lighting

1563
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,780
than you usually see at a McDonald's

1564
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,820
has this big cursive logo, McThriller.

1565
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,660
What?

1566
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,980
McThriller, why?

1567
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,100
You go in, is it because of trains?

1568
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,180
That doesn't make sense.

1569
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,020
Those words still don't tie together.

1570
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,500
There was apparently at one point

1571
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,140
a simulator ride in this McDonald's.

1572
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,780
But there hasn't been since like 1989.

1573
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,140
And yet they never change it from McThriller.

1574
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,020
Were you traveling through like McDonald's land?

1575
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,460
Like was Ronald McDonald there,

1576
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,260
like shooting Nazis or something?

1577
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,100
I don't know.

1578
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,220
Blowing away fry guys for trying to steal.

1579
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,780
Third Reich fry guys?

1580
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,220
Why have you turned?

1581
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,540
Speaking of trains.

1582
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,940
That's at those are trains I don't like.

1583
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,820
Yeah, Wal didn't consider that with the cars.

1584
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,260
And maybe people want some escapism.

1585
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,780
Don't remind people the recent events.

1586
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,060
No, this was, I don't know what the simulator

1587
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:00,900
at McDonald's was.

1588
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,500
But boy, if there was a McDonald's ride.

1589
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,100
There's gotta be some YouTube video of this McThriller.

1590
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:06,940
Somebody in the audience has to know.

1591
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,420
There's nothing you want more after you have

1592
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,980
a nice big greasy McDonald's meal.

1593
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,700
It's like a motion simulator is the perfect thing

1594
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,540
to ease my stomach.

1595
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,220
Oh man, it's Friday in Southern California

1596
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,900
during the Easter season.

1597
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,300
$2 filet-o-fish sandwich running right now.

1598
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,700
I would love to pound a couple of those bad boys

1599
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,940
and hop in a 3D motion simulator.

1600
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,740
Get jostled for a while.

1601
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,700
How about like a body wars where you go inside Grimace?

1602
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,740
He has like a tummy ache and you have to go help him.

1603
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,900
And you get to see how McDonald's food digests.

1604
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,420
Clogged arteries.

1605
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:43,420
Sure, seasonal overlay where you go inside Uncle O'Grimacy.

1606
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,620
His Irish uncle.

1607
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,660
Yeah, you don't see a lot of St. Patrick's Day seasonal overlays.

1608
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,620
It's like a diseased liver.

1609
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,460
Oh yeah.

1610
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,780
He's a drinker but not from McDonald's.

1611
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,540
Obviously no liquor here.

1612
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,660
I don't know where he's doing it.

1613
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,580
Grimace, you have to help Grimace donate part of his liver

1614
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,420
to Uncle O'Grimacy.

1615
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,340
Oh no.

1616
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,980
You have to use the front of your ship

1617
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:10,140
to like slazer off a little section.

1618
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,460
They should do a Galaxy's Edge Millennium Falcon level ride

1619
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,900
where you actually do the incision.

1620
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,140
Like you as a group have to perform the surgery

1621
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,540
on Uncle O'Grimacy.

1622
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,980
Get out.

1623
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,140
And you get put in a scuba suit

1624
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,060
and like swim out into his innards

1625
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,740
and remove the purple ulcers.

1626
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,420
Oh.

1627
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,420
But wait, would that be healthy for Grimace?

1628
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,260
What if the ulcer.

1629
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,300
To have an ulcer?

1630
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,380
Well, but he's purple.

1631
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,220
Oh so.

1632
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,780
What are his guts?

1633
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,420
Well he's like a neon green maybe,

1634
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,180
like a lime green or something.

1635
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,300
I guess so.

1636
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,380
Yeah, purple is healthy for Grimace.

1637
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,220
That's a good point.

1638
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:54,100
There's gotta be some cartoonist or some deviant art person

1639
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,300
who's drawn like a diagram of the anatomy of Grimace.

1640
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,340
I'm sure it's more detailed than you want.

1641
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,500
Yeah, absolutely.

1642
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,740
His blood is milkshakes?

1643
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,060
I mean his blood's gotta be.

1644
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:04,900
No wonder he's depressed.

1645
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,740
That actually might be canon.

1646
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,980
I'm so lethargic.

1647
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,820
That might be canon.

1648
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,780
He's kind of the Eeyore of their world.

1649
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,460
Absolutely. That's true.

1650
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:15,580
This is like Maya Rudolph's character in Away We Go.

1651
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,900
Remember her job was drawing medical textbook illustrations.

1652
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,460
I've never forgotten Away We Go since I've seen it.

1653
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,740
Weekly viewings.

1654
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,220
Weekly viewing, sing alongs.

1655
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:31,460
It is shocking that there's not a full scale

1656
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,060
McDonald's theme park.

1657
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,900
Yeah.

1658
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,100
You would think with the amount of money they have

1659
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,820
and the legit affection we all seem to have

1660
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,100
for these dumb characters,

1661
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,540
you would think there would have been a full scale

1662
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,820
somewhere McDonald's.

1663
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,500
It would have been cheap as shit but.

1664
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,340
Sure.

1665
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,140
Orlando, they have that massive Orlando one

1666
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,540
where you can still get pizza and pasta and stuff.

1667
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,340
They certainly have interesting McDonald's restaurants

1668
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,780
but you'd think there would be like a full scale.

1669
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,500
The McDonald's by my house growing up

1670
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,860
but it was always a treat to go.

1671
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,540
We never got it regularly but they had at the kids table

1672
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,380
like two saddles you could sit on at the kids table

1673
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,180
and that was always a thrill.

1674
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,020
Wow.

1675
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,780
Just a different way to sit.

1676
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,580
Yeah but as a kid you're like this is great.

1677
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,940
I'm sitting on a saddle eating a cheeseburger.

1678
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:14,780
Yeah.

1679
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,620
What more do you want out of life?

1680
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,900
Isn't some regular meal.

1681
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,740
I'm not some regular kid.

1682
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,140
Sure there's no, and you didn't need back support

1683
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,300
when you were a child.

1684
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,180
That's fine.

1685
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,420
I would hate it now.

1686
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,180
The best and scariest thing I have is just going inside

1687
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,660
of the Play Place officer Big Mac mouth.

1688
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,500
Oh yeah.

1689
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,820
In like tall thing you would climb.

1690
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,660
Oh sure.

1691
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,860
And we all had that memory right?

1692
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,700
Yeah yeah.

1693
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,520
Scary.

1694
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,500
They had like it was a piece of play equipment

1695
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,020
and it was inside of his mouth but it was elevated.

1696
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:42,860
Yikes.

1697
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,780
We had the Chuck E Cheese where I grew up in San Jose.

1698
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,860
There was one of the Chuck E Cheese, they're big,

1699
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,140
the band but there were like tunnels under,

1700
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,780
the band was elevated but you could crawl underneath

1701
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,540
and like little mazes.

1702
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,260
Whoa hold on a second, cancel the train talk.

1703
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,580
Pull the car around.

1704
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:02,860
This was a two story Chuck E Cheese.

1705
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:03,700
Oh my god.

1706
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,520
What?

1707
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,340
Yeah, it was cause you could get very close

1708
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,740
to these animatronics.

1709
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,580
Wait what did the tunnels do?

1710
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,180
They were just like little mazes, I don't know.

1711
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,980
There's also a room that was just a strobe light

1712
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,420
where kids could just like jump around and.

1713
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,100
This feels so decadent it feels like God would be destroyed.

1714
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:21,940
Yeah.

1715
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,220
It was the strobe struck by lightning.

1716
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,860
Could you watch the show from the tunnels?

1717
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,700
No.

1718
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,540
It was just there were his tunnels.

1719
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,700
But it was always very scary going up that close to them.

1720
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,540
They're frightening.

1721
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,780
There was also the Elvis one, the hound dog

1722
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,820
who would sing but he had like his own little lounge room

1723
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,740
and you could sit in little stools in front of him

1724
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,660
and the stools would bounce up and down like umpapa style.

1725
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,500
You're telling me.

1726
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,740
Like the Captain Eo seats, chairs that move along with.

1727
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,580
Just stools but like add a little bar in front of the Elvis.

1728
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:53,020
You're telling me that Jasper T. Jowls, the dog.

1729
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:53,860
Yeah.

1730
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,700
Had a special room where you would move.

1731
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,540
No, no, no, no, no.

1732
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,380
No, no, no, no.

1733
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,220
Oh wait.

1734
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,060
This is a hound dog.

1735
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:58,880
Oh wait you're right, you're right.

1736
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,720
Elvis themed.

1737
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,700
There were other bands.

1738
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,540
Yeah.

1739
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,300
That's why it's gonna take us a year

1740
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,300
to get through Chuck E. Cheese.

1741
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,220
I sent you that picture of like all the Chobas pizza

1742
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,780
characters, were some of them held over?

1743
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,620
I don't know.

1744
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,660
Cause what were the boys, there was the Beach Boys parody.

1745
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:16,780
There was a Beach Boys group, were they like the Beagle?

1746
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,340
I think they were all dogs.

1747
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,660
There was an Elvis dog, there were Beatles dogs,

1748
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,580
there were Beach Boys dogs.

1749
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,060
I have a memory of Gorillaz too.

1750
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:28,300
I think I thought the Beach Boys were Gorillaz

1751
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,980
but I think the Gorillaz were something different.

1752
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:34,660
It is funny to me like it's an Elvis parody

1753
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:38,780
for kids in the 80s and 90s who wouldn't really,

1754
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,740
would kind of know who Elvis was.

1755
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:44,100
And then you know all the Looney Tunes and syndication

1756
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,820
or stuff where like there's cartoon Marx brothers

1757
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,740
or cartoon Humphrey Bogard.

1758
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,580
James Cagney, everyone's favorite.

1759
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,020
James Cagney, what a good reference.

1760
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,420
Well like our kids 50 years from now

1761
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,820
when you mentioned The Rock, are they gonna know

1762
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,660
what the hell we're talking about?

1763
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,940
That's true, no.

1764
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:03,580
Yeah, will they know Ninja and like the Dolan twins

1765
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,780
more than The Rock?

1766
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,220
Like what are they worried about?

1767
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,980
We have like on the Guardians ride,

1768
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,100
if one of these actors does something crazy,

1769
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,940
pulls a Jussie Smollett, you know what I mean?

1770
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,260
What are you gonna do?

1771
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,300
I wonder if they have, the people in the world

1772
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:22,420
has not like really had to reckon with this in a big way.

1773
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:23,260
Right.

1774
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,260
Yeah, I don't know what, and well,

1775
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,660
and you know what we're coming up on is like,

1776
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,940
wait although is Depp fine?

1777
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,860
What do we determine about this?

1778
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,260
He seems like a piece of shit,

1779
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,260
but it seems like he skated by for this vlog.

1780
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,500
Well, because he hasn't been convicted of anything.

1781
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,340
Yeah, right.

1782
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,820
But we heard he's, I'm fuzzy on Depp.

1783
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,740
Is it bad, is he supposed to be no more Depp?

1784
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,780
Well, yeah, I think there's a feeling.

1785
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,220
Unless you're JK Rowling,

1786
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,980
which he's totally on board with him,

1787
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,820
I think everyone else is a little bit like distance.

1788
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,380
And we all know she's been making very good judgment

1789
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,220
on him lately.

1790
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,060
Oh, yeah.

1791
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:57,900
JK Rowling.

1792
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,700
If I could describe JK Rowling in two words,

1793
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,860
it would be normal and the second word would be regular.

1794
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,220
Yes, just like my poops.

1795
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,060
Yeah.

1796
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,460
But it's something they may have to reckon with,

1797
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,460
I mean I guess in that case they just remove,

1798
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,300
maybe that's easier to just remove a robot.

1799
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,620
Just with a hammer a couple of times,

1800
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,340
that's all you gotta do, just make them look different.

1801
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,180
Look like a different.

1802
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,700
Bash him into a different facial structure.

1803
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,260
I have here, I believe this is the character

1804
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,340
you're referencing maybe.

1805
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,540
That looks like him, yeah.

1806
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,700
King was a lion.

1807
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,540
Oh, a lion.

1808
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:31,220
A nine foot tall animatronic lion named The King.

1809
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,420
Nine, wow.

1810
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,980
That's what it says on the showbiz pizza wiki.

1811
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,020
And I just, when I go to the tiki room,

1812
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,780
hearing that clicky clacky on the end

1813
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,100
brings me right back to that,

1814
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,140
because you could hear these were not smooth.

1815
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,820
Are you kind of fond of the clicking?

1816
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:46,100
I love the clicky clacky in the tiki room.

1817
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,820
It's so like, it's a true, talk about time capsule,

1818
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,980
it's a true time capsule.

1819
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,260
Maybe that's my version of liking the clicks and pops

1820
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,700
on vinyls, you know?

1821
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,540
Exactly.

1822
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,740
The way they used to do it.

1823
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:01,020
It's better with deafeningly loud hydraulic sounds.

1824
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,700
I know there's stuff at Disneyland that has changed

1825
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:05,460
and will continue to change over the years,

1826
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,260
but if they took out the clicking and clacking

1827
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,020
of the tiki room, I think the cognitive dissonance

1828
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,860
would just drive me insane.

1829
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,740
How do they dampen the clicking?

1830
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,900
Don't ever, don't dampen the clicks.

1831
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,100
Don't dampen the clicks.

1832
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,020
Hashtag don't dampen the clicks.

1833
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,260
I have one request from the audience.

1834
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:25,260
If you live in Ohio, a king cat exists

1835
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,420
at Jungle Jim's grocery store in Fairfield, Ohio.

1836
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,260
What?

1837
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,740
However, it seems to be in poor condition.

1838
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,140
The king can be seen in left corner

1839
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,380
in the back of the dining area in the showroom.

1840
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,860
So if you live near Jungle Jim's grocery store

1841
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,500
in Fairfield, Ohio, please send us a photo

1842
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,340
of this animatronic.

1843
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,780
This grocery store sounds like a paradise.

1844
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:45,620
I agree.

1845
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,100
There's a restaurant with a lion in the back of it.

1846
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,940
I agree, I don't know anything else about it.

1847
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:52,500
Also, if they have cans of Skyline Chili, send us some.

1848
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,220
I hear it's not as the same as getting it in the stores,

1849
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,060
but you know.

1850
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,460
Yeah, don't send a meal.

1851
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:02,460
Don't mail us a fresh from the restaurant Skyline Chili.

1852
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,300
Maybe Jason.

1853
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,260
Well, yeah.

1854
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,100
That'll keep.

1855
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,060
How long?

1856
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,100
Eight days.

1857
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:07,940
Chili keeps.

1858
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,860
They would eat it on the trail.

1859
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,500
If there's one person listening who lives

1860
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,540
a couple blocks away from the Fairfield grocery store

1861
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,500
and is now feels like.

1862
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,340
This is our mission.

1863
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,180
This is a call to action.

1864
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:25,180
But I flash to they get too excited.

1865
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,340
They like, I'm going there right now.

1866
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:30,340
Speed out of the car, get T-boned by another car.

1867
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,620
Oh God, don't put that on us.

1868
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,460
No, I don't.

1869
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,300
Jeez.

1870
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,380
Someone's been watching Vice too much.

1871
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,460
Be safe is all I'm saying.

1872
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,460
I'd be excited too if my local grocery store

1873
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,980
had a call to arms related to it.

1874
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,820
It might not be there, honestly.

1875
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,140
Who knows when that Wikipedia was last updated.

1876
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,780
Or they'll get there right as it's leaving

1877
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,860
and the person can go, wait.

1878
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,620
They're just ripping the head off.

1879
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,460
All right.

1880
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,220
Make the incision.

1881
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:01,060
I was gonna say, I will offer a free

1882
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,900
lifetime Patreon subscription if you send us the head.

1883
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,740
Whoa.

1884
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,140
In general, if we get sent any robot heads,

1885
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,300
you're in for free.

1886
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,300
Yeah, but it has to be a certificate of authenticity as well.

1887
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,100
You can't, well no, I take that back.

1888
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,700
If you can make a facsimile of any of our

1889
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,340
beloved animatronics heads.

1890
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,540
Who is making these certificates of authenticity?

1891
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,740
Why are those authentic?

1892
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,580
Yeah, that's a good point.

1893
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,180
You can't make a certificate of authenticity.

1894
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,260
That's a very good point.

1895
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,900
It's a big thing in California.

1896
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,540
You can't sell autographed books and stuff in California.

1897
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:36,220
You can't sell that as this was autographed by the author

1898
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,300
unless you have a certificate of authenticity.

1899
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,420
But I don't understand how you do that.

1900
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,300
Can't you just forge that?

1901
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,140
Yeah.

1902
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:47,220
There's a man named Authenticus who sits on a tall throne

1903
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,860
and he does all of the stamping.

1904
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,900
Authentic inauthentic.

1905
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,460
So if you don't pass the Authenticus test.

1906
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:57,260
It's interesting, all our democratic rules.

1907
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,660
What a terrible job.

1908
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,940
It seems so boring after a while.

1909
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,380
It was fun the first few years.

1910
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,620
That's how living.

1911
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:04,820
I gotta find something else,

1912
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:07,260
but it's hard when your name's Authenticus.

1913
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,940
You get tied into a certain line of work.

1914
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,220
Term limits and torts and bills and laws,

1915
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,580
but we still honor Authenticus.

1916
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,860
We've all agreed.

1917
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:18,340
Yeah, hey, some systems just work.

1918
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,660
Yeah, that's true.

1919
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,100
He'll teach his son, Authenticus Jr.

1920
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,500
He'll change horses in midstream.

1921
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,820
He's 150 years old.

1922
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,660
How long have we been talking?

1923
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,580
Do we need to get back to the trains?

1924
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,420
Yeah, I would like to get back to the trains.

1925
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,260
Where are we at?

1926
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,340
Oh, we've been doing about an hour and five.

1927
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,420
Okay, great.

1928
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,940
We still got plenty of train time.

1929
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:38,780
What else?

1930
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:39,820
Since the 2000s,

1931
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,940
the trains have been running on biodiesel.

1932
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,180
They used to just run on diesel.

1933
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:49,620
The Disneyland Railroad now runs on biodiesel.

1934
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,060
I do love that smell.

1935
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,500
The smell of the fuel.

1936
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,340
Oh yeah, yeah.

1937
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,900
Am I crazy?

1938
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:56,740
No.

1939
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,900
That's part of the atmosphere of the park.

1940
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,460
You can't tell when you go by the Autopia

1941
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,900
because it smells like just pure gas,

1942
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:02,980
but other than that, you can smell.

1943
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:06,740
Oh, also the cabin, the burning cabin,

1944
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,140
doesn't burn anymore.

1945
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:08,980
No. No.

1946
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,220
You used to see that now.

1947
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,300
It used to be because it was attacked by Indians.

1948
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,020
And then as someone knocked over a lamp,

1949
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:15,420
and now everything's fine.

1950
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,500
They changed the story of life.

1951
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,620
It was an attack zone, and then it became just an accident.

1952
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:24,020
They were under an Indian attack, yeah.

1953
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:27,620
There was a lot more Pawnee kind of crap in Disney,

1954
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,780
and the burning of the town,

1955
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,740
and the armory and stuff.

1956
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:34,020
Yeah.

1957
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,060
And Zorro would come in once in a while.

1958
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:39,180
Zorro would show up sometimes.

1959
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,660
The guy who played Zorro would come and help.

1960
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,740
Help?

1961
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:44,380
Like nodding pots in the bathrooms?

1962
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:46,180
Yeah, yeah, he would operate a ride or two.

1963
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,020
Oh no.

1964
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,700
Two per car, please.

1965
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,020
Quit slicing Z's into the customers.

1966
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:52,860
Come on.

1967
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:53,700
Yeah.

1968
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:55,980
How else would you know he was there?

1969
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,100
Yeah.

1970
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,340
I didn't know the train used to be,

1971
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,180
there were two different,

1972
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,900
so they used to be able to run two at once,

1973
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,140
and you could either get on at Main Street,

1974
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:07,900
or get on at Frontierland,

1975
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,500
but you were taking it all the way around.

1976
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,620
It was a round trip, and light off.

1977
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,900
You would have preferred that.

1978
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,020
I mean, I think that would, it sounds fun.

1979
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:15,980
You didn't have a choice.

1980
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:16,980
You didn't have a choice,

1981
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,940
and then eventually they stopped,

1982
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,740
like okay, no, it's one track,

1983
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,900
we're gonna run multiple trains on one track,

1984
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,860
and you're gonna be able to get on and off.

1985
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:27,140
But I didn't realize when they introduced E-tickets,

1986
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,700
the train was always the highest level ticket.

1987
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,700
The train was an E-ticket until 1982,

1988
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,860
when they got rid of it.

1989
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:34,780
All the way to the end, really?

1990
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,620
Yeah.

1991
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,620
That's why I didn't realize that.

1992
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,620
The trains weren't even like a novelty form

1993
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,980
of transportation back then.

1994
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:43,380
It would be like, here's a bus ride for us,

1995
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,220
you know what I mean?

1996
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,060
That's true.

1997
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,340
People probably took the trains

1998
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,980
a lot more than we do now.

1999
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:52,060
Yeah, but I think they have always been expensive

2000
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:52,980
to maintain.

2001
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:53,980
I suppose so.

2002
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:55,300
A lot of moving parts.

2003
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,620
I guess people weren't taking old timey trains.

2004
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,580
That's what E-tickets going for,

2005
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:04,580
is old polish and brass.

2006
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,220
See that brass?

2007
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,060
Yeah.

2008
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:14,060
Most steam trains, I think, are not existing in the world.

2009
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:17,380
That's a rare form of train these days.

2010
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,820
Which is like, they need to be maintained

2011
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:21,060
by people who know what they're doing.

2012
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,020
I remember there's a whole talk of when

2013
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,140
they were gonna do the Star Wars,

2014
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,700
what was gonna happen to the people

2015
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,620
that operate the train,

2016
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,540
because they're like some of the only people

2017
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,180
that know how to maintain a steam train.

2018
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:36,180
You can't just furlough these very valuable,

2019
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,940
specific knowledge sources.

2020
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,380
Right, so they had them telling you about the train

2021
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,780
if you wanted to walk over there.

2022
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:43,620
Which we did a few times.

2023
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,860
To give them something to do?

2024
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:48,980
So if you walked over by the trains when it was down,

2025
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,300
they would be just like wandering around.

2026
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,580
Usually I think all they would do

2027
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:55,100
is help you pull the thing to make the whistle.

2028
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,060
The whistle was a thrill to pull the whistle.

2029
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,500
Did you do that in your photo shoot?

2030
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,420
I did it a number of times.

2031
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,260
I can't remember if we did it in the photo shoot.

2032
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,100
I don't think we have a picture of the whistle.

2033
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,060
I think we were concentrating more inside the train itself.

2034
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:10,020
Yeah.

2035
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,780
Because the whistle, we were talking about the whistle

2036
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,380
on the other side of the station.

2037
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:17,180
Yeah, they had a solo whistle just set up separate.

2038
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:19,100
What else?

2039
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,140
The caboose, okay, so you can still ride the caboose

2040
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,180
is sometimes on the tracks.

2041
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:27,340
I've never gotten to ride and I've tried multiple times.

2042
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:30,940
The Lily Bell, which is the restored parlor car.

2043
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:34,100
And did you guys know who the first person

2044
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:37,420
to ever ride in the Lily Bell was in 1976?

2045
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,460
Is it Nixon?

2046
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,820
Emperor Hirohito of Japan.

2047
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,140
Wow.

2048
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,740
Putting the past behind us.

2049
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:45,740
Putting the past behind us.

2050
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:47,420
Building bridges, mending fences.

2051
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:49,380
Did he give it an emperor's kiss?

2052
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,180
I can only imagine, I can only assume.

2053
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:52,020
I wonder if they felt like,

2054
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,940
well, American technology is really far behind.

2055
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,780
Yeah.

2056
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,100
This is the best they got.

2057
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,460
I was not impressed from my trip.

2058
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,420
Yeah.

2059
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,100
Crush the Americans.

2060
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,740
We have nothing to worry about.

2061
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,180
Yeah, have you asked to do the Lily Bell?

2062
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:11,660
I've, like, I always heard that if you went to City Hall

2063
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,540
first thing in the morning and you ask,

2064
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,420
is the Lily Bell running?

2065
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,260
And if it wasn't, if it was on the tracks

2066
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:21,300
and it wasn't scheduled for a special event or VIP,

2067
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,180
you could get a ticket for it.

2068
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:26,140
Now I've heard if you have to go to Main Street Station

2069
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:29,540
and talk to the employees if you can do it.

2070
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,500
And then I feel like I've also heard

2071
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,180
it's been relegated to the tours,

2072
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,220
to the additional tours.

2073
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:39,820
I think maybe Club 33 gets you on there too.

2074
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:40,660
Yeah, I'm sure.

2075
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,700
I can't just have anybody walking on that,

2076
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:43,540
like, spilling a drink.

2077
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:47,460
No, it's filled with like beautiful memorabilia,

2078
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,220
Disney family photos.

2079
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:50,660
That's too, yeah, like this, right?

2080
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,940
That's it? Yeah.

2081
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,900
Yeah, it looks really nice.

2082
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:57,660
I rode in when I did my VIP tour last year.

2083
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:00,700
I rode in a different car, but not the Lily Bell.

2084
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,100
You rode in an inside car?

2085
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,500
An inside car, yeah. Oh, really?

2086
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,140
There was only a few people in there.

2087
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,660
Oh, what was in it?

2088
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:08,780
Just some benches.

2089
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:10,260
Was it the caboose? Different benches.

2090
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,460
No. What's that?

2091
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:13,500
Was it green? Yeah.

2092
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,980
I think that's the caboose.

2093
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,900
Yeah, we rode in the caboose.

2094
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:21,940
I have pictures of me alone in that from another time.

2095
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:22,780
Why were you alone?

2096
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,620
Alone in the caboose.

2097
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,740
Well, no, I was with someone, but they took the picture.

2098
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:30,180
I am solo in the picture, looking like a pig and shit.

2099
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,060
I like the idea that you just set up a camera

2100
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,020
with a timer and you were alone in the caboose.

2101
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,660
Alone in a caboose could be like a great one-man show.

2102
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,660
Oh, kidding?

2103
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,460
Yeah, what brought you there?

2104
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,380
Are you gonna get out?

2105
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,140
Are you there to kill yourself?

2106
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,500
Suck in trained fumes until you die?

2107
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,620
That's the theme, though.

2108
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,100
Oh, yeah, couldn't do it anymore.

2109
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,420
That's too bad.

2110
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,620
Not a good place to kill yourself.

2111
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:55,940
Yeah, that Lily Bell, that looks nice.

2112
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:59,100
They really should do some insane high-end event

2113
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,780
because sometimes they'll do like a,

2114
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:03,940
give us $1,000 and you can eat breakfast

2115
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,660
by the hippo at the Jungle Cruise.

2116
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:07,500
Finally.

2117
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,860
Yeah, we've all been asking for it.

2118
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,180
There was a Haunted Mansion version, though.

2119
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:12,020
There was a dinner.

2120
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:15,580
There was a full dinner in the portrait hallway.

2121
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,020
Do you think they'll ever have,

2122
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,940
I want $1,000, I'll give you 10 grand

2123
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:21,740
and I want an actor playing Walt Disney.

2124
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,140
Just to walk you around the park?

2125
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:25,500
Yeah, will they ever have a Walt Disney character

2126
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,220
walking around, do you think?

2127
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,060
I don't know.

2128
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:29,300
I think that's dicey for them.

2129
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,500
It's a good idea.

2130
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:35,300
It's the divide between the family, the estate.

2131
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,900
The estate's its own little thing

2132
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,420
that works in cooperation with the corporation,

2133
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,060
the Walt Disney Company.

2134
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:43,420
The Walt Disney Company has their version of Walt

2135
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,220
and then the family has their version of Walt

2136
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,740
and then they're both very protected.

2137
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:51,020
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting because he is now

2138
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:54,380
heavily marketed everywhere in the park.

2139
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:57,340
Clothes and prints and posters.

2140
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,540
Quotes he didn't say.

2141
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,020
Quotes he didn't say.

2142
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,220
I love flying drones.

2143
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:05,300
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

2144
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,700
Yeah, but so it is all.

2145
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:10,540
I love Kesha.

2146
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:11,380
All you need is love.

2147
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,220
Yeah.

2148
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,060
Yeah.

2149
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,340
Purple rain.

2150
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,420
I only wanna see you standing in the purple rain.

2151
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:22,620
They should do some mashup shirts of Walt Disney,

2152
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:25,020
like make him look like Doctor Who or something.

2153
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:25,860
Great.

2154
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,700
Yeah.

2155
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,060
Ooh, yeah.

2156
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:29,940
Yeah, or him with Star Wars Kai.

2157
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:30,780
That makes more sense.

2158
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,940
Him with probably property saber and stuff.

2159
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:33,780
Sure.

2160
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,620
Right?

2161
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,440
Yeah.

2162
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,280
You just figure him like in the conduct,

2163
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,340
because he would put on the train guy outfit

2164
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:41,220
and he would drive the trains around

2165
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:45,580
even though he was not a train engineer or fireman,

2166
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:46,980
which are the two positions that.

2167
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:50,580
Was he that barman who like derailed the train maybe?

2168
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:51,940
Oh man.

2169
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:53,420
Like he was wearing a disguise

2170
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:55,580
and that's why they never saw that man again.

2171
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:57,580
Whoever that guy was.

2172
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,740
I would love a Walt shirt where he,

2173
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,300
with just a word bubble that says like,

2174
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,020
I fucking love trains.

2175
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:04,860
Walt.

2176
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:05,900
Walt.

2177
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,540
What is this, Disneyland?

2178
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,340
Too edgy.

2179
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,180
Too edgy.

2180
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:17,140
Taking something good and making it seem weird and perverse.

2181
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:17,980
Whoa.

2182
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:18,820
Got him.

2183
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,460
Whoa, David Lynch over here.

2184
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:25,300
What would Banksy call a Universal Studios scary ver,

2185
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,060
Doom-a-versal studios?

2186
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:27,900
Yeah.

2187
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,740
Uh, yeah.

2188
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,620
Studios, I don't, I'm gonna have to.

2189
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:34,900
I can't, I'm too tired.

2190
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,580
Doom-a-versal works pretty well.

2191
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:38,420
Say that for now.

2192
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,420
We should do a Disneyland episode as well.

2193
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,060
I don't think there are any critters at Universal.

2194
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,020
Are there?

2195
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,740
Well, I was thinking about that.

2196
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,820
Those were kind of critters, but not anymore.

2197
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,020
Now are there any?

2198
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:52,020
Do you consider the Minions critters?

2199
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:52,840
No.

2200
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,680
Okay.

2201
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,660
I feel like a critter has to have furry.

2202
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,460
What about Woody Woodpecker?

2203
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:00,940
Yeah, see a big presence in Orlando.

2204
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,380
I've never been to Orlando.

2205
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,340
I've never been to Disney World.

2206
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:05,620
Everyone says Disney World's bigger than Disneyland.

2207
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:06,580
Like, I don't care.

2208
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:07,420
It's certainly bigger.

2209
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,240
You don't believe him.

2210
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,660
I don't believe him, sounds like a myth.

2211
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:12,020
What I think is that swamp air's getting to your brain.

2212
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,620
You're just humid, that's all you know.

2213
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,340
Nothing could be bigger than Disneyland.

2214
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,460
That doesn't make any sense.

2215
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:18,340
I don't need the castle to be bigger.

2216
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,860
It's not about the size.

2217
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,100
Sure, I hear that.

2218
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,940
It's about the charm.

2219
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:23,900
It's about the tarps covering it

2220
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,660
while it's getting repaired.

2221
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,800
So mynicechat.com can complain about the rest.

2222
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,660
There's real problems in the world, you know.

2223
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:36,280
Then a rusty shingle.

2224
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,900
Maybe that's what's good for you.

2225
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:42,100
If we stay mad about these little things,

2226
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,660
then we don't have to be mad about the bigger things

2227
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:46,140
that we can't control.

2228
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:49,060
Well, maybe we should rise up and tear down against these.

2229
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,580
It's time to move on from childish things.

2230
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,260
We could still be mad about shingles, though.

2231
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,100
All right.

2232
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,340
We'll do a shingles episode, too.

2233
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,100
You know, Walt, would you be allowed

2234
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,060
to dress as Walt in the park?

2235
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,940
Oh, I saw, in Tokyo, during Halloween time,

2236
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,380
there were a couple people dressed as Walt for Halloween.

2237
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:07,220
Really?

2238
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:08,780
You were in Disneyland with Walt?

2239
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:10,500
Yes.

2240
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,340
Walt Cosplayers.

2241
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,860
I sent somebody a photo of it, I think.

2242
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,500
That's kind of like dapper days, isn't it?

2243
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,940
Because that's all, you could just.

2244
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:21,860
You could get away with disembodied Walt for sure.

2245
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,660
Yeah, it might not be clear what you are exactly,

2246
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,620
but you would know.

2247
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,820
Your little pencil thin mustache.

2248
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:30,060
Is there an iconic Walt costume?

2249
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,060
How do you be him?

2250
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:33,780
Well, somebody with the statues, I guess.

2251
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:36,260
The person in Tokyo was painted like the statue.

2252
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,100
Wow.

2253
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,300
Like copper?

2254
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,580
Yes.

2255
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:42,500
Like somebody you'd see over outside the movie theater

2256
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,220
in Burbank doing a dance or something.

2257
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:46,220
Which I see regularly.

2258
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:49,380
I see Lumiere regularly over in Burbank

2259
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,540
doing a dance outside.

2260
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,420
What?

2261
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:55,500
Yeah, a person dressed sort of like Lumiere with lights.

2262
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:59,220
There's also a full on rave light,

2263
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,780
bodysuit man that dances, too.

2264
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:06,780
I gotta say, for as sleepy downtown Burbank,

2265
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:11,940
as normal as Burbank can be, the buskers are very odd.

2266
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:14,940
There's a guy I've seen in front of the AMC,

2267
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,740
he will sing along to music,

2268
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:19,140
but they're not the karaoke tracks of songs.

2269
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:20,100
They're the full.

2270
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:20,940
Oh yeah.

2271
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:23,260
And he just sings over the actual singer.

2272
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:24,300
Yes, sure.

2273
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,700
There's a lot going on.

2274
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:26,540
Yeah.

2275
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,380
It's jarring.

2276
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,540
It is the nightlife in Burbank.

2277
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:31,380
You wouldn't think, but on a Friday and Saturday,

2278
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,580
that place gets going.

2279
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:36,300
You could get saved in front of a Skechers.

2280
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:38,460
That's true, too.

2281
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,300
Sure.

2282
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:42,020
You find Christ, then you go eat raw cookie dough.

2283
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:42,860
Oh yeah.

2284
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,180
Yeah, a little too much.

2285
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,020
Too much.

2286
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,660
That cookie dough business, I give them a year.

2287
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:48,500
I, I-

2288
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,740
Does a cookie dough business?

2289
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,580
Yeah, you just eat raw cookie dough.

2290
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:54,020
It's like an ice cream parlor, but with just cookie dough.

2291
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,460
They will mix it with ice cream,

2292
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,340
which Mike has said is much better than just the raw cookie.

2293
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,260
I have, yes.

2294
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:00,100
Is it good?

2295
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:00,940
No.

2296
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:01,780
No.

2297
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:04,500
It's much better than something else, but still not good.

2298
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,620
Jason, I'm both excited.

2299
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,940
A friend of mine had said, cause I was saying,

2300
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,980
oh, they're opening this cookie dough place in Burbank.

2301
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,780
He goes, not, it's not good.

2302
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:12,900
Whatever it is, he goes, it's,

2303
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,820
cause they have, this has been popping up around America.

2304
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:18,420
It's cookie dough places, much like ice cream.

2305
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:21,820
You'd see, oh, M&M cookie dough or whatever,

2306
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,020
sprinkles cookie dough.

2307
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,220
And I went in there and I ate a little bit of it

2308
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:29,020
and I was like, oh my God, no, like it's too much.

2309
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:29,860
Too much sugar.

2310
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:30,700
It's way too much sugar.

2311
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:31,540
Too pure.

2312
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,380
Too rich.

2313
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,340
It's not like, cause some cookie dough is,

2314
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,740
they like treat it beyond what regular cookie dough would be.

2315
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,260
Yeah, well there's no eggs.

2316
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,420
You can't, you know, they remove the eggs.

2317
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:44,900
Yeah, so that, so it's just,

2318
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,620
I can't imagine it's gonna last.

2319
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,460
It's like,

2320
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,280
But it has been popping up,

2321
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,820
the different places have been popping up.

2322
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,860
We better do the episode soon then.

2323
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:53,180
Shut your mouth.

2324
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,900
Two hours on a cookie dough place?

2325
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:55,740
Yeah.

2326
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,580
That's fine.

2327
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:58,740
I imagine we could do it.

2328
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:02,260
I can't handle, like, I don't really like liquor neat.

2329
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:05,500
Like I need ice or soda water or something.

2330
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,100
And I think maybe you were saying if you add ice cream

2331
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,100
and they mix the ice cream with the cookie dough,

2332
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,260
it helps a little, but.

2333
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:13,820
Add liquor, man.

2334
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,380
I mean, maybe if you add liquor.

2335
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,500
Add some tequila to that peanut butter dough.

2336
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,500
Sure.

2337
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,180
Swirl your sprinkles.

2338
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:21,020
Yeah.

2339
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,340
It would be fun if on the train they could,

2340
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:26,220
like if you could have like an old fashioned

2341
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,260
or like a Manhattan.

2342
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,100
Yeah.

2343
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:28,940
Or the ultimate.

2344
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:31,540
Or even a Saks-Barilla or something.

2345
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:32,380
Oh yeah.

2346
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:33,500
They need a little selection.

2347
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,860
That's like any ride you can comfortably eat on,

2348
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,700
eat and drink and like put your feet up.

2349
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:38,540
Well they do let you, don't they?

2350
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,380
They do, they can take you up.

2351
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,220
They don't really bother you.

2352
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,060
I'm eating popcorn on there.

2353
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,860
They're not supposed to, but I don't think they say anything.

2354
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,060
What are they gonna do, throw me off?

2355
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,020
Sure.

2356
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,700
I dare them to try.

2357
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,180
I'll go on something else.

2358
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:50,540
You know, I got this tattoo.

2359
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,980
Never gotten to the front of the line at Big Thunder Mountain.

2360
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,020
Do you always show it?

2361
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:59,020
I don't consciously go, um, but I don't not show it.

2362
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,580
But if you have, let me ask you this,

2363
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:03,940
while walking up, have you rolled your sleeve up before?

2364
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,220
Well, usually I run hot.

2365
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:07,420
So I always got short sleeves on generally always that.

2366
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:08,540
Sure.

2367
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,420
What if it's a real chilly winter day though?

2368
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:12,380
Then I know I won't make a point to show it.

2369
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,580
Not if I'm wearing a comfy hoodie or something.

2370
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:15,460
I would if I were you.

2371
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,860
I would really like make a show.

2372
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,460
At least maybe get a sticker.

2373
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:22,300
Do you get remarks from the employees?

2374
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,140
Never.

2375
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:23,960
Really?

2376
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,800
Yeah, nothing.

2377
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,540
I get more when I wear a button with a birthday.

2378
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:29,020
They're just not noticing it then.

2379
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:29,860
They must.

2380
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:30,700
You're being too modest.

2381
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,540
I guess.

2382
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:33,100
I don't want to be in your face.

2383
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:36,300
I think one day, yeah, the next time you go,

2384
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,780
really lay it on thick.

2385
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:38,940
I just wear a shirt that says like,

2386
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:41,340
ask me about my Disneyland tattoo.

2387
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,180
Sure.

2388
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,000
Oh yeah.

2389
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,740
And a big arrow pointing to where it is.

2390
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:45,580
Yeah, yeah.

2391
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,300
I would hope.

2392
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,540
Yeah, you deserve more.

2393
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,220
Then they'll give you a drink on the train.

2394
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,740
You deserve more for doing that.

2395
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:52,560
That's what I'm saying.

2396
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,400
Yeah.

2397
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,240
Show some respect.

2398
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,780
They're a plucky mom and pop operation.

2399
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:56,900
I'm supporting them.

2400
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:00,780
They need you as a customer.

2401
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:04,260
So I think we'd be remiss if we didn't talk about how.

2402
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,820
For years, the Disneyland Railroad was sponsored

2403
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:10,900
by the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway.

2404
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,260
And as such, the locomotives are named

2405
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:16,540
after the former heads of this rail company,

2406
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:17,380
CK Holiday.

2407
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:19,020
We'd be so remiss.

2408
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,860
I can't tell you how remiss we'd be.

2409
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:24,620
E.P. Ripley, Fred Gurley, Ernest S. March,

2410
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:27,340
and the one outlier, the most recent train,

2411
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:31,140
named after former Disney employee, Ward Kimball.

2412
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,980
Ward Kimball and Ollie Johnson, of course.

2413
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:35,900
The man who expressed the concern about.

2414
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:36,740
The cattle car.

2415
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,340
The cattle car being dangerous.

2416
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,860
Train enthusiasts, Ward Kimball and Ollie Johnson,

2417
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:47,300
helped learn about trains and the train community

2418
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,820
and rebuilding trains and that sort of thing.

2419
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:52,740
Is it like, truly, I feel like the rides aren't sponsored

2420
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:53,860
like they used to be anymore.

2421
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:55,580
Like FedEx presents Space Mountain.

2422
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,420
You know what I mean?

2423
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,620
Duracell used to be Star Tours.

2424
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:00,860
It's not as often.

2425
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:03,820
Ziploc just started sponsoring Splash Mountain.

2426
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:05,420
I don't like that, that seems cheap.

2427
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,540
What a cheap product.

2428
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,860
But they have bags to put your little stuff in.

2429
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:10,380
That's why you get the bags now.

2430
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,220
You get a little bag.

2431
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,860
A hack my family's been doing for years.

2432
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:15,380
Well before the sponsorship.

2433
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:17,180
I just feel like Ziploc doesn't go,

2434
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:19,820
Ziploc feels plasticky.

2435
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:21,340
But Critter Country feels like.

2436
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:22,780
Zippity doo dah.

2437
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:26,460
Are they taking advantage of that?

2438
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:27,860
Are they doing Ziploc?

2439
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:28,700
Zippity doo dah?

2440
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:29,540
I guess so.

2441
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:30,380
Just occurred to me now,

2442
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,100
but it would make a lot of sense, right?

2443
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,820
I guess Ziploc feels more like a Tomorrowland product.

2444
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,940
The House of the Future type of a thing.

2445
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:39,780
It is an amazing innovation.

2446
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:40,620
Yes.

2447
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:44,220
I'm still blown away by Ziploc bags is what I'm saying.

2448
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,380
That feels like a first year Disneyland attraction.

2449
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:51,380
Like, zip bags, zip the bags of the future.

2450
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:52,980
Come to Zipland.

2451
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:54,860
You can play with one, not take home.

2452
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,740
You can just look at one and handle it

2453
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:57,580
and then put it back.

2454
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,020
All right, you've had your time.

2455
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:00,180
Five minutes, give it back.

2456
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,700
A better splash mountain than the sponsor of like.

2457
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,300
Like cow hide or something?

2458
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:06,660
Logs, firewood.

2459
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:07,660
Dura Flame?

2460
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:08,980
Dura Flame, sponsor of Splash Mountain.

2461
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,620
Dura Flame is good, yeah.

2462
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:11,460
That's great.

2463
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,620
Can you get a little piece of wood on the way out?

2464
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:14,460
I always do.

2465
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,300
I give you wood.

2466
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:16,940
No.

2467
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:19,660
That's all right.

2468
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:25,380
But that's a pretty good deal if you come back to you.

2469
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:26,740
I mean, you have to like have the patience

2470
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,860
to carry a log out of Disneyland with you.

2471
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,860
Yeah, but I mean, it's a free log.

2472
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:33,140
People buy clocks and like things.

2473
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,660
Yeah, that's true.

2474
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:35,860
People buy framed art.

2475
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:38,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2476
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,860
But not quite as heavy as a log.

2477
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,540
Sorry, just to correct myself.

2478
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:47,540
Emperor Hirohito rode in the Lily Bell in 1975, not 1976.

2479
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:48,380
Oh my God.

2480
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:49,300
Didn't you say he was the first?

2481
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,140
He was the first.

2482
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:50,980
I'm still writing your letter.

2483
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,180
Yeah, he was still the first.

2484
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:53,020
Still the first.

2485
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:54,060
Just off by one year.

2486
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:58,500
And who is the, who's Zeus in Hercules again?

2487
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,340
Riptorn.

2488
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:00,740
Okay, just making sure.

2489
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:03,300
And did you have a train conductor's hat?

2490
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:06,380
Jory's still out, but leading towards the end.

2491
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,060
We should do recaps more often.

2492
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:11,980
Scott, this is, you know, the current train stations

2493
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,980
were not always the train stations.

2494
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,300
Of course, there was the Frontierland station.

2495
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:18,780
For a brief time, there was the Videopolis station.

2496
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:21,220
Oh, you know it, a little extension of Videopolis.

2497
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:22,060
Little extension.

2498
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:24,900
Which there wasn't, there used to be a Fantasyland one

2499
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,180
that disappeared entirely, and there just wasn't a stop

2500
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:28,580
up there for a long time.

2501
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:30,700
But I think in the effort to have all the trains

2502
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,660
running at once, they're like, well, we need more stops

2503
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,100
to make that possible.

2504
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:36,540
So you got a little extra Videopolis.

2505
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:39,020
It wasn't like quite, there wasn't much aesthetically

2506
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,540
going on, but I just like seeing that word

2507
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,940
in a second place.

2508
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:45,980
My favorites, the Disneyland 80s dance club.

2509
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,460
Oh.

2510
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:51,500
That they put up to get the MTV crowd.

2511
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,540
That MTV crowd.

2512
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,380
Yeah, yeah.

2513
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:56,940
So when they built Toontown, did they reroute the track?

2514
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:01,340
I think they, well, you go under the train, right?

2515
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:06,340
So I think they just put foam rubber up

2516
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:08,420
over the Videopolis station, essentially.

2517
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:09,260
Oh, no.

2518
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:10,100
I think it's the same station.

2519
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,380
The track's been rerouted a number of times

2520
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,220
over the years.

2521
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:14,300
But they try to not do it.

2522
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:16,540
That's one of those Disneyland 101 things,

2523
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:18,780
that the train sits atop the berm,

2524
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,580
and there's a lot of stuff you can do

2525
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,860
construction-wise at Disneyland,

2526
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:23,700
but you can't really move that berm.

2527
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,460
So that's why Indiana Jones, you gotta walk

2528
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:27,900
all the way under it, and a lot of the rides out there,

2529
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:31,020
same with Pirates on a Mansion, with Star Wars,

2530
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,820
pretty significant that they had to move the train track.

2531
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:36,380
There's a left turn now, the first left turn.

2532
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,980
There is now a left turn.

2533
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:39,980
Now a left turn.

2534
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:41,660
This is not what Walt intended.

2535
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:43,580
There was.

2536
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,660
Yeah, that's getting the mice chatters.

2537
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:49,260
That was an aggressive response that people had

2538
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,060
when this news was announced,

2539
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,780
because they were gonna shorten,

2540
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:55,540
or shrink Tom Sawyer's Island a little bit,

2541
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:57,140
and then now the route was gonna go

2542
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,660
in front of the Rivers of America,

2543
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:01,620
and people were fit to be tied.

2544
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,820
They were so upset about this,

2545
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:06,700
because they thought they were gonna lose the island.

2546
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,620
They thought that this was gonna make

2547
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:09,660
the whole thing short.

2548
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:12,260
They thought Mark Twain was now maybe not even gonna happen,

2549
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,540
or it was gonna be two minutes long,

2550
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:15,940
and they were all wrong.

2551
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,020
It's beautiful.

2552
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,860
It's better.

2553
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:18,700
It's really good.

2554
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:19,540
It's honestly better.

2555
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:21,540
Yes, it's a Disneyland enhancement.

2556
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:23,980
The first time you and I took that,

2557
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:27,740
brought the new train, that was a great day.

2558
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:30,420
That was, I was legitimately impressed.

2559
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:32,460
It is prettier, there's new stuff.

2560
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:33,740
It's so much more scenic.

2561
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:34,580
Yeah, yeah.

2562
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:35,420
I love those canoes,

2563
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,060
because I didn't do the canoes for the first time

2564
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,100
until a couple years ago,

2565
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,140
and you see more critters than you've ever seen before.

2566
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:41,980
Yeah.

2567
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:42,820
There's all sorts of critters.

2568
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:43,660
There's all sorts of critters.

2569
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:44,500
A murder beaver.

2570
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:46,300
He was chewing on one of the posts,

2571
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,820
holding up the train bridge.

2572
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:48,660
That's fun.

2573
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:49,500
Yeah.

2574
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,320
Good for him.

2575
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,160
That's easy.

2576
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:52,000
That's a critter I love.

2577
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,820
Maybe that's my next tattoo, the murder beaver.

2578
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:54,660
Ooh, yeah.

2579
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:55,500
That's a good one.

2580
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,780
He's industrious.

2581
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,620
Yeah.

2582
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:58,460
Yeah.

2583
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,300
He doesn't give a shit about your infrastructure.

2584
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,540
And he's protecting his beavers.

2585
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,020
He's providing for his family.

2586
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:04,860
Yeah.

2587
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:05,700
Yeah, you have to respect that.

2588
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:07,620
All of those bodies will soon be in the water

2589
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,020
for his family to eat.

2590
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,460
He'll take their wallets.

2591
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:12,540
Oh, yeah.

2592
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,380
And their watches.

2593
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:15,580
I don't know what good money is for beavers,

2594
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:17,860
but shiny coins.

2595
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:18,860
I love a shiny coin.

2596
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:21,660
Yeah, that's a cool thing for them to build a nest out of.

2597
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:22,660
What does a beaver in?

2598
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:24,860
Do you guys go to Tom Sawyer Island?

2599
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:25,700
Not really.

2600
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,540
No.

2601
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:27,620
I think it's a hidden gem.

2602
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:28,460
Yeah.

2603
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:30,180
There's scary things in it.

2604
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:33,020
There's more caves, more tunnels.

2605
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,780
Well, it's kind of piracy still, right?

2606
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:37,100
Or it's pirates lair at Tom Sawyer Island.

2607
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:39,740
Yes, I guess it's not Tom Sawyer, Tom Sawyer.

2608
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:40,580
Tom Sawyer.

2609
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,420
I saw it.

2610
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:43,580
When he can't make it to the bathroom,

2611
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:45,060
he's a Tom Sawyer.

2612
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,180
When he gets too scared.

2613
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,700
Yeah.

2614
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:50,420
Tom Sawyer Island is still in Orlando,

2615
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:53,740
and Aunt Polly's, the restaurant on Tom Sawyer Island

2616
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:54,580
has reopened up.

2617
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:57,260
They do like sandwiches and stuff on the island.

2618
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:01,500
They do pretty simple PB&J and pulled pork sandwiches.

2619
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,220
Yeah, you gotta enjoy it now.

2620
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:05,940
There's a restaurant on the island.

2621
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,820
I mean, I love a restaurant on an island in general.

2622
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:09,660
Sure?

2623
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:12,580
The restroom on Tom Sawyer Island should be Tom Sawyer.

2624
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:13,420
There you go.

2625
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,220
That would be good.

2626
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:16,060
That makes sense.

2627
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,620
And then it's still male Tom Sawyers

2628
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:20,220
and female Tom Sawyers.

2629
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:21,060
Yeah.

2630
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:21,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2631
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:24,700
Let me gripe real quick.

2632
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,540
Yeah.

2633
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:26,740
Why aren't all the cars,

2634
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:29,980
why aren't all the seats in all of the cars facing out?

2635
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:30,820
Exactly.

2636
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:31,740
Right, because some of them face forward.

2637
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:33,500
Right, so no drivers in those.

2638
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,060
Exactly, so it's such a bummer

2639
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,540
when you're waiting for the train

2640
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:39,420
and the front facing ones pull up.

2641
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:41,020
Oh, I don't know about that.

2642
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:41,860
What are you talking about?

2643
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:43,500
Well, it's a different experience.

2644
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:44,460
It's a worse experience.

2645
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:45,300
It's a worse experience.

2646
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,140
It's a hurt your neck.

2647
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:47,900
I wanna turn to my right.

2648
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:48,820
No, thank you.

2649
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:49,700
I'm sitting forward.

2650
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,300
Of course, if you go way to the left

2651
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,980
and you're trying to see primeval world,

2652
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,420
like how, that's a pain.

2653
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:56,060
Well, maybe that trip you just enjoy

2654
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,300
the wonders of real travel.

2655
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,420
Wait, are you telling me no bit

2656
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,060
that you don't get a little disappointed

2657
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,940
when you get the Disneyland train with a car

2658
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:07,260
that has the front facing seats?

2659
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:08,740
No, because I've gone a lot.

2660
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:13,100
Whatever pulls up, I gets in.

2661
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:15,300
That's what life has provided and you will accept.

2662
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,260
I guess that's a Zen way of thinking about it.

2663
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:18,100
Very Buddhist.

2664
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,140
But it's bad.

2665
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,500
They should have them all front facing.

2666
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,220
I don't know why you would ever want to.

2667
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:24,700
I would not be upset if they replaced them all,

2668
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:27,180
but I don't mind terribly.

2669
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:28,700
I wonder if they just fit more people

2670
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,140
with the front facing ones.

2671
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:30,980
What's that?

2672
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:33,460
I wonder if they just fit more people in that way.

2673
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:34,980
I don't know how that works.

2674
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,820
That might be right, but who cares?

2675
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:40,100
At the very least, they should give you guns or something

2676
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,060
to interactive shoot things.

2677
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,580
It should be like Buzz Lightyear on the train.

2678
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:45,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2679
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:46,620
That was a pretty good plus up.

2680
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,820
Yeah, it gets, I don't want to shoot a critter,

2681
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:54,820
but maybe some guys, a bandit of some sort,

2682
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:57,860
a Billy the Kid, an outlaw.

2683
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:00,700
Would you be comfortable shooting a dinosaur?

2684
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:01,980
If it's attacking me.

2685
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:05,460
Okay, if it's an aggressive, so the train goes really close

2686
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:07,700
to a, you're kind of looking at some pterodactyls

2687
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,060
in the distance, then all of a sudden,

2688
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:10,900
ah, there's one right in front of your face.

2689
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:13,260
If there's a triangle with a neon lit up triangle on it,

2690
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,460
I'm gonna shoot that fucker.

2691
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you only see triangles.

2692
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:17,860
I've been on Buzz Lightyear,

2693
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:19,620
because when I went with my nephews,

2694
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:21,900
they were like, it was one of the only rides they could do,

2695
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,180
because they were like three,

2696
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:25,740
so I've done it like 10 or 20 times,

2697
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,500
and so I know where all the hidden things are.

2698
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,940
Oh yeah, the one that's not lit up in the tunnel.

2699
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:31,500
Yeah, the ceiling ones, and yeah, yeah,

2700
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,980
I like to think I'm pretty good at it.

2701
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:33,820
Sure, sure.

2702
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:37,140
What if you could like, if you like hit a big target

2703
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:42,140
that made like a big boulder, or that made the asteroid fall.

2704
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:44,340
Oh, that'd be fun.

2705
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,260
Crush the dinosaurs.

2706
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:47,100
That'd be good.

2707
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,060
That'd be created the Grand Canyon.

2708
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:49,660
Uh-huh. There you go.

2709
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:52,060
The biggest target creates the Grand Canyon.

2710
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:53,340
Man, I mean, that would be great.

2711
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:57,300
I still, would I trade, would I still be okay

2712
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,020
with the front-facing seats if I got guns?

2713
01:30:59,020 --> 01:30:59,860
I'm still trying to think about it, I guess.

2714
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:01,460
I don't know, because if you're in the middle with the gun,

2715
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:02,820
I feel like you're never gonna,

2716
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:03,900
you're not gonna get anything.

2717
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,380
It would be great if you were facing out and had guns.

2718
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:09,420
What if they added a monitor on every car

2719
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,820
that had Jimmy Fallon in it?

2720
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:13,660
Doing like a fun bit or something.

2721
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:14,500
Okay, all right.

2722
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,700
I've always loved trains.

2723
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:17,900
I've definitely, for sure, way before this,

2724
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,180
loved trains the best.

2725
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:25,500
Yeah, now I'm seeing it and I'm loving it in my head.

2726
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,580
Oh, seeing him in a little conductor uniform.

2727
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:28,580
Yeah, he'd be great.

2728
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:30,100
Oh, he'd be like so sharp.

2729
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:32,020
The choo-choo song.

2730
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:36,180
I saw a video where Rami Malek touches his hand,

2731
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,980
like Jimmy Fallon's hand, and he flinches.

2732
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:43,420
I think he does not like being touched

2733
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,460
or he doesn't like his hand being touched.

2734
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:47,300
Look it up.

2735
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:48,460
All right, we'll look that up.

2736
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:51,980
Is it still sensitive from when he had his accident?

2737
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:53,620
Well, he kept having like three,

2738
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:55,580
like he fell down three times, right?

2739
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,860
Yeah, but he got the ring caught on the counter,

2740
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:59,580
I think is what that story was.

2741
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,940
Was he just like, pretty drinking too much?

2742
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:02,780
He eyed away.

2743
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:05,980
All he had was a vodka drink, then a whiskey drink,

2744
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,060
then a lager drink, then a cider drink.

2745
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:08,900
All right.

2746
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:11,500
He's too 90s nostalgic.

2747
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:15,380
He takes too many ideas from old songs.

2748
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:16,220
Yeah.

2749
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:20,660
Speaking of train drunkenness,

2750
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:25,660
the video of when they reopened the train

2751
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,340
and they had Lasseter in a conductor uniform.

2752
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:31,660
Oh no. Jesus Christ.

2753
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:33,900
That's not an image we need.

2754
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,020
Because he was sort of like,

2755
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:38,140
he was kind of the PR guy for the train thing

2756
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:41,940
and really just selling, the train's a big part of Disney

2757
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:42,940
and we're so excited the train's back.

2758
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,540
But that was like the first that I was like,

2759
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:47,100
something's up with the Lasseter.

2760
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,460
That was your first red flag?

2761
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:51,500
He's so red and so puffy.

2762
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,300
Well, because he bought a train

2763
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,340
that I think Ward Kimball used to own

2764
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:58,700
and they put it on the track for the grand opening,

2765
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:00,220
this other train.

2766
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:01,700
He's a train weirdo too,

2767
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,700
because in that documentary about his house,

2768
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,300
he's got a train going in and out of his room.

2769
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,980
I feel like you can't be into trains and Hawaiian shirts.

2770
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:10,820
It's one or the other.

2771
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:11,660
Too many train things.

2772
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:12,620
Too many red flag things.

2773
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,780
Too many, it's unsettling.

2774
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:15,620
Either trains or...

2775
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:18,300
And then also working animation, no, no, no.

2776
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,820
What if, maybe you could be into like Tiki stuff, right?

2777
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:21,940
That's totally fine.

2778
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:24,380
Honestly, isn't Tiki just cultural appropriation

2779
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,460
on every level?

2780
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:28,260
That's a thing I've talked about.

2781
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:30,220
I like it, I have a couple over here.

2782
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:32,380
But I don't disagree with what you're saying.

2783
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:33,220
I know.

2784
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:34,820
I feel like you just even putting this out there

2785
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:37,380
is gonna make it bad, so maybe we should cut this out.

2786
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:39,060
Okay, cut it out, cut it out.

2787
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:40,900
No, no, it won't cut it out.

2788
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,660
Tiki will be over once this podcast,

2789
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:43,500
the right episode comes out.

2790
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,460
We just killed it?

2791
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:45,300
Yeah, it's over.

2792
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:46,540
Tiki's canceled.

2793
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,900
Trader Sam's just become Sam's.

2794
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,740
It's just an old guy.

2795
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:52,460
Hi, welcome. From Cheers?

2796
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,180
Yeah, it's just Sam from Cheers.

2797
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:55,780
Can I get you a LaBats?

2798
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,460
Is this a fake memory I have?

2799
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:01,060
I remember the final episode of Cheers.

2800
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:02,780
Sam takes off his toupee.

2801
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:06,260
Is this a memory that I've made up in my brain?

2802
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:07,940
I thought he just turned the lights off.

2803
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:11,060
He hangs it on the light switch and then turns it off.

2804
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,300
This might be one of the stuff,

2805
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:15,060
sometimes you dream things and then you keep remembering

2806
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:17,900
for so long you forget that it was sourced from a dream.

2807
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:20,300
Yeah, I think I've made it.

2808
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,220
Ted Danson, we're talking Ted Danson's character.

2809
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,780
I have this vision, it's in front of Carla.

2810
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:27,260
And it's like the bar is closed

2811
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:28,780
and it's like a vulnerable moment

2812
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:30,220
that he takes off his toupee.

2813
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:32,300
Well, I don't think it's the last scene or anything,

2814
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,140
but maybe it happened.

2815
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:34,900
What about the end of the series?

2816
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,740
I've always thought of Ted Danson

2817
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:37,740
as having a very thick head of hair.

2818
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:40,340
Because I know, I've looked it up on YouTube,

2819
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:42,780
couldn't find anything, so maybe I'm insane.

2820
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:45,460
That sounds familiar, but I don't know that that's a,

2821
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:49,340
I found a pic, here's Sam holding hair.

2822
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:53,460
That's just a hairy found in the bar.

2823
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:54,780
He's just doing a DNA test.

2824
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:55,740
I think you're mixing stuff.

2825
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:57,460
Maybe you're mixing things up.

2826
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,820
I might be mixing things up.

2827
01:34:58,820 --> 01:34:59,860
She's like shocked.

2828
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:01,340
Yeah, he has his hair still in that.

2829
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:03,980
All right, all right, maybe I'm just mixing things up.

2830
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:06,060
I usually don't like to share dreams I had,

2831
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:07,620
but I remember I shared on the show

2832
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:10,500
a dream I had about booking hotel reservations.

2833
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,500
This is a different dream I had last night.

2834
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,740
I just remembered it.

2835
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:16,900
It was that I was going into the Star Wars hotel

2836
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,300
that's being built in Orlando

2837
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:19,620
that's gonna be very immersive

2838
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:21,980
and you won't even see any windows outside.

2839
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:26,980
And it was so, the dream was so methodical and unpleasant

2840
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:32,100
that they transported us to the hotel somehow with magic,

2841
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:33,820
but then all of a sudden I had no clothes on

2842
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:35,980
and we just got thrown into showers.

2843
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:36,820
Whoa, Jesus.

2844
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:39,420
Like a weird bio-Matrix type thing

2845
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:41,980
where it's all of a sudden we're all nude

2846
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:43,700
and going hustled somewhere.

2847
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:44,860
Like 12 monkeys.

2848
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:45,700
Yes.

2849
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:46,540
Time travel.

2850
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:47,380
No, no.

2851
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:48,860
And I woke up with, I had a little headache

2852
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:51,300
when I went to bed, but I woke up with a bad headache.

2853
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:54,820
So I had a stress dream about a very realistic space hotel

2854
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:56,620
that I went to and going through

2855
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,660
what you would actually have to do to go to a space hotel

2856
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:02,660
and get decontaminated before you went on a space station.

2857
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:04,140
Too much attention to detail.

2858
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:04,980
Yes.

2859
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:09,180
Like all this stuff off camera that Poe Dameron

2860
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,500
or Leia had to go through in A New Hope

2861
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:14,140
where they are tortured off camera.

2862
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:15,740
That is what you experienced.

2863
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:17,060
Oh, and Han gets.

2864
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:17,900
Oh, and Han, of course.

2865
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:18,740
Yeah.

2866
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,580
I think you were thinking Han gets tortured in a pair.

2867
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:25,340
I don't acknowledge the actual terrifying torture

2868
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:27,500
that happens to all of our favorite characters

2869
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,420
when they're not swinging lightsabers around.

2870
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:32,780
I hate to share a dream, but this is very quick and stupid.

2871
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:33,620
Please.

2872
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:35,820
I used to, I would be excited for movies.

2873
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:37,540
I would dream them before I saw them.

2874
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:39,060
And I was at the time very excited

2875
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:40,540
for the Flintstones movie.

2876
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,620
Who wasn't sure.

2877
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:43,940
How are they gonna realize this?

2878
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:44,980
What's it gonna look like?

2879
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:46,220
I can't imagine.

2880
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:49,620
But in my dream, the movie was a concert film

2881
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,700
of Flintstones on ice.

2882
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,540
And I was so disappointed.

2883
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:54,380
Whoa.

2884
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,820
I was like, that is the worst possible version

2885
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:00,220
of the Flintstones movie was a concert film

2886
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:01,980
of the Flintstones on ice.

2887
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:03,380
Is Flintstones on ice real?

2888
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:04,220
No, I don't think so.

2889
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:05,060
Okay.

2890
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,740
That's what I was wondering.

2891
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:10,100
As we see, I have an active, inaccurate, imagined brain.

2892
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,700
Well, I mean, there was at Universal Hollywood,

2893
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:14,540
there was a Flintstones restaurant

2894
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,860
for an obscenely long time.

2895
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:20,140
Like when I first went in 2006, it was kind of a stand.

2896
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:22,340
I think we all want that big ribs, those big ribs, right?

2897
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,180
I guess that, yeah.

2898
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:24,020
I did have ribs.

2899
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:26,220
But there were so many sitting out in the sun,

2900
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:27,340
just rotting away.

2901
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:28,500
It was a gross restaurant.

2902
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,540
And you'd walk by and you'd get hit with that smell.

2903
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,980
You'd get hit with the bad barbecue smell.

2904
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:35,820
There was a cloud of it, like just on the main hub

2905
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:36,660
when you were walking in.

2906
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:38,420
And it was by a midway, too.

2907
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:40,140
It was by games and stuff.

2908
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:41,140
Is this in Orlando?

2909
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:41,980
No, it's here.

2910
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:42,820
No, this was Hollywood.

2911
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:44,180
It's the entrance, it's exactly where

2912
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:45,340
Harry Potter entrance is now.

2913
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:46,180
Oh.

2914
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:47,500
It was this big Flintstones thing.

2915
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,460
Wow, I missed that.

2916
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:52,900
Flintstones on ice is just Fred eating the big rack of ribs

2917
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,140
with no dialogue or music.

2918
01:37:57,380 --> 01:38:00,340
And then just sauce splattering on the ice.

2919
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:02,500
Yells at Wilma to go away.

2920
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,060
Trying to get some peace.

2921
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:08,780
There would have to be little animals

2922
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:12,020
as the skates, though, too, that were acting as the skates.

2923
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:12,860
Oh, yeah.

2924
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:14,820
Like an upside down baby stegosaurus or something.

2925
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:15,660
Oh, no.

2926
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:17,180
Jesus, like biting it with his teeth.

2927
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:18,020
A baby?

2928
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:19,220
He doesn't understand.

2929
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:21,700
This is the most unpleasant Flintstones job.

2930
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:26,100
A baby who's being crushed by a fat man

2931
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:28,660
who's with his teeth just grinding.

2932
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:30,700
But it's a living, Scott.

2933
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:31,860
It's a living.

2934
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,780
He says it with a lot more fear.

2935
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:34,860
It's a living.

2936
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:35,700
It's a living.

2937
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,140
I guess it's a living.

2938
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,820
I guess it's a living.

2939
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,980
My Pillsbury Doe Boy impression, too.

2940
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:41,820
What else did we miss?

2941
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:42,660
What else trains?

2942
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:43,500
What did we miss?

2943
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,020
The New Orleans Square Station plays

2944
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,020
as the Morse code of the opening day speech.

2945
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:48,860
Oh, yeah.

2946
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:49,700
Set it.

2947
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:50,540
Very good.

2948
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:52,180
Hit us rapid now.

2949
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:55,580
They traded one of the original train

2950
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:56,660
called the Ward Kimball.

2951
01:38:56,660 --> 01:39:00,380
They traded to Cedar Point for a different item.

2952
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:01,220
Oh, fact.

2953
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:02,540
Yeah, items.

2954
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:03,900
Item trades.

2955
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,260
We've kind of skipped around Primeval World.

2956
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:09,060
Can I say one more thing about it, which is,

2957
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:09,900
I think it's,

2958
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:13,060
is this just me or do you get this feeling

2959
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:15,740
when you essentially watch some dinosaurs

2960
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:20,340
just living their lives and then there's not enough water

2961
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:23,140
and they're lapping it up in those kind of scary,

2962
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:26,740
emaciated dinosaurs or trying to get the last few drops

2963
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:30,540
and then scary Tyrannosaurus scene

2964
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:34,380
and it feels very apocalyptic, like comets coming.

2965
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:37,700
Do you get this vibe, because it gets so scary,

2966
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:40,740
do you get this weird narrative feeling of like,

2967
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:42,980
well, let that be a lesson.

2968
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:45,420
The dinosaurs brought this upon themselves.

2969
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:46,260
For us.

2970
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:47,860
It's a lesson for us, not for them.

2971
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:49,980
No, I think it's telling us

2972
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,060
that these dinosaurs were fucked up

2973
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:54,660
and they deserve what they're getting.

2974
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:57,020
I was like dread from when I watched it.

2975
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:58,940
What should the dinosaurs have done differently?

2976
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:00,540
That's what I can't figure out.

2977
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:01,380
Yeah, I'm not sure.

2978
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:02,220
The dams, I guess?

2979
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:05,140
Yeah, they wanna have more water.

2980
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:06,740
They should have been beavers.

2981
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:09,620
Well, most people should be beavers.

2982
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:11,260
Yeah, I guess so.

2983
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:12,300
Is there any way to do that?

2984
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,420
I didn't know that the music that's playing

2985
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:16,740
is from the movie The Mysterious Island,

2986
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:18,740
which is a different movie than Island

2987
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:20,380
at the Top of the World.

2988
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:23,540
Both movies made by Walt Disney Studios.

2989
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:24,380
Walt Disney Productions.

2990
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:25,900
Well, we know where the island on the top of the world is.

2991
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:26,740
It's on top of the world.

2992
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:28,940
Mysterious Island could be anywhere.

2993
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:29,780
Yeah.

2994
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:31,140
Sorry, I prefer that one.

2995
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:32,140
It's more open-ended.

2996
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,180
There's a weird connection,

2997
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:34,940
because it's a mysterious island

2998
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:38,140
based loosely on the Jules Verne book,

2999
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:39,940
an island at the top of the world

3000
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:42,700
who was gonna be a big influence in Discovery Bay,

3001
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:45,620
which got the lack of success for that movie.

3002
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:47,180
I do love that music though,

3003
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:49,380
because it has that 50s dramatic of like,

3004
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,540
oh my God, there's dinosaurs.

3005
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:52,940
But then post-Jurassic Park,

3006
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:55,140
I feel we're more into the wonder.

3007
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:57,460
It's either wonder or horror.

3008
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,780
But the music in Primeval World

3009
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:01,260
feels more spectacular.

3010
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:02,900
Spectacular, yeah.

3011
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:05,220
Kind of Godzilla-ish, a little bit.

3012
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:08,620
Big, big old drums and kind of booming brass.

3013
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:10,620
Oh my God, speaking of drums and dinosaurs,

3014
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:13,580
then Jurassic Park, if they get rid of those drums

3015
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:15,980
before the T-Rex drop,

3016
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:17,740
you know in the Jurassic Park ride,

3017
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:20,940
there are amazing, it's literally the drums going,

3018
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:22,940
I see what you're saying.

3019
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:26,260
If they get rid of those drums, I'm gonna be livid.

3020
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:28,980
Don't know, don't know what the drum plan is.

3021
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:32,620
Oh yeah, look, I'm on the Inside Universal message board

3022
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:35,180
a lot, but there has not been a lot of talk about

3023
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:36,380
the drums and will they stay.

3024
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:39,300
The Jeep doesn't have to drop, just keep those drums.

3025
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,740
That Jeep didn't work for a long time, I feel like.

3026
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:44,740
That was, yeah, a very inconsistent Jeep.

3027
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:47,660
But maybe, I would say let's put like

3028
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:51,020
a Chris Pratt animatronic playing drums to really make,

3029
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:52,180
like where's it coming from?

3030
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:53,020
Where's that music coming from?

3031
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:55,380
Oh, he's like rocking out, like he twiddles a drumstick

3032
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:57,860
beforehand, he's real cool.

3033
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,660
A mouse rat reference.

3034
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:01,020
Yeah, from Jurassic Park.

3035
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:02,780
Or Bryce Dallas Howard's there with her arms crossed,

3036
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:03,620
shaking her head.

3037
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:04,460
Yep.

3038
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:07,540
Just like, get a load of him.

3039
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:09,860
I hope there's a ton of Bryce Dallas Howard animatronics

3040
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:10,980
and a ton of Chris Pratt animatronics.

3041
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:12,220
It's just gonna be on screens.

3042
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:14,380
Aaron, Aaron!

3043
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:16,180
Do you want a little spoiler?

3044
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:17,020
Yes!

3045
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:19,100
Audience, spoiler alert, I probably said it

3046
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,060
on the show already.

3047
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:23,020
There's gonna be a dinosaur fight at the end now.

3048
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:23,900
What?

3049
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:26,460
It's T-Rex versus whatever that big one was

3050
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:27,300
from the first one.

3051
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:29,260
They're both real dinosaurs.

3052
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:30,100
Oh, that's fun, yeah, I'm into that.

3053
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:31,340
Real dinosaurs.

3054
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:32,180
They're real, yeah.

3055
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:33,380
They've gone mad!

3056
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,580
They just made Jurassic Park?

3057
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:36,620
It's actually over.

3058
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:37,740
They've learned nothing!

3059
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:39,900
Yep, and they just like have a collar around them

3060
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:40,980
and they just pull them back each time.

3061
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:41,820
That's not gonna work.

3062
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:44,060
They said it's fine, they said it worked once.

3063
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:46,780
They can't get a Jeep to work, they're gonna do this?

3064
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,860
They need to beat Rise of the Resistance,

3065
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:50,980
so they're just gonna open it and see what happens.

3066
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:52,700
They just wanna beat them to the marketplace.

3067
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:54,380
Make a real Indominus Rex.

3068
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,940
Here's the thing I like on the train,

3069
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:58,940
seeing into Splash Mountain.

3070
01:42:58,940 --> 01:42:59,780
Yes!

3071
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:00,900
Because sometimes in the year,

3072
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,660
Splash Mountain is closed for maintenance.

3073
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:04,580
Well, it's not running with closed for maintenance,

3074
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:06,860
but sometimes it's just too cold to ride Splash Mountain.

3075
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:07,700
Right?

3076
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:09,540
And I just wanna see the big riverboat.

3077
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:10,420
I love that riverboat.

3078
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:12,580
What a joyful, that's so muppety.

3079
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:13,420
Yeah.

3080
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:14,580
Very much so, absolutely.

3081
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:15,740
Just a bunch of animals singing.

3082
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:17,460
I don't like those cats though.

3083
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:18,900
I find them unsettling.

3084
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:22,340
They're a little, they're just weird, I don't know.

3085
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:23,740
They just feel off to me.

3086
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:25,460
Not critters.

3087
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:26,300
Cats aren't critters?

3088
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:27,140
Not in my book.

3089
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:27,980
No, they probably are critters.

3090
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:28,820
Cats are critters.

3091
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:30,300
What if they're feral cats?

3092
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:32,180
I would call those critters.

3093
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:33,020
Yeah, I call them critters.

3094
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:33,860
They should be.

3095
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:34,980
But as soon as they're adopted,

3096
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:36,020
they're no longer a critter.

3097
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:37,140
Right, they're dead to us.

3098
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:39,900
Well, you know how we could figure out what critters are?

3099
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:42,380
What animals were the capital critters?

3100
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:44,420
Oh my God.

3101
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:45,820
Do you know what I'm talking about?

3102
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:46,660
Those rats?

3103
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:47,500
Were they all rats?

3104
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:52,500
A bunch of sharks, if Washington has any, in spaceship.

3105
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,380
Well, we'll look up capital critters.

3106
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,780
Are you looking up capital critters, Scott?

3107
01:43:55,780 --> 01:43:58,260
I am, but you know, I shouldn't just Google

3108
01:43:58,260 --> 01:43:59,580
and we'll figure it out later.

3109
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:00,420
Yeah, we'll figure it out later.

3110
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:01,260
We'll do our Patreon.

3111
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:02,740
Capital critters episode.

3112
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:05,660
Oh boy, I'm really scraping the bum, bro.

3113
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:08,220
Capital critters and fish police.

3114
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:09,620
Oh boy.

3115
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,060
You know what, I also like that

3116
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:15,500
Grand Canyon music when you come in.

3117
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,900
Don't, don't, don't.

3118
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:19,340
Oh yeah, that's like classic music, I think.

3119
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:20,180
Real mosey.

3120
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:22,900
Or it's, it's Bach.

3121
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:23,740
Something like that.

3122
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:25,980
Or I didn't recognize the name of it.

3123
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:27,580
I'm not sure, I like that though.

3124
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:29,060
That's one of those good.

3125
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:31,340
I like that there's so much like 50s, 60s music

3126
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:32,820
being played on kooky instruments

3127
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:33,740
throughout Disneyland. Yeah, yeah.

3128
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:35,500
And that's some of it.

3129
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:36,980
It's like a radio, it's the music you would hear

3130
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:40,700
in a radio play about a cowboy going down the trail.

3131
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:42,580
Oh yeah, somebody going into some weird little

3132
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:46,060
McMoman Pops shop, some weird little saloon

3133
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:47,900
or general store or something.

3134
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:50,380
That's gonna be some fiber.

3135
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:52,260
What's that?

3136
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:53,100
Raw fiber.

3137
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:53,940
Using raw fiber.

3138
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:57,260
It's what you'd hear when a cowboy was taking a load off.

3139
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:58,620
Yeah, I need an empty jug.

3140
01:44:58,620 --> 01:44:59,460
Sure.

3141
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:02,340
A little rope, a bindle.

3142
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:07,060
There's some charts on a bunch of Wikipedia pages

3143
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:09,700
about like transportation stuff has charts sometimes

3144
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:10,540
of the routes.

3145
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:12,220
Oh yeah.

3146
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:13,060
And it was pointing out that like,

3147
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:15,620
well technically you can disembark the train

3148
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:18,580
and transfer to the monorail in Tomorrowland.

3149
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:21,260
And vice versa, you could disembark in Tomorrowland

3150
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:23,420
on the monorail and then get on the train

3151
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:26,900
like you were, you know, transfer a bus to train.

3152
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:27,740
A transfer.

3153
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:29,380
And I thought that was very novel.

3154
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:33,420
Yeah, if you take, all right, I'm taking the train

3155
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:34,660
from New Orleans Square to Tomorrowland,

3156
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:36,500
transferring to the monorail.

3157
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,820
And going to Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen.

3158
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:39,660
Oh.

3159
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:42,660
As far as Jazz Kitchen goes,

3160
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:44,220
Ralph Brennan's got the best one.

3161
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:45,740
Gotta be.

3162
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:47,860
Certainly in the conversation.

3163
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:50,900
I bet there's an emerald out there

3164
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:51,980
that's giving him room for his,

3165
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:55,140
in terms of labeled jazz, name labeled jazz kitchens.

3166
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:56,820
Emerald Lagasse's Jazz Kitchen?

3167
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:57,660
I bet there's one.

3168
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:59,220
A blues patio?

3169
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:00,060
I don't know.

3170
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,740
Here's something for me to research.

3171
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:06,740
Are the beignets better at the Ralph Brennan's quick service

3172
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:09,020
than the New Orleans Square beignets?

3173
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:11,340
I do love seeing just blasts of powdered sugar

3174
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:13,500
on the ground around New Orleans Square

3175
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:17,020
where you just see people just making a mess.

3176
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:17,860
Sure.

3177
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:20,220
I like those, I'm not a big fan of them,

3178
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:21,980
alcohol-free mint juleps.

3179
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,140
What's the point?

3180
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:25,140
Yeah, it's just kind of a minty.

3181
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:25,980
I might as well have that.

3182
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:26,820
Mouthwash.

3183
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:27,660
Yeah.

3184
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,420
That's gotta change.

3185
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:30,820
When Star Wars land rolls around,

3186
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:31,660
we've talked about it too much.

3187
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,660
Doesn't have to be all alcohol, right?

3188
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:35,620
Isn't Orlando all Disneyland you can drink everywhere?

3189
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:37,940
You can't walk around with it in Magic Kingdom.

3190
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,180
There's some restaurants.

3191
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:40,380
But there's a lot of restaurants

3192
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:41,220
where you can get wine and beer now.

3193
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:43,580
Is that some Christian scientist thing?

3194
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:48,580
It's some weird message board, Walt wouldn't want stuff.

3195
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:50,220
Walt loves it straight.

3196
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:52,580
He wouldn't want Gay Days either, but we got that.

3197
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:53,420
Sure.

3198
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:54,580
Yes, but that was a fit.

3199
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:57,260
Disney only officially recognizing it in the last year.

3200
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:59,700
And people have snuck in alcohol for years.

3201
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:01,500
And they still don't call it Gay Day.

3202
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,340
They still are like, do they say even Pride?

3203
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,820
It's unofficial.

3204
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:08,500
And in fine print, it technically says,

3205
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:10,580
you chose to be gay days.

3206
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:11,420
Oh, I see.

3207
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:13,620
But they've been marketing Rainbow a lot.

3208
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:15,540
Jesus is crying day.

3209
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:17,340
They've certainly merchandised it.

3210
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:18,180
Absolutely.

3211
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:19,020
Yeah.

3212
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:20,500
My favorite is seeing straight guys

3213
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,300
who accidentally wore red that day,

3214
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:24,860
very aggressively holding their girlfriend's hands.

3215
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:27,060
I've seen that a few times.

3216
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:30,180
I once, actually, Andy Richter told me

3217
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:31,380
that he did that one time.

3218
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,700
He wore the Gay Day color and I had a Gay Day.

3219
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:36,260
I feel like I heard that story too.

3220
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:40,180
And he was down there with Andy Daly, with their kids.

3221
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:42,460
And they're like, look at this beautiful couple.

3222
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:44,940
That's a good couple.

3223
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:45,780
Yeah.

3224
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:46,620
Sure.

3225
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,740
Oh yeah, but Walt, with that weirdness,

3226
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:53,700
you know what Walt would want is to make a lot of money.

3227
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:54,540
Yeah, right?

3228
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:55,380
That's the number one thing Walt would want.

3229
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:57,100
He would like to profit.

3230
01:47:58,220 --> 01:47:59,700
No unions.

3231
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:00,540
Sure.

3232
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:03,180
He'd be very happy with the pay structure, I'm sure.

3233
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:07,820
Although maybe if Walt came back from the dead,

3234
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:13,780
on Gay Day, saw that there was alcohol available

3235
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:18,100
in one small section of Disneyland, in this one cantina.

3236
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:19,460
In Ogres Cantina.

3237
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:20,660
Which you have to get to past

3238
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:22,340
the rearranged rivers of America.

3239
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:25,340
He would go apeshit and start sawing down that train track,

3240
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:26,180
just like the-

3241
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:27,380
He'd be joining the Beaver?

3242
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:28,220
Yeah.

3243
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:32,980
Get me in on that entire train derails.

3244
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:36,860
Bob Iger would not be allowed to drive the train nowadays

3245
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:39,260
because of OSHA.

3246
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:41,940
Like when the Mark Twain first opened,

3247
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:45,340
they weren't sure how many they could fit on it

3248
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:47,780
and almost capsized a couple times.

3249
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:48,620
My God.

3250
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:50,980
Because they tried to squeeze 500 people on it.

3251
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:53,460
I think 300 is max capacity now.

3252
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:56,620
If I look like I'm gonna be number 101,

3253
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:57,660
I'm not getting all that thing.

3254
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:00,340
Why do I wanna be crowded on a boat?

3255
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:02,300
I mean, it is a leisurely boat ride.

3256
01:49:02,980 --> 01:49:04,500
But I don't wanna be packed like a sardine.

3257
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,100
I wanna be able to walk around.

3258
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:07,900
Of course, you wanna kind of a porch to yourself.

3259
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:08,740
I wanna mosey.

3260
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:09,580
Yeah.

3261
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,420
What a strange-

3262
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:12,460
I don't wanna be crammed onto the Mark Twain.

3263
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:13,300
Sure.

3264
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:15,940
You wanna feel like you're on that carnival shit cruise

3265
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:16,780
or whatever.

3266
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:17,620
Right?

3267
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:18,460
What a hellscape.

3268
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,460
I think they should bring back selling refreshments

3269
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:21,340
on the Mark Twain.

3270
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:22,180
That'd be fun.

3271
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:23,020
That would be fun.

3272
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:23,860
Even just chips and soda.

3273
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:24,780
They should get them water guns.

3274
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:26,700
Water pistols, they could shoot the crowd.

3275
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:27,540
Oh sure.

3276
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:28,380
Oh that's fun.

3277
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:29,220
It should be nice to be refreshing a little bit.

3278
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:31,980
I don't know why I have this 12 year old boy's idea.

3279
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:33,500
It's harmless.

3280
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:34,340
It's harmless, yeah.

3281
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:36,180
When everyone gets a slingshot.

3282
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:41,580
To tie it back to potential injuries

3283
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:45,220
and Walt inflicting train injuries,

3284
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:47,180
the one fact we missed

3285
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:48,940
with the Sorted History of Train accidents

3286
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:52,100
is that his backyard train, the Carroll Wood,

3287
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:54,900
at one point derailed.

3288
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:57,100
The derailing didn't hurt anybody,

3289
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:01,100
but as it derailed, the steam thing broke.

3290
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:05,500
And started just shooting steam,

3291
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:09,220
hot steam copiously across his backyard

3292
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:11,900
and a five year old girl got burnt in the leg.

3293
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:14,140
And that was what made him go,

3294
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:16,300
maybe I should run my train

3295
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:18,020
in a more professional environment,

3296
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:19,420
not just in my backyard.

3297
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:22,420
But I feel like see, let someone else drive it, right?

3298
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:23,420
Wasn't that part of it?

3299
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:24,260
Oh maybe.

3300
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:27,060
I don't think it was him.

3301
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:29,020
It was that mysterious man again.

3302
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:30,860
Oh no, that bar man.

3303
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,540
The Walted of the skies, yeah.

3304
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:35,020
Why do we keep letting that guy drive the trains?

3305
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:35,940
The wood man.

3306
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:38,260
But if that little girl hadn't gotten burnt,

3307
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:39,820
maybe there wouldn't be a Disneyland.

3308
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:41,020
Imagine how wealthy you'd be now

3309
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,860
if you got scolded by Walt Disney.

3310
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:46,260
I want half.

3311
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,260
All right, fine, here.

3312
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:50,100
Thank you.

3313
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:52,660
What is it?

3314
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:53,780
Or list which characters I own.

3315
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:55,340
And Epcot, I want Epcot.

3316
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:00,620
So do we have any other Sorted History?

3317
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:02,300
Do we have any plus ups?

3318
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:05,300
I mean I really like the plus ups that they've done.

3319
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:06,860
And I really like that diorama

3320
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:08,300
and the little plus ups to the diorama.

3321
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:11,340
I want more little things to happen along the route.

3322
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:14,180
Like not a ton, I don't want it to get gimmicky,

3323
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:16,020
but little stuff happening along the train route.

3324
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:18,180
The art-o-topia side is kind of disappointing.

3325
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,740
Yes, that's the least.

3326
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:22,380
That's kind of the worst stretch in terms of

3327
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:23,220
unique little things.

3328
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:25,900
Unless you're passing by a parade that's about to go,

3329
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:27,580
which you can see some videos of.

3330
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:28,620
And the wave at you.

3331
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:29,460
Yeah.

3332
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:32,700
The inside out characters or whatever.

3333
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,540
Yeah.

3334
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:35,620
You get a little private parade.

3335
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:37,780
The forest could be thicker

3336
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:42,060
as far as looking out onto normal land.

3337
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,820
Sometimes you can see too much outside.

3338
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:44,660
I don't care for that.

3339
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:46,780
I want to be immersed.

3340
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:49,300
So more trees if that's possible might not be possible.

3341
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:50,820
Yeah, that's Star Wars forest.

3342
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:55,820
And the forest dividing frontier land in Star Wars.

3343
01:51:56,700 --> 01:51:58,500
It's gonna take a few years for that to grow in.

3344
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:00,020
Yeah, that needs to grow in a little more.

3345
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,780
It takes time.

3346
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:03,740
In 20 years maybe I'll be very satisfied

3347
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:05,340
with the thickness of the forest.

3348
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:07,220
Give it time.

3349
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,060
But now I'm not.

3350
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:09,340
I'm not happy with it.

3351
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:13,020
I think more, add a couple more cars on

3352
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:14,700
and let's get some of these,

3353
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:15,940
let's get some drinks in there.

3354
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:17,940
Let's get some premium experiences.

3355
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:19,420
Like a gambling car.

3356
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:20,980
Gambling, now you're talking.

3357
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:21,820
Roulette.

3358
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:24,500
Yes, a roulette car.

3359
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:27,300
Now, yeah, Walton would not have wanted drinking

3360
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:28,500
or gambling, but he's dead.

3361
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,340
He's dead.

3362
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:30,180
Welcome.

3363
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:33,300
Yeah, let's get a high stakes poker game going on

3364
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:34,500
in one of the cars.

3365
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,460
Booby Girls.

3366
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:38,620
Yeah, that's, let's do all of it.

3367
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:41,660
I don't think that's their official title, but.

3368
01:52:41,660 --> 01:52:42,980
Close quarters.

3369
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,860
They're like, yep.

3370
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:47,060
Their butts are in your face.

3371
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:49,500
Yep, that'll be, hello.

3372
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:53,020
Well, they own FX now, so we could get a Fosse Verdun.

3373
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:53,860
Oh.

3374
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:54,700
Dying.

3375
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:56,780
Or some rescue me cast members.

3376
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:57,620
Oh man.

3377
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:00,060
Are those like attractive actresses?

3378
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:01,900
They save the train catches on fire.

3379
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,060
The burning cabin.

3380
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:05,460
Oh, they put out the burning, yeah, that's the.

3381
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:08,140
Dennis Leary's rescue is putting out the burning cab,

3382
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:09,100
that's why.

3383
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,660
Available on Blu-ray.

3384
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:13,900
Don't know what this is, look it up, kids.

3385
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:17,540
The train is racing the Mayans Motorcycle Club.

3386
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,380
Oh no.

3387
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:22,180
Uh-oh, but the Sons of Anarchy are here to save ya.

3388
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:27,340
Archer could be gambling and drinking on that train.

3389
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:30,300
What would he say?

3390
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:31,340
He's outrageous.

3391
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:35,740
How about on the end of the train too,

3392
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:38,420
one of those hobo things where you pull.

3393
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:40,220
What do you call that, the two sided things.

3394
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:41,580
Like a push cart or something?

3395
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:42,420
Yeah.

3396
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:45,140
And that would be like a sought after car.

3397
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:47,660
Obviously you'd have to be harnessed in or something.

3398
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:48,700
Maybe just have, you know what,

3399
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:50,620
it might be too unsafe for guests.

3400
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:55,540
So just have some hobo character actors on the back

3401
01:53:55,540 --> 01:53:57,260
doing that behind the train.

3402
01:53:58,180 --> 01:53:59,340
Yeah, but I wanna see it in action.

3403
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:00,540
You wanna see it move, okay.

3404
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:03,140
Yeah, I wanna see that, that's fun I think.

3405
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:03,980
Absolutely.

3406
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:04,820
Yeah.

3407
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:06,700
I just want that cabin on fire again.

3408
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:08,540
Cabin on fire for sure.

3409
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:09,700
Cabin back on fire.

3410
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:11,100
And do some with Autotopia.

3411
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:14,540
Are you a pro, get rid of it?

3412
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:16,580
I mean, I never go on it.

3413
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:17,420
Yeah.

3414
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:20,940
Well it's, you will fuck your leg up as an adult,

3415
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:22,340
or at least I do.

3416
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:24,420
The last two times I end up so sore.

3417
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,340
Oh yay, cause you have to push really hard.

3418
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:28,060
And then you're like, you're weird and cramped.

3419
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:28,900
Your leg is like so sore.

3420
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:29,740
It is weird.

3421
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:31,260
I guess it's for children or something.

3422
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:32,900
It is for children who just wanna pretend

3423
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:34,260
that they're driving.

3424
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:35,820
And it always seems to be popular.

3425
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:36,980
So I'm like, I'm one of those,

3426
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:39,140
not everything has to appeal to me.

3427
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:39,980
Yeah.

3428
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:41,180
Like I'm okay if there's something there

3429
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:42,020
that doesn't appeal to me.

3430
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:43,580
But I don't know, it just does seem like,

3431
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:45,820
it seems like very 90s now and just,

3432
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:47,820
there's nothing nostalgic about it.

3433
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:48,660
I mean, at least not to me,

3434
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:50,220
but then if it's nostalgic to you,

3435
01:54:50,220 --> 01:54:52,620
if you were a kid when you first did it, I guess.

3436
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:54,380
Can they like reduce the footprint?

3437
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:56,220
Can they make it smaller like the Disney thing?

3438
01:54:57,060 --> 01:54:58,540
Are you probably getting a lot of money?

3439
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:01,660
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't look very nice.

3440
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:02,900
It smells bad.

3441
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:03,740
You just go through trees.

3442
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:04,580
It's noisy.

3443
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:05,420
You're not plussing it up.

3444
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:06,340
You just go through trees.

3445
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:07,420
There's nothing happening.

3446
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:08,980
I mean, that uses so much gasoline

3447
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:10,980
and the subs use so much water.

3448
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:15,500
It's not the most environmentally conscious area of the park.

3449
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:16,340
Most wasteful area.

3450
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:18,980
Should we just get rid of them and put in solar panels?

3451
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:19,820
Sure.

3452
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:20,940
Just a field of solar panels?

3453
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:22,020
Yeah.

3454
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:23,420
That's it and you just look at them.

3455
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:24,940
Brought to you by AOC.

3456
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:25,780
It was.

3457
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:27,140
Oh, sure.

3458
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:31,420
I don't want her values destroying the Disneyland I love.

3459
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:32,260
Your values.

3460
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:35,940
It was gonna go away when the first,

3461
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:38,820
that supposed first round of Star Wars plans.

3462
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:41,340
Oh yeah, it was gonna be a speeder bike through Endor.

3463
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:43,180
What are they gonna do with Disneyland?

3464
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:44,020
Yeah.

3465
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,100
Oh my God, there's so much you could do there.

3466
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:48,220
It was gonna be, Inventions was taken out

3467
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:50,740
and then Autopia and it was gonna be a speeder bike

3468
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:52,580
that went in and out and then over there

3469
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:55,140
would be like the forest of Endor and you go through.

3470
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:57,740
But it seems like Star Wars land is bigger than Tomorrowland.

3471
01:55:57,740 --> 01:55:58,820
Oh, well.

3472
01:55:58,820 --> 01:55:59,660
Is it?

3473
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:00,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3474
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:01,340
I'm gonna try everything there.

3475
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:02,220
Oh, I don't.

3476
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:03,620
Cause if it's bigger than Hogwarts,

3477
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:06,460
Hogwarts is probably about as big as Tomorrowland, isn't it?

3478
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:07,740
You think?

3479
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:11,100
Yeah, so Hogsmeade, most of them are about 12 acres

3480
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:14,540
and the galaxy's edge is gonna be like 14 acres.

3481
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:17,180
So it is bigger, it's bigger than Radiator Springs.

3482
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:20,420
So pretty big.

3483
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:21,260
Pretty big.

3484
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:23,860
Let's talk about like Tomorrowland should be the next thing

3485
01:56:23,860 --> 01:56:25,580
to get redone.

3486
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:26,580
I guess, yeah, what do you do?

3487
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:28,980
Just a past version of the future?

3488
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:31,220
We've said neon lights.

3489
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:32,300
Something, yeah, neon.

3490
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:33,140
Just neon lights.

3491
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:34,540
Neon, tronny.

3492
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:35,380
Like a troncoaster.

3493
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:36,580
Like a shitty bar?

3494
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:37,420
Sure.

3495
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:38,260
Yeah.

3496
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:39,100
Sure, yeah.

3497
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:40,540
Fine, fine.

3498
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:41,900
It's better than what they got now.

3499
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:42,980
Dive Barland?

3500
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:43,820
Okay.

3501
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:44,660
Yeah, sure.

3502
01:56:44,660 --> 01:56:45,500
You're fine with that?

3503
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,460
A like B minus Dive Bar is better

3504
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:49,140
than a lot of Tomorrowland currently.

3505
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:50,620
That's true, there's not much going on.

3506
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:54,940
I just like Space Mountain and Star Tours.

3507
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:56,380
There will be a time, I think,

3508
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:58,100
and it probably won't be for 10 years,

3509
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:01,060
but where you will just have one narrow walkway

3510
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:02,540
to Space Mountain and everything else

3511
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:03,900
is under construction.

3512
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:04,740
My God, everything else is torn up.

3513
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:07,500
Very much like California Adventure was for years.

3514
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:10,060
Yeah, Star Tours gone, Buzz Lightyear gone, all of it,

3515
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:13,460
and they'll do a full on reconceptualization of it.

3516
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:15,340
They're building a restaurant in Epcot

3517
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:18,060
that's like a space station.

3518
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:21,300
You look at these massive high def screens

3519
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:23,140
that look like you were eating in a space station.

3520
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:25,060
That's fun, so maybe you spiral out from Space Mountain,

3521
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:26,700
take inspiration from Space Mountain

3522
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:27,860
and build out from there.

3523
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:28,700
Well, what else is like?

3524
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:30,220
Because in the line for Space Mountain,

3525
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:33,460
you see the hubs and the other.

3526
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:34,380
That's a good idea.

3527
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,220
The problem is-

3528
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:36,180
I guess it's like a mail,

3529
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:38,500
it's like a post office, intergalactic post office.

3530
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:39,340
I guess it is.

3531
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:40,180
Is that what we wanna do?

3532
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:41,380
You got a letter stamp from space.

3533
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:43,260
You buy some stamps in space?

3534
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:46,780
The problem is it'll be IP based, unfortunately.

3535
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:47,620
They don't really have anything.

3536
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:49,300
There's no good space IP.

3537
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:50,260
Nobody cares about Tron.

3538
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:51,500
But that coaster's good.

3539
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,500
They built one in Florida.

3540
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:54,340
Yeah.

3541
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:55,860
So maybe we, and believe me,

3542
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:58,700
the Jared Leto Tron reboot is coming.

3543
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:00,700
With Jared Leto, who's he gonna be?

3544
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:03,660
He's Flynn's, I don't know.

3545
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:05,580
I'm a virus, he'll be a virus.

3546
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:09,460
You arrive where you go to Mars in 30 seconds.

3547
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:10,300
Very exciting.

3548
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:13,420
That's the solution.

3549
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:16,020
Well, anything else?

3550
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:16,980
Plus ups?

3551
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:20,060
I think we've completed the Grand Circle tour.

3552
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:23,740
Wait a minute, we missed one big thing, y'all.

3553
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:26,380
Your attention, please.

3554
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:28,380
Disneyland limited.

3555
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:29,900
How awesome is that?

3556
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:33,260
That is like fabric of the park.

3557
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:36,660
Yeah, the sound just transports you back there.

3558
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:38,140
Scary for some reason.

3559
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:39,980
Yeah, I know, I get a little weird dread from that.

3560
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:41,340
It makes you feel like you're in trouble.

3561
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:42,180
Yep.

3562
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:43,620
I mean, it's cool that it's scary.

3563
01:58:43,620 --> 01:58:45,260
I like that it's scary, but it is scary.

3564
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,700
It's a weird kind of scary man announcement voice.

3565
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:49,060
Because it is like a quality of a voice

3566
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:50,620
you'd hear in the Haunted Mansion or something.

3567
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:51,460
Yep.

3568
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:54,740
That's why it is one of the voices in the Haunted Mansion.

3569
01:58:54,740 --> 01:58:55,580
Who did it?

3570
01:58:55,580 --> 01:58:58,220
I was looking it up, I couldn't tell.

3571
01:58:58,220 --> 01:58:59,300
There's a guy named Jack Wagner

3572
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:01,100
and there's a guy named Peter Rennaday

3573
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:03,820
and there's conflicting information about which one it is.

3574
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:05,060
Well, Jack Wagner was the guy

3575
01:59:05,060 --> 01:59:07,220
who called the voice of Disneyland for a lot of times.

3576
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:10,220
Peter Rennaday, a very good voice imitator.

3577
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:12,540
He was the guy who came up on 20,000 Leagues.

3578
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:14,500
He was imitating James Mason.

3579
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:15,340
Oh, gotcha.

3580
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:17,060
And he's Mark Twain on the Mark Twain.

3581
01:59:17,060 --> 01:59:17,900
Yeah.

3582
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:19,900
And he's Henry in the Country Bridge Embry.

3583
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:24,140
I think it is Peter Rennaday, not Jack Wagner.

3584
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:27,140
I was very disappointed at the internet's information

3585
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:29,980
on this subject and I will not have this reflect

3586
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:31,020
on my record.

3587
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:31,860
It could be.

3588
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:33,780
And I don't know, star rating on iTunes.

3589
01:59:33,780 --> 01:59:35,700
The information wasn't there.

3590
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:38,460
It could be Rennaday doing Jack Wagner.

3591
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:39,580
That's it, it's Rennaday.

3592
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:40,980
Which is my guess.

3593
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:42,420
They couldn't afford Jack Wagner.

3594
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:43,700
No, I think he's long dead.

3595
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:46,740
Maybe they blended the two, you know,

3596
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:49,300
like Rey and Force Awakens, you know,

3597
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:50,740
how they used all three.

3598
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:52,860
They used like four different Ben Kenobis.

3599
01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:55,180
Or BB-8 is a bunch of people.

3600
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:56,860
Crazy.

3601
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:58,980
Ben Schwartz and Bill Hader.

3602
01:59:58,980 --> 01:59:59,820
Yeah.

3603
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:01,500
And all of us, audience might not know,

3604
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:03,820
we also, for episode nine we did some,

3605
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:04,780
we can announce it, all,

3606
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:06,340
Mike Jason and I all did some.

3607
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:07,660
We're all BB-8 beep-a-booms.

3608
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:09,660
We got paid with exposure?

3609
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:12,100
That was a little weird to hear from JJ Abrams,

3610
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:13,940
that like this will be great for you guys.

3611
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:15,100
We're out of money.

3612
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:17,660
You don't know how, like,

3613
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:20,460
you might get a lot of other work doing bleeps and bloops.

3614
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:22,900
Jason is BB-8 when he gets flustered.

3615
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:23,740
Yeah.

3616
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:26,900
Ah, son of a bitch.

3617
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,700
Shit, god damn it.

3618
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:30,100
But once you run it through the filters,

3619
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:31,140
you can't tell it's swearing.

3620
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:31,980
Yep.

3621
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:33,300
Sounds just right.

3622
02:00:34,820 --> 02:00:37,260
So, what else?

3623
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:38,100
What do you got?

3624
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:39,660
No, I don't really have anything.

3625
02:00:39,660 --> 02:00:41,100
I like that voice and.

3626
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:42,100
Your voice is fantastic.

3627
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:43,860
Oh, well there's some fun YouTube videos

3628
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:46,820
of train enthusiasts talking about the Disneyland railroad.

3629
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:47,660
Oh, boy.

3630
02:00:47,660 --> 02:00:48,500
So, keep an eye out for them.

3631
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,340
Wait, you said these were fun videos?

3632
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:50,500
Some like nice old folks.

3633
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,340
What's that?

3634
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:52,380
I don't doubt that they're videos,

3635
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:54,620
I just doubt that they're fun videos.

3636
02:00:54,620 --> 02:00:55,580
I think they're fun.

3637
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:56,420
All right.

3638
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:57,740
Because they seem to be really enjoying it.

3639
02:00:57,740 --> 02:00:58,580
They're having a good time.

3640
02:00:58,580 --> 02:00:59,700
They enjoy sharing their knowledge.

3641
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:02,660
And yeah, train people seem to,

3642
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:03,740
like they're connecting, like,

3643
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:06,180
and then the original cars are at this exhibit

3644
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:08,980
and this museum and this ranch and that sort of thing.

3645
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:10,300
More knowledgeable than I am

3646
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:12,180
about the full lineage of the train.

3647
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:14,500
Jason, can I give you a quick Sophie's choice?

3648
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:18,020
Better train Disneyland railroad or Casey Jr.?

3649
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:20,500
Oh, I think it gotta go Disneyland railroad.

3650
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:21,340
Okay, I thought it was gonna be Cumber.

3651
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:23,700
Casey Jr. is pretty novel,

3652
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:26,940
but you can't beat that Grand Circle tour.

3653
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:27,780
Okay.

3654
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:30,900
I once rode on Casey Jr. during the rain.

3655
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:31,820
It was great.

3656
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:32,660
In the train car.

3657
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:34,940
And I've also been on it during the fireworks.

3658
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:35,780
Oh, that's fantastic.

3659
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:36,620
That was amazing.

3660
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:37,940
I think you're right in the thick of it.

3661
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:38,900
Yeah, it was great.

3662
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:41,620
It's a nice little trip at night.

3663
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:42,620
It felt like Mario Kart.

3664
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:43,460
Yeah.

3665
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:44,300
Oh, neat.

3666
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:45,140
Like you just won.

3667
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:47,260
I just won when I'm on Rainbow Road or something, you know?

3668
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:50,020
So Casey Jr. during the fireworks

3669
02:01:50,020 --> 02:01:55,020
and Jason's tip, do a five quarters train trip.

3670
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:56,260
Devote 25 minutes.

3671
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:58,540
Be like Jason, five fourths.

3672
02:01:58,540 --> 02:01:59,860
Hey, I just realized,

3673
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:04,020
is there a Casey Jr. sequence in the Tim Burton Dumbo?

3674
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:04,940
I believe there is.

3675
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:06,100
I don't know the details,

3676
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:08,740
but they're selling a popcorn tub now.

3677
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:13,340
Casey Jr. and Dumbo at Disneyland.

3678
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:14,180
That seems like a dart.

3679
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:15,020
We'll see.

3680
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:18,060
Yeah, weird vibes around that one.

3681
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:20,620
An hour and a half of it is the crows.

3682
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:21,460
No!

3683
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:23,500
Why did they do more crows?

3684
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:25,500
They laid too hard in the wrong direction.

3685
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:27,220
They locked the theater doors.

3686
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:28,420
You can't leave.

3687
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:29,260
Oh my God.

3688
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:30,700
I keep watching those crows.

3689
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:34,620
That's an unpleasant way to end, talk about those crows.

3690
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:36,180
Do you know what's really funny is the,

3691
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:39,620
let's get ready for Dumbo.

3692
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:41,540
You heard that in an ad?

3693
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:42,860
It's Michael Buffer.

3694
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:45,220
This is, unless I'm dreaming it,

3695
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:46,980
unless this is my dream.

3696
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:49,660
Let's get ready for Dumbo.

3697
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:51,380
I have not seen that.

3698
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:52,220
That's wild.

3699
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:53,060
Really bizarre.

3700
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:54,340
Michael Buffer fans love the movies.

3701
02:02:54,340 --> 02:02:55,700
Is Buffer in it?

3702
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:56,900
I don't know.

3703
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:58,460
Might just be his voice.

3704
02:02:58,460 --> 02:03:00,900
Or they dub Michael Keaton with Michael Buffer's voice.

3705
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:02,020
Or they just got it sound like,

3706
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:04,940
pay him 50 bucks and then Michael Buffer is like,

3707
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:06,700
could it be Peter Rennaday?

3708
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:08,980
It's Peter Rennaday doing impression of Jack Wager,

3709
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:09,820
doing impression of Michael Buffer.

3710
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:11,460
Rennaday, you scamp.

3711
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:14,100
You done it again, Rennaday.

3712
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:15,020
You done it again.

3713
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:16,940
Rennie, thanks for being here.

3714
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:19,340
Mark Rennie, you survived, but gets the ride.

3715
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:20,460
Thank you for having me.

3716
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:21,900
This was a dream.

3717
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:23,740
What I do know is real.

3718
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:25,260
Yay.

3719
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:27,020
Well, where can people find you?

3720
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:28,740
Or exit through the gift shop?

3721
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:30,140
Or what do you get to plug?

3722
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:32,380
You can find me just at Mark Rennie,

3723
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:33,220
Twitter and Instagram.

3724
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:36,620
I don't post a lot, so it's not an imposition, I don't think.

3725
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:38,260
I have a show if you're in Los Angeles,

3726
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:39,580
May 12th, Mother's Day.

3727
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:41,100
It's called Those Magnificent Moms,

3728
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:42,860
but I host it with my actual mother

3729
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:44,820
