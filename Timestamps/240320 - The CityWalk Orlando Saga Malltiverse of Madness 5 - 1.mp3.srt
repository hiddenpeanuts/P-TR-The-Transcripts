1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,500
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,640
When your town has made you frown.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,400
When your square has made you swear.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,960
When life gives you one more punch.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,060
You need a dough that's soaked in Captain Grunge.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,720
You need a place, a place to stroll.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,700
With alcohol.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,700
A place that features part of the Berlin Wall.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,680
Where seam-punged robots sell chocolate snacks.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,680
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,720
So let's go take a walk.

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,820
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,360
Tonight.

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,740
Tonight.

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,720
Podcast The Ride presents

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,180
The City Walk Orlando Saga.

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,140
Multiverse of Madness.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,480
A daily,

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,680
Exploring the shops, restaurants,

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,180
and cosmic wonder.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,380
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando.

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,900
Welcome to Podcast The Ride presents

24
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,820
The City Walk Orlando Saga.

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,260
Multiverse of Madness.

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,680
My name is Mike Carlson and I have to say

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,440
before we even introduce anyone else

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,540
that I'm having a blast-a doing this pod-cast-a.

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,840
Joining me as always, Scott Gairdner.

30
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,980
I'm trying to come up with one immediately.

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:30,760
Okay, good luck.

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,780
I guess that's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,940
You seem an enthusiast-a about this pod-cast-a.

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,080
I am, that's right.

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,080
How about Jason Sheridan?

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,640
How about, how are you feeling, sir?

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,020
Can you do it in any fun way?

38
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,600
Can you say it?

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,960
I know, I'm thinking, I'm thinking,

40
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,720
I'm having a lot of fun

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,960
and I don't want to run from recording this fun pod-cast.

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,000
I mean, sure, yeah.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,720
Yeah, it's not as good.

44
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,460
You guys are the more musical.

45
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,120
You gotta add the A or something to it.

46
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,420
Oh yeah, it's because we're more musical, I think, yeah.

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm having a lot of fun-a, don't want to run-a.

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,480
Okay.

49
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,040
That changed everything.

50
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,000
That changed everything.

51
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,380
With one letter, it's all different.

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,160
My man, now you're on island time with the rest of us.

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
Thank you for doing that.

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,040
So yes, today here we are,

55
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,680
a very exciting situation, sector.

56
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,020
Yeah, I mean, I think we gotta check and make sure.

57
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,840
Oh yeah, you're right, I'm sorry.

58
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,660
I have a feeling where we're going.

59
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,480
That's true.

60
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,140
This construct, we have to double check.

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,840
We really, is this a good time to do it?

62
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,640
Yeah, please, you could be right.

63
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,740
Alright, let's see if we can call them in.

64
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,520
Sector keeper, where are we going today?

65
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,000
Boys, boys, today begins phase five,

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,840
Age of Buffett.

67
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,340
Phase five, sector one is Lone Palm Airport Bar

68
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,800
and the Hemisphere Dancer.

69
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,900
Hmm, wonder if the story behind that is,

70
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,260
fins up boys.

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,240
Whoa.

72
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,880
Wow, that's right.

73
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,360
The Age of Buffett.

74
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,760
Wow, an imposing phase potentially

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,260
or a phase for celebration.

76
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,220
I think celebration, that's what he would have wanted.

77
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,280
Well, and isn't that, in a way, what we're doing today?

78
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,480
Because we've discussed Jimmy Buffett's passing,

79
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,920
something that unfortunately,

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,440
in the time that it has taken us to get this off the ground,

81
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,620
that is an event that has occurred, RIP Jimmy Buffett,

82
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,400
and we celebrated him a little bit

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,180
on a Christmas Club 3 episode

84
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,540
with all of his Christmas albums.

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,160
However, there has not been the proper eulogy episode.

86
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,120
Is that kind of what this is?

87
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,540
It's tricky because, yeah, to some degree,

88
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,960
that is what this is, but I started unraveling

89
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
some other stuff too, so maybe it's not,

90
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,300
I almost feel self-conscious about this

91
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,160
being the official eulogy episode.

92
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,140
Sure, I just hadn't got enough data about the plan.

93
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,320
Because for a while it was, we'll just kick it to the saga.

94
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,120
It'll be in the saga, we'll kick it to the saga.

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,760
That's what I thought, and then I started looking into

96
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,820
some of the stuff that I know we needed to talk about,

97
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,060
and I was like, oh, well, there's some questions here,

98
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,460
and I don't know that this is the proper tribute.

99
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,120
Mm-hmm.

100
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,620
You know?

101
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,960
Well, there was also a discussion,

102
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,020
as we were forming the sector boundaries

103
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,720
with the Sector Keeper, there was a discussion of,

104
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,020
you know, we need to address, in a bigger way,

105
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,080
Jimmy Buffett's passing.

106
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:15,780
Right.

107
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,580
Do we do that with his restaurant?

108
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,720
His name is in it, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

109
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,760
Or is the true spirit of Jimmy, in a way,

110
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,500
just outside the restaurant, just outside,

111
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,440
there's like a little pathway, and it's along the water.

112
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,320
We're getting closer to Jimmy's spirit, I feel.

113
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,820
Yes.

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,980
And there is this, there is this little bar

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,340
that, where you get the breeze better than you get it

116
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,120
back in the restaurant itself.

117
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,380
Uh-huh.

118
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,860
And then there is a certain decorative item

119
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,680
that is more than a decorative item,

120
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,360
and therefore, should this not be the official Jimmy tribute,

121
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,480
even more than Margaritaville.

122
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,240
Here's the thing.

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,360
We're not gonna know until this episode is done.

124
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,280
I don't know how this is gonna go.

125
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,640
Are we gonna have to add another one?

126
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,060
You guys don't have, I don't know what we're gonna do

127
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,960
about anything.

128
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,280
That's all I'm saying.

129
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,540
Neither did he.

130
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,220
You know what?

131
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,180
I don't think he knew.

132
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,740
He didn't know.

133
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,820
When he first put pen to paper, andâ€¦

134
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,040
I just spilled the Diet Coke.

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
Well, yeah, like you were saying

136
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
before you spilled that Diet Coke,

137
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,500
you know, you've gotta lax at it.

138
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,160
You don't know exactly where you're going.

139
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,620
Jimmy didn't know that when he first put pen to paper

140
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,240
to write a song, or to write all three of the chords

141
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,300
in his song, that it was eventually going to turn

142
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,380
into a restaurant chain.

143
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,480
And you didn't know that you were gonna knock over

144
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,580
that Diet Coke and then still be cleaning it up

145
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,500
and wiping and having to yell while you're doing it.

146
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,660
Oh, but now you're back.

147
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,020
You should have had a song called like Party Foul,

148
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,140
or something, Party Foul, or whatever they call it,

149
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,360
you know, when you drop a drink or something at a party.

150
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,860
What could have destigmatized party fouling?

151
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,680
Well, that's true.

152
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,340
Today's destination seems like it would be a place

153
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,080
where they're spilling a lot.

154
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,060
You know, people haphazardly knocking over

155
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,700
their boat drinks and such.

156
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,560
Into the sand.

157
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,260
Into the sand.

158
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,780
Oh, that's a fun little drink sand blend.

159
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,820
You gotta reek it up.

160
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,060
Another thing he could have done a song about.

161
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,040
Liquidy sand.

162
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,600
Drink sand.

163
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,020
Sugar in the sand.

164
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,080
You know that you're drunk if you're drinking drink sand.

165
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,180
Drink sand is good.

166
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,280
Watch out for the paper umbrellas.

167
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,460
Yeah, so anyway, so everything's fine.

168
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,220
I've recovered from spilling the tall boy Diet Coke.

169
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,780
Extra tall Diet Coke.

170
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,740
That was the problem.

171
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,600
A tall boy like you and your tall elbows reached up

172
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,100
and knocked it over.

173
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,760
But you know what?

174
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,540
Didn't that not loosen us up?

175
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,000
You know what?

176
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,040
Maybe it was his spirit moving through your elbow

177
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,540
and going, guys, relax.

178
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,480
It's not a book report.

179
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,960
Y'all are chilling out and talking about your favorite guy.

180
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,000
He's in the room with us.

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,240
And he's guiding me as I flip through many tabs

182
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,420
listing information about his famous plane.

183
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,760
I feel like it's been a minute since there's been one of those episodes

184
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,400
where Mike has these so many things, so many things, too many things.

185
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,300
Yes, this is so many things.

186
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,340
That's often the fuel of great episodes.

187
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,140
That's true.

188
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,840
I'm excited, and it makes up for me who has none.

189
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,660
That's good.

190
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,020
I really assumed that you would take the lead here.

191
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,460
I'm kind of the same.

192
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,420
I open the basics, the restaurant website,

193
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,360
and some Yelp menu pictures just to see how it's changed over the years.

194
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,580
Let's just give our general opinion so far.

195
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,760
We're talking about basically this little oasis

196
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,340
outside of Margaritaville Restaurant Proper in Orlando.

197
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,600
It's a little bar.

198
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,540
It's got sand.

199
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,200
You can dip your little toesies in the sand if you want.

200
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,520
As I did, it was nice.

201
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,020
As of 2003, Jimmy Buffett put a real-life plane of his there,

202
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,500
which is now an iconic part of the skyline or whatever,

203
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,640
depending on where you're looking.

204
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,560
Yes, in the logo of this series.

205
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,180
It's one of the primary parts of it.

206
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,980
Some listeners noted when they saw that plane in the logo,

207
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,900
a number of them asked a question.

208
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,680
The question was, if that plane is so prominent in the logo,

209
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,540
does that mean that there's some sort of interesting story about the plane?

210
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,300
No, that's a very good question.

211
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,520
I think there is.

212
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,940
I think there is an interesting story.

213
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,200
There were interesting questions I had that I've asked on this podcast before,

214
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,240
and I think we always say, well, whenever we get to it in the episode about it,

215
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,020
that's when we're going to tackle these questions.

216
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,340
I just wanted to get your opinion on the place real quick.

217
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,760
Sure.

218
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,420
The sand, that little oasis.

219
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,640
Have you had a drink there?

220
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,960
Scott and I had a drink there with the level keeper when we were there.

221
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,400
We discussed it a little bit.

222
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,940
I have only ever kind of passed through there.

223
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,180
You've never had a drink at the Lone Palm Airport.

224
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,140
Well, it's not his happy places under the lighthouse

225
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,080
and eating a Cinnabon and smoking a very long cigarette.

226
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,420
Smoking a long parliament, which my partner thought was my preferred cigarette.

227
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,480
You like longs, right?

228
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,160
Yeah.

229
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,280
You a longs guy?

230
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,920
You've got longsig energy, right?

231
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,980
I mean, it is fair in the handful of times I've bought a pack of cigarettes my life,

232
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,040
and as for parliaments, they start going, what kind?

233
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,820
And I go, regular?

234
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Longer, longer.

235
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,800
Longer.

236
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,620
Smokable.

237
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,000
Those ones that are coming off of the shelf because they're so long.

238
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,880
Those ones that don't fit on your regular shelf.

239
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,200
You know what?

240
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,300
But it turned out nice.

241
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,940
We had lots of nice little cool down moments at the board of entry smoking area.

242
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,200
We could share the long cigarette very easily.

243
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,640
But this is not yourâ€¦

244
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,120
That's where you go to relax.

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,220
We've all taken photos at this place with this plane,

246
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,040
which apparently has some of the story associated with it.

247
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,760
But do you get any feeling from this little zone?

248
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,960
Oh, I got a feeling of relaxation.

249
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,400
It's very chill.

250
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:18,920
Looking back, I do regret not driving a scooter and blasting the horn in the sand.

251
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,600
Whoa, wait, what?

252
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,960
Blasting the horn?

253
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,700
And interrupting the good, calm, mellow vibes?

254
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,780
I mean, I don't know.

255
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,920
A woman did.

256
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,880
I was passing by this area on the path.

257
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,480
It was getting a little crowded, and one was like, use the horn, use the horn.

258
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,000
And I'm like, I didn't touch the horn the whole time.

259
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm terrified to use that thing.

260
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,680
But you wanted to use it at the Lone Palm Airport.

261
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,880
Or was it going to be like a party horn?

262
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,900
Like a party horn.

263
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,920
You could do it along with the steel drum part of Margaritaville.

264
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,140
That's true.

265
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,500
I don't think it would pitch bend, but you never know.

266
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,840
Maybe if you put a little different pressure on it, there's probably a way to play a horn.

267
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,800
Even just testing what terrain that thing can go over.

268
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,660
Can it go through sand?

269
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,800
How many donuts?

270
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,860
Is this a bad idea?

271
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,700
Am I losing a deposit doing this?

272
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,020
There should be.

273
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,100
It should be like a vehicle that can then convert into something that could go through sand.

274
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,340
Like it should be like an all-terrain vehicle.

275
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:32,320
Well, down at the Jersey Shore in Ocean City, a lot of the umbrella stations that are kind of set up at the busier beaches

276
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,660
do have like sand wheelchairs with giant wheels on them that can go through sand.

277
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,600
So, Scott, I was really impressed that you went the full like, I'm taking my shoes off.

278
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,940
I'm kicking my toesies in the sand.

279
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,720
I did.

280
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,480
I did it.

281
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,120
I put my bare feet in there.

282
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,380
And then still a few listeners were like, that Scott foot stuff on Maine?

283
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,660
I don't know.

284
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,100
My feet were covered, listeners.

285
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,480
That's where the soon to be announced $30 tier will be coming into play on the picture.

286
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,400
Yeah, famous attractions.

287
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,680
Really close up high def photos of your feet.

288
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,960
I'm no fool.

289
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,260
I wouldn't give it away for free.

290
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,180
I'm a businessman, just like Jimmy.

291
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,160
Anyway, it did feel great.

292
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,020
It felt very nice.

293
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,760
And you know what?

294
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,280
I do think they carved out a little relaxing zone.

295
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,440
We had a drink under the plane's wing.

296
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,220
It was a very chill spot.

297
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,240
And you know, and it is an area with a lot of hubba, but you know, it's kind of hidden away.

298
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,700
You go all the way around and then you don't notice the crowd of people.

299
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,320
Sure.

300
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,900
And this is, you know, like there's a little kind of section it's not as, of course, beautiful to sit and look at the view.

301
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,020
But in LA, there's a little kind of nooky area as well.

302
00:12:53,020 --> 00:13:01,180
Like I almost think that's the magic of Margaritaville and Jimmy Buffett in general is just having a little relaxing place.

303
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,740
And yes, there's not the water view in Los Angeles, but you have a view of a fence and a service.

304
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,340
It's not the best view in the world, to put it mildly.

305
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,060
But you got a fire pit there.

306
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,260
You got some TV, got some music.

307
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:20,120
I've had some nice relaxing times sitting in those Margaritaville themed or painted deck chairs out there.

308
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,520
Me too.

309
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,760
And that's more important, I think, as far as like the food, all that stuff, fine, eating fine.

310
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,280
But having a nice little nook or a little spot is really the place.

311
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,120
That's what if all Margaritaville's were just a little spot.

312
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,740
Yeah.

313
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,720
That would be ideal, I think.

314
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,600
And it's I think it hurts some of the locations that they, you know, these ones that have a little extra bar zone.

315
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:43,820
Yes.

316
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,520
I think are probably the best ones in the closer to water we can get, obviously the better.

317
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,960
Yes, like the one, yeah, the one at Navy Pier in Chicago doesn't have a little spot.

318
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,900
It's by the water, but it's not a little spot.

319
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,660
And that's what you want.

320
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,960
You want it cozy, you want a little spot.

321
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,060
So, yeah, this place is great.

322
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,300
This is this is one of the best places in City Walk Orlando.

323
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:14,360
Do you think that it is acceptable, given a short time frame, to choose Lone Palm Airport, to go have a drink here and perhaps not even food and not go to Margaritaville the restaurant proper?

324
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,720
I would not be upset with you if you told me you did that.

325
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,080
Great.

326
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,120
Just over here.

327
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,140
What do you think, Jason?

328
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:20,940
No.

329
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,120
Yeah, I think that's valid.

330
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:22,960
Yeah.

331
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:35,100
You know, I wouldn't say it's any more different than like if you sat on that patio at Margaritaville where sometimes troubadours are, you know, playing their wares.

332
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,000
You mean like playing a fife?

333
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,380
Playing a fife.

334
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,700
Playing Long December on a guitar or something.

335
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,160
Yeah, playing.

336
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
By the Counting Crows.

337
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,580
Playing Zimmerazz.

338
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,680
If you will please indulge me, sir.

339
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,840
Long December.

340
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:49,860
And there's a reason.

341
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:50,860
Yes.

342
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,480
Playing a little flute of volcano.

343
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,260
So, yeah, there's nothing I don't have anything bad to say about the actual spot in Orlando here.

344
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,780
Of course not.

345
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:07,020
Obviously, you know, maybe who knows as time goes on if we'll have any negative things to say about Margaritaville or the food or anything.

346
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,540
I don't know.

347
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,060
We'll find out tomorrow.

348
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,740
We'll find out.

349
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,000
But as far as this spot, this is the ideal spot because you could also have a drink wander over there.

350
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,300
It doesn't have to be even a Margaritaville branded drink.

351
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,640
It doesn't have to be a Landshark Lager.

352
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,280
You could bring anything you want.

353
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,940
Bring a Fat Tuesday over there.

354
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,300
You could bring there's the bar that sells just boring unbranded drinks, which I know is like who gives a shit.

355
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,720
But you could just bring like a whiskey on the rocks over there.

356
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,440
But you want to get, if possible, you want to get something where there's a picture of a sun wearing a lei.

357
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,940
Yeah, of course you want that.

358
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,740
I'm just saying this is a versatile spot.

359
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,200
Yeah.

360
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,960
And I don't think anybody's going to yell at you if you don't have a Buffett Margaritaville branded cocktail.

361
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,480
Sure.

362
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,240
Not even you?

363
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,440
You're chill enough that you don't yell?

364
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:55,700
I would judge it silently in my head of like, well, they brought in sort of unlicensed whiskey, no IP whiskey or whatever.

365
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,520
But I guess.

366
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,900
That doesn't look like a Bahama Mama.

367
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,760
That looks like green alcohol and orange slush.

368
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,240
Right.

369
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,140
I'm like kind of like, yeah, like a lady, like an older lady, like judge, like in church or something.

370
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,340
That's my energy.

371
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,140
You gab, you gab.

372
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,980
That's what I'm saying.

373
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,060
I'll gossip about them later.

374
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
The Christmas and Easter crowd are here, I see.

375
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,180
Jason's rolling his eyes.

376
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,480
That's what I would be doing too.

377
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,000
Sure.

378
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,720
That's how you feel about fair weather Buffett fans.

379
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,680
Right.

380
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,680
Yes, of course.

381
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:36,660
So, but I would at least appreciate that they came over here to pay their respects to this sacred area and this sacred plane with possibly an interesting story.

382
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,620
I do want to shout out they do have a partial food menu.

383
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,780
Yes, they do.

384
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,520
That's a very good point.

385
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,440
And it's on a menu shaped like a surfboard.

386
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,560
That's good.

387
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,500
Of course it's good.

388
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,420
That's a lot of fun.

389
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:48,900
Yeah.

390
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,860
A lot of fun.

391
00:16:50,920 --> 00:17:01,240
But yes, I think here, like, like, I can't imagine what would be other than maybe like food that is rancid, other than what you could not like about this.

392
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,720
I just feel like this is the most unimpeachable spot in all of CityWalk.

393
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,460
I feel like this is another one where you're, I don't know who you're arguing to.

394
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,960
This is a common mic occurrence.

395
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,640
It's not, and there's no, you couldn't have a complaint.

396
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,920
There's nothing you could say about this place.

397
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,620
Well, I like somebody who has a complaint to show me what it is.

398
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,660
I'm just saying.

399
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,660
There's got to be a person listening right now that's like shit talking it.

400
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,740
And I don't want to.

401
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,400
I don't want it.

402
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,580
They need to listen to what I'm saying, which is definitive.

403
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,420
It's in that lane where you're like, and Gail Gordon was always funny.

404
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,600
Show me a time that he didn't bring it.

405
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,180
He wasn't making you guffaw.

406
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,300
And yeah, yeah, maybe it was a little Frank Nelson ish.

407
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,280
OK, but whatever people share artists share from each other.

408
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,740
Inspiration comes.

409
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,380
Because he's like that's the other people talk like that too.

410
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,360
Not just those two.

411
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,380
The only thing you would like more than this is if there was a Gail Gordon restaurant.

412
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,360
Gail Gordon's Gail Gordon's Harumphville.

413
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,040
Oh, please.

414
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,320
Oh, yeah.

415
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,740
The vault could have been like the vault or something.

416
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,680
The soup vault.

417
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,440
It's like Mr.

418
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,380
Mania had a vault at his bank, of course, from the show.

419
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,200
I definitely knew one fact about his character that I've never seen before from the third.

420
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,220
Here's Lucy show where Lucy's having a cookout.

421
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,600
Jack Benny is there.

422
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,420
He's doing the cook.

423
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,680
I don't know.

424
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,660
This is completely out of context.

425
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,980
I don't know what the episode was about.

426
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,800
And then he's like, oh, viral.

427
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,840
Here's Lucy clip.

428
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:26,880
You know how people get like on your Instagram and like you'll get different things like targeted to you and it'll be like models for some people and it'll be, you know, like sports for some other people.

429
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,700
I get just out of context clips of here's Lucy on Instagram.

430
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,520
Have sent me numerous here's Lucy clip.

431
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,600
Yes, of course.

432
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,700
Here's Lucy is fascinating.

433
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,160
It ran for like seven years.

434
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,520
OJ Simpson is on it.

435
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,020
Like there's just so many things going on.

436
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,860
And this one is like Jack Benny's on it.

437
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,000
I forget there's somebody else on it.

438
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm like, is that and it is.

439
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:58,580
And then he like he calls in a bus driver and then Jackie Gleason dressed as Ralph Cramden comes in like the longest applause ever in the full Ralph Cramden like bus driver outfit.

440
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,740
And then like he makes a hamburger.

441
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:08,340
But then like take some of Jack Benny's money and puts on it and like there's a whole like hand like thing like he's about to like really dig in and eat it.

442
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,840
And then that's the end of the show.

443
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,900
I'm like latter day Jackie Gleason performance.

444
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
Nobody talks about nobody talks about it.

445
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,780
Yeah, I said I sent it to a big Jackie Gleason fan and he had never seen it before.

446
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,360
So yeah, this is a little known.

447
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,080
And you send it to your Gleason chat.

448
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:32,200
Yeah, I don't want to steal something from Jane, but my Gleason girlies is what I call it.

449
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,940
Yeah, so.

450
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:41,080
Does that get confusing in your message app, the Gleason girlies next to the Gordon girlies?

451
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,260
It gets very confusing.

452
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,180
Yeah, because those are two separate factions.

453
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,920
Yeah, and you switch to Gale girlies and it's even more confusing.

454
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,580
Yeah, very, very confusing.

455
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,620
So yeah, anyway, nobody should argue with what I just said in general about Gale Gordon or Lone Palm Airport.

456
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,960
Now you're keeping us in suspense, Mike.

457
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,620
Does the plane have an interesting story?

458
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,320
The plane is an interesting story, but we're going to get there.

459
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,300
That's the whole thing.

460
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:18,180
So what I want to start also talking about is that perhaps this interesting story put our hero Jimmy Buffett in danger of dying prematurely or whatever.

461
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,700
But that's not the only story where Jimmy Buffett had a near death experience.

462
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,940
OK, as a pilot, you know, pilots for some reason always seem to have these stories.

463
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,540
Celebrity pilot, Harrison Ford, for instance.

464
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,380
Yeah, certainly.

465
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,420
Friends, right?

466
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,360
Because you look up and it's like People magazine.

467
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,380
When Jimmy died, they published a thing called Jimmy Buffett survived at least three near death experiences before his death at age 76.

468
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,120
Wow.

469
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,280
And that was not ultimately in a plane crash.

470
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:53,340
No, and it was not that a parrot flew into his mouth, performed his entire last concert for him.

471
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,000
That has happened a few times.

472
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,620
No, I'm a pro with that.

473
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,320
That happened.

474
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,340
All right.

475
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,960
The parents taking this one.

476
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,780
Take it.

477
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,780
So I just wanted to do a brief history of some of the incidents.

478
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,560
What Buffett his first brush was 1978.

479
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,500
He was on a sailboat in San Salvador at the time.

480
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,640
He was anchored in a cove, which again, this is perfect.

481
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:24,680
Buffett stuff, a cigarette boat stopped to use Buffett's radar, and he gave them approval if he could drive their go fast boat.

482
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:31,820
After partying on a nearby sailboat and sleeping in his boat's dinghy, he reportedly drifted out and woke up surrounded by water.

483
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:39,480
But eventually the cigarette boat and a mother mothership loaded with drugs found him for the mail and pointed him in the direction of land.

484
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,520
So he like partied too hard and he wound up like floating alone at sea.

485
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,280
In a go fast boat.

486
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,760
Do you know what a go fast boat is?

487
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,920
I think that's because they come into play in the plot of the Miami Vice Michael Mann movie.

488
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,700
They talk about needing go fast boats to get to Cuba.

489
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,620
OK, and get back and forth.

490
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,120
I don't know how fast the go fast boat goes.

491
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,480
It's probably faster than that boat we took around Bay Lake in Florida Disney World, though.

492
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,120
Give me a go slow boat.

493
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,940
That will in its later years.

494
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,460
Give me a take it easy boat.

495
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,180
Uh huh.

496
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,760
That barely moves boat.

497
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,840
That boat was basically a rowboat with a go car motor in it.

498
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,720
So yeah, I think goes faster for sure.

499
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:30,440
So yeah, in ninety four, he flipped a plane and then he had to escape the plane and swim to a passing boat as he was taking off.

500
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,040
Which is this is always the thing where I'm thinking about like flying or flying a helicopter or whatever.

501
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,120
I feel like if I flipped a plane over once, I'm probably done flying planes.

502
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,500
Was it a sea plane?

503
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,200
Yeah, it was a sea plane.

504
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,660
Are those easier to flip?

505
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,560
That's a very good question.

506
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,160
Well, the water is there, too.

507
00:22:49,220 --> 00:23:03,340
So I bet the the the extra element of water is definitely making like if you're just taking off on a runway and it's maybe not even that windy, you don't have water that could potentially be like an extra element of something that would knock you off.

508
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:03,780
Sure.

509
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,740
Do you know the location of any of these incidents?

510
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,980
This was Nantucket Island.

511
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,100
OK, what about the other one?

512
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,720
Oh, I have to go back and look.

513
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,360
I just I'm going to it's going to take me a second, but it does feel like there's possible rhyming.

514
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,360
OK, you know, why didn't you do songs about any of these?

515
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,760
Certainly Nantucket is a prime prime word for rhyming.

516
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,640
Well, I was just going to say Nantucket.

517
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,080
Water is probably a lot colder, maybe choppier.

518
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,680
Sure.

519
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,560
That's not a good title.

520
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,440
Yeah.

521
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,280
But what is it?

522
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,500
No, I never said it was.

523
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,300
I was just saying that water and I thought you were going to pitch a song title.

524
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,480
Uh, I wish I had a popsicle so I could suck it maybe.

525
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,200
Um, that's a little I don't want that to be suggestive.

526
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,420
I don't want to put him he only does like lightly suggestive songs.

527
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,520
Yeah, I know.

528
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,060
But is then like how do you because how do you fit and make it up?

529
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,180
It's got to be like Nantucket, man.

530
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,880
Fuck it.

531
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,700
Well, that's not.

532
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah, he would.

533
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,900
He'll does he have a fuck in this?

534
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,180
When you got Nantucket waiting for you there, I think you break your rules.

535
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,840
Well, but you're not in the title.

536
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,540
You can also say suck it like your suck it.

537
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,300
Nantucket.

538
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,100
Well, corner corner chuck it.

539
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,740
Separate thought.

540
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,900
Corn is a good thing to shuck.

541
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:20,960
Yeah.

542
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,240
If only he lived.

543
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,640
Well, he should have done it.

544
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,760
He needed to strike while the iron was hot.

545
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,140
He should have written a song in 94.

546
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:35,660
So he said in 95, he said, I'm still flying, but I have a safer plane now, which he told the Boston Globe.

547
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,000
And for a while he got introspective about it.

548
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,660
But he's you got to get back up.

549
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,080
He said, I called a therapist I'd seen off and on in California to tell him about it and to say I was having flashbacks.

550
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,400
But the week before, the therapist had also ditched his plane.

551
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,400
Boy, did we have one heck of a therapy session, did he say, which also sounds like a tall tale.

552
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,860
We're like my pilot therapist ditched his plane as well.

553
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,300
Also flies, I guess.

554
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,320
I mean, I guess what else?

555
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,620
Who else are you going to talk to if you're Jimmy Buffett, but a pilot therapist?

556
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,800
Hmm.

557
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,640
Got to understand where I'm going from.

558
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,200
I mean, a like minded individual.

559
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,900
There's got to be a fisherman, a pilot, a shucker or a bootlegger.

560
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,660
Professional conflict.

561
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,500
He was going to lend me out to someone else.

562
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,320
I said, no, let's just have some pilot talk for a while.

563
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,300
I guess I could vibe with a therapist who is made out of coconuts.

564
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,660
Honey, we're having pilot talk here.

565
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,900
Could you stay out of it?

566
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,040
So yeah, so he I don't know.

567
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:45,220
He just he had a he had a bit of a pirate life, you know, he came to came up against brushes with all sorts of danger.

568
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,820
Wow.

569
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,480
But OK, I look.

570
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,720
Let's get to the let's get to the thing.

571
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,620
I think you're suggesting one was immortalized.

572
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,840
Only one was immortalized.

573
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:08,100
And this is, of course, in 1996, Jamaican authorities reportedly mistook Buffett's plane, the Hemisphere Dancer, which is the plane at City Walk, Orlando.

574
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,220
That's your answer.

575
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,580
That very plane, the one that we sat in the one.

576
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,700
Yes, absolutely.

577
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,580
At Loon Palm Airport.

578
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,140
At Loon Palm Airport.

579
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,860
They should call it Loon Airplane Airport.

580
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,660
They should do that.

581
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,000
You're right.

582
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,920
There is not a second airplane there.

583
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,540
Yes.

584
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:33,680
So the Jamaican government mistook this plane for some sort of drug smuggling plane, and they shot at it.

585
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,000
That is it.

586
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,580
Oh, my God.

587
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,880
That is a huge mistake.

588
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,260
It's a huge mistake.

589
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,220
And of course, they're not drug smugglers.

590
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:50,840
Years later, when Buffett would release the album Banana Wind, he included on that album a track called Jamaican.

591
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,000
Make a Mistake, which, of course, just told the tale.

592
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,720
Not in such clear detail, the tale, I think, but like kind of give you the gist of the tale.

593
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,880
It doesn't include some specifics, I don't think, but it doesn't.

594
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,820
But it gives you the idea of what happened.

595
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,440
You almost got choked up saying that song title, I feel like.

596
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,680
I did get choked up.

597
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:20,880
I almost feel bad that either of us interrupted because I feel like we should have let you read that like a priest reading the story of the book of Christ.

598
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,700
Low date.

599
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,020
I can add that echo in later.

600
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,420
So, yeah.

601
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:49,000
So and then in May 1996, the authorities apologized eventually to Jimmy Buffett and his passengers, which included Bono from U2 and his whole family, Bono's whole family.

602
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,580
Now, I don't think this part of it has been discussed before.

603
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,140
Bono we've talked about.

604
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,200
I know that, Michael.

605
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,220
But the family you're saying.

606
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,060
But the family.

607
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,060
Yeah, I don't think I knew about the family either.

608
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,720
I think we have talked about the Bono part of it.

609
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,460
I think we have as well.

610
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:02,840
Mrs.

611
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,920
Bono and all the little Bono tykes.

612
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Mrs.

613
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,460
Bono and the two Bono tykes.

614
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,720
Yes, we're there.

615
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,980
And this is just to be really clear in case any listeners are not aware of the ongoing mythology.

616
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:20,520
What happened was you told this story in full during the City Walk Saga with Paul Scheer many years ago.

617
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:27,700
And it was then that it struck me maybe not a lot of times on the show at that point because the show had been going for very long at that point.

618
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:33,340
But I realized how many times I have heard this full tale from you over the years.

619
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,720
And now it has grown and you the listener of the ongoing listeners have heard it many a time.

620
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,680
And I just want to can we break that down for a minute?

621
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,180
Of course.

622
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:50,920
What is it about the tale that gives you such joy, that makes you want to plow ahead and tell this no matter how many times it has been told?

623
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:58,100
I think what I like about this whole thing the most is that Jimmy Buffett wrote a song called Jamaica Mistake.

624
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,240
Well, that clearly is what it builds.

625
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,520
That's that is like that is the point that is hiding in Wake.

626
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,720
Like that's you know, you because you have a smile that comes when you know you're about to hit it.

627
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,020
Yes, it's a it's a it's an I mean, it's kind of an interesting story.

628
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:20,680
Certainly famous guys, famous people getting shot at in a plane and then the plane being in a near theme park.

629
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,300
That is fun.

630
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,880
We like that.

631
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,060
I think everybody anyone a person of a certain interest likes that.

632
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,920
But then the cherry on top, you get to say that then Jimmy Buffett wrote a song called Jamaica Mistake,

633
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,820
which is just one of the top song titles of Jimmy Buffett's career.

634
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,240
Well, it's one of those that you've you've really like nurtured and is like part of as you are introducing people to your Buffett fandom.

635
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,640
Yeah, that's a big one that lures people in and math sucks is another one that lures people.

636
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:57,760
Yes, it's your way of indicating it's your way of indicating to people, you know, that there's silliness afoot here.

637
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,560
And maybe you know, Margaritaville, maybe you know, She's Very In Paradise.

638
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:06,600
You have no idea how much sillier it gets, especially as he keeps making music through the 80s, 90s and 2000s.

639
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,980
The people don't know quite as much.

640
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,760
Well, and any time someone in Mike's life makes a mistake, he's like, well, that's a pretty bad mistake.

641
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,820
But it's not the worst one I've ever heard.

642
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,200
And then he just rolls into it.

643
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,320
I can't think of one bigger mistake, however.

644
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,320
So, yeah, I have not told this story to a person in a while.

645
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:39,780
But now that you're saying it's like you're wedding my whistle to tell it again to a person who has never heard it because it's a it's a fun it's fun to tell.

646
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,020
It is fun to say.

647
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,660
Is it fun is the million dollar story.

648
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,960
I think it's more fun, honestly, as far as PTR stories.

649
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,020
Well, I think I tried to do a good job of making that story not fun anymore.

650
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,680
Yes.

651
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,440
Yes, you did a good job.

652
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,480
And we'll see if it ever really weighed down.

653
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,140
Yes, you did.

654
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,580
And we'll we'll see who knows when story who knows when that could come back.

655
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,260
I said million dollars.

656
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,980
I didn't say suitcase.

657
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:13,060
So, yeah, so so this is a thing that is now I would be interested to know if I've told it 10 times on the show, probably at least.

658
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,760
I'm not sure.

659
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,200
Well, now it just gets alluded to.

660
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,100
And now there's the ongoing thing of the people.

661
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,580
Now, people, listeners go take pictures there and they wonder aloud if there's ever been if there is an interesting story involving this plane.

662
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,400
And this is where we can officially confirm it.

663
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,780
I guess there's a psychology with me, too, where I'm like, what is it?

664
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,080
I don't want to take that away from you, but I do.

665
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,540
I think it's clear at this point.

666
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,580
I have a gene.

667
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:44,160
There is something that does just get under my skin when I hear a story told in full that I've heard many times before.

668
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,500
Yeah, I'm not sure what that is about me.

669
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,360
I think it comes from my parents.

670
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:59,740
I think this is a childhood annoyance because they have the stories that are, you know, look, they're nowhere near the Jamaican Mistake story, which is one of the great stories of our time.

671
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:07,360
But there's the stories that are, you know, are repeated nonstop and there seems to be no awareness that this story has been told.

672
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,920
It's told like probably once a month.

673
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,860
My parents do that.

674
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,620
Yeah, for sure.

675
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:17,480
I will be I sometimes though I'm struck by like there's other ones and I like these are the famous ones on the show.

676
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,640
But then I think sometimes I think I have told a story three times and it's never registered.

677
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,380
And then sometimes there's stories that I feel like.

678
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:24,940
Right.

679
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,460
There's certain ones that get flagged.

680
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,960
And I don't know if it's just like you.

681
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,380
You're like we were like Logie on the day where I told the story twice and you don't remember it.

682
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,920
And then a year later I tell it and it doesn't get flagged.

683
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,120
But then there's other ones where I go, oh, I think I maybe have said that once and then that gets flagged.

684
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,760
So it's interesting to know what note what gets flagged and what doesn't.

685
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,740
Well, the word Jamaica Mistake, the phrase Jamaican Mistake is a giant, leaving flag.

686
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,200
It's it's it's massive.

687
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,560
Yeah.

688
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,680
And it's on all your playlists.

689
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,320
So Scott's playlist.

690
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,500
Yeah, Scott, every time you open Spotify, it's like the first thing.

691
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,080
Of course.

692
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,440
Can I say something about the song Jamaica Mistake?

693
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,180
Mm hmm.

694
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,560
I I can't even really ironically listen to it that much.

695
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,380
It's I don't find it good at all.

696
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,380
All right.

697
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,060
Thank you for your honesty.

698
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,260
I wish I could listen to just the part where you make a big mistake.

699
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,620
But honestly, it takes like an hour for him to even finish that.

700
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,760
It's really long.

701
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,600
It's not math.

702
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,580
It's not one of his finest.

703
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,380
Math sucks is like a masterpiece compared to Jamaica Mistake, in my opinion.

704
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,700
You know, when we were at one of the city walk locations for days now,

705
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:37,800
I've been looking in my Shazam records and my photos, my screenshots.

706
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:44,820
I swear we heard a Jimmy song that none of us ever had heard before.

707
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,640
And it's like, got to remember that for the show.

708
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,340
And it is just disappeared.

709
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,700
That might have been Nantucket Manfucket.

710
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,900
Yeah, it was Manfucket Manfucket.

711
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,440
I knew he did.

712
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,120
I should give him more credit.

713
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,980
I made that song in 2011.

714
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,480
Jimmy fell off the stage while performing a concert in Australia and he blacked out, but he was OK.

715
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,140
So he fell.

716
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,880
Australia, my tail.

717
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,780
I had too much Hungry Jacks and it just made me too logy.

718
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,400
I forgot.

719
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,500
I thought he broke in his neck, said the doctor.

720
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,900
I heard the clunk of his head on a metal ledge.

721
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,800
Australia, me whale.

722
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,780
It's a promising format.

723
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,600
I want to try to pick all the stories and run them through that filter.

724
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,580
And it could be any accident you've like like like a Diet Coke spill like Diet Coke.

725
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,580
Yeah, broke.

726
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,580
Folks, let's see.

727
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,200
Spirit spirit broke.

728
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:46,960
Nothing broke.

729
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,800
Yeah, that's OK.

730
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,640
That's not bad.

731
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,480
You could exaggerate the story and say that it shorted out all of our recording equipment.

732
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,020
Yes.

733
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,940
Diet Coke, Mike Soca.

734
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,040
Oh, that's great.

735
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,440
Yes.

736
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,100
There you go.

737
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,560
That's very good.

738
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,740
So, yeah, you can do it big and small things in your life and feel free to do that as you listen to this podcast.

739
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,720
Think about the last like, oh, shit thing that happened and then make a song about it.

740
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,860
But it's got to have those A's.

741
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,540
It's got to have those A's at the end of the words.

742
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,000
That's the that's the little masterstroke.

743
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,960
So, yeah.

744
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:27,280
Now, there's other like you look up Jimmy Buffett playing stuff and there's just there are random stuff like 2002 singer Buffett flew his biplane into a runway sign at Palm Beach Airport.

745
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,880
Sorry, I forgot this before he flew into a sign, but he was not injured.

746
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,160
So I guess that's not why they're compiling it on that list.

747
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,440
So city on that one.

748
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,020
I think the place is an important part.

749
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,820
West Palm Beach.

750
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,040
Oh, yeah.

751
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,860
Someone's always hitting that sign.

752
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,100
They got a whole warehouse full of them.

753
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,300
Not a big deal.

754
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,540
West Palm Beach sign breach.

755
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,760
Yeah.

756
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:05,380
So, yeah, anyway, so I think that I think that wraps up some of the big other things other than the thing we're getting to, which is the the hemisphere dancer and the, of course, famous incident where the plane was shot up by the Jamaican government.

757
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,240
Now, I was just going to say, are you going to bring up the details, some of the details of this?

758
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,660
Because I think I have gotten some of the details, perhaps a bit wrong over the years.

759
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,500
OK, OK.

760
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,040
Well, this is good.

761
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,860
You're going to do your suitcase story.

762
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,620
Yes, I'm going to be on your own.

763
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,800
You're going to volunteer it.

764
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,120
I am.

765
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,760
This is what I want is more transparency.

766
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,220
Yes.

767
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,840
On the show.

768
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:33,220
And speaking of just not to sidetrack, but just something from a couple of days ago in this very saga.

769
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,840
Oh, yes.

770
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,140
Yes.

771
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:42,000
Mike, I can't believe this, but I asked some listeners on Twitter if they've ever had an experience with McDonald's food making them sick.

772
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,420
And despite the hydrolyzation process, this is somehow happened.

773
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,240
Well, I didn't declare that McDonald's would never make anyone sick.

774
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,480
I said that there was a process by which you would make the food digest easier, not making people sick.

775
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,140
I never said no one would ever get sick.

776
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,080
It felt definitive to me.

777
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,360
I don't think it was definitive.

778
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,200
Like, well, you can't.

779
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,880
I believe the phrase you can't get sick was said.

780
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,620
Well, I said I have to check the tapes.

781
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:10,900
You can check the tapes, but I don't think I've made more definitive statements that have been wrong and more aggressive ways on the show than that.

782
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:21,640
My mom did remind me that like one time on the way to like a Cub Scout camping trip, it was and I chalked this up to nerves and it was really cold.

783
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,620
I had a Big Mac on the drive.

784
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,880
And when I got there, I was sick.

785
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,440
So I don't want to blame the Big Mac.

786
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,360
Jason, how dare you blame the Big Mac on that?

787
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,160
You don't know that.

788
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:39,200
I think the cold of a Pennsylvania winter and the nerves, you know, I think your mom is sharing listeners.

789
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,000
Six stories, please.

790
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,600
I don't want them to go by one of those sausage breakfast burritos one time or chicken.

791
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,820
They used to have chicken.

792
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,320
Somebody also said because Jane said she didn't want to have the fries with somebody.

793
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,320
I heard somebody say that it's vegetable oil now.

794
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,880
We're talking.

795
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,360
Yeah, we're going back and forth.

796
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,520
We've been discussing.

797
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,260
We need more research for the fries scenario.

798
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,260
Oh, you're having talks.

799
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,260
You're on tentative talks to return to McDonald's.

800
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,420
We need to shut everything down until we can figure out what's going on.

801
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,080
Oh, that's true.

802
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,560
I don't know.

803
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,400
I you know, your mom, maybe she's not aware of hydrolyzation is all I'm saying.

804
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,360
I because it's I don't know.

805
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,980
I think I think everyone is missing.

806
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,880
You must have been you must have thrown up from being nervous.

807
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,720
Surely it couldn't have been what I'm saying.

808
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,220
The cold and he's saying that he's saying he does a lot of playing the big man.

809
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,840
Now she got wrecked by those menu items that are now defunct.

810
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,300
I see.

811
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,220
That's why they got.

812
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,260
Yeah, because we're still standing up for the hydrolyzation.

813
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:38,820
Every one of these stories must be if they all go back and think about it, they'll realize they were throwing up from fear.

814
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,220
They must have been being chased or something because it can have been the food they were being chased.

815
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,060
Every one of these people, if you go back and buy a prowler or a burglar.

816
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,640
Oh, that's right.

817
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,420
There was a bear.

818
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,240
Yeah.

819
00:38:49,080 --> 00:39:02,220
Anyway, what I was going to bring up is I think probably another piece of this that fixes it in your mind is the presence of Bono.

820
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,040
Bono seems to be a primary pop cultural interest of yours, and I think you take him out of the equation.

821
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,680
Is it is fun?

822
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,180
I'm not sure.

823
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:08,940
It's it's not.

824
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,360
He's certainly a nice garnish.

825
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,020
He certainly sprinkles.

826
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,140
He's rainbow sprinkles or chocolate jimmies.

827
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,500
He's he's he's that for sure on the on the story.

828
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,540
But I would argue he's not essential to it, but it makes it interesting that he's there.

829
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,500
And I do like that about the story, too, because what's fun about that is just the idea of like Bono.

830
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,860
You kind of think as a little pompous and a little bit of his own ass.

831
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,300
But oh, he's hanging with Jimmy Buffett in Jamaica.

832
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,540
Like, maybe this guy isn't so uptight, you know, maybe I could party with Bono and we'd have a good time.

833
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:45,120
You know, like that's what you take away from that is then I could be friends with him.

834
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,160
Yeah, I usually have another extremely rich man.

835
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,560
Yeah, I assess a lot of rocks.

836
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,040
I'm like, could I be friends with someone?

837
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,380
So it's like I didn't think so with Bono.

838
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,120
But then you hear this story and you go, I think we could have hung maybe.

839
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,020
Mike, you had a birthday recently and it was a fun time.

840
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,680
However, it was not a Bono themed party.

841
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,980
And no one made an attempt to try to get Bono to make a surprise appearance at your Bono party.

842
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,520
So you can do all these thought experiments all you want.

843
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,540
But if you aren't starting a social media campaign to see if you can prove it, then what are we doing?

844
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,820
Well, it was a rainy Friday night in Los Angeles.

845
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,980
It was a little brisk.

846
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,800
If Bono was here, I bet he's like firing up the Domino's Pizza Tracker.

847
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,740
You know, he's staying in.

848
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,720
He's putting his little he's putting his feet up.

849
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,880
You're apparently not as well versed in the Domino's Pizza Tracker.

850
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:43,420
You were using that short Domino's Pizza Tracker short hand for staying inside tonight.

851
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,960
I should have thought ahead.

852
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,640
And as soon as Domino's is said, that means I'm keeping undercover.

853
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,700
I can't make it out tonight.

854
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,500
I'm firing up a stream and what's in my queue?

855
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,480
Let's get my queue down a little, you know, let's get my queue down.

856
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,920
Oh, my queues are out of control.

857
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,640
Bono's gaining to watch bottoms.

858
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,620
The residency is over in the role talking about the residency is over.

859
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,380
OK, of you two.

860
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,420
So now we enter a new and now we get two brief stints by jam bands.

861
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:15,840
That's right.

862
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,420
Good question.

863
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,960
Well, they're still cleaning up the active crime scenes from the falls.

864
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,280
Let's add like a little more to this story here.

865
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:33,520
It's Bono, his wife, Allie, the children, Jordan and Eve and Island's Island record producer, Chris Blackwell, also on the plane.

866
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,060
Oh, that's a major music figure.

867
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,400
Yeah.

868
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,420
I've heard his name before.

869
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,560
So he's he's on there as well, which I don't think that we've ever talked about him being on the plane.

870
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,160
OK.

871
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,840
And yeah, so this was and let me find exactly.

872
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,300
And that's interesting, but it's not a Richard kind.

873
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,440
It's one I doesn't need to have not a rich guy from the get go.

874
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,260
I'll say that.

875
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:52,820
Right.

876
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,080
So, yes, they're all on there.

877
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:07,860
And I guess the thing that over the years that I think maybe I've incorrectly stated or been confused about is that initially when I think I said this, this told the story, I was saying, well, Jimmy Buffett was not on the plane.

878
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,760
It was his plane.

879
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,860
But these people were shot at.

880
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,460
And then, you know, I'd start to see this story told and it's very much official Buffett lore.

881
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,280
And then it basically sort of insinuates, oh, no, no, Buffett's on the plane or whatever.

882
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,060
He's he's flying the plane or whatever.

883
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,500
And I'm like, well, that feels weird.

884
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,720
And I remember even looking through some message boards years ago and people were arguing about this.

885
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,920
This was for some reason I couldn't find the exact message boards, but I did find other message boards.

886
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,640
You know, Buffett News dot com message boards.

887
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,260
I think there's a Buffett world somewhere where people are.

888
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,920
Jimmy jangle dot net.

889
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,020
Yeah.

890
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:45,420
Yeah.

891
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,520
So people were sort of discussing some of this.

892
00:42:51,540 --> 00:43:04,240
And I'm like, everything I read basically now just says that Jimmy was on the plane, that Jimmy had been basically like the official language makes it seem like Jimmy was on the plane and he was flying the plane.

893
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,200
What does the plaque say at Lone Palm Airport?

894
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,140
Are they definitive about Jimmy?

895
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,960
That's a good question.

896
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,280
I actually didn't think about that.

897
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,640
I'll try to find that.

898
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:12,900
Yeah.

899
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,140
Yeah.

900
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,500
You keep you keep going.

901
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,200
Mm hmm.

902
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:29,220
So I'm looking around and everything and I'm having trouble finding even somebody that says, you know, this isn't the case that this like I'm not even finding an initial source passengers on the plane.

903
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,420
What do you mean?

904
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:38,160
The other my finding confirmation of that and family and record producer were they on the plane when it was fired upon?

905
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,880
Well, that yeah, that's what every that's everything says that everything is sort of agrees on.

906
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,420
They weren't just waiting to be picked up.

907
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,140
Oh, yeah.

908
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,580
Yeah, they were.

909
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,120
I think they were taking off is basically what it was.

910
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,740
And then they got shot at or whatever.

911
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,560
So I'm looking around.

912
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,240
I'm looking around.

913
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,540
And then I search, you know, just anything like Buffett, not on plane, not on hemisphere dancer.

914
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,060
And it takes me to Facebook, to Buffett News Facebook group.

915
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,360
And I write somebody posted last year.

916
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,140
I forget who was with Jimmy in the plane going to get chicken in Jamaica and got shot at.

917
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,040
I keep thinking it was a country singer.

918
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,360
And so this this woman responds named Sandy Leslie.

919
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,760
And she says it's Bono's kids.

920
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,940
And then Sandy's associate explains who it was.

921
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,880
Chris Blackwell, a records producer.

922
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:37,960
And then she says, but also my brother, Randy Leslie, Jimmy's pilot from 1991 to 2006.

923
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,500
They were filming the best 20 bars in the Caribbean.

924
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,060
The seas were too rough that day to film.

925
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,160
Jimmy told some of this is a little poorly written, but Jimmy told our best 20 bars in the Caribbean.

926
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:49,900
Good question.

927
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,100
Jimmy told my brother to drop them off and to get chicken wings.

928
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:58,680
And he had to fly the sea plane, the hemisphere dancer to Montego Bay to fuel up the plane.

929
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:05,860
Randy had let them off the plane and was taking off about 100 when 100 Jamaican police officers came out of the bushes and started shooting guns at the plane.

930
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,680
They thought they were drug runners.

931
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,580
So basically the same story at that point.

932
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,720
So I went, well, who is Randy Leslie?

933
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:18,500
He is not in any of these paragraphs that I've been finding explaining these incidents.

934
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,460
We have a new Randy to talk about.

935
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:26,200
Randy Leslie, Jimmy Buffett's pilot, who is now I believe deceased as of 2008.

936
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:34,020
But Randy, it seems really like Randy Leslie was flying the hemisphere dancer, not Jimmy.

937
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:39,340
But now sort of there's been a like not that they're like, I don't know.

938
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,920
He seems to be erased from Buffett world.

939
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:53,440
And this is why I start to think maybe this isn't the best tribute, because now I have even more questions coming out of this, because he was let go by Jimmy a couple of years before he died.

940
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,320
And people are not sure why.

941
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:04,800
And so but you find if you look up Randy Leslie, you can find that he was on the hemisphere dancer when this incident took place.

942
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,660
So now we have an even more missed.

943
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:13,500
Now we know, I think definitively what the situation was that Jimmy was on the plane, but he was not flying the plane.

944
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:14,240
Wow.

945
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,860
Randy Leslie was.

946
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,380
What takes him out of the fold?

947
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,460
Did he propose to Jimmy?

948
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:26,540
They were discussing the time and he said that there are times where it is not five o'clock somewhere.

949
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,120
It's possible.

950
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:28,640
Heresy.

951
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,060
Get out of my face.

952
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,060
He said he didn't like.

953
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:31,820
You're dead to me.

954
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,640
He didn't like shrimp or something.

955
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,200
What?

956
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,100
What the hell?

957
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,040
So so yeah.

958
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,300
So so when you go through some of this, the people are like, what happened to Randy Leslie?

959
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,420
Jimmy Buffett's pilot.

960
00:46:46,720 --> 00:47:00,920
Now, this is also stuff I've heard from people where they're like, Jimmy Buffett actually kind of stopped drinking 20 years ago, but they throw a margarine of like a margarita in his hand for photo ops and stuff to make it seem like the party is still going in that way.

961
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,180
Not that he doesn't have fun, but this is like the theory that Stevie Wonder is not blind.

962
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:05,980
Right.

963
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,640
I am shocked and appalled.

964
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,540
And I don't have any.

965
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,700
And he's so uptight that he would fire people.

966
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,020
Who was this man?

967
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,020
I don't have any confirmation that that's true.

968
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,380
And there would be still like Instagram where he's got like a glass of wine.

969
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,560
Maybe he still drank wine.

970
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,060
I don't know.

971
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:24,620
But there's there's all these like sort of like conspiracy theories stuff about Buffett that he wasn't.

972
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,060
Does he believe that all of us in this crazy world are fruitcakes or not?

973
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,020
Well, I think he believes that.

974
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,200
I don't want to believe that.

975
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,280
Let me real quick.

976
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,600
I'll just read a quote from Bono about the incident.

977
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,320
He said these boys, I assume he means the Jamaican government.

978
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,220
These boys were shooting all over the place.

979
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,740
They felt as if we were in the middle of a James Bond movie.

980
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,120
Only this was real.

981
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,640
It was absolutely terrifying.

982
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,220
And I honestly thought we were going to die.

983
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,540
So sounds scary.

984
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:57,440
So about this story also that we've never picked apart is like what's going on with this Jamaican government where they just like, is that it?

985
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,220
Yeah, pretty sure.

986
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,660
Big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big.

987
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:08,020
Well, yeah, that is also and I couldn't find anyone like sort of debunking the series of events where you're like, yeah, why did they just start shooting at the point?

988
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,600
Like if it's taking you off, it would eventually get the airspace, which probably wouldn't be their problem.

989
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,080
Yeah.

990
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,340
And then it's like they're only a few bullet holes in the plane.

991
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,580
You can still see.

992
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,160
But like I was going to say, can you see them at the lone Palm air?

993
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,280
I believe you can.

994
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,460
OK, but I think they've been like because they he still flew the plane.

995
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,960
So I think they fixed up the plane.

996
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:35,340
It was decommissioned in 2003, so I don't think they were leaving a bunch of holes in it while he was still flying.

997
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,120
Has there ever been a situation?

998
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:48,580
Have any of these people then ended up any of these Jamaican government people ended up on vacation at City Walk and they go, oh, my God, there it is, the plane.

999
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,100
And then they take out their personal rifle and start firing.

1000
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,100
I knew it.

1001
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,540
And they just thought of habit.

1002
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,780
Yeah, it's going to smuggle some drugs out of City Walk Orlando.

1003
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,680
Yeah.

1004
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,520
Where do they pose with the plane?

1005
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,940
Like, oops, I'm sorry.

1006
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,420
You got to own your mistake.

1007
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,420
Because what can I say?

1008
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:12,500
It's there's got to be somebody who is involved with that that sees the plane and is like, oh, wow.

1009
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,200
Was it the is that maybe it's a different plane I shot it.

1010
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:17,640
Yeah.

1011
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:26,400
I mean, that's I was going to say, because these people might the like going policy in Jamaica might be if you don't exactly know where the plane came from.

1012
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,740
Just start firing at it.

1013
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,860
This is just like this is a regular.

1014
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,880
Just this is a regular afternoon for them.

1015
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:33,660
Fifty fifty.

1016
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,860
It's a sea plane.

1017
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,640
It's fifty fifty chance.

1018
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,300
Mm hmm.

1019
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,000
Better just just be safe.

1020
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,980
Just start firing.

1021
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,540
Yeah, I will say, though, that luckily like so.

1022
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:49,580
So the whole thing with the story is then the Jamaican government like says like they apologize formally.

1023
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,380
I think there's a newspaper headline.

1024
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,720
They're apologizing to Bono and Jimmy Buffett and everything.

1025
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,980
As far as their relationship with the Jamaican government went, Jimmy Buffett has restaurants in Jamaica now.

1026
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,600
Don't worry.

1027
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,640
That's how good the relationship is at this point.

1028
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:09,180
Would you accept the phrase I land to make Amanda?

1029
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,380
That's that I mean the term for the apology part of the story.

1030
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,700
I think so.

1031
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,600
I accept your regret or something like.

1032
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,980
Yeah, that's good.

1033
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:23,200
Yeah.

1034
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,440
So so yeah.

1035
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,960
So so this place now.

1036
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:45,500
So this is a I'm trying to think of as like a more famous story of Jimmy Buffett's either like or a different even let's think about like an analogous for a different rock star like their defining story with and then having a piece of memorabilia or an artifact from that story sitting at City Walk.

1037
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:49,840
Obviously, you know, hard rock, which, you know, has stuff like that.

1038
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,920
But this plane, this has got to be the most the biggest like Jimmy Buffett is Mr.

1039
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,620
Tall Tales.

1040
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,600
He likes spinning a web or whatever.

1041
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,120
But this did happen.

1042
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,800
And it's the biggest artifact.

1043
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,080
It's the biggest thing you could ever plant somewhere.

1044
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,680
The biggest story he has.

1045
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,300
Yeah.

1046
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:17,440
My thought is if you went to Chuck Berry's restaurant and he had the toilets that he installed the cameras over.

1047
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,620
These are my special toilet friends.

1048
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,860
So yeah, I'm bouncing all over here, but let me go here.

1049
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,000
So so Randy Leslie, real quick, Jimmy Buffett's pilot.

1050
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,080
There's just some some mysterious stories.

1051
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,360
They retired him.

1052
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,860
There's a story here about Randy being retired, which of course, when they say that, it means sounds like they're killing him.

1053
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,340
It sounds like they're drowning him with cement shoes.

1054
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,520
But Randy said to me and I don't know if we get the whoever is writing this.

1055
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,760
They're retiring me.

1056
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,300
He didn't seem to know why.

1057
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,840
Oh, a contract pilot, John Norcus said this, of course.

1058
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,280
Another character is answered who also worked for Buffett.

1059
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,860
He was disappointed that Jimmy didn't talk to him about it.

1060
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,740
It was handled by an underling.

1061
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,440
So Jimmy had like one of his worker guys fire Randy here.

1062
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:21,540
Paul Beecher, Jimmy Buffett is accused by several friends of his longtime pilot and party accomplice, Randy Leslie, of turning a blind eye to Leslie's ouster after 60 or 15 years.

1063
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:30,860
So Leslie entered Margarita Velour when the Buffett sea plane he was piloting was fired on by Jamaican police who mistook Leslie and his boss for drug runners.

1064
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:48,160
So this place on Buffett world dot com does when you dig in and you have to look for article on Buffett's former pilot does indicate that Randy Leslie was on this plane and Jimmy's former party accomplice, which is very interesting, too.

1065
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,120
Yeah, that's an interesting.

1066
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,600
I don't know that specific phrase.

1067
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,340
What a phrase.

1068
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,400
Yeah, it just implies that you're getting away with something.

1069
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,720
Yes, it is no mere, you know, these aren't just people sitting around having a chat.

1070
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,460
Right.

1071
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,060
You were partying like you've never partied.

1072
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,440
You guys have secrets.

1073
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,740
You guys share some bad secrets.

1074
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,520
Maybe that's what had to happen.

1075
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,240
I had to retire you, buddy.

1076
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,080
Give him a go watch.

1077
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:14,960
Kick him on the butt.

1078
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,640
Say goodbye.

1079
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:16,980
30 years.

1080
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,120
Keep your mouth shut.

1081
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:23,040
I think Jimmy, when this gentleman passed away, Jimmy took care of the he did.

1082
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,280
He did the nice good stuff for the kids and stuff.

1083
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,760
So he still eventually.

1084
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:36,280
But it felt like this, like his old party buddy got booted by like a like middle level manager of Margaritaville.

1085
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:44,400
And by doing good stuff for the kids, you mean he he bred a talking shrimp wearing sunglasses for each of them to own.

1086
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,500
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1087
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,820
From his lab, the Buffett Labs, which still is not public.

1088
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,820
But, you know, we know about it.

1089
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,160
Yeah.

1090
00:53:52,980 --> 00:54:04,120
So, yeah, I think that like when we're talking about I do think there should be like more of this story sort of told at the Orlando City Walk.

1091
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,080
I kind of think they need to force it a little bit more on you.

1092
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,260
I don't want it to ruin the vibe that you're learning a history lesson.

1093
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,080
But I don't know if it's is it animatronics?

1094
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,180
Sure.

1095
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,100
Is it by the plane?

1096
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:16,980
Well, they're right.

1097
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,920
I feel like there's bushes there and it's across that walkway.

1098
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,420
And so often it's like that show at the mall in Vegas, the whatever the fall of Rome thing.

1099
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,300
If some animatronics pop out and like, hey, what is that plane?

1100
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,240
Drug runners.

1101
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,200
Get them.

1102
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,040
Bang, bang, bang.

1103
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,480
Whoa, what's happening?

1104
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,740
Seems like a mistake in progress.

1105
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,700
Yeah, I mean, I'm I'm for anything.

1106
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,060
Anything like that is fine.

1107
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:48,440
I would just like a little box where you hit the button and it goes in 1996, Jimmy Buffett and Bono and his family were all like,

1108
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,340
you can even give me that like low five version of it.

1109
00:54:51,620 --> 00:55:02,140
I just think that the people there, I guess I said there's no criticism, but I guess the only criticism is just that I don't think people are chilling out there knowing what they're basking in the glow of.

1110
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,340
Yeah, yeah.

1111
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,400
It's like you would want to know that.

1112
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:10,260
I think you would want to know you're in a part of American rock and roll music history.

1113
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,920
So your complaint is there is a plaque and the plaque does not go far enough.

1114
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,920
Yeah, it doesn't fully illustrate it like two or three plaques.

1115
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,980
OK, that's better.

1116
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:23,480
I agree.

1117
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,660
That's mirrored.

1118
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:32,080
So sun hits them, shines a light, draws your eye to it, burns your eyes while you look at it.

1119
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,840
I mean, I was going to say one of the plaques could just be explaining how sea planes work.

1120
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:43,180
And then you a plaque about how Jimmy came to buy this one and when he liked about it.

1121
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,980
And then the third plaque is about the.

1122
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,860
Go on.

1123
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:56,860
Just a little more background, you know, about the general notion of sea planes and what their relationship to them.

1124
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:57,940
It's an H.

1125
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,360
U.

1126
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,900
16 C albatross.

1127
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,800
Grumman, is that the name of the plane?

1128
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,180
Grumman, Grumman, Grumman, Grumman.

1129
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,300
I think it's Grumman.

1130
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:12,060
They do the movie theaters and they do the sea planes.

1131
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,760
Yeah, I can give you the manufac.

1132
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,880
It was manufactured in 1955.

1133
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,900
OK, so it's like an old plane, too.

1134
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:25,280
I wouldn't think that an old plane like that, you want to keep flying it into the 1990s.

1135
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,820
So he was asking for trouble anyway.

1136
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,540
Yeah, would you?

1137
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,460
Well, I mean, only like Leno and some of the other people that drive old cars around Burbank are doing stuff like that.

1138
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,560
I guess they're souping them up.

1139
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,620
They're fixing them and making sure they run.

1140
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,600
But still, that's old technology.

1141
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,880
So Jimmy Buffett's Sea Plane Garage is a show that really should have happened.

1142
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,960
It was sitting there and he left money on the table.

1143
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,360
I agree.

1144
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,240
This was a Navy ship as well.

1145
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,980
OK, this was decommissioned.

1146
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,280
And so so I guess at one point it was probably top of the line.

1147
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,580
They drop it, drop nukes out of it, right?

1148
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,480
Yeah.

1149
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:57,780
Oh, yeah.

1150
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,820
This flew over Japan.

1151
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,400
That's the part they leave out.

1152
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,600
They do leave that out.

1153
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,860
Yeah, I bought it.

1154
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,180
It was a little just factoid on the sales sheet.

1155
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,060
Drop fat man and little boy.

1156
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,180
Yeah, he doesn't.

1157
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,340
He didn't have a song about that either.

1158
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,400
I also just just as far as current events are concerned,

1159
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:25,620
Boeing has had its about sixth problem with a plane in the last two weeks.

1160
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,460
Yeah, yeah.

1161
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,220
A lot of stuff happening.

1162
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,540
This and this strange, mysterious death of the whistleblower.

1163
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,240
I mean, who knows what happened there?

1164
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:41,020
There's really it's impossible to figure out what happened accidentally to whistle.

1165
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,440
If in case you don't know what we're talking about,

1166
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:47,300
there was a guy who is whistleblowing who used to work at Boeing who has testified a little bit against them

1167
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,900
and said like they've whether they had there was a merger.

1168
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,240
And because of all this, they've cut costs and planes are falling apart.

1169
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:01,220
And there's about literally six incidents in two weeks or something where like shit is falling off of planes

1170
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:05,560
and like planes are just dropping from like altitudes aggressively.

1171
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,040
And then this guy was set to testify against them.

1172
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
And then he's dead.

1173
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,920
He died mysteriously.

1174
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,960
So mysterious.

1175
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,580
All of a sudden.

1176
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,260
It's really mysterious.

1177
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:22,700
I also can we think of you talk and then are you spill?

1178
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:24,580
We kill.

1179
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:26,660
Yeah.

1180
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,260
OK, there you go.

1181
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,400
Well, he was he was going to talk about the not very publicly known story.

1182
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,480
Boeing, no wing.

1183
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,420
Wings fell off.

1184
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,620
Things fell off of it.

1185
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,020
None of the stories are as fun as this one.

1186
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,380
I don't know about his family, but I don't think they would have said Bono was on one of the planes.

1187
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,780
So you're not going to be telling these stories, right?

1188
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,020
It's not it's not OK.

1189
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,420
I guess we can eliminate that.

1190
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,020
Mike, you don't just like telling stories of aerial mishaps.

1191
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,320
You aren't gleefully at parties telling stories about the Alaskan airplane where the door fell off.

1192
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,360
No, no, no, I didn't.

1193
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,640
I don't tell that story.

1194
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,500
I tell that story a lot, but I don't have a joy.

1195
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,800
There's no smile on my face.

1196
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,660
Yeah, they found an iPhone like miles away.

1197
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,500
It survived.

1198
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,540
Oh, is that true?

1199
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,520
That is true.

1200
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,460
Yeah, they did find a guy's iPhone.

1201
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,120
So somebody's phone got sucked out.

1202
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:21,760
Oh, wow.

1203
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,220
OK.

1204
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,260
And then he got returned.

1205
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,500
I think they returned it to him.

1206
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,260
I would hope.

1207
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,640
But that's interesting.

1208
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,740
So that that actually that that speaks to the durability of the iPhone.

1209
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,140
At least I think was in a case.

1210
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,420
So so you may be the case did the lift.

1211
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,800
The case breaks the fall even from thousands of feet in the air.

1212
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,280
Wow.

1213
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,480
Get yourself a case.

1214
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,120
We need to find out what case that is.

1215
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:43,600
Wow.

1216
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,100
Alaska door blasta anyway.

1217
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,200
Trying to pick up speed on these.

1218
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,740
Yes, please play at home listeners.

1219
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,580
And yeah, that testimony will be whistleblower.

1220
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,400
No show up.

1221
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,940
Not showing up.

1222
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,640
Got some of his testimony out.

1223
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,780
Didn't get it all out.

1224
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,520
Epstein, suicide, not alive.

1225
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,280
I don't know.

1226
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:11,960
That's not good.

1227
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,940
So, yeah, so so this also this this this story, I think, is it's

1228
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,260
a Buffett's book, A Pirate Looks at Fifty.

1229
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,380
He writes about this story.

1230
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:31,280
And then that kind of seems like people say that's when all of a sudden now it's on clothing.

1231
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,620
It's on merchandise.

1232
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:42,660
It's on the men like that's sort of when it becomes like a big part of sort of the Buffett lore when the phrase Jamaica Mistake leaves or the story and the sea or you say the seaplane.

1233
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:43,280
Well, the seas.

1234
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:57,520
Yeah, just the iconography of the seaplane itself, because we of course, this story, I've told this before, but this might only be the first or the second time, excuse me, when we were at the Margaritaville Resort or the living Margarita Village in Orlando.

1235
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,600
And there was a gift shop in the part of the hotel area.

1236
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,240
Oh, yes.

1237
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,320
You remember this.

1238
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:06,480
Remember you recall that there was a shirt.

1239
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:07,960
There was a shirt.

1240
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:08,520
Yes.

1241
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:08,920
Yeah.

1242
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:09,400
Yes.

1243
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:15,060
And then there was a woman who worked there, though, who immediately once I seem to know anything, she was very excited.

1244
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,960
And she actually did seem to be steeped in the knowledge of it.

1245
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,660
But we don't have to finish.

1246
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,120
We don't have to.

1247
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,920
Margarita Rapida.

1248
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,240
Yeah, that's very good.

1249
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:24,700
Yeah.

1250
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,720
So, yeah, so I think that's that's sort of yeah, he puts that out there.

1251
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,860
And then he tells he he tells a version of the story.

1252
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:42,360
And now it is just as iconic as the Eddie Van Halen guitar that used to be immortalized in a giant way at the hard rock up here or something.

1253
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,160
It's the seaplane.

1254
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,340
That's his seaplane.

1255
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,940
And because of the story and because it's just you can't escape it now.

1256
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:56,200
And I think when the AI takes over and whoever is running his estate in the next 50 years, I think it's only going to grow.

1257
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,960
It's going to be little toys of him in the plane.

1258
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,820
And like you'll see like you'll see this everywhere is what I'm saying.

1259
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,420
They're now going to start making little toys of the plane.

1260
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:10,580
Well, I think they'll continue to make merchandise of it is what I guess really all I'm saying is that this is a big part of it.

1261
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:16,000
And I'm I'm part of this unpaid PR campaign to get the plane out there more somehow.

1262
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,500
Well, you certainly popularized it within people who listen to this show.

1263
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:23,900
Yeah, I think a lot of people passed by that plane and didn't know a thing about it.

1264
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:28,980
And now this is one of those things that we've talked about this before.

1265
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:38,540
But this for sure is one of there's so many people listening who have forced people to hear that story who were maybe interested or maybe not interested.

1266
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:44,300
But you have you this is a disease that you have spread maybe very clearly.

1267
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:47,680
And I think that's a gift to that outside bar to see it.

1268
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,320
Yeah, yeah.

1269
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,340
You know, yes.

1270
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,360
And now with this episode, I think it's a nice tidy.

1271
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:59,560
That's not tidy, but it's a nice explanation of some of the details that may have been lost in my telling of the story over the years.

1272
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:06,040
And I want you to drag that loved one back out there and say, did you know that Randy Leslie was flying this plane?

1273
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,020
You can add now details to the story.

1274
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,600
And I think that's a gift that you're welcome.

1275
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,620
It's like you think the story can't get crazier.

1276
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,760
And then you learn that Randy Leslie is part of it.

1277
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:17,980
Yep.

1278
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,440
Then you learn that Randy Leslie.

1279
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,320
This whole thing is flipped the story just like a sea plane, sea plane flipping.

1280
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:23,960
That's right.

1281
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,200
And we're talking about the Universal Orlando Resort.

1282
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:38,720
I want to know now, does the second sea plane, the sea plane parked by the Royal Pacific Hotel, does that have a story?

1283
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,500
Is that just a prop?

1284
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,560
Is it not actually a plane?

1285
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,500
Oh, interesting.

1286
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,020
Well, it's not Jim Buffett related, but you don't know about that.

1287
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,740
That was Joe Walsh was flying it.

1288
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,000
And James Dolan was on the plane with Joe Walsh.

1289
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,120
Bob Geldof.

1290
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,780
Bob Geldof was there.

1291
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,020
A cannon like a pirate ship cannon.

1292
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah, they sold some vintage cannons.

1293
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,380
Turks and Gaicos, so big yikes.

1294
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,320
So anyway, I don't know.

1295
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:16,920
That's really that's it.

1296
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:17,820
As far as that.

1297
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,200
And I don't.

1298
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:22,180
Yeah, this honestly, this doesn't feel like the tribute to Buffett that should be.

1299
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,220
So I'm going to have to kick that down the road.

1300
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,340
Still more.

1301
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,160
More.

1302
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,700
I'm just going to have to kick that down the road.

1303
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,520
Like when Jimmy playing, kicking the can.

1304
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,080
What do you want to be in the episode that we haven't covered by now?

1305
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,780
We haven't finished the books.

1306
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,120
Well, the problem was, yeah, well, the books.

1307
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,080
That's the whole situation with the books.

1308
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:42,880
Tully Mars.

1309
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,080
Tully Mars.

1310
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,780
We said, yeah, yeah.

1311
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:50,760
I think that we haven't dug into the catalog of music completely, obviously.

1312
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,780
And I think that we have.

1313
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:55,000
What?

1314
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,940
There's a lot of outings.

1315
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,400
Scott agreed for a half second.

1316
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,120
No, it's just because I was.

1317
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,220
He was busy typing.

1318
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,140
I know I was well, I was trying to.

1319
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,100
No, I'm not saying you were distracted.

1320
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:04,700
I would know.

1321
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,580
I was distracted.

1322
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,740
I was busy figuring out Tully Mars.

1323
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,580
Scott gets in his car.

1324
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,880
We have one, Mike.

1325
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,860
What haven't we?

1326
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:14,760
What is left?

1327
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,420
I understand the books, maybe the books.

1328
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:17,740
Sure.

1329
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,680
Well, thank you.

1330
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:19,780
Scott agrees with the books.

1331
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,520
Yeah.

1332
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,400
Escape from a scrape to Margaritaville.

1333
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,200
We've yet to do a full episode on.

1334
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,660
And there's still the man made a lot of music in his life.

1335
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,320
There's this big tribute concert coming soon.

1336
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:30,860
Oh, yeah.

1337
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,980
What's your deal with that?

1338
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,860
Because that went on sale recently.

1339
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,700
It's just like it was when I got into the queue to buy tickets,

1340
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,140
it said your number 18,351 or something.

1341
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:43,440
Oh, my god.

1342
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,400
It gave you a number?

1343
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,180
It gave me a number.

1344
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:45,440
That sucks.

1345
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,860
And I was like, yeah.

1346
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,860
And I did the math of how long that would take.

1347
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,160
And it was not fast.

1348
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,900
So I think everything is mostly resale right now.

1349
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:54,440
But you know.

1350
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,360
Now for any listeners who might not know about the big tribute

1351
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,360
concert, what's happening in the tribute?

1352
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,320
Is it the Hollywood Bowl?

1353
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,340
Hollywood Bowl, Pit Bowl, Paul McCartney.

1354
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,860
Oh, this is Mike's dream.

1355
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:04,180
The Eagles.

1356
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,080
Oh, my god.

1357
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:06,420
The Eagles.

1358
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,240
The Coral Reefer Band, of course.

1359
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:10,060
I think Sheryl Crow is there.

1360
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,860
If does it have the word tribute in it, then yes, Sheryl Crow is there.

1361
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,060
Sheryl Crow will be there.

1362
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,620
And I forget there's some others other people too.

1363
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,840
But McCartney's ex Pit Bowl is really what I.

1364
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:24,920
I'm not going to perform together, but still the idea of them on the same show with the Hollywood Bowl.

1365
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,580
Oh, you're the ex like a collaboration.

1366
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:27,540
Yeah, that's what I'm sorry.

1367
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:31,140
I said Paul McCartney's ex Pit Bowl and I'm like, what did I miss?

1368
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:31,740
That would be.

1369
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:33,500
I have not been reading People magazine.

1370
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,260
That would be an interesting story too.

1371
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,120
Like this plain story if they were.

1372
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:37,620
Yeah.

1373
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,900
But no, that's not the case.

1374
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,100
It doesn't say Pit Bowl and John Travolta.

1375
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,140
Yeah, I don't know that he's not there, but just it doesn't say it is all I'm saying.

1376
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:50,840
But yes, this collection of artists paying tribute to Buffett at the Hollywood Bowl.

1377
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,300
It seems like a great night.

1378
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:53,180
We had a.

1379
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,360
You just so you you brought it up before we started recording.

1380
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:58,060
And I said, oh, you said, well, the ticket line is too long.

1381
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,080
I think it's sold out immediately.

1382
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,200
And I was like, oh, well, sorry, you can't go.

1383
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,840
And you said, no, just means I got to work harder.

1384
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:05,720
Well, that's true.

1385
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:06,220
Yeah.

1386
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:07,520
What here?

1387
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:11,580
This is the end of this episode is not the time for me to get into this long explanation.

1388
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:16,260
But the ticket, everything buying tickets sucks so bad now.

1389
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:17,740
Everything is dynamic pricing.

1390
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:23,700
Everything is an algorithm to design designed to make everybody spend the most money possible from fast food,

1391
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:29,780
from Wendy's to other different fast food that are like changes the price, depending on the time of day.

1392
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:34,920
That said, unrelatedly, do you want to remind people we do have a five dollar and eight dollar tier on the Patreon?

1393
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,060
A lot of great bonus content on there.

1394
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,620
And it's not dynamic pricing.

1395
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:39,800
No, we don't.

1396
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:40,640
We don't change.

1397
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:43,420
Wendy's has disowned the dynamic price.

1398
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,740
Yeah, they just didn't like getting.

1399
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:50,140
But there's other but other fast food places apparently have already done it and did it quietly.

1400
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:54,240
So I think Wendy's was like, oh, no, we weren't doing that or whatever.

1401
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,320
But I mean, the ads make it so.

1402
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,240
Yes, mysterious.

1403
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:57,800
Right.

1404
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,860
But take a tangent to Scott's spent.

1405
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,540
But tickets, it sucks to buy tickets now because of this.

1406
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:11,340
And but but what I'll say is that as the concert approaches, you got to check.

1407
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:19,140
And they put like face value tickets back in as concert approaches, as stages are assembled, as comps are given out.

1408
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:26,900
That's the time when Michael strikes is as the the eve of concert concert day.

1409
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:27,560
I see.

1410
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,140
So you like a checker.

1411
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,820
This work I could I could bring the first one I didn't like.

1412
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,480
I'm sorry.

1413
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:37,760
Everything else was good.

1414
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,360
Got a rhyme.

1415
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,380
I get tired.

1416
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,180
Yeah, I know.

1417
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:40,960
It's been yeah.

1418
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:41,200
Yeah.

1419
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:41,360
Yeah.

1420
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,520
So anyway, so yeah, I'm not saying I'm not.

1421
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:53,400
Don't count me out for partying with Pitbull and Paul to celebrate and Bono and Bono, who you will become great friends with because he knows he knew Jimmy.

1422
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,560
I'm not saying we could.

1423
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,580
I'm not saying we will.

1424
01:08:55,740 --> 01:09:00,940
I'm saying we could if the scenario is correct, because it just indicates that he's a chiller guy than I think.

1425
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:01,760
Mm hmm.

1426
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,720
That's all I'm saying.

1427
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,260
Yeah.

1428
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,740
Do you do you consider yourself a chill guy?

1429
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:12,640
I would say that if I got a good laugh out of Jason on that, I would say, thanks, brother.

1430
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:21,600
Well, I would say I don't mean to throw my money out at Jason like that last city walk episode where he laughed.

1431
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,680
I would say that I am half I'm half chill.

1432
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:28,800
You can be you can be.

1433
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:31,080
We had plenty of chill moments during this.

1434
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:31,720
I'm just saying.

1435
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1436
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,940
No, I think I think I'm deceptively neurotic.

1437
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:46,680
I think that anxiety and neuroses, I think it's deceptive because there's plenty of times when I'm very, very even keel and calm.

1438
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,360
Mm hmm.

1439
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,860
But what lies beneath?

1440
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,300
That's the question.

1441
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,580
And then what comes up from the surface sometimes?

1442
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,040
Yeah.

1443
01:09:53,060 --> 01:10:01,000
So it's and what lies awake for hours at night reading about microplastics and new strains of covid.

1444
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,440
And 100 toward toy deals, you need to.

1445
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1446
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:06,200
It's feeding.

1447
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,380
It's feeding something.

1448
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,960
It's feeding some beast.

1449
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:16,560
It's a feed of beast, the beast feast feast feast feast feast feast feast feast feast feast feast feast feast feast feast feast feastabenzied.

1450
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,520
Yeah.

1451
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:22,000
So so no, I would I would be on my best chill behavior with Bono.

1452
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,900
I'm not giving him the you'd say I'm cool.

1453
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:26,820
I'm chill.

1454
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:27,280
Yeah.

1455
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,140
Yeah.

1456
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:28,320
Yeah.

1457
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,240
I would let him know.

1458
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,420
That's the only way you let somebody know if you're cool and chill.

1459
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,840
And I and I'm and I'm young and with it.

1460
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,020
And I listen to music that isn't by you.

1461
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:36,260
Yeah.

1462
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:40,800
That's not to say I love your music, but I'm just letting you know I also like young people's music.

1463
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,300
One of the things that makes me chill.

1464
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:43,720
Yeah.

1465
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,480
So that will be you go down fine.

1466
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,840
It would be fine.

1467
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:53,160
So anyway, this is this is just, you know, to be continued is really all I'm trying to say.

1468
01:10:54,020 --> 01:11:00,840
To be continued to be here's what I want to say to be continued in the short term and to be continued in the long term.

1469
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,200
That's all I'm going to say.

1470
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,380
The battle continues.

1471
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,240
Well, in the short term, done, done, done, done.

1472
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,640
In the short term.

1473
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,460
Oh, my God.

1474
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:11,140
The sector stone there it is is appearing.

1475
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,320
Wow.

1476
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,680
This it is.

1477
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,960
I mean, I feel like Mike has to see the sector stone.

1478
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:18,380
Yeah.

1479
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:21,080
Being this a big area of Mike's interest.

1480
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:29,080
It's a it's a bronze tier of Randy Leslie, Jimmy Buffett's former pilot and party accomplice.

1481
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,940
So they took one of his tier, a tier from his eye.

1482
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:35,500
They took the actual tier from his eye and they bronzed it.

1483
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,580
And now it's just a teardrop.

1484
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,280
And that's what our sector stone is for this.

1485
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:46,560
Immortalizing the sadness for being quietly replaced in the Buffett organization.

1486
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,300
So that's just what it is.

1487
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,160
I wish it wasn't.

1488
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,800
But that's on a Randy Monsa.

1489
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Randy Monsa.

1490
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:55,440
All right.

1491
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:55,640
Great.

1492
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:56,340
Well, that did it.

1493
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:02,820
You survived podcast, the Red City Walker, Orlando Saga Multiverse of Menace, full analysis of Hemisphere Dancer Edition.

1494
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:08,460
Before we wrap up, we need to check in with the sector keeper and figure out what we're doing tomorrow.

1495
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,640
Let's see if we can summon him.

1496
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,280
Hello, boys, boys.

1497
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:14,480
Hey, all right.

1498
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:20,760
Well, this phase, the age of Buffett is proceeding pretty nicely.

1499
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:24,500
And I think I have some idea of where we might be going.

1500
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,500
So I guess tomorrow we'll maybe go review like the restaurant.

1501
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,200
And that'll be that right.

1502
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,240
You mean restaurants?

1503
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,920
Oh, because it's one of those.

1504
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:36,420
It's the there's multiple.

1505
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,280
Alpha and Omega.

1506
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,040
Right.

1507
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,780
We're hanging loose in the age of Buffett, baby.

1508
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:41,780
Oh, I see.

1509
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,620
Taking our time.

1510
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:43,780
Five o'clock somewhere.

1511
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:44,280
All right.

1512
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,320
Well, what is this then?

1513
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:45,640
All right.

1514
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,840
So what happens tomorrow?

1515
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,700
Two places because the Hemisphere Dancer is a cosmic nook, boys.

1516
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:53,100
Oh, you told us about those.

1517
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:53,540
That's right.

1518
01:12:53,660 --> 01:13:01,140
Just as it took Bono on an unforgettable adventure, it too can take you to a special dual jump point.

1519
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:01,780
Whoa.

1520
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,580
Wait, a jump point to two places at once?

1521
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,400
That's possible.

1522
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,620
That's right, boys.

1523
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:10,920
Climb inside the Hemisphere Dancer for your crucial double mission.

1524
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:17,600
Tomorrow, you must review both Margaritaville Alpha and Margaritaville Omega.

1525
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,160
OK, so the Orlando one and the Hollywood.

1526
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,480
OK, well, we're reversing that.

1527
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,140
We've now done that.

1528
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,400
We did that with NBC Sports Group.

1529
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,260
OK, so tomorrow's episode will be.

1530
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:26,000
Tomorrow's episodes.

1531
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,480
What's that now?

1532
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,380
No, no, no, no.

1533
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:29,400
Separate episodes.

1534
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,240
Alpha and Omega are separate episodes.

1535
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,040
Oh, we have to have a separate episode for each.

1536
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:34,740
That's right.

1537
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:38,980
OK, and then one will come out one day and then the next one will come out the next day.

1538
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,720
Same day.

1539
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,740
We're living in the age of bumping.

1540
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,120
Oh, age of bumping.

1541
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,280
The rules are different.

1542
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,900
When he says it's five o'clock somewhere, he means it's five o'clock in two episodes.

1543
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:49,700
Oh my God.

1544
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:56,220
OK, so tomorrow or whenever at midnight when they come out, we have to have two separate episodes.

1545
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,260
One about Margaritaville Orlando and the other about.

1546
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,020
We can't combine these.

1547
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,020
That's right.

1548
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,320
Heavy is the parrot head.

1549
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:09,060
Hat that wears the crown or head.

1550
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,400
That wears the crown.

1551
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,460
Whatever it is, we'll figure it out tomorrow.

1552
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,140
OK, well, you know what?

1553
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:22,140
That's all right, because there's so many, you know, like fun menu options at this place.

1554
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:23,980
We'll have time to talk about all of it.

1555
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,340
We try everything on the menu.

1556
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,800
Boys, if anything, we have to be consistent.

1557
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,080
We know that at this point, same meal, no alterations.

1558
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,880
So we have to order the same meal on each coast and review it in separate episodes.

1559
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,500
Yes.

1560
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,960
Oh, OK.

1561
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,280
We have to order the exact same meal, a entire nation apart.

1562
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:44,520
You're learning, boys.

1563
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,660
You're learning.

1564
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:50,940
Well, learning that whatever is the most complicated version is what we'll always do.

1565
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:53,290
OK, so tomorrow.

1566
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:54,320
Sorry.

1567
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:54,980
All right.

1568
01:14:55,100 --> 01:15:00,460
So tomorrow, listeners, refresh your feed for two episodes.

1569
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:00,920
Oh, yeah.

1570
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:08,180
And I'm also seeing on the dossier you've just given us that one of the episodes will be on the Patreon behind the paywall.

1571
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:14,060
Well, if you were having trouble keeping up already, good luck now.

1572
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:14,840
Heck yeah.

1573
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,620
Good luck, boys.

1574
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:18,800
Forever.

1575
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:20,560
Dog.

1576
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,400
This has been a Forever Dog Production.

1577
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:31,980
