1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
DOG!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Warning the following podcasts may contain unified taffy agreements

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Chuck E. Cheese's skeleton wearing the skin of a different animal

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A very rare mention of F-troop actor Larry Storch

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And the danger of teens claiming too many boardwalk benches

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
All that plus Alan McLeod joins us to talk the Ocean City, New Jersey boardwalk

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
On today's podcast, The Ride

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, but today alt title, Taffy Boys

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm Taffy Boy Scott, there over there is Taffy Boy Jason

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I was wondering if you were going to go for Seaside Confections

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Or the title America's Greatest Family Resort

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Which is heavy marketing

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Jason, I could not go too, this is deeper than I can go

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Because this is not my place, it's not a place I've been

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's a place you've been, we've talked about before

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Basically a second home

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, and a place dear to our guests seemingly

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Mike Carlson, I don't know

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Never been, but I am a Taffy Boy

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You don't have to be in Ocean City to be a Taffy Boy

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Catch all of this, I feel like Ocean City boardwalk is that kind of the way to

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I think that's right, Ocean City, we need to clarify Ocean City, New Jersey

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Because Ocean City, Maryland is a very different town

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Is another thing, yeah, and I got confused in some research where I started

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because it seems like there's like two main parks that we're dealing with on the boardwalk here

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And then I bumped into a third and like, what are you, hang on, what?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A whole other, and then really got a little bit into it and realized it was Maryland

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A whole different history, Ocean City, Maryland

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So that means, Trimper's Rides, you're out

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Out on the Trimper

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Enjoy getting air right now, because that's it for you, Trimper

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Not till we make it to Maryland, but we're in New Jersey here

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And this comes courtesy of a great guest, somebody who, it defies logic that he has not been here yet

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I'm happy it's happening

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Being on the show, you'd have to say, it's a no-brainer

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Very glad to have

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's got a great new podcast called Walkin' About

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And I'm excited to talk about that

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you're a Doughboyz fan, you know him as Molasses Boy

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's Alan McLeod, hello

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hey, oh my gosh

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm so happy to be on

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I guess it does, everything's so crazy in the world

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It does seem logical now that I am here, you know

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes, finally, finally, there's something, things make sense

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This crazy world of ours

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's good to be here with all the taffy boys

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I am a Molasses Boy

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Which is also available

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Aesthetically very close

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's very close and it's available at the same shops that you might find along the boardwalk if you're getting your saltwater taffy

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Sticky and sweet, both molasses and taffy

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, and I saw a big line, I watched a video that filmed a big line of taffy barrels

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
At the place you've talked about before, Jason, Shriver's is the name of it

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Shriver's, yeah

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Home of Mr. Taffy, a mascot character, you brought us a toy that my son loves

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And I saw in that line up of taffy barrels some molasses taffy

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There you go

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It all ties together

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Happy to be in second or third or fourth place, I don't know how you would rank the chewy treats

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, Jason should have this on the top of his head

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
In terms of taffy or in terms of Shriver's?

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Shriver's, yeah, yeah

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I rank Shriver's pretty high

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, I mean, just as far as like

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're talking more taffy versus molasses versus

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know what else

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Molasses is not really just you eat it on its own, right?

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Do you just drink a cup of molasses?

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You guys don't do that?

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't really picture, I don't have a clear image of if I'm looking at just molasses, what is it?

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You don't do that? Well, molasses is like the leftover stuff after you make something good

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They're like, what do we do with this shit?

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Put it into some cookies or something

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's got a fun name

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How do you feel that the nickname that's stuck to you is that it's

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now you're equating it with leftovers

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Does it feel like it?

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There's something good in everything, you know?

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I mean, I don't know, it's a very utilitarian nickname maybe

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Use every bit of everything

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've fully accepted that

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The name originated from me being slow

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Being a slow boy and turned into a slow man that's accepted that name

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Did it come from, did they name you that? Did Doughboys name you that?

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Or did you come in, has that been floating around?

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's an old football nickname

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
From being too slow on the offensive line

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's not an easy going attitude

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's now become more of a lifestyle

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You've owned it now

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's my brand

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But it is nice to see that molasses is available at Shriver's

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Which is a place that I love

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I love looking at those machines

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I love just kind of going to see what they're doing

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
In that little factory through the window

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, yeah, those like 100 plus year old machines

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They're still using

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They don't make them like that anymore

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So you get to see people doing

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's like on Disneyland Main Street you get to see people making candy apples or something

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you get to see people like doing it, churning it out

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Working on the taffy

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, it's great

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is wow

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The mind meld that happened

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Not since you were paired with your own past self

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
During the City Walk saga was there such agreement

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I mean this is great

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I love that this is where we're starting from

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And that you brought us this out

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That you wanted to talk about this

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because perfect for Jason, this is great

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I love that

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But we were both like

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Where does your Ocean City, New Jersey fondness come from?

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because you grew up Alabama

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah, so this is

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And so the

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I do

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I have a huge fondness for Ocean City

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And it's from my wife's family

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They do a family reunion there pretty much every year

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And have done it since for decades and decades

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And then so when I kind of came along

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I started accompanying Stacy on these family reunions

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And just fell in love with Ocean City

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And you know had never really been to

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Spent any time in New Jersey like at all

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And you know I just

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I like

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
While I don't have a nostalgia from being a kid there

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I embrace

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's automatically a place you just become nostalgic for

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because it's so stuck in time and just like

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh sure

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Such

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Just a fun environment

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
A fun place to go

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Of course I love walking around

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So it's like

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
If you don't like walking

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Then I don't know Ocean City might not be the place for you

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because not only just

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I mean parking is not easy

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Like once you kind of find a parking spot

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's like you're not driving around much

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Like you just kind of make your way around

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And then of course the boardwalk

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Which is about two and a half miles long

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think it's eight miles

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh really

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
When

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think two and a half for like

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You know

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Amusement parks and restaurants and stuff

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But the boardwalk keeps going in both directions

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
To like houses and stuff

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Houses and beaches

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But the like amusement zone

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The amusement zone itself is like two and a half, three miles

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Something like that

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's pretty good

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's good

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Blocks and blocks

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Wow

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Of it

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Crazy

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So it's just a place that from getting to go and see my wife's family

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And get a sense of like hear all the stories that they've had from when they were kids

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And that their parents had from when they were kids

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You just kind of develop a real appreciation for it

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And taking tours

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I remember we took several years ago

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Took like a ghost tour around

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And it was just hilarious

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You know

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Because you get to know a bit more about the history of the area

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And it was just really funny

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Like the guide was just a very old man

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Who sort of made an attempt at a costume

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
With sort of a pirate shirt

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And but he kept trying to recruit my friend Chris

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And kind of like pass the torch to him

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You know

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Like who Chris was living in Philadelphia at the time

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And he was like

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You might be a good guide

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You know

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And he kept trying to convince Chris

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
To take over the business

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah to take over the business

201
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Like on the tour

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It was so funny

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Was he doing that like to every group he had

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Like finding one person in the group

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And going maybe this person will get me out of this hell

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Maybe

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Or there's a pyramid

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh yeah perhaps

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's what it is

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Just give me 10%

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But otherwise you control the business

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's a good point

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's funny you say that

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because I never took the ghost tour

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But my memory in the mid to late 90s

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Is the ghost tour company

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And I don't know if it's the same company

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know if it's popped up and gone away

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But I remember they had a building

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Or they had offices shared with

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It was ghost tour and internet cafe

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I was brand new to the internet at the time

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And I was like mom mom we gotta go over to the city

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We gotta check out this internet cafe

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I just remember the signs outside

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Like ghost tour slash internet cafe

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's so awesome

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know if this ghost tour had a brick and mortar office

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I can't imagine

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah

232
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And I can't remember that

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Sadly I can't remember the name of the tour that we took

234
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But it was very memorable for that aspect alone

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Internet cafes are gonna be one of those really hard things to explain to our kids

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Now that all cafes are internet cafes

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
These had to be specially designated

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay imagine you're borrowing a dirty desktop computer

240
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay a desktop computer is

241
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Let me go back

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well now they have cafes that are specifically non-internet right?

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Like I mean

244
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Some places yeah

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So you can really like interact with humans I guess that's the idea right?

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You're not all on your device

247
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Right so you can like get into that book you're reading

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Or really like you know be present with your friends

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Right

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Well Med like all of the great you know think about Seinfeld, Frasier friends

251
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
All of them cafe central location

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Right yes

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And today all of them would just be they just sit down and plop right down on their phones

254
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's right yeah

255
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No hijinks would ensue

256
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No relationship discussion

257
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's so true

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There'd be no stories would occur we're all missing out you might say

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I would say

261
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The existence of Wi-Fi makes it so we don't get into any capers at that one place that we go

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Right

263
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I mean it ruins a lot of horror movie stories you know

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes true

265
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You would text

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I would just text the policeman

267
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There was an episode of Studio 60 that took it right up to the wire where like

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We're deep in cell phone era like but they wanted to trap some characters on the roof

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And they like so they have to write it into it like

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We're in the one place in Los Angeles where there's no cell reception

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Sorkin has just said on it

272
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Figure it out

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I want we gotta trap character there's romantic tension between the characters

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We gotta put them on the roof

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Figure it out

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's pockets where there's no reception

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Wouldn't a roof have better reception?

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't know

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Fuck it

280
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Couldn't they have just left their phones in their office?

281
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No that's a good one

282
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Jeez

283
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Well you should have been in there

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah you should have

285
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You should have

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I tried I tried so hard to intern on Studio 60

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You actually did?

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes I did

289
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That lined up with your like Okwood summer

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It lined up with my out semester in LA

291
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And it was like everyone was like oh Aaron Sorkin's making a new TV show

292
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And it's shooting right at Warner Brothers and on the street from the Okwood apartment

293
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And if you can get in on that you'll be there for 10 seasons straight

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I did not they didn't hire any interns except one person

295
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Because her mom was Bradley Whitford's cousin

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
There you go

297
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
How close did you get?

298
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Did you just how did you learn that about like oh I was rejected

299
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like did you have an in did you have an inside person?

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh she told I she was another student

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh you knew her?

302
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah no I knew her and she was like oh they didn't hire I just got in

303
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I just got in because my mom is related to Bradley

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh wow

305
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You still got that number?

306
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Give us that contact info we could get in with Bradley Whitford's

307
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh I mean I guess so I never really thought about it

308
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We're really close with her

309
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This could be a ticket for all of us

310
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Except when you were like what are you holding out on her?

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I want that internship

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Okay wait where were we?

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That was from cell phone so it was from internet cafes

314
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay well speaking of like you know harkening back to times gone by

315
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Am I correct that Ocean City is a dry city?

316
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You are correct

317
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Dry as a bone

318
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Dry as a bone the thing that always makes me laugh

319
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There's I think three bridges into town and at the foot of all those bridges

320
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Cause you can bring alcohol in you can have alcohol in your homes

321
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And you can drink it at home you can't drink it on the beach

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But at the foot of every bridge on the mainland is a giant liquor store

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh as soon as not even one foot from where you get to

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh yeah we always stop at I can't remember the name of this show

325
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But it's just like that you stop cause you have to fly in for I mean as far as I know

326
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Either from here you fly into like New York or Atlantic City or Philadelphia

327
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Or Philadelphia yeah yeah

328
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So yeah generally the drive from any of those areas you got to stop at one of these bridge liquor stores

329
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Well to also get generally their groceries and stuff too

330
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So you're kind of stocking up for a week or whatever

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But yeah that's where people just have carts full of booze

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And there is a lot of controversy in the last few years because some restaurants

333
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So for the longest time you couldn't do BYOB

334
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
In the last few years some restaurants established membership supper clubs

335
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Where if you paid like 10 bucks 15 bucks you joined the member

336
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You were a member and then you could BYOB

337
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This dance you have to do to what are we retaining here

338
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Because doesn't it just cause because I saw that you know like despite being a dry city

339
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That Ocean City was declared the drunkest town in New Jersey

340
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Does it not just create more

341
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
People overcompensate for that maybe

342
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah but also like as I was alluding to at the top

343
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Like at some point I think at a travel channel special it was deemed like

344
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Number one America's greatest family resort

345
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And they just took that moniker and just they have stamped it on beach tags

346
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They've stamped on t-shirts they stamped it on marketing material

347
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Something the travel channel said once

348
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Not any official there was no voting body for this

349
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There might have been voting or it could have been a poll

350
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But I was like I was having trouble finding the origin of it

351
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But I just remember at some point in high school I started to see

352
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Just one day there was all this stuff about America's greatest family resort

353
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Well what was the town what's the town where Bruce Springsteen is from

354
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's Asbury Park that's further up North Jersey

355
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I feel like there was a time when Asbury Park was a dry town or something

356
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Like a long time ago or something

357
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And then they introduced they made it not a dry town anymore whatever

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
They made it just a regular wet town

359
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And then it all turned and that's like when the rock and roll scene really like took off

360
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And the people that kind of the the forebearers before even Bruce Springsteen kind of and what led to him you know

361
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So I feel like there's like this new you know the neighboring towns or whatever

362
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Because I don't even know if Atlantic City isn't that probably not a dry town

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No Atlantic City and even if you go either direction to either Sea Isle or Margate or Venter

364
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Immediately there's yeah bars so like Ocean City New Jersey is like we're doing our own thing

365
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We're not becoming one of those rock and roll towns

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You know we're always drunk coming out of the Taj Mahal or whatever Trump building in Atlantic City

367
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We don't want any global rock stars being born here

368
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Maybe causing tourism

369
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It goes back to the founding because the town was founded by like Methodist who wanted like a wholesome place to go on vacation

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Gotcha

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And yeah it's just kind of kept the wholesomeness kind of vibe the whole time

372
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But it's funny I say that like Cape May New Jersey which is at the end of like the coast

373
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Also a lot of historical stuff and like you know very focused on preserving the old houses

374
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And a lot of restaurants have been there a long and long time

375
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And people have their traditions family trips family reunions that they do and stuff

376
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But Cape May is like a wet town and it doesn't seem like grimy

377
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Some towns are very wet towns and seem very grimy

378
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Very wet

379
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The wettest and the grimmiest of towns

381
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But we just passed Memorial Day weekend and I saw there were at some of the beach towns like Ocean City

382
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
At like you know there were a bunch of teens like roving bands of teens

383
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
There was only one stabbing which is unusual

384
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Because there's more usually or it's unusual

385
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What's that?

386
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because there's more stabbing

387
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Usually a number of stabbing

388
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Usually it's just rowdy teens and they just get arrested for what?

389
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Drinking or weed and then they just take them to the police station

390
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And the parents can come pick them up and there's no charges if they do community service

391
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Like this is a thing

392
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But like in Wildwood which is a much larger like wilder Jersey Shore beach town

393
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
They declared a state of emergency

394
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There were so many groups of roaming teens

395
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Shit's going down right now in both of these places

396
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like it seems like the Ocean City thing is more mild although a stabbing

397
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But then yeah the headlines are dramatic

398
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
There's a headline from the inquirer.com

399
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Jersey Shore official says unruly teens won't be allowed to steal summer

400
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
There's a concern, I mean there's a tension as we record this

401
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I didn't realize what a hot button issue we were talking about

402
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
We're at the top of summer here and there's the potential that summer could be stolen

403
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Wow

404
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We gotta stop these teens

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I remember when I was in high school

406
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This was a headline then

407
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Like the teens are taking over all the pavilions

408
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Those old people need those benches by the boardwalk

409
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You know the benches on the boardwalk that they can sit and stare at the ocean

410
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Like it's full of goths

411
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's full of goths

412
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There's makeup and hair dye rubbing on those benches

413
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So what do they do now?

414
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's like all the beaches are closed at 8pm

415
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But it's like well now the roving bands of teens are on the boardwalk

416
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Just let them go wild

417
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
This is a dirty dancing scenario

418
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I was going to say it's like oh yeah

419
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
There's some reverend behind this

420
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's like oh I don't know these teens whose childhood happened during covid

421
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The socialization might be a little off kilter

422
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I mean if anybody would just go out there with a boombox and start playing the Footloose song

423
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
They'd just start dancing and that would be the end of it

424
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
They wouldn't get violent

425
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's what I was thinking of with reverend

426
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It is, reverend's the Footloose, that's right

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That's what they need

428
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's a town that banned dancing

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yes

430
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They banned dancing in Footloose

431
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I think that's right

432
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Dirty dancing must be about a town that bans dirty dancing

433
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No they're like at a camp or something

434
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
There's just this dirty dancing occurring between people

435
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's just a bit of a conservative vibe

436
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So dirty dancing incidentally was made at my

437
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It was shot at two different hotels in Virginia

438
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And one of them was a hotel that my Aunt Sharon and Uncle Mac used to be the managers of

439
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Wow

440
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Whoa really

441
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It was at the time so I was going there as a kid to Mountain Lake Virginia

442
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
To this hotel even before dirty dancing

443
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Like as a little kid even before

444
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So when dirty dancing came out I was like oh my gosh look at that

445
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Wow that's surreal probably

446
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It was very surreal and it was like just

447
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's still one of my favorite movies

448
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I can't really separate the two

449
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It is objectively a great movie

450
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But it's one of your favorite home movies

451
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah it kind of brought Hollywood home to me

452
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Because I recognized it and it was just the best

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's pretty exciting

454
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Not even just some movie

455
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Because sometimes it will be like some movie

456
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I mean like lots of stuff filmed around me I guess in the valley

457
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But you know just like Monday

458
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's just like a living back lot

459
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm like oh you know hey Blast from the Past filmed one scene down the street from you

460
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Brendan Fraser

461
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
What is that?

462
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Not a time case in like a bombshell

463
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But dirty dancing a pretty like timeless

464
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Where the setting brings a lot to it

465
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So like and people must travel there to go to those places

466
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Somebody Jason and I know grew up on the pond from on Golden Pond

467
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Really? I forgot that one

468
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
My big one

469
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And it was very surreal because when it came out I had not traveled back home

470
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
In a little while due to the pandemic

471
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But Mare of Easttown is filmed like where I grew up

472
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Like she got in the first or second episode

473
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
She goes to an aquarium supply store and I looked up where that was

474
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I was like oh just a quarter mile from the middle school I went to

475
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Like just down the street

476
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Where you manage the football team

477
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The fact I remain obsessed with

478
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You manage a football team in seventh grade

479
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I haven't watched there is there was a movie starring Kristen Wiig

480
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
An indie movie that shot in Ocean City

481
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But I haven't watched that one yet

482
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Were they worried about all the Hollywood roughnecks coming in

483
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Bringing their their left coast ideals

484
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Well no I think they were very excited

485
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Because I believe it probably shot in the off season

486
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And I'm sure they were happy for the money

487
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
That anything is happening there

488
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Is this a place that is dead when it is not summer

489
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh yeah it like contracts

490
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's like a college town where like

491
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh during the school year in this case the summer season

492
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's like oh there's like 100,000 people

493
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And then the off season it shrinks to like 20,000 people

494
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Okay okay

495
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I have another logistics question

496
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Is any of because I'm keeping

497
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I've had a hard time keeping all these straight

498
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
All the Jersey amusement places

499
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
There's Ocean City

500
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And then there's these two parks that we'll talk about that are here

501
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Then Wildwood and Maury's Pier

502
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's way south of everything we're talking about

503
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Correct

504
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I believe Wildwood is south

505
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I forget what's north and what's south

506
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
But it's a separate district

507
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Atlantic City is a whole other thing

508
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That's like a little bit up north

509
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Is any of this the Jersey Shore

510
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Or is what you call the Jersey

511
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
This is all considered the Jersey Shore

512
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah okay okay

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
But there is North Jersey Shore

514
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Which that's where you get to like

515
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Asbury Park as we talked about

516
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I believe Long Beach Island

517
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Aledo country is

518
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Oh

519
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
That's I think North Jersey where they're flying weird flags

520
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Okay

521
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I've never been anywhere here

522
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I've never been to any of the Jersey Shore

523
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No I haven't done any of this

524
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You've never gone down to the shore

525
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Is that what they say

526
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah you go down

527
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Go down to the shore

528
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Some people

529
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Go down shore

530
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah

531
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Go down shore

532
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah that's the thing

533
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
They just

534
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That's the like

535
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Show me way of

536
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Go down shore

537
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh we're going down the shore this weekend

538
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Hope them rain

539
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Hope them rain don't

540
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Ain't bad

541
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Wow

542
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
When it's

543
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
That's great to hear

544
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
When it's the off season

545
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Are they still making as much taffy

546
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
As they do during the peak

547
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Shriver's is one of the boardwalk businesses

548
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That are open like all year round

549
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And I don't think they're making as much

550
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But they certainly are

551
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But are they shipping out

552
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Or are they making taffy just for the boardwalk

553
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Sorry to go back to taffy

554
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
No they have a big shipping business

555
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yeah they have a big online business

556
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay so they're working in there

557
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But they're shipping a lot of that out

558
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
That's not just being made for the patrons

559
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Of the boardwalk

560
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Okay

561
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah no they have a big shipping business

562
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Some listeners on our discord

563
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The discord that fans made for the show

564
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
They sent me a Shriver's gift basket

565
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Really

566
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
A while back

567
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah

568
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Wait a minute did the gift basket include

569
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Because I'm going into Shriver's

570
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And I'm looking up Mr. Taffy

571
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
He brought that toy

572
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And in the Google images

573
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm like wait a minute

574
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
There's a book called The Birth of Mr. Taffy

575
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
First of all you ever seen Mr. Taffy Alan

576
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I recognize Mr. Taffy

577
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You've seen him around

578
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I've seen him around

579
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I didn't know about this book

580
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You've seen him stroll in the store

581
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh god was there a book

582
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
There might have been a book

583
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm upset I can't like find even a preview page

584
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Because I want to know his story very much

585
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I mean Jane and I both

586
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You know we have insane sweet tooths

587
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So we like just like rabbit

588
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You might have eaten the book

589
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Animals we tore through

590
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We might have eaten it

591
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah it's very possible

592
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Insane sweet tooth tore through

593
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I like the word choices

594
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I really appreciate it there

595
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I think there is Taffy in the freezer

596
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Because you can freeze Taffy

597
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You know if you have Taffy in that freezer

598
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I know I know I still have Taffy in the house

599
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm not sure if it's in the cabinet

600
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I don't know

601
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I know I still have Taffy in the house

602
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm not sure if it's in the cabinet or freezer

603
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You just don't know where it's located

604
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah I don't know where it's located

605
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Or if you're like hiding it in the toilet

606
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You know the compartment over the toilet

607
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
In case any burglars break in

608
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And then they wouldn't think to look there

609
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And steal your Taffy

610
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Well and it's too Taffy too

611
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So like it doesn't really go

612
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Because Shriver's has info like brochures

613
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And they're like if it gets hard

614
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You just rub it between your hands

615
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You warm it up a little and it softens it

616
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So Taffy stays good forever

617
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
As long as you roll it and rub it

618
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It stays good for a really long time

619
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You have to rub it twice a year

620
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You rub it every other six months

621
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You roll it every other six months

622
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You warm up your Taffy when you change

623
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Your smoke detector battery

624
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
If you hear the chirp of the detector

625
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's time to roll the Taffy

626
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Also functions as the Taffy detector

627
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Okay rub rub rub rub rub

628
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And we're set

629
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Alright I'll see you in a couple years buddy

630
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Keep aging

631
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Am I crazy to sit like

632
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Maybe not really growing up with a lot of Taffy

633
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Taffy's the thing I will

634
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm fine to have one thing of Taffy

635
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Every three years

636
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
By that I mean one piece of it

637
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
One inch long piece of it

638
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Is that insane?

639
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Am I missing out on great Taffy possibilities in my life?

640
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I like sweets

641
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm not buying a lot of Taffy

642
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
If somebody offered me Taffy sure

643
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But it's not my go to

644
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And also my teeth

645
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It's not good for your teeth

646
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's not good for your teeth

647
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
No this is a jersey

648
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'll take it out of your mouth right now

649
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
For audio fidelity

650
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You probably should have stopped chewing it

651
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm experiencing tremendous pain in my mouth right now

652
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You have Taffy in like a dip

653
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I feel every tooth

654
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Like it's like chewing tobacco

655
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You just have a Taffy in your lip

656
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
All at all times

657
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Alan has been dipping Taffy

658
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Since he walked in

659
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
This is a Jersey Shore thing

660
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Jane I'm wearing an Ocean City t-shirt right now

661
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Nice

662
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I should have worn my hoodie

663
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I have a little hoodie

664
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And I think that's how we first

665
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I was wearing an Ocean City hoodie at a party or something

666
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You came up to me

667
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Talking about Ocean City

668
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I was so surprised

669
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Because I'm like Alan's from Alabama

670
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
How does he know all this Ocean City stuff?

671
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah no I'm very fortunate to have the Ocean City connection

672
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Through Stacey's family

673
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I like this new nostalgia too

674
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I like that you can have an equivalent of childhood nostalgia

675
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Or something you're discovering in your 20s 30s

676
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'm sort of coasting off their nostalgia

677
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And now I have a bit of nostalgia of my own

678
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And then also having a kid that's gotten to go there

679
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Every couple years

680
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That's nice

681
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Seeing it

682
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Because a lot of it you're viewing through

683
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And me if you're a parent there wandering around

684
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
There's plenty to enjoy if you're not a parent

685
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Once you start seeing the kids run around

686
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And their reaction to stuff

687
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That's super fun too

688
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So what's he into? What are the go-tos kid-wise?

689
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Well he loves the two big amusement parks

690
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I don't know if they're exactly on either end

691
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh yeah they're a few blocks apart

692
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
They're like maybe a 10 or 15 minute walk apart

693
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And we can get into them

694
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Just to say what Gillian's Wonderland Pier and Playland

695
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What is that clunky name?

696
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Playland's Castaway Cove

697
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Playland's Castaway Cove

698
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's the newer name

699
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
We always just call them Playland

700
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And Wonderland Pier we should

701
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It is not a pier

702
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It runs parallel at the boardwalk

703
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And the ocean

704
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That confused me getting into all this too

705
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I don't see no pier

706
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
There's no pier here

707
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Well it is a pier that juts out into the sea

708
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Morris Pier is a pier

709
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And if you were in a car

710
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I think it was Seaside Heights

711
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Another town

712
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
During Hurricane Sandy

713
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I believe a rollercoaster fell into the

714
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Like the pier broke up

715
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And a rollercoaster fell into the ocean

716
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So that was at Ocean City?

717
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
No that was at Seaside Heights

718
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh okay Seaside City

719
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So those and we'll get into those a little bit

720
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Okay so those are kid hits for sure

721
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Oh yeah so those are like the big things

722
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I mean it's like you said in the beginning

723
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Like the whole boardwalk to me feels like

724
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You're not just going to one place

725
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's all kind of a continuum

726
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's all like you're popping around

727
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Like we're gonna go to Playland

728
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And we're gonna go to this arcade

729
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Or we're gonna go get a calzone

730
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Over at this place or whatever

731
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's all kind of like

732
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It gets mixed up like when you're in

733
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Just specific spots like it's never gonna be

734
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Just that one thing that you do

735
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Because you're out there

736
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And you're gonna pop around a little bit

737
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But yeah

738
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Mini golfs to look like

739
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
A lot of mini golfs

740
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You go to the music pier to use the bathroom

741
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Has historically been the most reliable bathrooms

742
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Oh yeah that's a good tip

743
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That's a great spot I like that

744
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That's a neat interesting architectural

745
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Like little location that music

746
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah that just does jut out into the ocean

747
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And it's like a big event space

748
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
For a long time

749
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Beach Boys have played there

750
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
They're playing this summer

751
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
If you can believe it

752
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah the Beach Boys are getting out there this summer

753
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And they're taking their friend John Stamos with them

754
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Can you believe it?

755
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
They're becoming a regular

756
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Presence at the music pier

757
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Bacon Brothers

758
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I bet it's been 50 years

759
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Some of this stuff goes back 50 years

760
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Jane saw Gradley's shirt for me this morning

761
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And she's like

762
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Oh it's coming up at 150 years old

763
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And I was like

764
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Oh what did they do for the 100th

765
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And I was like oh I wasn't alive

766
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Okay not that much of an old man

767
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I was not alive for the 100th

768
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Beach Boys soon enough to

769
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
150 years of surfing

770
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
These boys are 150 years

771
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And OC Con there or something too I think

772
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
They just did a comic convention

773
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Okay and I remember last time I was there

774
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I saw a picture of

775
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Giancarlo Esposito

776
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Was gonna be

777
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Oh cool

778
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
This is not

779
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Not too shabby

780
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
The stars come to shine

781
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Mike Love

782
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I went to the schedule

783
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Mike Love coming

784
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Kenny G coming

785
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Starring Peter Noon

786
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Peter Noon

787
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That's how it's built now

788
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
He made it up to starring

789
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Like the Jimmy Fallon tonight show credit

790
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yes

791
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So all the up-cotties

792
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
To the beat grades

793
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Another Ocean City connect

794
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I just started writing down

795
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I was like oh I don't have to

796
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Research a lot cause I just started writing down

797
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
No

798
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Alan do you know the term shoebees

799
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Oh wow

800
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
This is probably like a 100 year old

801
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Thing

802
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Shoebees were the name

803
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
For day trippers who would come down to the beach

804
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Cause there used to be a train

805
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
From Philadelphia

806
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
There used to be like a train or a trolley

807
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Sort of thing

808
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And people would pack their lunches

809
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
In a cardboard shoebox

810
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So you knew they were shoe

811
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh my god

812
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
How have you not revealed this to us before

813
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Shoebees cause they had the cardboard lunchboxes

814
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So they got the name

815
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The day trippers got the name

816
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Shoebees

817
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So a shoebee is

818
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Just somebody who brings their lunch in a shoebox

819
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That's coming to the pier for a day

820
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That's the origin of it

821
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Coming down to the beach

822
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But now it's kind of like

823
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I feel like the locals call the people

824
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Who come

825
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Is it all derisive

826
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Is this a slur

827
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Should we be bleeping this term

828
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Shoebee

829
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's like sis on twitter

830
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You're on X the everything app

831
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You can't say it anymore

832
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Can't even say shoebee anymore

833
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Shane Gillis said shoebee

834
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
On the monologue of SNL

835
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Comedy is back

836
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I do stand up sets

837
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And I say shoebee and the whole audience is silent

838
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I don't know what's going on

839
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It never gets a laugh PC

840
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I think it's like

841
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
People don't know

842
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
They don't know to go to

843
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Mancos for the best pizza

844
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Or they don't know

845
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That you need beach tags to get on the beach

846
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So these are kind of like rouges

847
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
These are naive people that come down

848
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
For one day they don't know this fucking place

849
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
They're eating the wrong shit

850
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
They're fucking lunch in a shoebox

851
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Get out of here

852
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We're the people who live here

853
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
We know what the real stuff is

854
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You've been enough

855
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You know about the beach tag

856
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Now I've learned about the beach tag

857
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Is Alan a shoebee though?

858
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Not anymore

859
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
At one time I hate to say it

860
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I really am flattered with that compliment

861
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
At one point you had to have been a shoebee

862
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Oh of course

863
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You gotta be a shoebee to not be a shoebee

864
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You were getting mocked behind your back

865
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
By these locals

866
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I don't know

867
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
If I'll get to an honorary

868
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Not local stats

869
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I don't want to presume anything

870
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But I do feel more comfortable there

871
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I am aware of the beach tags

872
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Although I often forget them

873
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But that's a thing

874
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The moment you get there

875
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The relatives are passing the beach tags

876
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Around

877
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You're sticking it

878
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
To a towel or your backpack

879
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So beach tags

880
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
These are little

881
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't even know what you call

882
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
They're almost like bottle cap

883
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Size or something

884
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah bottle cap size is a good way to put it

885
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But it's really sturdy

886
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Paper

887
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Kind of vinyl-y

888
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's like a pin

889
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You pay to access the beach

890
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And this is kind of split

891
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The beaches are free in Wildwood

892
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Because it's half a mile

893
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
To the water

894
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But the beaches are a lot smaller

895
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
In Ocean City

896
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So to pay for upkeep

897
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And like

898
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Just maintaining

899
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The beaches

900
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
A number of towns

901
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Cape May comes to mind

902
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Ocean City

903
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You had to buy a beach tag

904
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You could buy them for a day

905
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Or for a week

906
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Or for the season

907
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And you just got to show it

908
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
There's usually a bored teenager

909
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And you just show it

910
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And then sometimes there's beach tag

911
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
People walking around the beach

912
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Like hey can I see your beach tags

913
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And if like

914
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You walked

915
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
If you just walked on and sat down

916
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And you didn't know about them

917
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
They'll sell you a beach tag

918
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Maybe that's why that kid got

919
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Stabbed or whatever

920
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Because they didn't have a beach tag

921
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
In which case

922
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
What else are you going to do

923
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah a little bit

924
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Isn't there a Cape May cafe

925
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It just happened this week

926
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Sorry

927
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Sorry to make a joke about this

928
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I hope you've recovered from the stabbing

929
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Isn't there a Cape May cafe

930
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
At the beach club

931
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah there is the Cape May cafe

932
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And the beach club is above fame

933
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Disney World Hotel

934
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So is that why you like the beach club so much

935
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Because it kind of reminds you

936
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
We just like the seafood buffet

937
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Like fish family

938
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You were a big fish family

939
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And that's more what it was

940
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
My parents liked the shrimp and crab legs

941
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And that sort of thing

942
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And you're watching big fish

943
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah I'm always

944
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Constantly watching big fish

945
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I remember that I saw

946
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Big fish the day it came out

947
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And we did a

948
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Double feature where we saw

949
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Big fish and 21 grams

950
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Wow

951
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
We didn't

952
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
We were just excited for Oscar

953
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
We love movie nerds in high school

954
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And thankfully we saw 21 grams

955
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
First so big fish

956
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Really helped cut the

957
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Edge, take the edge off

958
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Wow

959
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
If you'd done 21 grams and then seen

960
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Big fish

961
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
No that's why I'm saying

962
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
We did 21 grams

963
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
If you literally did 21 grams

964
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
To pre-game for big fish

965
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
21 grams of taffy

966
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Not enough

967
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I got a high taffy tolerance

968
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm gonna have two

969
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Souls in my body

970
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And one's gonna be made of taffy

971
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
There's also, there's a whole other term

972
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Benny too, you got shooby and then you got

973
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Benny

974
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
There's an Alice Obscura article that says

975
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Are you a shooby or a Benny

976
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm having trouble figuring out Benny, Benny's just like

977
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Fucking people called me Benjamin

978
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Come down here

979
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Is that what it is? I think so

980
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I'm not reading this terribly carefully

981
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But yeah, I think

982
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Or it's people who come to the shore to soak up

983
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Beneficial rays

984
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Thus Benny's

985
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
That seems like a stretch, people who want

986
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Beneficial things for their body

987
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I only want the vitamin D

988
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'm a Benny

989
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
This is strange

990
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It depends on where you are

991
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Apparently in Michigan you call them fudgies

992
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
People come in

993
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Just all they want is the fudge

994
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And then they want to leave

995
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
This is like Howley's in Hawaii or something like that

996
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
What is that one?

997
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Howley's is

998
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Like you're not

999
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Native to Hawaii

1000
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Or you're

1001
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Native blood

1002
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Like indigenous to Hawaii

1003
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Anybody out of that

1004
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Guys like me would be a Howley

1005
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Anyone yes

1006
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
By virtue of how anyone visits Hawaii

1007
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
We're all Howleys

1008
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Apparently there's a version

1009
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
In Jaws

1010
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
They make one up for that Jaws

1011
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
What's the Jaws town?

1012
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Amity

1013
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Summer dinks they say

1014
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
People who pop

1015
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Into Amity and don't even care about the rich

1016
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Amity culture

1017
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Summer dinks

1018
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
There's a connection between Ocean City

1019
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And Southern California

1020
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
In that

1021
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Pasadena and Ocean City both have

1022
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Duda parades

1023
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Oh I remember the Duda parade

1024
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Right

1025
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It's like a silly parade

1026
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
This is an off season thing in Ocean City

1027
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
They used to have like

1028
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
A famous

1029
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
They would have a famous grand marshal

1030
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Every year like I think Mickey Rooney

1031
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Was at least one Duda parade

1032
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Great grand marshal in Ocean City

1033
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But this year

1034
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It was a guy who I think used to play

1035
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
For the Flyers

1036
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So a little less exciting

1037
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I mean probably exciting

1038
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I think it was mostly partially

1039
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Rained out the Duda parade

1040
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Are they considered sister cities Pasadena and Ocean City?

1041
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I don't think so

1042
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Can we get you to be

1043
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The grand marshal of one of these Duda parades

1044
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I would die if I was the grand marshal

1045
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Of the Ocean City Duda parade

1046
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
This has got to be possible

1047
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's kind of the star caliber

1048
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And get ready because I'm going to say

1049
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Some of the names that we all love to hear

1050
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Please I love to hear the names

1051
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Mickey Rooney is in there

1052
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Soupy Sails is in there

1053
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
This is the Pasadena one?

1054
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
This is Ocean City

1055
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Larry Storch who we just talked about

1056
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Just passed away from F Troop

1057
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Of course

1058
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Show from 70 years ago

1059
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I don't know

1060
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Jason for

1061
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Theme park podcast fame

1062
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
He's no Larry Storch

1063
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
These are all people that died 30 years ago

1064
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Well not Larry, he died a couple years ago

1065
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Jason doesn't have a leg up on them

1066
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And that he didn't die 30 years ago

1067
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Being alive, that's

1068
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Number one on the resume

1069
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I've got that going

1070
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But I did not play for a tri-state area

1071
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Sports team

1072
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But you managed your high school's football team

1073
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And I don't think the season went that well

1074
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's my memory

1075
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
How much is that

1076
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Your fault though

1077
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Well

1078
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I told them I was

1079
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Alan, what you would know

1080
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
What do you call the little orange thing

1081
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
You put the football on to kick it

1082
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Oh gosh

1083
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Well I wasn't the kicker

1084
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But I should know this

1085
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's not a tee, but maybe it's something like a tee

1086
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Something like that, we did this the other day

1087
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
We could have figured it out

1088
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It might just be a stand

1089
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
But if anybody should have known this

1090
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I hate to say it

1091
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
They were like, okay you run out

1092
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And put the stand out there

1093
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And I would always just not be paying attention

1094
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Because football is kind of boring

1095
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And I don't really know

1096
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
How it's played very well

1097
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Were you too slow putting the stand out

1098
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So like

1099
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's a similar thing to Alan

1100
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You guys are kind of equivalent here

1101
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I was a bit of a molasses boy

1102
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah

1103
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Both Ocean City beat two molasses boys

1104
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Together

1105
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
If you'd been in the same game

1106
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Alright, now

1107
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Manager, go set up

1108
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
The first name what the thing is

1109
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And then go put it out

1110
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'll just grab it, I'll name it later

1111
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Then slow run out

1112
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
To the middle of it, okay last boy

1113
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Get in there, take the kick

1114
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Slow walk out to the

1115
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
We would have lined it up perfectly

1116
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah, wow

1117
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
There's still time

1118
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You're gonna get you guys on the field together

1119
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
We gotta go back

1120
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
The slowest game

1121
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Ever played

1122
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Alan, let me ask

1123
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Because you know

1124
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
We mentioned the amusement parks

1125
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
My

1126
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I feel like Ocean City

1127
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And maybe

1128
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Stacy's family does this too

1129
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Where it's like, oh we go here

1130
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
We don't go there, we go to Mancos for pizza

1131
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
We don't go to Preps

1132
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Or it's like, oh no, Preps is better

1133
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You gotta go there

1134
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Does your son have a preference between

1135
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Playland and Wonderland?

1136
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
That's a great question

1137
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And I do believe that Stacy's family

1138
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Is more of a Manco family

1139
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Mancos always comes up

1140
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I would say

1141
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
That right now

1142
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And this could just be an age

1143
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Thing that he's more of a

1144
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
A

1145
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Sometimes I mix them up, Gillians

1146
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Like the one that looks like

1147
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
The castle with the red top, Gillians

1148
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Because that, I feel like

1149
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The majority of the rides there are more

1150
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Geared towards smaller kids

1151
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
That's the place that he's

1152
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
More inclined to go

1153
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And then when we go to the bigger one

1154
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Which is

1155
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Playland

1156
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
That's got

1157
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That's got a little bit more faster rides

1158
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And stuff like that there I think

1159
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
This is so

1160
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Funny you say that

1161
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Because when I was growing up

1162
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Playland was the one for little kids

1163
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And Wonderland was the one for big kids

1164
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And now it's swapped

1165
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And I'm like, oh yeah, Playland does have

1166
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
A lot of big rides now

1167
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And they've built

1168
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It's a little crazy walking around there

1169
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Because they've built a lot of things

1170
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
On top of other things

1171
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
You know, there's a lot of rides

1172
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Packed into a smaller area

1173
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Yeah, there's coasters going

1174
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
From different rides that are just right

1175
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Next to each other

1176
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Flying by

1177
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And right next to hotels

1178
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Which it's probably like

1179
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Right across the alley

1180
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Rattling windows

1181
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
For sure

1182
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So they've like, are you saying they've kind of like

1183
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Jammed in coasters

1184
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
That there was kind of a modest

1185
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Layout of little kid rides

1186
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But then they've had to like court the adult

1187
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Market so they just kind of like, alright

1188
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
What every inch of free space

1189
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Free space gets a coaster now

1190
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And Wonderland is still pretty

1191
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Spread out, a lot of kid rides

1192
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Definitely a lot of kid rides

1193
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah, monorail

1194
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
A small, little

1195
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's a train

1196
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It's like a ripoff Thomas

1197
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's kind of a ripoff Thomas

1198
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
It's always been a ripoff Thomas

1199
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Like what, 20 feet in the air?

1200
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It goes above the park

1201
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Which is very cool

1202
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Why would Thomas do that? That's strange

1203
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Don't worry about it

1204
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
My son is all about the logic

1205
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Of Thomas, the most logical train player

1206
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I've ever seen, he'd be so bothered that he was

1207
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Up in the air

1208
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
The ripoff aspect is

1209
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Kind of the non, I mean there's almost

1210
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
There's no

1211
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Real IP there as far as I

1212
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Can tell

1213
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Like it's all

1214
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Sort of faint

1215
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Representations

1216
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Of things that you kind of know or have

1217
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Heard of, you know, like there's something

1218
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
That's like a, just a structure

1219
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
That they can run across with a bridge called Raider's Ark

1220
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Raider's Ark

1221
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I love Raider

1222
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I love that

1223
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
As a kid

1224
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
It's not specifically, there's no Indiana Jones

1225
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Stuff necessarily

1226
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Raiders of the Lost Ark, but like you're

1227
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
The ride that you're on

1228
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
The Ark of a Raider

1229
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Why does a Raider have an Ark?

1230
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It's like a fun hack

1231
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
There's rope bridges and tunnels

1232
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And that

1233
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
The logic

1234
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
The logic is airbrushing

1235
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
A lot of the giant airbrush mural

1236
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
There's like a worm one, I forget what it's called

1237
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
But it looks like the worm from like

1238
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Alice in Wonderland or something

1239
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But it's not

1240
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
The caterpillar you mean? Sorry, the caterpillar, not a worm

1241
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It could be a worm that looks like a caterpillar

1242
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
In their world it's a worm

1243
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
But he has like a joint instead of a hookah

1244
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But like

1245
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
My favorite ride is there's like a haunted

1246
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
A haunted ride

1247
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah, that's new in the last few years

1248
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I watched a ride through that a while ago

1249
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And it's pretty good

1250
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It's very effective, it's very good

1251
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And Sunny is still haunted by it

1252
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Two years later

1253
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
When he rode it when he was five

1254
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And because

1255
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
We're going to go

1256
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I don't want to time stamp this episode

1257
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
But we will be going this summer

1258
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Back to Ocean City

1259
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And so I was asking him

1260
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
What do you think about that haunted dark ride?

1261
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Do you want to get back on there?

1262
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I don't know dad, I don't know

1263
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Really, wow

1264
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Stuck with them

1265
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
One of his little cousins in front

1266
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And the seats on that are reminiscent

1267
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Of the haunted mansion

1268
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Kind of high back chairs

1269
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah

1270
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
This is a fine Jersey Shore tradition

1271
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Of intellectual property theft

1272
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
But like

1273
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Don't worry about it, who's going to say it?

1274
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
There is

1275
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
In the last few years there is

1276
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
A candy shop

1277
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Called Candy Land

1278
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That just uses giant like

1279
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
The board game font

1280
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It just uses Disney

1281
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
It uses the Disney like hand written font

1282
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And then it just has like

1283
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
A giant photo

1284
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You know

1285
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Printouts of the castles

1286
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And stuff in the store

1287
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Wow, how close can we get?

1288
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
That's crazy

1289
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
This ride is just called a haunted house

1290
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Dark ride, I think

1291
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
They don't really, they don't put too much on

1292
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
That pretty much gets the whole message across, it's dark

1293
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
It's scary

1294
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Kids are likely scared by the horrible metal

1295
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Noises that affordable

1296
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Basic animatronics

1297
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Make

1298
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yes, they're natural creaking and screeching

1299
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Yes, in addition to like

1300
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The copyright free

1301
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Haunted house music and screams

1302
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And stuff

1303
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
But there's skeletons, there's clowns

1304
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
That glows in the dark

1305
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I believe there's maybe even a couple of times you get

1306
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Wind blown at you

1307
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
So

1308
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
There's a lot of screaming from what I saw

1309
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Just like loud scream

1310
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
In which case

1311
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Your role of course is going to be

1312
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That's just upsetting

1313
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Yeah, yeah

1314
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Has he been on like

1315
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Haunted Mansion and like a Disneyland and stuff too?

1316
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
No, I

1317
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I hate to tell y'all

1318
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Really, this might

1319
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Turn the tables on me

1320
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
We have not been to Disney World

1321
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Disneyland

1322
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
This is like his exposure to

1323
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Amusement parks is

1324
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Something along the lines of this

1325
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
State fair kind of quality of stuff

1326
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
But at that age also

1327
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's you know

1328
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So I think he's really going to appreciate it

1329
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I'm sort of like

1330
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I justify going like I really want him to remember it

1331
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
When we go, you know like

1332
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Oh sure, yeah yeah

1333
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I feel the same way about on my

1334
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Hardcore fandom

1335
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Scale, I say the same thing about

1336
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Going to Tokyo Disneyland

1337
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
But like we were

1338
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
You know like I've been talking about maybe

1339
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Like Universal with him this summer

1340
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And he

1341
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We were listening in the car

1342
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Not too long ago to y'all's

1343
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You know Universal

1344
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
To the Mario Land

1345
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh yeah

1346
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I'm sorry if we cursed

1347
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Oh yeah, no I did have to like kind of

1348
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Car

1349
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And I'm sorry if I said something

1350
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
That I was attracted to Chase Meridian

1351
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
From Batman Forever or something

1352
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You had to explain that

1353
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
For like 15 minutes, very graphic

1354
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I mean, he really loved it

1355
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
He really liked it, he really liked hearing y'all

1356
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Recap it and talk about it

1357
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
We just heard the show

1358
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And enjoyed it, what?

1359
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
He enjoyed the show

1360
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It's fun, he's kind of

1361
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Into podcasts

1362
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I do have to be careful

1363
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And you guys don't have to edit yourselves or do anything

1364
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Obviously it's for whoever

1365
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
This is a very explicit

1366
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Show

1367
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Very, very explicit

1368
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's how we're labeled on

1369
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Apple Podcasts

1370
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Most shows have the

1371
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
E next to it, we have the

1372
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
VE

1373
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It's bad parenting on my part

1374
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
To do that, but

1375
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
The topic was so juicy

1376
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
For us that, you know, we're excited to get

1377
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Into these things now that he's like really

1378
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Kind of in his zone of, to appreciate it

1379
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Did he like, did he ask

1380
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
How old we were and say like

1381
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
These guys are like closer to my age, right?

1382
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
They're your age

1383
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
They sound so young, like if they're not kids

1384
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Then they are just barely not

1385
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Kids, right?

1386
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
This is like, I mean, it's often

1387
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Like

1388
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Me going something like, these are

1389
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Some of dad's friends

1390
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Or you've met this one guy

1391
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Before, you know, such and such

1392
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
As birthday

1393
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So he vaguely

1394
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I don't know what that's like to have some sort of a

1395
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Tangential connection to the

1396
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Media you're listening to or watching

1397
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
You know, as a kid, but other than

1398
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Dirty dancing

1399
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Anyway, that's generally how I

1400
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Kind of describe stuff

1401
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
One of daddy's friend's shows

1402
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Is not

1403
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Appropriate because there's a lot of talk about

1404
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Sucking your own dick

1405
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You can't play all

1406
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Of them

1407
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yeah, no

1408
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
That's just for daddy

1409
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Some of daddy's friends just do it for daddy

1410
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Uncle Nick has a little mouth

1411
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
He says some naughty words

1412
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
In the topic of

1413
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
In the area of kind of like

1414
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Rip-offs

1415
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
To me, the juiciest thing

1416
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Not knowing anything about this park

1417
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Was discovering something

1418
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
In Gillian's

1419
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Wonderland Pier

1420
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And that is that there is a little area

1421
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Where you can put in a dollar

1422
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And you can activate

1423
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
An animatronic band

1424
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That is clearly

1425
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
A re-skinned Chuck E. Cheese

1426
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Robot band

1427
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And you guys are both familiar with it

1428
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Did you run into this too, Mike?

1429
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I saw a picture, yeah

1430
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Awesome, so cool

1431
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I judge a lot of these places on

1432
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I don't expect a place like this

1433
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
To have animatronics

1434
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But it's certainly a bonus

1435
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It's cool, it's like

1436
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Now we're talking

1437
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So yeah, you can

1438
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Activate

1439
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
You guys have seen them

1440
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But here they are, they're on kind of like a little

1441
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Western porch and they are called

1442
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Rocky and the Railroad Ramblers

1443
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So good

1444
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Right up, you have to go up

1445
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
A level to board

1446
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
The railroad that goes around the park

1447
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Oh, so the monorail

1448
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Passes

1449
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Yes, the Thomas monorail passes

1450
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Behind them while they do their show

1451
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And it

1452
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Is just so evident

1453
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
If you're into these characters

1454
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
As we are, it's so

1455
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Obvious that they just

1456
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
It's like the same facial shapes

1457
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
As the Chuck E. Cheese and they just put

1458
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
New felt on them or whatever

1459
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
The gestures are the same

1460
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
They took Chuck E.'s skin off

1461
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And they put new skin on

1462
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
There's going to be a lot more of that I feel like

1463
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Because Chuck E. Cheese

1464
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Has got to get rid of a lot of their

1465
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Animatronics

1466
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
They haven't smashed them off

1467
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
They have to kill them

1468
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
They're like alive enough

1469
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
You have to separate the head from

1470
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
The spine

1471
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And it has to be like

1472
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Like Wolverine, you're killing Wolverine

1473
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You have to kill Wolverine in the comics

1474
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
You have to separate his head off his body

1475
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
But then you have to separate his body from

1476
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So he doesn't grow back

1477
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Because he's a healing power

1478
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So it's similar to the Chuck E. Cheese robots

1479
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It's the same

1480
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It's the same gestures

1481
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And they are all

1482
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Their limbs are contorted such that

1483
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
They should be holding instruments

1484
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
That they are not

1485
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So they're clearly gesturing as if

1486
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
They're playing the keyboards or a guitar

1487
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It's just that they have severely bent

1488
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
They just look mangled

1489
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yes, yeah, they're playing phantom instruments

1490
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Air guitar, I guess

1491
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Let me quickly go through

1492
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Okay, here's equivalence

1493
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Okay, so again, the band

1494
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It's not Munch's Make-Believe Band

1495
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
It's Rocky and the Railroad Ramblers

1496
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Chuck E. is Rocky the Panda

1497
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Helen Henny is

1498
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Henrietta Hatpin

1499
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Mr. Munch

1500
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
The monster one is Bubba

1501
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Jasper T. Giles the dog

1502
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Is Hank the Dalmatian

1503
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And Pasquale the pizza chef

1504
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Is Antonio

1505
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I didn't stray too far

1506
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
He looks like an old mayor

1507
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I think the mustache

1508
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Is built into the mechanics

1509
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So he has to still have the mustache

1510
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
They just made him old

1511
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
They didn't get too far from the original characters

1512
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
They're just like one little generation removed

1513
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Still a bird and a dog

1514
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Chuck E. maybe changes the most

1515
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Chuck E. might have the face of

1516
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Or one of them has the face of that

1517
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Elvis one

1518
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Oh, the king?

1519
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Yeah, the king

1520
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Do you think there's a way to track

1521
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Where that can't

1522
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I wonder if there was a showbiz pizza

1523
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Or Chuck E. cheese that was

1524
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Closed down

1525
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Why in fact

1526
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
That is exactly what it is

1527
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Actually it was one that I think closed

1528
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And was fully done in the 80s

1529
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It was like an early

1530
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Went under

1531
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Didn't have the Chuck E. Cheese license anymore

1532
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But the restaurant, somebody came in

1533
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Redid, I think I'm getting all this right

1534
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
That it was the Chuck E. Cheese band

1535
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Then it closed

1536
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Then some other enterprising people came in

1537
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And said, well you've got a perfectly good band here

1538
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
We'll build a restaurant around it

1539
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And I think this is all in Scranton

1540
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And there was a place called

1541
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Wow

1542
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Oh man

1543
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
They have been through

1544
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
It started as the Chuck E. Cheese characters

1545
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Now it is Rocky and the Royal Ramblers

1546
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
In the middle it was

1547
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Whatever, Zach Perry Winkle's

1548
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Panda band, I don't know what it is

1549
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I have to do this list again

1550
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Chuck E. Cheese was Zach Perry Winkle

1551
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Helen Henney is Henrietta Hen

1552
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
State Henrietta

1553
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Jasper T. Giles, Dudley Dog

1554
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Pasquale

1555
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Was Pasta Pete

1556
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I really like that one

1557
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And then my absolute favorite

1558
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Mr. Munch the Monster used to be

1559
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Thirsty Jones

1560
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
The best born name

1561
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I've heard in a long time

1562
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Wow

1563
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
That's great

1564
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I wish we could get some old robots

1565
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And just change the characters a little bit

1566
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
That would be so fun

1567
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Oh, invent our own?

1568
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
But not go too far from the originals

1569
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Yeah

1570
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I always thought that would be a great

1571
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Talk show band

1572
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
To have a talk show band

1573
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
That's a really good idea

1574
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Especially as the bands disappear

1575
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
The first thing that talk shows are losing

1576
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Is the band

1577
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So you can't

1578
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
We can't pay humans anymore

1579
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Why not? But then it's boring to just play

1580
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Pre-recorded music

1581
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And then we play into the animatronic

1582
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Oh yeah

1583
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And then now we're cooking

1584
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Just enough to say like

1585
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Haha, yeah, Trump is screwed

1586
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Don't forget to eat your small rock every day

1587
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
What?

1588
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
That was one of the

1589
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
AI Google results when people were trying

1590
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
To get it

1591
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
It said like, someone asked how many rocks

1592
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Should I eat every day

1593
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Google is broken right now

1594
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
So you can find people

1595
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
For certain AI prompts you can ask questions

1596
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Is it okay to eat glass? And it says

1597
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yes, it's okay to eat one liter of glass a day

1598
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
So there's all these errors

1599
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Going on when you search things

1600
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
The funniest was someone

1601
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Asked how do you make pizza

1602
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Or how do you keep cheese from falling off pizza

1603
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And they're like, you know

1604
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It could be too much sauce or not enough cheese

1605
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Try putting some glue in the pizza

1606
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And Katie

1607
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Natopoulos used to be

1608
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
At Buzzfeed, I think it's at Business Insider now

1609
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
A very funny

1610
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Reporter, she made the

1611
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Glue pizza

1612
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
She made Google's glue pizza?

1613
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
She made the glue pizza

1614
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
She got like non-toxic

1615
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Elmer's glue and put it

1616
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Mixed it in the sauce

1617
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And made the pizza

1618
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Did she eat it? She did

1619
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
She's like

1620
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Well it smells a little

1621
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Chemically cooking

1622
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
But she made the glue pizza

1623
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Really taking their word for it with that non-toxic

1624
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Really

1625
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Trust the Elmer's people

1626
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Think about all the people that are doing that

1627
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Not ironically

1628
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Just because they look for

1629
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
They were looking for the recipe

1630
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
That's why

1631
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
My pizza is not tasting right

1632
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
A lack of glue

1633
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I think she actually

1634
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Not Elmer, she used the up and up

1635
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
The Target house brand

1636
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Version of Elmer's non-toxic glue

1637
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Interesting

1638
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Kind of bold

1639
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Kind of bold going with the

1640
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Up and up like the Rouse

1641
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It's like the sauce that you spring for

1642
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Buy the right glue

1643
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
The glue makes the pizza

1644
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I think she went with Francesca

1645
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Rinaldi, which is an East Coast

1646
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Brand

1647
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Alan, you mentioned like there is not a lot

1648
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Of IP here

1649
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
But there is a mascot for Gillian's Wonderland

1650
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
For many years

1651
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Wonder Bear

1652
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
My son

1653
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Wonder Bear

1654
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
A female, either partner

1655
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Or girlfriend or wife

1656
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Or stuff

1657
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I don't want to assume

1658
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
You don't want to label it

1659
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It's Wonder Bear's girlfriend or partner

1660
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's a long term relationship

1661
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Did you find the name of the girl bear?

1662
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Her name is Landy

1663
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Landy, interesting

1664
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
In honor of the man who saved

1665
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Brian Wilson

1666
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Dr. Landy

1667
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But Wonder Bear and Landy

1668
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I was like, alright, when you get to Landy

1669
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That might be a lack of imagination

1670
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's just confusing

1671
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I like it, I guess

1672
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I just don't know where

1673
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Wait, it's from Playland

1674
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
From Wonderland

1675
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Landy

1676
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
But I didn't put that together

1677
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It's so basic

1678
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It's just looking at the other half they had lying around

1679
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yet I still missed it

1680
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Landy

1681
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
She's a girl bear who loves land

1682
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
She's like a land baron

1683
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
She may not like being so close to the sea

1684
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Given that she

1685
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
She's named after a piece of

1686
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Family property or whatever

1687
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Land, oh yeah

1688
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Interesting

1689
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Stacked generations deep

1690
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Yeah, the current generation

1691
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Jay Gillian

1692
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Was a little busy being

1693
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
The mayor

1694
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
The mayor of Ocean City

1695
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Okay

1696
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
A number of Gillians have been mayors

1697
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Oh, really

1698
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Ocean City, there's a history of

1699
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
They control the park and they control the town

1700
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
But Gillians, I feel like

1701
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I feel like my dad the last few years

1702
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Has been like, well

1703
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Gillians might have some

1704
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Back tax it

1705
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
It seems like there was talk of

1706
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Sheriff's auctions

1707
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And it seems like it always

1708
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Gets resolved

1709
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Thank god

1710
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
This looks like Gillian

1711
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
One of the rides you can ride inside

1712
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Gillian's guts

1713
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Are you talking about Wonder Bear?

1714
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Is that Wonder the Bear?

1715
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Is it a different bear than Gillian?

1716
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
No, Gillian is the family

1717
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Gillian's not a bear, Gillian's the family

1718
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I don't know that

1719
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I think that might be from

1720
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
A ride called

1721
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Bear-A-Fair

1722
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I got that in front of me

1723
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Bear-A-Fair

1724
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
So that's Wonder Bear and you can go inside

1725
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Wonder Bear's guts

1726
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Yeah

1727
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
And have a Bear-A-Fair

1728
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
You can get up inside

1729
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Wonder Bear and have a Bear-A-Fair

1730
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I guess it's not that weird

1731
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Sitting inside Dumbo

1732
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Sitting inside Dumbo in Disney

1733
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
It's not that weird that you're inside the character

1734
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
It's almost like

1735
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Close to

1736
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
You're riding on top of them

1737
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
You were in a hollowed out stomach

1738
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And now we've put the cloak of a fair

1739
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Over it as well

1740
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
There's a lot going on in Bear-A-Fair

1741
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Wonder Bear has been killed

1742
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
His guts have been extracted from its body

1743
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
There's a hole in its chest

1744
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And now you're getting to ride in there with your family

1745
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I was going to say

1746
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
This is a Revenant situation

1747
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
This is a Revenant situation

1748
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
They could call it Revenant the Ride

1749
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
This is kind of like a mech suit situation

1750
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
This is kind of like a mech suit situation

1751
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You get in there and he just gets up

1752
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And you're walking around as a big old Wonder Bear

1753
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Don't tell the teen gangs

1754
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
There's mech suits around

1755
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
They can stab a lot more efficiently

1756
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
They can stab a lot more efficiently

1757
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
They can stab a lot more efficiently

1758
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So there is

1759
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So there is

1760
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It's just like a block away from Ocean City High School

1761
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
It's just like a block away from Ocean City High School

1762
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
They're asking for it then

1763
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
They're asking for it then

1764
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
The kids

1765
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It was always wild to me

1766
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
It was always wild to me

1767
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
They go to high school by the boardwalk

1768
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
That's so cool

1769
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
They go to high school by an amusement park

1770
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Beach volleyball

1771
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
That would be cool

1772
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
It's iconic looking when you see it

1773
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It's the first big thing you see

1774
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
in that direction

1775
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Usually our path

1776
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Usually our path

1777
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Maybe something like

1778
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
We've gone to

1779
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
There's a restaurant called Oves

1780
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
My family loves Oves

1781
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Who doesn't love Oves?

1782
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
It's delicious

1783
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Everybody loves Oves

1784
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
That's where the boardwalk is kind of narrowed

1785
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
That's where the boardwalk is kind of narrowed

1786
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And then you walk from there

1787
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
And then it gradually widens out

1788
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,120
widens out and then boom, there's, there's Gillian's right there.

1789
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,840
But, um, one time, last time we were there, Sonny started kind of doing,

1790
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,120
there was like a family dinner there at Oves and there's like a big balcony.

1791
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,040
And, uh, you, so you can see over the boardwalk.

1792
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:59,280
And then my son went out to the boardwalk and started like dancing around on the

1793
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,360
boardwalk for some reason, just being a cute five-year-old dancing around and his

1794
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,600
cousins were up on the balcony, like cheering him on, like, yeah, yeah.

1795
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,720
And then some people walked by and they threw him a dollar.

1796
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,600
Wow.

1797
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:21,480
There are a lot more buskers like the city approved buskers along the

1798
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:27,480
boardwalk playing saxophone or keyboard or there's a lot of full bands on like

1799
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:32,160
family nights along the boardwalk or something like that.

1800
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,200
Watch out for those beach tags and watch out for you.

1801
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,120
Make sure your son is permitted for his own beach tags with his dance.

1802
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,400
Or his own buckets and like shovels for the beach.

1803
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,440
This time put them to work.

1804
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,160
Remember that dance from last time.

1805
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,840
Get down there, pay your way.

1806
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:57,160
Does he like the, cause, uh, Gillian's wonderland known for the massive Ferris

1807
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:00,480
wheel and that's kind of like an icon of ocean city.

1808
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,840
Does he like it?

1809
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:02,400
Oh yeah.

1810
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:03,000
No, he loves it.

1811
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,280
He loves the, the Ferris wheel.

1812
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:04,880
Okay.

1813
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:05,840
Love that Ferris wheel.

1814
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,960
I mean, that's the best way to like get the bird's eye view of the whole, like,

1815
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,040
uh, uh, yeah, I mean, that's, that's how you get the only other tall thing is

1816
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,640
like there's landers or portico hall.

1817
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,040
Yeah.

1818
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:18,480
Yeah.

1819
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,120
There's like a couple of tall rides, you know, but this is the one, the

1820
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:27,440
most kind of serene view and especially at sunset or at night when everything

1821
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,680
lights up, you know, it's really pretty way to see the city and all those

1822
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,080
beautiful old houses that are over there.

1823
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,000
Full of the mean people that are judging you.

1824
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,560
Well, if people that have gotten their liquor from across the bridge and they're

1825
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:48,120
just sitting out on their porches, judging you, what are the night, what are

1826
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,040
you doing when the, what are the evenings?

1827
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,520
When, when the pier is closed, what are you doing?

1828
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,160
You're just like,

1829
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,080
Folks are like riding their bikes up and down, you know, taking walks.

1830
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,400
A lot of walking.

1831
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:05,400
Oh, I feel like, oh, uh, uh, is in the fine tradition of like Jersey shore.

1832
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,200
Like you get a platter.

1833
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:12,920
So you get soup and salad, uh, soup or salad sometimes, and your

1834
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,200
entree occasionally dessert.

1835
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,360
So it's a lot of food and it's all fried food.

1836
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:23,120
It's like, besides the corn on the cob, it's French fries or big potato.

1837
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:31,720
And, uh, fried fish or, uh, broiled fish, which is kind of, uh, flavorless.

1838
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,280
It's the version where it's nothing.

1839
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:34,520
Okay.

1840
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,080
Butter and paprika, but that's like a lot of food.

1841
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,320
So yeah, you walk it off.

1842
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:43,040
You eat a big fish dinner and then you walk the boards to walk it off.

1843
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,560
And Oves is also a bicycle rental place.

1844
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,280
It's bicycle rental and like donuts.

1845
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,120
And I think it even started that way.

1846
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:56,960
Maybe it was like mostly a bicycle rental and like the guy had a grill and

1847
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,320
then it became more of like a restaurant, but it's also a bicycle rental.

1848
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,360
Yeah.

1849
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,280
So he's just like, Oh, I'll take my girl to work today.

1850
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,960
Business started bringing the George Foreman out there.

1851
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,480
That's what it started 20 years ago.

1852
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:19,880
Um, I, I don't know if this is on the Ferris wheel, but you know, like, look,

1853
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,960
you get like the incidents page of these places and I never, you know, I never

1854
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,920
want to go too much into the, you know, deaths or grim things that happened.

1855
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,560
There's no, I don't think there's any deaths here.

1856
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,440
No, there are.

1857
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,520
I, I, oh, no, I, I know the story I'm about to tell.

1858
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,520
Oh, right.

1859
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,560
Constant fires.

1860
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:41,920
If you build very, every, every, the locals know, as long as you're not a

1861
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,240
shoe B, you know, there's a fire every day.

1862
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:51,000
If you have very old buildings with very old electrical setups next to a

1863
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,840
wooden boardwalk, you're going to have some fires, you know,

1864
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,320
whenever these places come up with you, you have a lot of concern.

1865
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,280
It's always, it's going to flood.

1866
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,400
The ride's going to fall into the, you're like, you're, I think you're like

1867
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,800
concerned generally about the seaside amusement park.

1868
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,200
Yeah.

1869
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:12,640
Uh, well the Jersey shore is, uh, subject to hurricanes, uh, some of the year.

1870
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,600
Uh, I've had, I've seen a number of fires.

1871
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,320
There was a fire when I was in elementary school at this place, Fisherman's

1872
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,560
Wharf, which like, was like my favorite shop.

1873
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:28,240
I mean, it was mostly at the time, like seashell knickknacks and Simpson's

1874
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:31,160
toys, cause it was 1992.

1875
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,400
And they weren't, they weren't using reputable factories back then.

1876
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,640
So those, those, uh, those Moe's would light up, uh, second flash

1877
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,040
paper, the worst made Barney's you've ever seen.

1878
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:46,560
There was, there was one, uh, Coors brothers ice cream.

1879
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,360
There's a number of those on the boardwalk.

1880
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,920
I don't know if, uh, the family like Coors frozen custard.

1881
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,520
There's like, yeah, multiple of the ones.

1882
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,520
There's a little one at Gillian's, right?

1883
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:58,920
Yeah.

1884
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,560
Is that the place where, is it Coors where they do like the flattened ice?

1885
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,240
They like flat when they're making the rolled ice cream that was, that

1886
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:13,280
was like a trend that popped up one summer and it was gone as quickly as it arrived.

1887
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,840
I was looking for the rolled ice cream.

1888
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:22,200
We had Coors, which is delicious, but it was kind of a fun novelty.

1889
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,840
Yeah, I hate to say it.

1890
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,440
Say, I don't know the way it sounds to me, this rolled ice cream

1891
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:32,960
sounds like some shooby shit, flashing the pan go in one summer and out the next.

1892
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,320
That's a real Jersey shore that where it's like pops up and either becomes

1893
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,760
ubiquitous, like dip and dots.

1894
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:44,840
I remember when they showed up and then they, you know, big aim everywhere.

1895
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:45,880
They stayed.

1896
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,840
They had what it took tasting terrible.

1897
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,840
They actually got their, the footholds somehow there.

1898
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,520
There was a movie theater there too, that I don't think was

1899
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,280
working last time we were there, but it was broken.

1900
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:03,160
The Moreland Terrace, uh, was bought by a local chain and it's slowly being redone.

1901
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,520
It's supposed to reopen.

1902
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:09,320
And the other movie theater that was down the block in town became the big

1903
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,840
Manco and Manco pizza headquarters.

1904
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:19,360
Oh, it was a shitty family fun center that kept one or two movie screens going.

1905
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,080
And then the pizza, you know, Shane wanted out.

1906
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,320
None of these businesses started.

1907
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,560
They, none of them started as what they became.

1908
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,320
This is a place where you can like, just start some, just get something going.

1909
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,200
And then it turns out, no, I sell t-shirts.

1910
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,840
I, you know, I thought I was selling, uh, beach tags, but now I sell taffy.

1911
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,800
But you can always kind of see the remnants of what, you know,

1912
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,400
what was there.

1913
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,480
Skeletons are in the corner.

1914
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:52,000
From when they thought they were, they were a skeleton manufacturing company.

1915
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:56,520
Like open to a movie theater, but I actually just turned into a place

1916
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,600
that makes kettle corn.

1917
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,280
It's a, it lets you grow.

1918
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,320
It lets you change.

1919
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,800
Let's evolve this place.

1920
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:08,400
I was going to say from the incidents page, just this one, this one, non-fatal,

1921
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,960
thankfully, uh, in June, 2007, the park was closed for two hours after a 17 year

1922
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:18,360
old girl had fired shots from a 22 caliber gun into a sand dune from one of the

1923
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:22,600
pier's rides, thankfully just into a sand dune and you're like, what's going on?

1924
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,520
What did, what did this 17 year old, what did she, what was she mad about?

1925
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,880
Turns out investigated, uh, uh, that she just found it on a seat,

1926
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,200
accidentally dropped by an off duty cop.

1927
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,680
Left their gun on the Ferris wheel.

1928
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:42,760
Oh my God.

1929
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,480
This is, this is something straight out of Brickleberry.

1930
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:57,040
We had a fun, a funny, a funny incident, which I was like worried about at the

1931
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,120
time, but it is in hindsight when Sonny was a very little baby, we, we went to,

1932
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:04,720
this wasn't a violent incident, but it was like at just one of the little stores

1933
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:09,040
on the boardwalk, old, you know, the old timey photographs.

1934
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,600
Oh yeah.

1935
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,160
That old timey photo place has been there forever and ever.

1936
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:13,880
And it's great.

1937
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,760
Cause you know, it's like, you get a family photo and everybody's like, we're

1938
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,640
all old timey bank robbers, gangsters.

1939
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,120
So there was like a, we were getting all the little cousins together.

1940
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,960
And, um, at this time, Sonny must've been like one years old or something.

1941
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:35,120
So, so, um, some of the, the, the, the, one of the nieces, I think was like

1942
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,240
pointed to a picture, there was a variety of choices and it's like, let's

1943
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,840
do the pretty flowy dress thing.

1944
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:46,560
Um, and so that was from in the category of like an old South portrait or whatever.

1945
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,720
So they start getting their gear on and the girls have these big flowy like, uh,

1946
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:58,320
dresses on and then there's the boys putting on soldier outfits and a little

1947
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:03,200
Lord Fauntleroy thing, and they're kind of getting in the pose and the

1948
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,400
photographer is setting up the thing.

1949
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,720
And, um, and then nothing's dawning on me.

1950
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:16,000
And I'm from Alabama until the photographer unfurls the Confederate flag.

1951
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:28,720
And he's like, Oh, it's an old South portrait.

1952
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:32,080
And I'm like, Oh, well, can we, can we just do, can we do the version without

1953
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,440
the, is there an ocean one?

1954
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,680
Saloon backdrop.

1955
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:40,480
Yeah.

1956
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:40,760
Yeah.

1957
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:43,360
Like the saloon thing with the chimney is perfect.

1958
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,200
It doesn't make any sense.

1959
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,560
These people wouldn't be in a saloon.

1960
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,320
They're not at the same.

1961
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,400
This is antebellum and they're over in the old West.

1962
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,560
They were, it's okay.

1963
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,280
I'm not worried about accuracy here.

1964
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,080
It's okay.

1965
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,280
I mean, and that was just like, that's the Jersey shore.

1966
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,400
Like this is the old South.

1967
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,920
These are, we're hitting all the little traits of the old South thing.

1968
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:05,920
And they're not wrong, but it was just like, uh, and if you look through the

1969
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,520
photo book, yeah, there's a lot of like families that are like, we're old South.

1970
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:13,160
You know, we're in front of the Confederate flag, but anyway, it was like,

1971
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,680
it was just the funniest thing.

1972
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,280
Cause it was just like, oh yeah.

1973
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,600
All the cousins are about to be in this photograph now.

1974
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,560
Which is that would damn him forever.

1975
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,240
He could be running for office.

1976
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,360
He won't be running for some offices.

1977
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,720
Some kind of type of a councilman one day.

1978
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,080
Yeah.

1979
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,640
But it was just like one of the funniest things.

1980
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,560
Oh my God.

1981
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,280
Wow.

1982
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:41,880
Wow.

1983
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:42,840
Why did they have?

1984
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:47,880
I know why they wait, except it's wait, but it's, it's Jersey though.

1985
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,120
Like, uh, I, that's so weird that they would.

1986
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,200
It's just sort of weird.

1987
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:57,960
Yeah, there's a weird, I wouldn't say therefore it erases or they, I think

1988
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,600
they were just like, these are the touchstones of the old South.

1989
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,800
I think there was a time.

1990
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,040
Yes.

1991
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,360
We're like, I mean, everyone's always had the agenda of the Confederate

1992
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:09,200
South, meaning something very specific, but like, I think there were also, it

1993
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,480
was just like, the flag was around as a, that equals South and that.

1994
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,520
Yeah.

1995
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:14,840
Sure.

1996
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,000
I just ran into guys like me coming in there.

1997
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,040
What's going on?

1998
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:29,840
Putting all of your kids and cousins into giant puffy bouffant dresses.

1999
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,200
And then you raise a fuss about the Confederate flag.

2000
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,120
I just watched.

2001
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:36,600
Uh, okay.

2002
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:42,000
So there's an old, uh, there's a full house where a, uh, uh, pop star comes

2003
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,120
to visit, uh, Stephanie for her birthday.

2004
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,200
I think I've seen that.

2005
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,000
It's a guy named Tommy page who seems like made up.

2006
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,720
That seems like a fake guy, but I like to know it's a real guy.

2007
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:55,040
And I'm looking up the Tommy page music videos.

2008
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:55,640
What was his deal?

2009
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:56,160
All right.

2010
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,800
Here's his song shag.

2011
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:58,600
Okay.

2012
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,880
And I'm watching this music video and by the core, the chorus kicks in and he's

2013
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,920
Tommy page is busting moves in front of a Confederate flag.

2014
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,360
What is this?

2015
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:06,760
Why?

2016
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,720
And I think it's, I think it's a song from a movie called shag that maybe

2017
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,400
takes place in the South and thus, but it was really disconcerting.

2018
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:21,040
Like I did not expect this around this corner, just to cool, you know, like

2019
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,320
a Rick Astley style guy and he's busting moves in front of all.

2020
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,120
I found that Chuck E cheese clip from like the early nineties where they're

2021
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,520
flashing flags and the Confederate flag flies up on that.

2022
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:32,880
We talked about that in the episode.

2023
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,840
I think there was a time where you just, people were just like, this is

2024
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,160
iconography of a thing that it doesn't, there's sort of an innocence about

2025
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,640
to them, that this is just a thing that's like, you know, and then as people

2026
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:52,520
started, you know, maybe not a good symbol, more context about that.

2027
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,760
You know, they're surrounding it.

2028
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,920
You're like, going like, Oh, maybe, maybe we'll find some other, maybe

2029
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,600
an old, uh, uh, oak tree.

2030
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,360
That's all I can pull.

2031
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,560
I can't think about driving.

2032
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,880
What's the most innocuous picture?

2033
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:15,800
I know depending on oak trees, branches could be bent in an offensive shape.

2034
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,040
Oh, here we go.

2035
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,040
There's always something.

2036
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,240
Oh, it could be bad.

2037
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:24,280
One of the six, one of the six flags, at least initially was a Confederate flag.

2038
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:24,520
Right.

2039
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:24,880
Right.

2040
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,040
Yeah.

2041
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:25,280
Yeah.

2042
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,200
That's a boardwalk t-shirt shop scaled back.

2043
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:32,120
They just replaced all the like Rick and Morty with a Confederate flag.

2044
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:34,480
They were like, Oh, just make it the Supreme logo.

2045
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,600
Don't worry about it.

2046
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:41,160
We do not have the license for this, but Rick and Morty and Goku can

2047
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,880
wear the Supreme logo.

2048
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,640
Uh, um, what have we met?

2049
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:47,520
What are fun details?

2050
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,480
I mean, this, this has all been super fun stuff to talk about.

2051
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,360
And it's, it's very relaxing to, I don't know, just even hear about,

2052
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,920
Oh, the nice and the pizza place.

2053
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,880
And it's picking, Oh, I don't know these places, but

2054
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,360
stealing your popcorn or whatever you may have in your hand.

2055
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,040
Oh, I will say my face.

2056
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,000
I will shout out my favorite ride, which is at the other, the other place.

2057
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:15,400
Not at Playland, at Playland, uh, uh, the Gale force.

2058
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,400
That's, that's, that's the big roller coaster.

2059
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,000
Oh, okay.

2060
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,560
It's kind of like advanced coaster, right?

2061
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,680
Like it's, it's, it's sort of a good one for being a

2062
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:29,000
yeah, it's, it's like, um, I forget X number of tickets where you

2063
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,520
buy $10 just to ride it and I wrote it a few years ago and it's like a real,

2064
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:38,320
I think, intimate coaster and it rocked my shit.

2065
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:43,760
Like I was not prepared for Gale force Gale force took years to construct

2066
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,040
and then it opened and they, some stuff was installed wrong.

2067
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:54,120
So then it went down for months and months, but Playland is where we

2068
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:59,840
were talking about fires, uh, in early 2021, right before we were about to

2069
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,640
record the episode with Avery Monson, I learned about, there was a massive

2070
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:09,840
fire burning on the boardwalk and it was at Playland and they are still

2071
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:15,960
reconstructing their like entryway arcade and stuff, but it totally destroyed

2072
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:22,680
my family's beloved, uh, hamburger construction company, construction company.

2073
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,400
Yeah.

2074
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:30,120
So it's businesses close or flip because it's like, well, a lot of the

2075
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:34,440
comic stores closed because the comic bubble burst, the collectible

2076
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,440
bubble burst in the nineties.

2077
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,000
Uh, a lot of the bookstores closed.

2078
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:44,240
There's still the bookatieria, the used book store, my family loves.

2079
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:49,520
And once at Ithaca, I was like, is that the fucking bookatieria van?

2080
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,400
And it was the guy and I was like, I love your bookstore.

2081
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,840
My family loves your bookstores.

2082
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,160
Like the man, wait, sorry.

2083
01:25:55,160 --> 01:26:00,360
The man from the pure bookstore you liked was in a van by you was

2084
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:05,280
in a van down by the river because his daughter was going to the college.

2085
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,240
Okay.

2086
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,560
So what was his name?

2087
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:12,840
I actually do not know his name, but I've been going there since the stand.

2088
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,680
Bookatieria.

2089
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,000
Yeah.

2090
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:20,360
Um, but businesses flip cause either bubbles, uh, burst or like

2091
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,520
fires certainly will close businesses.

2092
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,840
Bookstores.

2093
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:30,240
Uh, I think the Atlantic books just went bankrupt.

2094
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,600
Um, and, uh, yeah, trends just change.

2095
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:39,360
Kindles, you know, can I ask a hard question of you right now?

2096
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,560
You love this place.

2097
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,200
Yes.

2098
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:42,280
Okay.

2099
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,360
On the second gate, I started asking some hypotheticals here where I have a

2100
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,440
giant missile launcher that can blow up the whole launchers back.

2101
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,040
I'm going to have to train my missile launcher on one thing.

2102
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,400
Toon lagoon or the boardwalk here.

2103
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,360
Unfortunately, in this case, it is to lagoon.

2104
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:05,680
All right.

2105
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,880
I have a second question though.

2106
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,480
It is now trained on either Marvel superhero Island and islands of

2107
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,520
adventure or ocean city.

2108
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,320
I don't know if ocean city is going to make it.

2109
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,280
Oh, you have to decide.

2110
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:19,200
All right.

2111
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,120
We need an answer.

2112
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,440
The entire city.

2113
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,120
Well, no, just the boardwalk and the two things.

2114
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:25,720
What did they do?

2115
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,080
Some people just live there.

2116
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:27,480
All right.

2117
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,960
They're mean people though.

2118
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,440
Maybe like in their snooty about the local.

2119
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,480
Man, we're mad at the shoe.

2120
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,720
If you've ever spoken ill of a shoe be that you're in the missile bath now.

2121
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,080
All the business is gone.

2122
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,320
The boardwalk gone.

2123
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:47,800
Uh, it's probably got to be Marvel superhero island has been destroyed.

2124
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,040
This is like, like I said, it's like a second home.

2125
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:55,480
Well, that's why I, that's why I was the Marvel superhero island is also

2126
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:59,040
a second offices of the daily.

2127
01:27:59,040 --> 01:27:59,360
Whatever.

2128
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,000
Where does Spider-Man work daily?

2129
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,040
Daily bugle.

2130
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,200
Those are, yeah, you sleep under one of those desks.

2131
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,400
That's a second home to you too.

2132
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:06,880
Wow.

2133
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:07,480
Wow.

2134
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,000
This is like an impossible scenario.

2135
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,880
This is a Kobayashi Maru and Star Trek.

2136
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,040
It is a Kobayashi Maru, but you actually decide it.

2137
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:14,800
So we're fine.

2138
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,720
It actually, I just got to read.

2139
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:17,240
Oh wait.

2140
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,520
I just had to read on the test.

2141
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,800
Oh, I didn't know I could cheat on the test.

2142
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,520
I'm a good boy.

2143
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,280
I don't cheat.

2144
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,280
So anyway, yeah, yeah, I would be very interesting.

2145
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,000
Wow.

2146
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,840
The other I was, I wanted to propose one of these with Alan, but I

2147
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,760
don't know how to do it.

2148
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:39,720
I don't know how to like, if you had to be in a missile train scenario, I don't,

2149
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,880
I don't know another, I don't know another old place that you're endeared to.

2150
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,440
I was going to say play land or wonderland.

2151
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,360
Like, what is Stacey's family?

2152
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,880
Where does the loyalty lie?

2153
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,680
Well, I would have to ask them to evacuate before anything.

2154
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,640
Well, yeah, no, they get out of there.

2155
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,000
They.

2156
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:56,560
Okay.

2157
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,000
Okay.

2158
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:57,400
Right.

2159
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:05,880
Um, um, let's see, uh, which one would I blow up?

2160
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:06,200
What?

2161
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,560
Yeah, yeah.

2162
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,240
And it's, that's a pretty carefully guided missile cause these

2163
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,400
places are close to each other.

2164
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,040
So there's not going to be a big footprint to these, these explosions.

2165
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:23,240
Uh, I guess I would, uh, I would probably train it on, uh, play land.

2166
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:24,720
Keep wonderland.

2167
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,800
I really like the iconic, um, spires and castle.

2168
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:29,640
Like, yeah.

2169
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,160
And maybe the less spinning letters that spell out wonderland are really

2170
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:36,000
nice to the spinning letters.

2171
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,720
Those are really cute letters.

2172
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,480
Really good.

2173
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:44,120
If, if you're looking listener for a visual representation of all this, there

2174
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:49,000
is an Instagram account or, uh, they, they professionally do this now, I think

2175
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:57,080
called OC and J, uh, drone, um, and they do drone photography of the island.

2176
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,520
And, um, uh, the theme of the amusement parks, I think they've been doing a

2177
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:08,440
lot more, uh, yeah, OC and J underscore drone, which the drone has the POV

2178
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,680
that a missile in the air would have.

2179
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:15,440
You can watch the videos and can go pew and pretend that you're a missile on

2180
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,560
the way to blow something up.

2181
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,240
Yeah.

2182
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:22,800
But also beautiful photos of like the Bay and the marshland and the bridges.

2183
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:23,360
Look at that.

2184
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,360
Into town.

2185
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:24,800
Wow.

2186
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:25,520
Wow.

2187
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:33,000
Um, I also did a couple of years ago, a little, uh, a little video, uh, not

2188
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,440
an essay, I wouldn't say, but just some, took some photos.

2189
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,000
I get some photos on my walking about pod thing from a couple of years ago

2190
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,840
that I, that I made of ocean city.

2191
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:51,080
I was so, um, moved by the experience that year that I made a little video

2192
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:54,560
oven, took some pictures, you know, that out, scroll down.

2193
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:02,220
It's a pleasant place that inspires nice photography and tributes, which

2194
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:05,800
ties nicely into, into the pod, which we could talk about a little bit, but I

2195
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,320
get, well, like for, unless like a one more, just like, do you, anyone want to

2196
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:14,080
give like one more out of context name of a restaurant or shop that you like?

2197
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:18,480
I mean, I, like I said, I've been coming here basically since I was born.

2198
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,440
I do have a list of, I was tossing it.

2199
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:21,720
Great.

2200
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,080
Close to restaurants.

2201
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:23,440
Great.

2202
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:33,240
Uh, shaftos, spadafores, shaftos, shaftos, shaftos was there for like 50 or 60 years.

2203
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:38,040
It was like an old school kind of like dinner, you know, soup, salad,

2204
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,600
entree, dessert kind of place.

2205
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:47,040
They would do a choice of restaurants, but no, I'm saying you

2206
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,880
order and you get all that.

2207
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,600
I, I like at a restaurant.

2208
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:56,440
Yeah, I mean, like it comes as a meat and you get it all as a meal.

2209
01:31:56,440 --> 01:32:02,000
You get it all for one price and that was probably far too much

2210
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,760
for a child to be eating a shoe.

2211
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,680
Shoebees don't know about shaftos.

2212
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,320
Shoebees don't know about shaftos.

2213
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:14,360
Uh, that, uh, likely closed, um, because people either want to retire or die.

2214
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:20,040
Um, because they've run a fish house for 40 or 50 years.

2215
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,160
Like, yeah, that ran it.

2216
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,880
Um, toyarium was collectible store.

2217
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:29,560
I love growing up, hamburger construction company, green grill and Flanders

2218
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:30,080
grill.

2219
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:35,320
When Flanders grill closed, uh, they opened the green grill and then they

2220
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,480
wanted to retire.

2221
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:41,640
And I think a lot of the staff went to work at the varsity or at Reddy's.

2222
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,240
And those are breakfast lunch.

2223
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:45,320
Well, Green Grill is a hotel, right?

2224
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,160
It's interesting.

2225
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,120
The Flanders.

2226
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:47,440
Yeah.

2227
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:54,440
It's a massive hotel, uh, built, I think around in the 1930s named after, you

2228
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:59,200
know, the battlefield Flanders in tribute, the field of Flanders.

2229
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,160
From world war one.

2230
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:01,800
Interesting.

2231
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,400
No, not the Simpsons character.

2232
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,840
Not the Simpsons character, not dead.

2233
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:13,440
No play land as expanded over the years and built into what used to be

2234
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,480
the massive Flanders pool.

2235
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:16,800
Hmm.

2236
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,320
So they shrunk the pool.

2237
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,200
Oh, they just built another pool.

2238
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:21,760
Okay.

2239
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,240
The first pool felt ready to retire.

2240
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:27,080
It had been a pool for 50 years.

2241
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,040
This was a giant.

2242
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:28,720
Ready to die.

2243
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:34,280
You know, in the mid 20th century, when people would go to the seaside

2244
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:39,280
resorts for their health and do, you know, uh, bathing in the, but you'd,

2245
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,120
the sea is so rough.

2246
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,120
So we have the pool.

2247
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:44,640
So people would go to bathe because they couldn't bathe at home, you mean?

2248
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:48,680
No, no, they could bathe at home, but like for a vacation.

2249
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:50,480
Ah, be purified.

2250
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:50,960
Yeah.

2251
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,800
I forget whether it was a saltwater pool.

2252
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,880
Uh, I should know this.

2253
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:56,760
It might've been.

2254
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,280
Hmm.

2255
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,760
Do they have any of the stuff Steve Harvey does?

2256
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,600
Like a red light machine now or a ice plunge?

2257
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,640
Modern equivalent.

2258
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:03,960
Yeah.

2259
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:04,520
Uh, yeah.

2260
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:07,520
Now thousands of people don't want to take a red light bath together.

2261
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:07,800
Yeah.

2262
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,280
Like a red light things.

2263
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,160
Oh, oxygen bars.

2264
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:14,480
Those were big trend on the boardwalk in the nineties.

2265
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,800
It's going to be so funny in like seven months, Mike, when we discover

2266
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:25,040
like red light treatment causes massive tumors like Steve Harvey

2267
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,800
walking around his head bulging out.

2268
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,720
Steve Harvey's head grew five times its size.

2269
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:31,280
It looks better on camera.

2270
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:31,840
Yeah.

2271
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,240
He wanted it that way.

2272
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,000
Matches the size of the suits.

2273
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,160
Fortunate to the ties.

2274
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,280
Uh, another try.

2275
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:47,560
I think there was like escape rooms that like, I know, there are, yeah, those

2276
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:50,720
have caught on the last few years, like an alien invasion one or something.

2277
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:51,120
Yeah.

2278
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:56,280
Um, but, uh, restaurant I would shout out is uncle.

2279
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,160
It's a pancake house.

2280
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,880
Uh, uncle Bill's pancake house.

2281
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,000
Uh, there's always a line.

2282
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,200
Yeah.

2283
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:08,160
They don't need my help, but how old is uncle Bill?

2284
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,320
80, 85.

2285
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:10,360
Is he ready to die?

2286
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,840
I don't know.

2287
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,280
He might just be an idea.

2288
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:14,800
I don't know.

2289
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:15,160
Yeah.

2290
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:18,480
He's a little cartoon man on the side.

2291
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,760
Oh, he is easy.

2292
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,000
Yeah.

2293
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,600
Uncle Bill.

2294
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,920
Let me see how old the cartoon is and if the cartoon's ready to die.

2295
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,840
Well, the fish people were really ready to die.

2296
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,360
You do fish for 40 years or more than ready to die.

2297
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:29,240
Sure.

2298
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,840
Um, uh, did you say you're going out there?

2299
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:39,560
I, I will probably, yeah, this summer, I think besides one summer when I was

2300
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:46,600
stuck in LA for work and then, uh, 2020, we said, no, no, fuck, no vacation.

2301
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,120
Jason, we got episode.

2302
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,080
We got to do an episode about King Arthur's carousel.

2303
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:50,800
You stay here.

2304
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:56,520
I would love to hear our 2010 episodes, but there are only two summers.

2305
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,320
I've not gone back to ocean city since I've lived here.

2306
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,440
Is this uncle Bill and he's got a woman next to him.

2307
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,320
Yeah, he's, yeah, they're making pancakes.

2308
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,280
Who's the lady?

2309
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,000
I don't know.

2310
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:05,560
Landy.

2311
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:11,040
All right.

2312
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:11,920
Look, that one's this.

2313
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:12,720
They look youthful.

2314
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:13,360
They look youthful.

2315
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:16,280
They're not ready to die.

2316
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:20,960
Um, youthful, a diet of just pancakes.

2317
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:25,760
Uh, um, but we're, we're probably ready to end here.

2318
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,280
We're ready to wrap it up, but what a pleasant journey through this place.

2319
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:33,960
Um, I'm so happy to say Alan McLeod, you survived podcast, the ride.

01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,360
And let's, let's, uh, let's stroll on into the gift shop.

2322
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,760
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2323
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:44,800
Hey, check out my podcast walking about.

2324
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:55,120
Um, I, uh, I love walking and, uh, hopefully as you've made clear walks in the name of

2325
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:59,280
it, uh, you can walk while you listen to it.

2326
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,400
You are allowed if you want to.

2327
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:06,440
And, uh, yeah, yeah, I got to check out the show yesterday.

2328
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,040
It's great.

2329
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,600
It's so charming listeners to this show.

2330
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,720
You love Eva Anderson, I'm sure.

2331
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:13,760
And she was great on it.

2332
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:19,200
You guys went to Hollywood forever cemetery and it's, uh, just what a pleasant, I mean,

2333
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:23,560
you know, it's, it's fun history, but also just hanging out with you guys.

2334
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:28,520
And it's like the way, the, the way you cut it up, that it's like, it's like more like

2335
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:34,120
little audio documentary than, uh, than the normal podcast.

2336
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,400
I get, I just like the formatting a lot.

2337
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,440
It's very charming.

2338
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:42,880
And also that you, you're like the, like interstitial narrations you do, I think are

2339
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,400
really great and funny.

2340
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:49,440
And the thank you here with your, with your, uh, pleasant Southern lilt.

2341
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:52,280
I was like, and we're going to like LA landmarks.

2342
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,320
I'm like, we're in a little bit of like Huell Hauser territory.

2343
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,400
Oh, I mean, Hey, I'll take that.

2344
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:00,800
I mean, I, I mean, I love Huell.

2345
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:05,640
Huell is like the only sketch comedy character, like impersonation.

2346
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,600
I ever did.

2347
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,880
Oh, that makes so much sense.

2348
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:16,480
Starting at, like at, uh, doing like any kind of sketch stuff or character bits.

2349
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:21,600
Like it would be, I remember I had like a sketch that was like, I was just going

2350
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,600
into like a restaurant, some restaurant and it was Ryan Perez was the cook.

2351
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:29,680
And I was like bugging him as Huell, you know, just because it came from a place

2352
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:34,240
of love, because I discovered Huell when I moved to LA and I was like, Oh man.

2353
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,640
So yeah, it's still alive when like, cause he wouldn't, wouldn't, when he

2354
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:42,080
passed away like mid 2010, maybe 10 years ago or so longer.

2355
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:47,120
But, uh, yeah, no, I mean, I think it's, I think it is that just, uh, you know,

2356
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,880
there's something about coming from another place and you're just the

2357
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:53,040
excitement you feel over like discovering new places and stuff.

2358
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:53,720
And yeah.

2359
01:38:53,760 --> 01:39:00,040
And so, so, uh, huge, huge fan of Huell, huge fan of Rick Steves.

2360
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,080
I love Rick Steves.

2361
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,400
Rick Steves is the best.

2362
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:03,800
Yeah.

2363
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:04,200
Yeah.

2364
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:09,200
And, uh, so I mean, yeah, there, there's, there's another guy that used to do like

2365
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:13,520
another presenter, like LA presenter, Ralph Story, who used to do stuff.

2366
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:13,920
So,

2367
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,160
Oh, is he, is he things that aren't here anymore?

2368
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:17,640
Yes.

2369
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,920
That has come up on this show for some reason.

2370
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,280
I don't remember what it was.

2371
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,680
We've assuredly, we've talked about some things that aren't

2372
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:24,920
here anymore in the show.

2373
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:31,200
So yeah, I mean, you know, it's, it's definitely like, uh, I've, I definitely

2374
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:38,400
like love all those types of, uh, formats and presentation and just kind of got a

2375
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,600
kick out of figuring out like, maybe this is a way to do it.

2376
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:46,040
It's sort of like an audio diary sort of captures the sense of like a place and

2377
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:52,480
time, you know, and just like, uh, or a person, you know, that, that I admire a

2378
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:56,560
friend, you know, like, you know, so it's just, uh, it's been really fun.

2393
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,120
Chuck E.

2394
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:36,760
Cheese's that I went through.

01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,240
Thank you.

2396
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,680
Because there's also, wait, yes.

2397

All right.

2398
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:42,160
Because, uh, uh, the Chuck E.

2399
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:45,560
Cheese fan community is like, all right, this is a little confusing because

2400
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:51,200
ocean city has Rocky and the railroad ramblers, but that is not to be confused

2401
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:57,240
with Rocky and the Ramblin rascals, which you can find in the enchanted

2402
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:00,120
forest water safari in old forge, New York.

2403
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:00,560
Wow.

2404
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,360
And let me speed through those in that one.

2405
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:03,880
Chuck E.

2406
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,600
Cheese becomes Rocky the rabbit.

2407
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,040
Helen Henny becomes Henrietta hat pin.

2408
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:12,120
She's Henrietta in every, we have our thing, the Helen test where a lot of

2409
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:15,880
like a very bland name to give to a lot of like female characters who don't bring

2410
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:20,720
a lot to the table is Helen and I think Henrietta is maybe another really weird.

2411
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:23,560
Uh, yeah, yeah, uh, uh, a bland name.

2412
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:27,840
Uh, um, let's see, uh, Pasquale becomes Antonio.

2413
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:28,680
That one's the same.

2414
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:29,440
Jesper T.

2415
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:35,280
Jowls is Jacko the donkey and munch becomes bad bonga the monkey.

2416
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:36,360
Oh my gosh.

2417
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:41,000
Uh, so we have all these, I can't believe how much the family tree.

2418
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:41,360
Yep.

2419
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:44,160
Thirsty Jones is really fantastic.

2420
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:48,240
I don't know how to see a picture of, I mean, thirsty Jones is just the purple

2421
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:49,800
monster from Chuck E.

2422
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:55,960
Cheese, but like that, I mean, munch sounds like, ah, I don't want pizza, but

2423
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:58,800
thirsty Jones has got to be thirsty Jones is slick.

2424
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:00,440
Oh yeah.

2425
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:00,640
Yeah.

2426
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:00,920
Yeah.

2427
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:01,720
There's a different vibe.

2428
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:03,080
There's a mess in town.

2429
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,840
I call thirsty Jones munch is a clown.

2430
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:06,520
Yeah.

2431
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,520
Thirsty Jones is cool.

2432
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:08,120
Yeah.

2433
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,160
Thirsty Jones.

Slip, slurp.
