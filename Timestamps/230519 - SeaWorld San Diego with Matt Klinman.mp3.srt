00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,600
Warning, the following podcast may contain

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,160
patriotism gone horribly wrong,

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,220
submarines that are the literal opposite of submarines,

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,360
and people who don't know how peacocks work.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,080
Matt Kleinman educates us about being an educator

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,980
at SeaWorld San Diego on Podcast The Ride.

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,140
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,980
where we are dedicated to our mission

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,700
of providing a safe, protected habitat for nerds.

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,100
My name's Scott, I'm the director of Nerd Rescue

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,220
and Rehabilitation here at the podcast.

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,100
Joining me is the head of Dry Fact Conservation,

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,980
Jason Sheridan.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,460
That's right, and I'm just getting word

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,660
that we have been purchased by a private equity group,

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,780
so that habitat organization,

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,300
that might have to get some reorg going.

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,140
Some reorg.

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,260
I'm sure whatever it is, they are even more dedicated

23
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,140
to conservation than we are.

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,980
I can only imagine.

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,620
Than we could ever dream of being.

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm sure they're wonderful.

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,220
Finally, a man who is committed to sustainability

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,060
through the recycling of stories, Mike Carlson.

29
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,060
I'm here, yes.

30
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,620
I think stories are something that we're gonna need

31
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,460
a lot of in the future, so we should only have a few of them

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,220
and reuse them over and over again as to not waste.

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,060
I think so too.

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,380
I think that there is, ultimately there's some carbon

35
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,260
footprint to telling a story.

36
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,700
It's hard to say where, but there's electronic devices here

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,500
and it requires effort from your brain.

38
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,220
At some point, I think it hurts the environment

39
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,020
to make the effort to tell a new story.

40
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,740
So when you repeat a Jimmy Buffett story

41
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,460
or an Armand Shimmerman story, you're keeping,

42
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,620
you're being globally conscious, so I appreciate it.

43
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,460
Thank you, yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,700
That is what I'm trying to do.

45
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,500
So I'm glad everyone notices that,

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,740
and I hope that's what you carry forward in your own lives,

47
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,180
listener, dear listeners.

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,980
Yes, if you're taking any lessons from us,

49
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,820
tell your friends the same stories over and over.

50
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,980
I think everyone will love how it goes over.

51
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,980
Today is SeaWorld San Diego, and we are joined

52
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,900
by an actual former member of the SeaWorld family

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,220
who might be aware of, maybe was given jargon

54
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,220
of resembling some of what I just did.

55
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,380
I don't know, we'll find out about your onboarding

56
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,860
and what, I don't even know what you did,

57
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,660
so I'm excited to get into it.

58
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,140
He is one of the creators and stars of Funny or Die's

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,140
high science on what will still be HBO Max

60
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,340
for a few days upon the release of this episode.

61
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,500
So it's HBO Max, but that will, that will,

62
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,900
it's gonna shed that HBO.

63
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,460
Point is, high science is the show,

64
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,820
Matt Kleinman is the guest.

65
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,660
Hello, Matt.

66
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,460
Hey, thank you so much for having me.

67
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,300
Of course.

68
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,260
Yeah, the SeaWorld family, I guess,

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,620
one of the things that they tell you right away

70
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,340
in the orientation is that SeaWorld,

71
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,660
when I worked there, was that SeaWorld only exists

72
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,220
to enrich the Anheuser-Busch brand.

73
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,700
Back when it was owned by Anheuser-Busch,

74
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,460
but they were very explicit that that was the purpose,

75
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,700
was to make the brand of Anheuser-Busch seem better,

76
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,660
to enhance its brand, and we were all there to do that.

77
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,340
We were ambassadors of Anheuser-Busch

78
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,700
and using SeaWorld to make Anheuser-Busch

79
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,740
a stronger, better global brand.

80
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,820
It wasn't about helping a penguin out.

81
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,500
No, that wasn't a part of it at all.

82
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,580
It was not, it was like, the orientation

83
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,620
was one of those things where like,

84
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,980
and you, everybody out there in the park,

85
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,540
do your best to make someone's day a little bit better.

86
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,820
Make sure everybody knows where the bathrooms are.

87
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,060
Go above and beyond,

88
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,100
because you're representing Anheuser-Busch,

89
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,100
and we're here to make sure that via these dolphins

90
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,420
and whales and sea creatures,

91
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,460
that people buy more Anheuser-Busch products.

92
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,580
A guy pointed out the bathroom to me,

93
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,860
so I'm more likely than in three months

94
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,500
in the supermarket aisle.

95
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,060
Well, you got a lot of choices there.

96
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,300
Absolutely, the Anheuser-Busch family

97
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,900
has something for everyone.

98
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,740
Absolutely.

99
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,300
Finest beverages there are.

100
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,540
Can I ask a question?

101
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,140
Because you brought up Anheuser-Busch.

102
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,700
Absolutely.

103
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,060
At some point in my readings,

104
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,260
they mentioned that a number of employees

105
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,100
were entitled to two cases of beer every month.

106
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,180
They do claim that.

107
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,580
I'm so glad you're bringing this up.

108
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,260
It's one of the first things I wanted to talk about.

109
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,660
Wow, no idea.

110
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,580
My understanding, what's called the tot system,

111
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,940
you know what that's what it's called

112
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,300
when they used to have people work on wineries

113
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,740
or on liquor distilleries or whatever,

114
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,260
and then they would have a company store,

115
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,860
but they would give you the wine for free

116
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,260
so that everybody would drink it

117
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,700
and gamble away their earnings

118
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,820
and then have to come back to work for low wages.

119
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,860
They did that.

120
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,700
So they would give you-

121
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,780
It's bribery kind of.

122
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,420
Yeah, every two weeks.

123
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,380
Every two weeks they would give employees

124
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,740
who were over 21 two cases of,

125
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,500
I think of Bud Light,

126
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,260
was what I heard people talk about.

127
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,780
I was 19, so I didn't get this benefit of a perk.

128
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,900
And then also I remember being like,

129
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,300
well then they should give me the cost of a couple.

130
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,140
Yeah.

131
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,980
Right, they should like, I'm getting screwed here.

132
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,820
Well, hey now, hey, hey, hey, hey.

133
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,700
Yeah, like getting nickel and dimed here.

134
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,500
Do they make any juices or anything?

135
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,100
I don't know what else is in that family.

136
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,420
Yeah, Anizer Bush, like Juicy Juice?

137
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,260
Like juice boxes?

138
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,180
You'd have to assume, and it's deep holdings

139
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,820
at some point in that lineup.

140
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,420
Beer for little kids.

141
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,780
Yeah, no, Beer Junior.

142
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,380
I would have loved some Beer Junior,

143
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,820
but no, I just, it was just kind of like

144
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,900
something people told me about.

145
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,980
I wasn't even sure when or where it would happen

146
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,140
because they kept people like me away from it.

147
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,940
You didn't even know where it was distributed.

148
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,380
No, I would have thought I would see my coworkers

149
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,940
stride into the parking lot with a big 30 rack or whatever,

150
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,860
but I never quite saw that.

151
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,780
And I would have thought that one of them

152
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,500
would be cool enough to offer me some,

153
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,180
but nobody ever did that for me.

154
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,020
Geez.

155
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,860
You missed out on the, let me take a stab

156
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,100
and say the only perk.

157
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,620
Besides just generally getting money.

158
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,740
Yes, right.

159
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,500
Well, there were a lot of free tickets to SeaWorlds

160
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,340
that you got.

161
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,020
You got a bunch of like free passes

162
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,580
and then some half off passes.

163
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,940
So I would have a friends come to,

164
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,500
came to visit over that summer.

165
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,940
So I worked there for my summer

166
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,460
between freshmen and sophomore year of college.

167
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,580
I'm from San Diego.

168
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,220
I came back home, wanted a summer job.

169
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,540
And I had always, it just was like SeaWorld to me

170
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,460
was like the ultimate thing.

171
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,980
I loved SeaWorld.

172
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,060
So, well, I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself

173
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,980
because I do wanna, if it's okay with you guys,

174
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,860
because we, and I don't know how you guys

175
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,820
have dealt with this in the past,

176
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,340
but this is a canceled theme park, right?

177
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,020
Yeah, let me take a guess.

178
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,660
It's so many words, but I have learned

179
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,620
that they just kept on keeping on

180
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,860
in one of the things they said they were gonna change.

181
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,020
Well, let me, look, I don't know

182
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,940
what you're getting at exactly, but let me say this.

183
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,660
I was curious, like how dark do we need to get here?

184
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,780
And I realized that because this is SeaWorld San Diego,

185
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,740
the first one, open 1964, kicked off the brand.

186
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,620
This is not the one with Tilikum.

187
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,460
It is not.

188
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,180
Therefore, that is the Blackfish from Blackfish.

189
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,300
That's Orlando.

190
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,980
Tilikum was from Orlando.

191
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,900
So we have no obligation to talk about Blackfish.

192
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,300
Oh, wow. We did it guys.

193
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,420
We don't have to.

194
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,260
Okay.

195
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,940
Most of the stuff was not.

196
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,780
The murders happened elsewhere.

197
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,980
San Diego was perfect.

198
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,820
Yes, sure.

199
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,260
Orlando bad.

200
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,620
It's all in Orlando.

201
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,460
So we just kick that.

202
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,420
Jason was right about Florida and all of it.

203
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,260
I'm so glad to hear you say that.

204
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,100
Kick that down to that episode.

205
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,140
Because I really wasn't sure how to go

206
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,620
and bring this to the table with you guys.

207
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,340
We'll do a very dark episode about the Orlando

208
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,420
and the Blackfish situation eventually.

209
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,860
Get with a serious guest who's like,

210
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,180
we'll get somebody with a PhD in whatever.

211
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,220
Animal,

212
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,740
animal killology.

213
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,660
I don't know what it is.

214
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,620
Admittedly, I have never seen that movie

215
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,020
because I think it would make me too sad.

216
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

217
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,940
That's a good, hey.

218
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,140
And that's why, now the only downside to this is that,

219
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,700
all right, so that's a sad movie that's off the table

220
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,900
because it's Orlando.

221
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,500
I am sad we don't get to talk about happier movies

222
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,380
including Jaws 3D.

223
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,820
That is Orlando so it's off the table.

224
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,380
I really love Jaws 3D.

225
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,500
And we don't get to talk about the adventures

226
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,460
of Mary-Kate and Ashley, the case of the Sea World adventure.

227
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,660
Which is of course from the mystery series.

228
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,900
They saw it was Olsen and Olsen Mystery Agency.

229
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,340
They did two Sea World adventures

230
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,460
but this one was the case of the Sea World.

231
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,700
Have you seen it?

232
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,780
Yes, my sister had this.

233
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,620
Okay, I never.

234
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,540
I like these.

235
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,340
I liked the mystery videos.

236
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,780
Because they also, I think had songs.

237
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,860
I think they would pause the mystery component

238
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,700
to still make it a song and dance tape.

239
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,260
Okay, well we'll get there.

240
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,100
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

241
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,020
I mean I love flat delivery

242
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,820
which will come up in some other clips that I'm gonna play.

243
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,220
So those Olsen Twin videos,

244
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,820
that's just a festival of flat delivery.

245
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,540
That was what they excelled in.

246
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,380
Their talent.

247
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,740
Mm-hmm, that's what we know them for.

248
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,660
Anyway, did that.

249
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,820
Well, sort of.

250
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,900
Well, but the thing is, and I kinda,

251
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,300
I'm sorry, I'm putting this again on you guys.

252
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,620
I am kind of hoping.

253
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,620
I mean you guys are experts.

254
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,860
And the thing, the truth is, ever since Blackfish,

255
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,220
I haven't gone back.

256
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,780
Because I just don't know if it's okay.

257
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,020
Right.

258
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,060
I went back.

259
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,540
I've been, I don't know if it was okay.

260
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,540
I was there to support the Sesame Street brand.

261
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,420
This was, all right, this is the closest place

262
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,860
that I can go where there is Sesame Street stuff

263
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,180
and it was for my child.

264
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,740
So that can only be good, right?

265
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,300
And he got to be in a dance party

266
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,900
with a still at the time socially distanced dance party

267
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,100
where Ernie and Elmo were up on top of a pirate ship

268
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
and we just waved to them from afar

269
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,420
as we were all around like many adults and children

270
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,300
very possibly getting COVID.

271
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,700
The point is the people in the suits weren't getting COVID.

272
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,740
This is like a show?

273
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,740
Yeah, it was kind of a just confusing flop around.

274
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,260
Now I don't remember, I mean, I'm sure,

275
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,180
I wanna say like a YMCA was in there,

276
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,300
kind of general wedding music played

277
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,460
near a colorful pirate ship.

278
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,460
And look, my son got to point at Elmo in the count.

279
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,220
So am I to be run over the coals for this?

280
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,340
Did you see fish shows?

281
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,460
We did not see any fish shows.

282
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,660
So that's good, right?

283
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,820
Now granted I gave money to the system

284
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,220
that makes fish shows possible.

285
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,700
And they've changed the fish show.

286
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,380
They've changed some things over the years.

287
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,220
I bet.

288
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,420
They say that, but to kind of check,

289
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,940
I watched a video of the most recent version

290
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,060
of the Shamu show, which is supposed to be updated

291
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,260
more about their lifestyle and experiences.

292
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,060
And it's nice, the stage looks nicer.

293
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,140
There's definitely more like a lot of good factoid

294
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,980
and stuff like that.

295
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,700
But the tricks and things were mostly similar.

296
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,180
Yeah, they were still doing a lot of the little tricks.

297
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,580
That's what I was, they had more soulful music

298
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,180
than I remember them.

299
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,180
And they have less like direct like,

300
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,700
and now here's this trick.

301
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,260
And now here's like less of that.

302
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,260
That's more of a little bit like

303
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,980
they're just kind of jumping kind of as it's going.

304
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,060
It's a little more free.

305
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,020
It's not like do this, do this.

306
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,740
Right, it's their choice.

307
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,740
I get free style of Shamu choice.

308
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,060
So I guess really, probably a person would say,

309
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,500
as long as they're doing Shamu show, it's probably bad.

310
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,020
That's what I'm wondering too.

311
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,860
Probably.

312
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,060
But the thing is, is that these,

313
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,460
and now we're getting into the heart of the matter.

314
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,100
They, these are, many of them are orcas

315
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,300
that were born in captivity.

316
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,420
That this is the life that they've only known.

317
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,900
That there's nothing else to do with them.

318
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,740
And they're gonna live a long time.

319
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,700
And so, while they're there,

320
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,500
you should do something with them.

321
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,740
And you gotta- A fun show.

322
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,580
People look at them.

323
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,780
Let them have a little bit of fun.

324
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,980
Let them do their thing. Sure, sure.

325
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,340
Yeah, that seemed to be the thing they had stuck with.

326
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,180
They're like, all right,

327
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,620
we're not gonna breed them in captivity anymore.

328
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,340
And I was like, hold up.

329
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,580
What were you doing?

330
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,820
Like, I thought these were rescues.

331
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,140
Not the case, no.

332
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,940
And so I think this class, this crop of them,

333
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,620
is like when these are gone, they're gone.

334
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,620
Like they say they're not gonna do, get any more of them.

335
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,540
That said, I can't really tell.

336
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,700
They have open Sea World in Abu Dhabi on Yas Island.

337
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,540
They did?

338
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,860
Did you want to hear? Yeah.

339
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,700
Yeah.

340
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,260
It's like what, 10 years ago?

341
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,740
No, wasn't it recent?

342
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,580
Is it more soon?

343
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,060
I think it was this year.

344
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,900
Oh wow, I must have been through the day then.

345
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,220
Is it a new Sea World in the world this year?

346
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,060
Yeah.

347
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,740
Yas Island is one of those like tourist,

348
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,380
massive tourist destinations built from nothing.

349
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,620
Where you're like, don't knock on the walls.

350
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,620
Don't ask who built this

351
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,700
and don't knock on the walls too closely.

352
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,100
Don't dig too deep under the sand.

353
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,140
Don't dig too deep.

354
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,580
What you will find will not have you saying Yas.

355
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,620
Oh my God, I'm so wrong.

356
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,460
Yeah, Jason, you're right.

357
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,380
It's not even, it's opening in two weeks.

358
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,220
In two weeks.

359
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,060
What?

360
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,060
This is coming out in one week, so that means one week.

361
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,860
Yeah, the 23rd it's coming out.

362
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,140
So any listeners who are on Yas Island,

363
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,980
do we know that it is Yas, not Yas?

364
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,020
It's Y-A-S.

365
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,460
Y-A-S.

366
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,380
Yeah.

367
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,100
I have, they're Yasifying Sea World.

368
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,940
Wow.

369
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,740
They're putting Sea World into a big photo filter.

370
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,500
Yeah.

371
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,100
Matt, when did you work there exactly?

372
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,900
So I worked there the summer of 2005.

373
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,740
Okay.

374
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,540
That's way before the movie, right?

375
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,380
Well, there you go.

376
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,380
So Matt, you're fine.

377
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,220
Thank you.

378
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,060
Thank you for saying that.

379
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,100
Yeah, no, I mean, I, thank you.

380
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,700
I felt like it was okay at the time.

381
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,580
And then when the movie did come out,

382
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,020
I mean, I don't know how, when the movie came out,

383
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,180
I said the lie.

384
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,780
There's a lie in the movie that they say that

385
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,900
although they show somebody on hidden camera,

386
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,940
they show an educator, which was my position,

387
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,020
telling somebody, a guest, that the orcas live longer

388
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,340
in captivity than they do in the wild.

389
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,180
Oh, wow.

390
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,940
And that's just simply not true.

391
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,620
There's no evidence to bear that out,

392
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,660
but that is something in our like info packets

393
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,140
and a very common question

394
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,180
and something that we would say all the time.

395
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,500
And I took that as gospel, because these are the experts.

396
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,940
These are the people who know.

397
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,940
And so that was one of the lies or one of the things

398
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,500
that I said on behalf of the company

399
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,420
that I have since regretted.

400
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,460
Wow, so you said that like every day, maybe?

401
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,700
Probably, if I was working at that exhibit.

402
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
That's wild.

403
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,820
That is like an interesting factoid

404
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,660
that you could give people.

405
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,500
And it makes them feel good.

406
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,460
It doesn't happen to be true.

407
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,900
Yes.

408
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,020
They love it so much here that they live longer.

409
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
They want to live longer.

410
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,860
Yeah.

411
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,660
They like the theme park better than the ocean.

412
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,500
They do.

413
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,340
Yeah.

414
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,180
That's interesting.

415
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,300
Well, I like a theme park better than the ocean.

416
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,980
So I guess that makes sense.

417
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,700
Music plants and I have some popcorn falls in.

418
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,540
They like that.

419
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,380
You like popcorn, don't you?

420
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,660
Yeah, the flavors are different.

421
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,420
Wow, guests over 21 are entitled to two free

422
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,420
seven ounce pours of beer.

423
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,700
That's awesome.

424
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,980
Try the whales like the beer.

425
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,220
Maybe that's why they want a beer.

426
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,500
Yeah, if I don't live longer,

427
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,220
I'm actually leaving beer on the table.

428
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,540
I'm not collecting more free beer if I die sooner.

429
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,140
So if I live longer in the park,

430
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,980
I get more bang for my buck.

431
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,020
Yeah.

432
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,620
It's important to attain that value.

433
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,020
So that is, yeah, that's interesting.

434
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,060
Is there, are there any other like big lies

435
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,100
they had you telling?

436
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,300
So the other thing was that this was 2005.

437
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,060
This was a Anheuser-Busch and prior to Anheuser-Busch,

438
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,940
it was owned, I had heard by,

439
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,500
it was by a large like conglomerate or whatever,

440
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,340
but I had heard that the owner was much more Christian then.

441
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,820
But all that led to us never being able to say

442
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,980
the word evolution.

443
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,180
We just couldn't tell people when we were educating them

444
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,140
about the animals.

445
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,060
We couldn't say that they evolved to be this way.

446
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,900
We had to say they adapted or just ignore

447
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,900
the concept of evolution entirely.

448
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,740
Okay.

449
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,060
Adapting's okay.

450
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,900
Yeah, adapting is fine.

451
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,740
What's the difference?

452
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,340
Like God allowed adaptation, but evolving.

453
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,580
God came down and kind of shaped the clay

454
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,780
a little bit differently on one day.

455
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
It's just like him doing rewrites or whatever.

456
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,620
Yeah, yeah.

457
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,060
God is fine with synonyms, you know.

458
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,300
But he's not fine with that one word, no, no.

459
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,660
Yeah, so that was another thing

460
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,340
so we couldn't talk about that.

461
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,060
And then, I don't know, I mean, there's a bunch of stuff

462
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,020
that I feel like I could kind of get into

463
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,980
about just the experience of being at SeaWorld

464
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,540
and what you sort of see when you're there

465
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,260
as compared to I think what you imagine it would be like,

466
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,740
or I don't know, the fiction of it being.

467
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,140
Wait, question, how are you in,

468
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,620
you're an educator at 19.

469
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,140
Right, so yeah, well, so let me start at the beginning,

470
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,380
I suppose, which was that I'd always wanted

471
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,180
to work at SeaWorld and then through a series of like,

472
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:15,180
just me completely missing the context of a few key moments,

473
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,100
I was led to really believe that being an educator

474
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,540
at SeaWorld was a much bigger deal than it was.

475
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,300
And that started with, obviously as a kid,

476
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,540
I thought it was really cool and wanted to work at SeaWorld

477
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,300
and I remember maybe the winter before going to SeaWorld

478
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,300
and meeting somebody in the shark encounter

479
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,500
with a young person, the youngest college age or whatever,

480
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,580
with a clipboard who was telling people about the animals

481
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,580
and stuff like that and I remember thinking like,

482
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,700
oh, that's amazing, I was studying marine biology

483
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,060
in high school, I really loved that stuff,

484
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,180
I got a scuba, I got scuba certified when I was a teen,

485
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,820
I loved the ocean, growing up in San Diego,

486
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,180
I would snorkel all the time, surfing,

487
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,020
all that sort of stuff but I really loved marine biology

488
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,580
and so I kind of assumed that, oh, the people working

489
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,380
at SeaWorld must be best in class,

490
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,340
experts about all of these things

491
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,300
and I once went up to somebody who was working

492
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,580
at one of these places to ask them,

493
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,980
so how'd they got the job, are you a student?

494
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,580
All of the answers, when I replayed them again,

495
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,500
fed into my bias which was believing that they were

496
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,580
a PhD student who was that clipboard they were using

497
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,860
to take data, to collect data about what they were observing

498
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,460
some sort of study they were doing

499
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,740
because this person said, oh yeah, I'm a student,

500
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,180
I go to UCSD, yeah, I like the animals,

501
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,700
and I'm like, oh, is that what you study?

502
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,340
Like, yeah, I study stuff, but I was like, I don't know.

503
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,820
Anyways, later I realized on his clipboard was just

504
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,140
drawings of the sharks with their names

505
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,980
that he was holding so he would remember what they were

506
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,460
if somebody asked him and he was probably

507
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,400
just a college student who had this job.

508
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,780
The educators at SeaWorld are actually,

509
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,300
it's a minimum wage job, it was like a 7.15 an hour job

510
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,860
and really you're there to make sure people don't fall

511
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,140
into any of the open pools of water

512
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,820
so they give you lifeguard training and show you

513
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,300
where the donuts are that you throw out,

514
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,820
the water, and where the life jackets are

515
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,300
if you need to save somebody, but basically they figure

516
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,780
they had to pay people to stand around near the open tanks

517
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,980
they might as well give them a microphone

518
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,220
and a little fact book and have them say some stuff.

519
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,060
Oh, okay.

520
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,620
You're kind of a show too.

521
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,460
A little bit.

522
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,280
Casual, yeah.

523
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,540
Yeah, or you're there to give some burnishment

524
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,460
to the brand, some little bit more than what the guests

525
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,880
had bargained for or whatever.

526
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,280
Now it is also the, it can be like a gateway

527
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,080
to becoming a trainer is that if you,

528
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,100
a lot of the trainers started at this educator position

529
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,840
and like worked their way up.

530
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,500
So that was another thing that led me to believe

531
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,880
that this was like a big deal.

532
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,800
But basically when I applied, when I came home that summer,

533
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,280
I thought I didn't, I kind of ran,

534
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,960
that was running through my head and then a couple

535
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,280
of other things happened that made me think like,

536
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,000
there's no way I'm gonna get this job.

537
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,200
The other one was when I went to like the trailer

538
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,440
in the parking lot of SeaWorld to like get a job application

539
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,360
and put it in, the comedian Dat Fan.

540
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,200
Of course.

541
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,020
Oh sure.

542
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,860
Was there?

543
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,240
Winner of one of the last comics stand,

544
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,080
the first last comic stand.

545
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,680
The first season of last comic stand,

546
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,800
which had just been a few years prior.

547
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,360
And he was there also applying for the same job.

548
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,200
What?

549
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,040
What?

550
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,200
And I, which then led me to believe like, oh wow.

551
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,280
Like this is like a Hollywood pipeline.

552
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,280
This is like the people who are doing this are like,

553
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,040
you know, tip top talent.

554
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,640
Why would me, a college freshman even have a chance?

555
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,400
I remember going and seeing him there,

556
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,560
having an application and then talking to like

557
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,600
the higher up people.

558
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,480
I don't know, he was going into some offices

559
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,800
and talking and they seemed to be doing some wheelings.

560
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,640
I don't know.

561
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,320
Later I learned that Dat Fan was going back to,

562
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,720
was going there to apply.

563
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,480
But during, so he's from San Diego.

564
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,920
And when he was on last comic standing,

565
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,720
he was like comic from San Diego, Dat Fan.

566
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,120
And by the way, he's a lovely guy.

567
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,960
He was wonderful.

568
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,480
It was nice meeting him and like having lunch

569
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,800
and stuff with him, like he was great.

570
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,760
No shade on Dat Fan truly.

571
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,880
But I guess he had, that had been his day job,

572
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,120
was he had worked his way up as from being an educator

573
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,960
while he was like doing standup and stuff like that.

574
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,680
He had worked his way up to the point where he was like

575
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,960
the highest level kind of presenter there.

576
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,640
Like he would do the MCing for like

577
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,120
the weekend Shamu shows.

578
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Like he, which are like big, like lights going crazy,

579
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,600
like big sort of things, high production stuff.

580
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,960
He was like their main guy.

581
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,840
He was the last educator standing.

582
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,440
Yes, he was the last educator standing.

583
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,280
He had won, he had won the tournament

584
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,160
of SeaWorld Educating.

585
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,120
And, but when I had learned was he was there that day

586
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,040
because he had gone, he had like moved to LA

587
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,240
after last comic standing, you know,

588
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,520
tried it for a little bit.

589
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,200
He had a wife and like young kids.

590
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,080
And I think they just felt like his wife was a teacher,

591
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,640
that their life was a little better in San Diego.

592
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,800
So they had kind of moved back.

593
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,040
And yeah, he was going to keep doing standup,

594
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,320
but he wanted to basically just get his old job back,

595
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,160
even if part time, just cause you know, he loved it

596
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,000
and it was great.

597
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,360
They loved him there.

598
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,520
But corporate had a rule that if you leave

599
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,360
and two years elapse, then you have to start back at step one.

600
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,880
And all of his like record,

601
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,160
everything he had done didn't matter.

602
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,440
He had to go back to the minimum wage job

603
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,600
that I was also applying for.

604
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,880
Oh my God.

605
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,200
So it was, and the beer resets too.

606
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,040
Right.

607
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,640
It didn't get to that third box.

608
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,480
Oh no.

609
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,960
Yeah. It feels like corporate and him

610
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,680
should have just cracked a couple of cold ones

611
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,520
and talked it out.

612
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,400
At least got him up to like mid range, you know?

613
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,800
You would think, but that was what I was witnessing

614
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,480
was him kind of arguing and being told this bad news

615
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,160
and him being like, come on guys, it's me.

616
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,480
Remember me.

617
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,840
And then being like, I'm sorry, this comes from corporate.

618
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,680
Wow.

619
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,560
So what does your experience starts

620
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,320
with a person you recognize,

621
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,920
but then kind of recently relevant person

622
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,800
being told they can't.

623
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,640
Right.

624
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,360
It's like just limited your expectations.

625
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,080
Well, but through my frame and lens,

626
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,640
I just saw a famous person wheeling and dealing

627
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,920
in the hiring office and I just had no idea.

628
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,640
And then when I went to like,

629
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,200
I got like a callback or whatever,

630
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
they liked my application, they brought me in

631
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,680
and you do like a little audition.

632
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,840
You like give a little spiel about animals

633
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,960
in front of like the tide pool exhibit or whatever.

634
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,920
And then the other person doing it when I was there

635
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,360
had just come back off of a national tour with Rockefeller.

636
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,280
And which- What?

637
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,760
I also didn't fully know how to contextualize

638
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,080
if that was like a big deal or not, I don't know.

639
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
But at the time I was like,

640
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,480
well, I'm definitely not getting this job.

641
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,640
I mean, this is for the big leagues.

642
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,480
This is like, wow.

643
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,720
Wait, are there multiple, if I've been a fool,

644
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,400
is Rockefeller not just four people

645
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,560
and the same four people from Carmen San Diego?

646
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,680
Are there, is it Bloomin' Man?

647
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,200
Are there a lot of Rockefellers?

648
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,020
Yeah, it's Bloomin'.

649
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,860
Yeah.

650
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,700
Geez.

651
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,280
So I'm not seeing the person who did the shoe-wop-a-doo-ay

652
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,800
on my favorite show I tolerated when I was eight.

653
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,640
Probably not.

654
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,480
Wow.

655
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,360
So there's multiple touring units of Rockefeller.

656
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,960
That was what this person told me.

657
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,800
It's franchises.

658
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,240
So the Rockefeller that played my senior week event

659
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,800
when I was graduating college and I was like,

660
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,720
oh, this picnic food is terrible

661
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,920
and Rockefeller is kind of sucks.

662
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,760
Like this all, I gotta go pack up my house.

663
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,040
I was just kind of bummed out.

664
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,760
I don't think I'll stay for the rest of Rockefeller.

665
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,320
Do you remember what Rockefeller sang?

666
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,160
Sorry to derail this with Rockefellertal.

667
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,840
Well, I think I bailed after the Where in the World

668
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,680
is Carmen San Diego song.

669
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,520
They did the Where is the World?

670
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,360
I'm pretty sure they did it.

671
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,200
What else are they gonna do?

672
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,680
What else are they gonna do?

673
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,040
Yeah, that's my, I'm the most curious

674
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,600
what is the second song they performed.

675
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,480
It's a good question.

676
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,320
Weird.

677
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,480
Sing it, Rockefeller.

678
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,520
Right, that was the thing.

679
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,360
Yeah.

680
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,200
Sing it.

681
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,040
It's a little exciting to hear in a room with microphones.

682
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,880
Sing it, Rockefeller.

683
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,600
Oh, this was in the quad during an unexpected

684
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,560
spring heat wave.

685
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,080
Well, look, they're more equipped than most acts

686
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,080
to perform acapella or rock-a-pella.

687
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,720
They don't need microphones necessarily.

688
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,520
Well, sure, look, they were just happy to know

689
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,480
where in the world they were that day.

690
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,920
Mike Love would like rock-a-pella

691
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,040
because of the acapella nature.

692
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,480
Yeah, well, and he does, because he's like the bo-po-po-bo-po,

693
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,080
he does that part of the harmony.

694
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,920
Yeah.

695
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,760
Mm-hmm.

696
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,680
Light a rose.

697
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,880
They're a cool band to him.

698
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,920
They're an up and coming.

699
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

700
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,360
Like when three years ago he's like,

701
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm gonna start collaborating with a big act of today,

702
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,120
Sugar Ray and Hanson.

703
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,120
Mike Love's failed.

704
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,400
Mark McGrath is on a lot of Beach Boys stuff recently.

705
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,280
Yeah, he's becoming.

706
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,080
He's like another extra member.

707
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,600
Satellite member, yeah.

708
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,440
He might, yeah, he might join up.

709
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,400
Of the Beach Boys now that are rock-a-pella.

710
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,520
He's with them a lot.

711
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,600
He's with them on specials, I feel like.

712
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,840
They'll do like a July 4th special,

713
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,400
and Mark McGrath is there with them.

714
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,080
You have a lot in common with Mike Love,

715
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,280
and to both of you, Mark McGrath is a big role.

716
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,800
Sort of like what John Mayer is to Grateful Dead?

717
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,640
Oh, maybe, yeah, yeah.

718
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,360
I think John maybe has done more dates even.

719
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,880
That but with zero musical talent or ability.

720
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,720
Right.

721
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,520
Look, Mark there is saying, I think,

722
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,640
do it again is what I've seen Mark do.

723
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,320
So I don't know why that specific song,

724
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,920
they want him there for that, but.

725
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,040
Easy.

726
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,880
Easy to sing?

727
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,320
Sorry, I'm throwing Mark under the bus here.

728
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,480
He seems like a lovely guy.

729
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,160
When you were, I think maybe you said,

730
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,520
kind of alluded to this,

731
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,400
when they said you would be an educator,

732
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,920
was there a 19-year-old pride in the idea of that word

733
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,520
and what your mission was then?

734
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,960
Absolutely, and they give you a little spiral-bound book,

735
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
and you go through a couple days of training

736
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,160
about basic facts about all the animals

737
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,680
and how to put together,

738
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,880
they give you template scripts for the spiel

739
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,720
that you're gonna do.

740
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,280
So how it works is you walk around Sea World,

741
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,720
if you go to one of the exhibits where there is an educator,

742
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,200
which are almost always ones

743
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,240
that also have open pools of water,

744
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,840
an educator will have a microphone,

745
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
they'll usually talk for five to 10 minutes

746
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,200
and then open it up for questions,

747
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,560
be like, hey, I'm here for questions

748
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,720
if anybody wants or whatever.

749
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
But I did, because I had just taken,

750
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,520
I had done a lot of marine biology stuff,

751
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
and I don't know if people actually wanted this,

752
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,760
but I really took pride in that I could speak for a full hour.

753
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,480
I could go out, I could do material

754
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,480
without recycling that much of it for a full hour,

755
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,360
just kind of giving not only the information

756
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,440
that Sea World provides,

757
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,880
but other information that I knew

758
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,440
from my marine biology classes,

759
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,000
and I could really inform the public about pinnipeds,

760
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,400
seals and sea lions, or about the intertidal zone,

761
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,520
or the manatees, or the shark exhibit,

762
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,680
which was one of my favorites,

763
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,640
and then I would kind of have whole things that I would do,

764
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,200
and I took a lot of pride in that.

765
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,920
Did this help, did that help you get the job?

766
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,800
I think my original, they had kind of callback auditions,

767
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,520
and I did one that I guess, I don't know.

768
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,440
Probably. Yeah.

769
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,520
But I was so nervous, because I thought

770
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,800
that only Hollywood up-and-comers were gonna get the job.

771
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,880
So I was, if I-

772
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,720
You had no credits.

773
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,680
Yeah, so I, exactly.

774
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,520
I'm close to having an IMDb page.

775
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,320
Why would they even pay attention to me?

776
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,160
But they gave me a shot,

777
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,800
so I remember trembling as I was delivering my spiel.

778
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,640
Wow. Wow.

779
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,360
Meanwhile, you're probably the dream,

780
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,840
you're probably the best they have.

781
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,440
Yeah, once I got in there,

782
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
I mean, there were definitely some people

783
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,840
who were very interested, and also definitely some people

784
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,640
who wanted to be dolphin trainer track,

785
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,080
but there were also people who were just like,

786
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,520
I don't know, I thought this would be a fun job,

787
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,360
or whatever.

788
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,200
Right. Okay.

789
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,120
Geez, interesting.

790
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,400
Okay, so you move past the intimidation.

791
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,240
Right.

792
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,720
Rockstar spiel.

793
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,360
How long are you there, ultimately?

794
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,200
How long do you do this for?

795
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,280
Yeah, well, the job was just for the summer, for me,

796
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,000
but it was like, you pick up four or five days a week,

797
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,520
or whatever, and they kinda rotate you around the park

798
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,400
throughout the day, so usually at one exhibit

799
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,280
for like an hour or two, at most.

800
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,600
And then one of them would be the Shamu kind of enclosure

801
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,680
in between shows, and you would talk to people,

802
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,520
and that's where I would say the lie

803
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,560
about their longevity and stuff like that.

804
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,520
But yeah, so that was basically the gig.

805
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,520
And then, you know, then things kinda happened.

806
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,040
Then I guess I could start kinda.

807
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,880
I think we have to go.

808
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,720
Sure, yeah.

809
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,880
I'm scared, but yes.

810
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,560
Well, I do, this is like a little bit of a warning.

811
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,160
I don't know, Scott, if you told these guys

812
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,560
a little bit about the stories,

813
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,880
a couple of the stories I have,

814
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,200
but I don't want people going into this not.

815
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,200
I did wait, because if you told them to me,

816
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,600
that would have been at the Funny or Die

817
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,160
15th Anniversary party where I was the drunkest

818
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,000
I've been in years.

819
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,840
Oh, okay, cool.

820
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,660
So I don't have them.

821
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,500
I don't have them.

822
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,340
This will be fresh.

823
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I did not have them

824
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,520
to give to Mike and Jason.

825
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,360
No, we don't know anything.

826
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,200
This worked out perfect.

827
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,800
I'm so glad I got college-level drunk.

828
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,560
A little refresher for Scott,

829
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,200
and a totally new thing for me and Mike.

830
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,280
Yeah, too, it was their quinceañera.

831
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,120
Right.

832
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,960
Oh, yeah.

833
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,800
Oh, yeah.

834
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,640
Oh, yeah.

835
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,480
Oh, yeah.

836
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Funny or Die quinceañera was the theme.

837
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,000
Yes, yeah, yeah.

838
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,320
And the hors d'oeuvres that were not present

839
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,360
were all Mexican food, I guess.

840
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,920
But I never got any.

841
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember those.

842
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,000
They don't invite me to these parties anymore.

843
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,840
I used to be invited.

844
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,560
I think they invited everybody who worked there.

845
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,640
I stole a pillow, though.

846
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,920
That was the victory. Oh, nice.

847
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,760
I wanted to steal a pillow,

848
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,640
but they were all stolen by the time I wanted to steal one.

849
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,920
Well, and that's how they fell on hard times

850
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,800
where we're not able to keep pumping out

851
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,720
landlord style videos as much

852
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,560
because everyone's stealing the pillows,

853
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,680
taking a LaCroix to drink and a LaCroix to take home.

854
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,440
Well, they wanted me to, that was part of it.

855
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,000
That was like getting the beer from M.I. Sir Bush.

856
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,320
Hell, that was the toss.

857
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,400
It was assumed that you take as many pillows as you can.

858
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,360
Just people taking advantage of the good, wholesome folks

859
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,760
at private equity.

860
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,600
And again.

861
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,760
Same old story.

862
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,960
Same old story.

863
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,120
So there were a lot of like lore and stuff at SeaWorld,

864
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,200
like stories that you only hear if you work there,

865
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,880
but maybe I'll tell a couple of those

866
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,800
because they're the things that,

867
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,400
some of the things that stick with me.

868
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,000
The main, one of the ones that I had heard

869
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,040
even before I worked at SeaWorld,

870
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,280
because I think it's like corroborated in like press

871
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,720
and stuff like that, is the previous,

872
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,720
before Anheuser-Busch, the previous owner,

873
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,320
who again, I had kind of heard was Christian.

874
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,400
I kind of tried to verify that kind of stuff

875
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,880
before coming here to make sure.

876
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,720
You seem to just be the head of like a large publishing

877
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,440
company that then tried to get.

878
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,280
Hardcore.

879
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,120
Yeah, hardcore.

880
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,960
A division of hardcore.

881
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,800
Yeah.

882
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,360
And then they had to sell SeaWorld to Anheuser-Busch

883
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,160
because Giseline Maxwell's father tried to do

884
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,920
a hostile takeover of the company.

885
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,760
Whoa.

886
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,200
And in order to do that, they had to go into such massive

887
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,960
debt that they had to sell off SeaWorld.

888
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Wow.

889
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,800
Yeah.

890
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,400
If you want to talk corporate wheelings and dealings,

891
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,440
that's the, if you guys have seen the new Tetris movie,

892
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,280
the bad guy in the new Tetris movie is the one and the same

893
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,960
that ultimately led to Hardcore having to.

894
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,200
Mr. Maxwell, what's the name?

895
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,040
Do we know the name of the?

896
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,960
Robert Maxwell.

897
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,800
I think so.

898
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,360
I believe also a Mossad spy.

899
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,280
Oh, really?

900
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,120
Maybe.

901
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,840
Like had some shady wheelings and dealings.

902
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,040
Well, he died mysteriously.

903
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,280
He like fell off a boat or something.

904
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,120
What?

905
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,960
Yeah.

906
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,800
He died very mysteriously.

907
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,640
In that group of people, a mysterious death?

908
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,480
Yeah.

909
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,320
I don't say.

910
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,160
That's hard to believe.

911
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,520
I certainly hope it was the last one.

912
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,440
So, but I think that guy, the Hardcore,

913
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,400
the guy that worked for Hardcore,

914
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,960
I think he's who they refer to when they say

915
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,520
the Christian guy, but he they SeaWorld is known.

916
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,360
If you go, even if you fly into San Diego,

917
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,200
you can't miss it.

918
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,840
There's a giant revolving tower, a big blue tower

919
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,320
with like kind of like a revolving platform on it,

920
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,400
distinctive on the San Diego skyline.

921
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,320
And apparently when they opened it,

922
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,880
they wanted to sort of like christen it

923
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,680
with like a big sort of ceremony.

924
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,840
And at SeaWorld, there was one of those places

925
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,320
where they have a lot of like peacocks roaming the grounds.

926
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,160
Sure.

927
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,720
You know, the Los Angeles Botanical Garden

928
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,920
is a similar place like that.

929
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,400
Philadelphia Zoo always had a lot of peacocks

930
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,240
roaming the ground.

931
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,400
Yeah, it's fun.

932
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,000
So I guess he took up some of those peacocks

933
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,040
to the top of the tower

934
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,800
and he was going to release them like doves.

935
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,640
No.

936
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,480
That's so high.

937
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,280
I don't think that works.

938
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,080
And so, I mean, yes.

939
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,360
Also, they definitely, even if peacocks

940
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
could have flown from there,

941
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,480
I think they clipped the wings.

942
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,320
Some.

943
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,680
So the man, the rich man, he threw peacocks

944
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,080
off the ledge of this, I don't know,

945
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,000
100 feet, 200, 300, 500 feet tower.

946
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And apparently they just plummeted to their deaths.

947
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,440
What did you think was gonna happen?

948
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,040
I think that they would fly off gracefully

949
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,560
and christen his beautiful new tower.

950
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,600
They are birds.

951
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Birds fly.

952
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,840
End of story.

953
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,720
Come with me.

954
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,760
You can throw one too.

955
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,880
That is.

956
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,720
What?

957
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Yeah, so that's like a famous San Diego tale.

958
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,440
Oh my God.

959
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,640
How come we didn't find this doing our research?

960
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,440
Yeah, they tried to bury this one.

961
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,000
It wasn't, this wasn't on cworld.com.

962
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,840
No, there's not famous photos of this

963
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,960
like Walt opening Disneyland.

964
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,720
Well, that's the thing I remember.

965
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,800
I think if you go like micro-fiche digging

966
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,320
in like some like library,

967
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,280
you can maybe find the old article.

968
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,480
And I'd always hoped that there would be some image of it.

969
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,680
I don't know if anyone took it, but I've never seen it.

970
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,760
It might've been too, it was too much of a blur.

971
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,520
I don't know what speed they were following.

972
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,760
Mr. Sea World and.

973
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,600
Probably pretty fast.

974
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,440
Pretty fast, yeah.

975
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,360
The most beautiful blur you've ever seen in your life.

976
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,560
Jesus Christ.

977
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,120
It was a very impressive blur.

978
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,000
You've got to think if peacocks could really soar

979
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,040
like doves around tourist destinations

980
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,760
that are dirty with them.

981
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,680
You'd just be seeing soaring peacocks everywhere

982
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,520
all the time.

983
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,040
It'd be common iconography.

984
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

985
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,760
The place of the soaring peacock.

986
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,600
Yeah.

987
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,920
But yeah, no.

988
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,040
Why don't we see this all the time?

989
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,440
It's so, peacocks aren't taking the initiative to fly.

990
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,280
He was just trying to give them the head start they needed.

991
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,720
It's like Sea World was not started

992
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,440
with a bunch of animal experts around.

993
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,560
That's what it seems like.

994
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,880
The knowledge was not.

995
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,720
Well, it was.

996
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,080
Not to derail from what you're saying,

997
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,400
but the backstory of it is like it was 1964.

998
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,680
Four UCLA frat brothers decided to start.

999
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,600
Stick some shit in some tanks or whatever.

1000
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Yeah, it was like we're gonna put a,

1001
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,760
we're gonna make an underwater level of our restaurant.

1002
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,280
Oh, that's too complicated.

1003
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,720
All right, where's there a bunch of land we can grab?

1004
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,960
Let's, so that is, that's the starting point.

1005
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,760
So I guess it shouldn't be so insane

1006
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,960
that now we got peacocks falling out of towers.

1007
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,800
Yeah.

1008
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,640
Oh my God.

1009
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,240
So the other legend, and this was the one that I heard

1010
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,200
when I was working there.

1011
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,760
I hadn't heard this outside of it,

1012
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,560
but it also involves birds.

1013
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,120
Is that very famously the orcas,

1014
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,160
seagull, this is the Mission Bay of San Diego

1015
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
and seagulls are everywhere or whatever.

1016
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,560
And famously, seagulls would land on the orca pool

1017
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,880
and the orcas being the apex predator of the ocean

1018
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,360
would eat them.

1019
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,960
And, but I never personally got to see this,

1020
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,000
but people would say that they would see it relatively often

1021
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,520
where not only would they eat the seagulls,

1022
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,320
but they would kind of like play with them

1023
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,440
and toy with them like a cat,

1024
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,960
but with a mouse before finally putting them

1025
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,120
out of their misery.

1026
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,960
And they would grab them by their feet, you know,

1027
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,800
you can imagine a seagull kind of like with its swimming,

1028
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,560
swimming calm on the surface,

1029
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,960
but underneath their little feats are moving quite a bit.

1030
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,960
And an orca would grab the feet and then pull it down

1031
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,920
and kind of bring it almost to the point of drowning

1032
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,280
and then pop it back up and kind of toy with it.

1033
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,120
Right.

1034
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,400
And then ultimately eat it.

1035
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,080
So that is definitely something that corroborated

1036
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,600
people would say would happen.

1037
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,240
This next part of it is something that only was kind of

1038
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,560
happened in lore.

1039
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,480
Okay.

1040
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,680
But so.

1041
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,600
No lawsuits.

1042
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,760
Oh yeah, is that something that.

1043
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,600
I don't know.

1044
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,440
It's different.

1045
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,840
For the first time ever I am worried

1046
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,400
after where we've landed.

1047
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,600
I'll just say hard to put that on a t-shirt, you know.

1048
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,520
Hard to put.

1049
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,800
They play with them before they kill them.

1050
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,880
Yeah.

1051
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,920
Yeah, holograms were very popular in the 90s.

1052
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,760
It's like, look, the seagull disappeared.

1053
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,600
Where does it go?

1054
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,520
So being Anheuser-Busch,

1055
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,360
there is a very patriotic streak to the orca shows.

1056
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,360
And in particular at every show, this was 2004,

1057
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,520
or sorry, 2005, they would still play.

1058
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,000
If you guys remember that Super Bowl commercial

1059
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,160
that Anheuser-Busch did, that was kind of a retelling

1060
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,320
of a real thing that happened when troops came back

1061
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,720
from Afghanistan or Iraq where some troops came back

1062
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,720
to like a civilian airport and still had their uniforms on.

1063
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,360
And everyone in the airport stood and applauded for them.

1064
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,720
That's like kind of like a story.

1065
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,840
It was like a new story that happened.

1066
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,240
And then for the Super Bowl in 2002 or 2003,

1067
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,760
Anheuser-Busch did an ad where they kind of recreated that.

1068
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,040
And it's a very like effective,

1069
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,160
like kind of tear-jerking thing.

1070
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,600
It's just everybody seeing the soldiers just kind of

1071
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,920
like humbly getting off the plane and everybody stands.

1072
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,680
And it's like a really like lovely,

1073
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,000
like affecting patriotic moment.

1074
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,480
And then that happens and then just Anheuser-Busch logo

1075
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,320
just comes up.

1076
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,480
They're taking that moment for themselves.

1077
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,040
Yes, burnishing the brand.

1078
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,640
Everything is just to make it.

1079
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,000
So if you think of that, think of us.

1080
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,040
Yeah, yeah.

1081
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,000
We essentially did it.

1082
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,440
Right, basically.

1083
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,280
We came home.

1084
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,400
So they would play that at every orca show,

1085
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,760
at every Shamu show.

1086
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,600
Come on.

1087
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,240
They would say like, and we wanna,

1088
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,720
welcome to the Shamu show and we wanna thank

1089
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
our members who are in service,

1090
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,360
our service members who are here today.

1091
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,720
And they would play this commercial

1092
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,880
before every Shamu show.

1093
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,720
Oh my God.

1094
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,760
So if you don't like the show you're about to see,

1095
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,080
that is like spitting in the face of the troops.

1096
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,920
Exactly.

1097
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,480
So then that's what we,

1098
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,760
that's what the orcas are here to do.

1099
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,840
Is they're essentially part of the military or whatever.

1100
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,560
They're basically, yeah, yeah.

1101
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,080
They're the seabaring arm of.

1102
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,680
Those were the brave men who killed

1103
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,840
Pat Tillman and Chris Kyle, okay?

1104
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,560
Show them some respect for this beer commercial.

1105
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,240
Thank you for saying that.

1106
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,080
Yeah.

1107
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,760
So they would, and then for the later shows,

1108
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,840
they would kind of go even further.

1109
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,320
At one of the late night, like the, or not late night,

1110
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,480
like kind of the prime time ones,

1111
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,600
they would do something where the one of the trainers

1112
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,960
would ride Shamu around the tank

1113
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,360
and while riding Shamu plant an American flag

1114
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,720
on the back of Shamu.

1115
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,560
No.

1116
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,400
In the hole?

1117
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,240
No, just.

1118
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,440
It's like implied that it's in the hole.

1119
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,280
Come on.

1120
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,840
But it could have been in the hole.

1121
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,240
Probably what most spectators thought.

1122
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,320
That's what it's kind of seeming as if.

1123
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,320
An implied hole.

1124
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,600
Into the hole.

1125
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,880
But they're not just stabbing though.

1126
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,040
No, like, I mean, you know, you watch it close,

1127
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,160
they're gracefully just kind of like kneeling.

1128
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay.

1129
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,600
On the orca, on Shamu, taking a fluttering American flag

1130
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,320
and planting it on the back of Shamu

1131
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,280
and doing a lap or two while,

1132
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,560
like red, white and blue goes, whatever.

1133
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,400
Okay.

1134
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,200
You know what I'm saying, San Diego's also a military town.

1135
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,360
Yeah, sure, sure.

1136
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,480
Top Guns.

1137
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,320
Right, exactly.

1138
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,600
This is for the Top Gun people.

1139
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,760
So. Oh my God.

1140
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,600
That all, again, all things that happened corroborated.

1141
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,880
Now this is the legend, which is that at one of these things,

1142
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,880
what they used to do was have an eagle, a bald eagle,

1143
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,280
a trained bald eagle soar over the tank

1144
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,800
at like kind of the crescendo of the patriotic moment.

1145
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,400
Maybe you see where this is going.

1146
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,720
And the legend is that the eagle, the bald eagle,

1147
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,520
the glorious bald eagle flew a little too close to the tank

1148
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,080
and one of the orcas leaped up and ate it.

1149
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,760
Took him into his mouth.

1150
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,600
Oh.

1151
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,680
The greatest moment in American history.

1152
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,640
People probably thought that was part of it.

1153
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,600
It was incredible.

1154
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,200
They're like, yeah, okay, all right.

1155
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,920
And now the eagle is within us.

1156
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,760
Yeah.

1157
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
Maybe they thought like the whale would go somewhere else

1158
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,200
and then like open the mouth and the eagle would fly out.

1159
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,440
And they're like, okay, it must, this is a theme park.

1160
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,680
This is not real.

1161
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,440
Proud Shamu, chomp that bald eagle down.

1162
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,880
Suck, oh, hang on.

1163
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,200
That's never happened.

1164
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,040
All right.

1165
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,320
Proud to be an American.

1166
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,160
Rawr.

1167
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,600
Oh, and like, and also it's like far enough away,

1168
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,440
I feel you'd be like, wait.

1169
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,280
What was that?

1170
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,320
Everyone is kind of like leans forward.

1171
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,360
Like, wait a minute, what was that?

1172
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,160
That artist who drew all the rainforest t-shirts

1173
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,760
and the Joe Camel ads gets an assignment,

1174
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,320
gets an assignment in his mail.

1175
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,600
And he's like, Shamu eating eagle.

1176
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,440
I don't even know how to.

1177
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,720
Shamu mid eagle chomp.

1178
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,960
Mid eagle, I don't know.

1179
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,800
Is he, is the eagle supposed to?

1180
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,320
Who's the client on this one?

1181
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,480
They look like they're in pain

1182
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,520
or should it look like it's a death they couldn't even feel.

1183
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,760
Everyone's meaning to do this.

1184
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,080
Should it look like everything?

1185
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,840
Everyone's meaning to do this.

1186
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,400
I mean, the true disappointment has to be

1187
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,320
that they couldn't make it happen every show.

1188
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,120
They only had so many eagles.

1189
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,680
Bald eagles are expensive.

1190
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,040
Maybe, yeah, look, seagulls are dime a dozen, but.

1191
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,160
The people in charge of SeaWorld,

1192
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,920
it seems like morally they'd be like, you know what?

1193
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,120
That was bad, but kind of cool.

1194
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,520
Maybe we'd do it every time.

1195
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,600
Maybe.

1196
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,400
They'd ran a feasibility study

1197
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,960
of how can we make this happen.

1198
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,320
That's a better finish for the show.

1199
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,160
Everybody would want to see that.

1200
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,680
I want to, don't you wish you were there?

1201
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,640
Sure, yeah, and hey, extra cases all around.

1202
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,480
We're celebrating.

1203
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,680
This is lightning in a bottle, folks.

1204
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,120
The whale eats the bird.

1205
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,760
They did also, I keep forgetting to mention,

1206
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,040
they did have a Clydesdale beer garden.

1207
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,920
They had Clydesdales in SeaWorld at the time.

1208
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,640
Oh, I remember that in theme parks.

1209
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah, any of the other bush parks.

1210
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,520
They didn't station us at the Clydesdales

1211
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,120
to give Clydesdale facts, but.

1212
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,160
Didn't they ever eat any?

1213
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,000
The horses.

1214
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,440
The massive beasts.

1215
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,360
Just kids, just guests.

1216
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,920
Did they ever send a horse off a giant diving board

1217
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,760
at SeaWorld?

1218
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,320
Oh, like in the Perry Mason,

1219
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,760
like they were just talking about in Perry Mason.

1220
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,240
I don't know, it feels like in the early days,

1221
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,400
they must have done it. I didn't see anything.

1222
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,760
Because that was like a common old thing

1223
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,240
that they used to do. Yeah.

1224
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,480
But it feels like SeaWorld's opening year,

1225
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,600
they've tried stuff out.

1226
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1227
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,320
Yeah, nobody was documenting it,

1228
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,800
so you didn't know what happened.

1229
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,200
The only way to make it cooler is if they could launch,

1230
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,120
if a Clydesdale could jump off a ramp,

1231
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,440
it itself eat a bald eagle.

1232
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,120
Oh, yeah. And then Shamu eats the whole Clydesdale.

1233
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,840
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1234
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,520
That would have been the thing to strive for.

1235
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,520
I mean, basically the second Meg, Meg 2 trailer.

1236
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,080
Oh, really?

1237
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,760
A dinosaur eats another dinosaur

1238
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,560
and then gets eaten by a Meg.

1239
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,800
Wow, wow.

1240
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,440
Do you think SeaWorld is looked into trying to breed Megs?

1241
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,120
Oh, yeah. Yes.

1242
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,920
Orcas off the table, but get the Megs going.

1243
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,560
There's no regulations on that.

1244
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,080
These movies are real big.

1245
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,040
There has to be like BD Wong's character

1246
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,720
from Jurassic World in SeaWorld,

1247
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,760
as far as like a geneticist

1248
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,160
who's trying to figure things out.

1249
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,760
And like maybe if you can,

1250
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,600
maybe to get around all the moral issues,

1251
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,720
you just breed whales that don't feel anything.

1252
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,080
Right. They don't feel emotions.

1253
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,320
They don't have like pain receptors.

1254
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,840
And then that's the way you get around it.

1255
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,680
That makes a lot of sense.

1256
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,360
Isn't that what Deep Blue Sea was?

1257
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,400
Didn't they, they were trying to make smarter sharks.

1258
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1259
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,800
So they could make the sharks do tricks.

1260
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,040
Right, right.

1261
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,600
And so the sharks could show up,

1262
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,400
could like pop up at specifically very shocking times.

1263
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,240
Yes, exactly.

1264
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,280
Like these sharks are so smart,

1265
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,680
they can interrupt a monologue.

1266
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,520
They can.

1267
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,280
Somebody thinks they're gonna survive, yeah.

1268
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,560
Whoever's doing this genetic stuff

1269
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,080
is probably working on two projects.

1270
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,560
One for the military, one for theme parks.

1271
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,400
Yeah.

1272
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,240
Same, but it's basically the same concept of like.

1273
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
That's one for you, one for them.

1274
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,680
Right, we control them.

1275
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,080
One of them kills, one of them puts on a fun little show.

1276
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,800
That is most of, I think, the Jurassic Park movies

1277
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,880
and also most of Michael Crichton's bibliography.

1278
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,720
Yeah, it's true.

1279
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,560
That is very true.

1280
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,240
And yeah, one for the military, one for little treats.

1281
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,120
Right, we have one.

1282
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,440
One shark can like turn into,

1283
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,000
have human legs spring out and run on land

1284
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,520
and eat a bunch of people.

1285
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,120
And then another shark can sing rock-o-pella.

1286
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,960
Yeah.

1287
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,000
Can sing in a perfect harmony with other sharks.

1288
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,160
They're working on a lot of things, I bet.

1289
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,960
I would certainly prefer the touring iteration

1290
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,520
of rock-o-pella that has a singing shark in it.

1291
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,360
Yeah, oh yeah.

1292
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,160
I don't think I'd ever go see the all-human again.

1293
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,200
Maybe, yeah, maybe you would just want one shark

1294
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,560
on the rock-o-pella team too.

1295
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,360
An all-human and then a shark.

1296
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,400
Pops them.

1297
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,560
Do up.

1298
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,840
Chomp it, rock-o-pella.

1299
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,680
Yeah.

1300
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,520
Yeah.

1301
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,360
Yeah.

1302
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,200
Yeah.

1303
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,920
Do they wear straw hats, rock-o-pella,

1304
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,760
or are they too cool for that?

1305
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,840
The shark does, yeah.

1306
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,680
The shark does.

1307
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,520
Oh, the shark does.

1308
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,800
Yeah, he'll wear whatever, if you breed him right,

1309
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,800
he'll wear whatever you want.

1310
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,640
Yeah, yeah.

1311
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,640
Well, and you teach a shark to burp out the big red fedora.

1312
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,480
Mm.

1313
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,320
Oh, that's good.

1314
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,160
At the end of the show.

1315
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,440
Right onto the head of the one who's, where's my hat?

1316
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,680
And folks, don't worry, we don't have to worry

1317
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,840
about Carmen Sandiego anymore.

1318
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,840
Chomp it, you got her.

1319
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,120
She's dead.

1320
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,960
She did.

1321
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,560
Oh, it's her fedora, I see.

1322
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,440
Okay, or it could be the pesky rock-o-pella guy.

1323
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,240
Yeah, the one trying to unionize the rock-o-pella gang.

1324
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,080
Yeah.

1325
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,240
Chomp he got to.

1326
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,000
Yeah, yeah, the shark on rock-o-pella is a union buster.

1327
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,840
Yeah, it's a pinkerton.

1328
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,760
It'll go right to management and get rid of the one

1329
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,360
who's causing trouble and trying to unionize rock-o-pella.

1330
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,320
They sent the shark to that Magic the Gathering YouTuber,

1331
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,720
the one who would like, God, did you hear about this?

1332
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,560
No, no.

1333
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,400
Oh, this.

1334
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,240
I know what you're talking about.

1335
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,640
A YouTuber was reviewing a new deck of Magic

1336
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,120
the Gathering stuff, and Wizards of the Coast sent security

1337
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,840
to go like, how did you get ahold of that?

1338
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,960
Wasn't released yet.

1339
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,800
Oh.

1340
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,480
And they sent the pinkertons.

1341
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,240
Read this was like very recently?

1342
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,440
In the last month.

1343
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,280
Wow.

1344
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,100
Yeah.

1345
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,040
Jeez.

1346
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,360
There was a, did Nintendo, somebody stole some software

1347
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,000
and Nintendo was making them like.

1348
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,880
Bowser.

1349
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,480
Pay all of their money.

1350
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,160
I think his name was like.

1351
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,120
No, Doug Bowser is the man now in charge.

1352
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,960
Oh, right.

1353
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,800
That's different.

1354
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,620
Reggie, I believe.

1355
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,460
But I think the guy also had a weird name.

1356
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,880
There's a guy named Doug Bowser.

1357
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,720
Works at Nintendo now.

1358
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,560
Really?

1359
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,400
His name is Doug Bowser.

1360
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,280
Yes, yes.

1361
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,560
But Nintendo's like making people pay.

1362
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,560
There's somebody did something that's against the rules

1363
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,280
and like, they're like making this person pay

1364
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,320
the rest of their like salary to Nintendo

1365
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,200
for the rest, like 10 years or the rest of their life

1366
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,040
or something.

1367
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,600
Garnish his wages for the rest of his living.

1368
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,360
But he has to still work there.

1369
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,080
No, he doesn't work at Nintendo, I don't think.

1370
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:39,920
No, he just.

1371
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,520
He just wronged them so severely

1372
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,960
that he owes them for life.

1373
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,000
Yeah, and I don't know if they like modded the,

1374
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,320
I don't remember, it didn't seem like a big deal to me.

1375
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,160
No.

1376
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,000
Whatever it was.

1377
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,820
These are games we're talking about.

1378
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,040
We're talking about children's games.

1379
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1380
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,480
Need to ruin a life.

1381
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,000
My God, wow.

1382
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,760
This is, what a place.

1383
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,280
So now, so if you guys are up for it,

1384
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,320
I can now take you to the deepest depths of my experience.

1385
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,920
Oh no, we're not there yet.

1386
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,760
Oh my God.

1387
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,600
Made country.

1388
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,680
You slowly lured us from in the shark cage.

1389
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,040
We're getting used to the pressure down here.

1390
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:14,880
All right.

1391
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,840
All the way to the floor zero.

1392
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,960
Okay, so Max, Max Gis Lane.

1393
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,800
There's a little island in Sea World.

1394
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,800
No, Robert Gis Lane had a beef with his neighbor.

1395
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,960
They're secret, they're secret Maxwells

1396
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,600
who live under the sea.

1397
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,640
They're too grotesque to live up with us.

1398
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,440
Sea World, Little St. James opened.

1399
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,080
A little black book.

1400
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,080
A little black and white book of orcas.

1401
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,440
So, okay.

1402
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,160
So here's a story of what happened to me personally,

1403
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,640
which so I think that that is like legally okay, right?

1404
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,840
If I say that, that like I would say this.

1405
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,840
Sure, yeah, yeah, it happens.

1406
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,640
I experienced this, so I can't be sued for it.

1407
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:02,040
So there's a lot of weird stuff that happens at,

1408
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,040
you know, an oceanarium within,

1409
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,440
with the animals themselves.

1410
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,560
And I bet this similar stuff happens at zoos

1411
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,360
and any place where you keep animals in captivity.

1412
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,080
And you know, I'm not a big animal liberation guy

1413
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:14,900
by any means.

1414
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,640
I like an aquarium, I like a zoo, I like all those things.

1415
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,400
But you do have to admit that probably some

1416
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,480
of the higher order mammals,

1417
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,040
they're not having the best time.

1418
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,880
Sure. Seems like it.

1419
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,880
And so one common thing that happens is

1420
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,280
that the animals are all, they get horny.

1421
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,000
They get horny for each other.

1422
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,320
And so you kind of, you'll see this very often.

1423
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,000
I would see it at the, one of the dolphin exhibits,

1424
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,440
the commerce and dolphins,

1425
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,700
which are kind of like black and white spotted,

1426
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,880
similar to orcas, but they're smaller, they're cool.

1427
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,420
This was near the journey to Atlantis ride.

1428
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,200
We haven't even talked about the rides at SeaWorld.

1429
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,040
Sorry, guys.

1430
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,880
Who needs them?

1431
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,960
I'm deleting all of this from the notes.

1432
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,320
This is all, this is, we're doing this.

1433
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,600
So, but you would often see them pop little erections

1434
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,160
and chase each other around.

1435
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,060
And it kind of felt like a little bit like, you know,

1436
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,840
those old timey, old timey movies where a lecherous man

1437
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,680
would, you know, just chase the secretary around the.

1438
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,520
Right.

1439
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,340
Benneal.

1440
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,360
Yeah, like a Benneal kind of thing.

1441
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,840
It felt that way a little bit.

1442
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,400
And you know, who knows that the, I,

1443
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,040
they said that they liked it or something.

1444
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,880
I don't know.

1445
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,120
It were whatever they're doing, what you got to do.

1446
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,520
It seems like a bit of an oversimplification.

1447
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,360
Sure.

1448
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,040
Who knows, but animals are being animals.

1449
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:24,880
Sure.

1450
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,600
This place hasn't lied yet, right?

1451
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1452
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,240
So, so the thing that I witnessed happened

1453
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,440
at the manatee exhibit.

1454
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,680
So the manatee exhibit was manatee rescue.

1455
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,880
And it was an exhibit where they had four manatees,

1456
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,160
all of which had been rescued from the waters of Florida.

1457
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,240
All of them had scars from boats, from being hit by boats.

1458
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,600
And all like one of them was in particular,

1459
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,840
what had mostly lost its tail.

1460
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,820
It was kind of the runt of the four.

1461
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,820
And so the, so the exhibit, the manatees,

1462
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,560
because there were so many being rescued,

1463
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,720
again, this is all what they told us.

1464
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,440
So I don't know if it's true.

1465
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,800
The manatees were, who were being rescued,

1466
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,480
outnumbered the number that they could hold in captivity.

1467
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,560
So they had a breeding hold on all manatees in captivity.

1468
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,680
So to facilitate that,

1469
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,280
they would just have single sex habitats.

1470
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,600
So all four of these manatees were male.

1471
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,680
And I sort of noticed during the summer,

1472
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,200
there's like late nights at Sea World.

1473
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,760
And kind of later on, there would be fewer people

1474
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,360
and the animals would start acting a little bit stranger.

1475
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,020
And so one strange thing I witnessed one night, for example,

1476
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,580
was manatees famously, or famously,

1477
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,820
something interesting about manatees

1478
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,880
is they're actually most closely related to elephants

1479
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,280
than any other, than a marine animal.

1480
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,020
If you kind of do like an X-ray of their flippers,

1481
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,720
you can kind of see like an elephant kind of foot

1482
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,780
type of thing if you squished it down,

1483
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,740
if it adapted by squishing it, it's fin,

1484
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,160
it's elephant foot down.

1485
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,860
They also are the only marine mammals that are strict,

1486
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:56,900
that are vegetarian.

1487
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,580
They only eat plants.

1488
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,660
And so at Sea World, they would just feed them

1489
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,540
like huge heads of lettuce.

1490
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,940
They would just throw big heads of lettuce in

1491
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,420
and that's what they would eat.

1492
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,740
At Epcot too, I've witnessed.

1493
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,580
Oh really?

1494
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,260
They have a couple of rescued manatees

1495
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,940
that are, they're not in great shape.

1496
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,780
Little Joe?

1497
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,620
Yeah, Little Joe.

1498
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,460
Yeah.

1499
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,300
Oh wow, you know them.

1500
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,140
I know Little Joe, yeah.

1501
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,260
Well you know, and so yeah they.

1502
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,100
We've seen them.

1503
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:20,940
Celebrity.

1504
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,500
They have them on stage and all, on stage quote unquote,

1505
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,660
but it's just tanks.

1506
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,300
They don't make them do anything,

1507
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,300
but they're always throwing them stalks of lettuce.

1508
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,140
Yeah, totally.

1509
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,440
So if you get there during feeding time,

1510
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,400
they're just going hog wild on the lettuce.

1511
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,600
So one night I went,

1512
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,120
this is one of those like disturbing images

1513
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,200
that like I have in my mind.

1514
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,520
The, I came in, no one was really there, a few people,

1515
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,180
but all the manatees were together.

1516
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,160
They were all floating down to the bottom of the tank,

1517
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,920
chewing sand.

1518
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,840
And that's another thing about manatees is they chew.

1519
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,440
They're the only marine mammal that chews.

1520
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,560
It's like they have a bunch of molars and they like,

1521
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,500
they chew.

1522
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,960
So they were going down to the bottom of the tank,

1523
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,000
getting heaping mouthfuls of sand

1524
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,400
and chewing it as they rose to the top

1525
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,800
and then vomiting just bright green.

1526
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,280
Just like the water was like flooded with bright green,

1527
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,280
which I assumed was lettuce being,

1528
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,480
yeah, or algae or something being regurgitated,

1529
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,760
but they were all doing it, which was very odd.

1530
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,840
So that was one, that was a manatee evening.

1531
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,080
And then now what I'll tell you is another manatee evening.

1532
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,760
So I went one night to my manatee exhibit.

1533
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,680
Are you alone?

1534
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,760
This is, I believe it's just you and.

1535
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,120
Yeah, you're the only person in the park.

1536
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,440
So it felt that way.

1537
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,880
I would, I was 19.

1538
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,360
And if you're bored, we didn't have,

1539
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,240
we had cell phones and we didn't have smartphones

1540
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,120
or anything like that.

1541
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,200
So the thing I would do to kind of occupy myself

1542
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,480
is I would have little Olympics at every exhibit where like,

1543
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,120
oh, I'm gonna try to jump and hit this beam

1544
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,200
and have a little long jump at the shark exhibit

1545
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,880
where a bridge was this long

1546
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,520
and try to jump at the whole bridge.

1547
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,760
And I would do that kind of, whatever,

1548
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,880
just to occupy myself as a teen boy.

1549
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,840
So I was doing my manatee exhibit Olympics

1550
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,000
of like a high jump of trying to hit the beams.

1551
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,840
And I.

1552
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,440
Hey there, Scott here.

1553
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,000
At this point in the conversation,

1554
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,520
Matt's story took a somewhat uncomfortable turn

1555
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,720
and we at Podcast the Ride made an executive decision

1556
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,960
to censor the story in our tried and true method

1557
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,920
pioneered a few years ago by Evan Susser.

1558
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,480
And I started to notice that one of the larger,

1559
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,800
the largest manatee got.

1560
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,040
The moves like birds, you get the moves like birds.

1561
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,880
Hail.

1562
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,640
And the thing about manatees is they're.

1563
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,840
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move,

1564
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,880
slides back.

1565
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,400
So the big manatee was very slow.

1566
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,080
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move.

1567
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,760
And it was very clear to me, I mean,

1568
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,520
it seemed to me any, you know, cognizant, you know,

1569
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,720
living person or thing would know that

1570
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,880
the two other manatees on the other side started.

1571
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,720
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move.

1572
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,880
And then they each.

1573
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,720
Slides back.

1574
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,280
Wow.

1575
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,720
Uncute and I am supposed to like.

1576
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,160
And I was just dumbstruck.

1577
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,920
Just, this is crazy.

1578
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,920
This is, I'm not, this is gonna stick with me

1579
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,520
for the rest of this day.

1580
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,160
But as a 19 year old, I may not have been able

1581
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,880
to get out of bed for two days.

1582
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,920
Yeah, that might be a God has abandoned us sort of moment.

1583
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,160
Yeah, I may have just denounced.

1584
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,000
At least in David Cronenberg, either David or the son

1585
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,920
got in a moment.

1586
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,760
Yeah.

1587
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,560
This is what the world is capable of.

1588
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,760
I mean, in a way, this is why I needed to come here

1589
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,880
to bear witness to this.

1590
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,720
Sure.

1591
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,560
I could finally release it.

1592
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,320
You've been carrying this around for a long time.

1593
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,000
Also SeaWorld is canceled.

1594
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,320
Now officially, I say.

1595
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1596
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,840
So that's why, that's what I wanted to see.

1597
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,760
Once you heard my testimony, what do you believe now?

1598
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,960
You suddenly kicked it over the, like a, you know,

1599
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,320
a whale or a seal nudging a ball into a tank.

1600
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,000
It is, you have nudged it fully into the canceled tank.

1601
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,520
I'm going to be able to hold the whole ocean

1602
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,360
after I hear this.

1603
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,440
Well, but so let me say a few things.

1604
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,280
Okay, sure.

1605
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,120
Go ahead.

1606
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,200
Like not, you know, unlike an orca,

1607
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,080
perhaps it's not all black and white.

1608
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:04,920
Okay.

1609
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,920
SeaWorld does have an extensive sea lion

1610
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,440
and seal rescue program in San Diego.

1611
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,240
At every beach where you see seals and sea lions,

1612
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,600
there's a phone number that you call

1613
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,360
if you see one in distress.

1614
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,400
And as far as I know, this is a reputable and good program

1615
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,800
where if you see a sea lion with like plastic bag

1616
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,120
or something like that, they have people on call all the time

1617
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,760
who will come and help seals and sea lions.

1618
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,640
They also have some sort of research institute there.

1619
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,560
They do do, they do function as, you know,

1620
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,720
an education sort of institution in the way that a zoo does.

1621
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,520
I'm sure the Institute and the rescue people

1622
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,240
are happy to be following that story.

1623
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,200
I just, I just don't, you know, I don't want.

1624
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,640
Now you guys are in.

1625
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,920
You know, as I'm here, you know, canceling SeaWorld

1626
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,800
or re-canceling SeaWorld or, or I just, to me,

1627
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,000
it's complicated feelings.

1628
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,640
Cause also this was an important, you know,

1629
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,040
this is a seminal time in my life.

1630
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,280
This is when I was 19.

1631
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,120
Yes.

1632
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,560
You are also human with a sense of morality

1633
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,960
that animals that not operating at that level of brain power,

1634
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,480
they don't have any necessarily sense of right and wrong.

1635
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,320
That's right.

1636
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,320
But the question is, would that behavior happen in the wild?

1637
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,160
Right.

1638
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,720
Or are they driven insane by being in the tanks

1639
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,040
next to the Dippin' Dots?

1640
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,880
Right.

1641
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,720
You know?

1642
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,200
I'm hearing the same music over and over and over.

1643
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,520
Hearing the same idiots yammering on a microphone

1644
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,480
through their like garbled water.

1645
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,320
Yeah.

1646
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,600
They're really murmuring to each other.

1647
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,680
This guy thinks he's so,

1648
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,480
cause he's got an hour of material.

1649
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,840
I don't want this one to shut the fuck up.

1650
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,480
Usually they give us at least some similar.

1651
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,160
I like that guy who just points to the pictures.

1652
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,840
Dan Van had an hour of standup,

1653
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,800
you had an hour of facts about marine biology.

1654
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,280
Yeah.

1655
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,920
This is kind of a big question I had with SeaWorld

1656
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,000
in the last decade or so.

1657
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,520
He's just, I was always like,

1658
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,360
man, they are really building a lot of roller coasters.

1659
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,720
They are really leaning into the roller coasters.

1660
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,560
And certainly the back at Lash from Blackfish

1661
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,920
would explain that, but also I was like,

1662
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,160
oh yeah, I guess it's occurring to me now.

1663
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,040
Like, yeah, there's probably other weird stuff

1664
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,680
behind the scenes where you mentioned

1665
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,720
they were sold to Anheuser-Busch in 1989.

1666
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,640
And then in 2009, they got sold to Blackstone,

1667
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,320
the investment in private equity group,

1668
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:26,320
which at one point in time owned 50% of Universal Orlando.

1669
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,160
And Universal Orlando bought that out

1670
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,520
for just over a billion dollars in 2011.

1671
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,320
So they fully owned it outright.

1672
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,160
Blackstone-

1673
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,320
We can continue to like them.

1674
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,160
Yeah.

1675
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,520
Unlike the, isn't the Great Wolf Lodge in this family?

1676
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,840
Great Wolf Lodge has some stuff with Blackstone

1677
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,160
cause that came up a lot.

1678
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,520
And then let's see other one, Merlin Entertainment,

1679
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,160
who does the Lego lands and a lot of parks in Europe.

1680
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,680
They're under Blackstone.

1681
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,280
Merlin Entertainment, by the way,

1682
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,040
much better name for a company that owns theme parks

1683
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,000
versus Blackstone.

1684
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,680
Blackstone, yeah.

1685
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,520
Look at Merlin, he's a hooky wizard man, right?

1686
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,360
Blackstone.

1687
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,920
They're trying to, well, SeaWorld is trying to escape

1688
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,480
the shadow of Blackfish.

1689
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,920
So that's why they've partnered with Blackstone.

1690
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,040
Yeah.

1691
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,960
Blackstone, by the way,

1692
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,600
so one of the worst Wikipedia criticism sidebars

1693
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,760
I've ever seen, it just says,

1694
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,120
illegal child labor,

1695
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,480
T-Far station of the Amazon rainforest,

1696
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,200
United Nations condemnation of the Invitation Homes Project

1697
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,520
and lobbying efforts.

1698
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,360
So that just the bad vibes, the vibes on that.

1699
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,520
So it's like, okay, that's who owns SeaWorld now.

1700
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,920
But even they were like, all right, you gotta,

1701
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,320
we're gonna lean more into the roller coasters

1702
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,880
than the little shows.

1703
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,720
Mm-hmm.

1704
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,080
So, and that, so the other thing is,

1705
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,520
I'm a big roller coaster junkie, I love roller coasters.

1706
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,840
And so the fact that there's actually a bunch

1707
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,320
of sick ass roller coasters in my hometown

1708
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,840
also makes me wanna go back.

1709
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,000
I don't know if you had a chance to hit any of the rides

1710
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,080
or anything when you went back to the city.

1711
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,040
Well, yes, so I'm there,

1712
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,840
again, and I'm there before I heard any of what you just said.

1713
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,360
Again, now we have to do all, we did distancing before,

1714
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,760
I'm gonna do distancing now.

1715
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,920
Everyone here, make sure you distance.

1716
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,920
But regardless of any of that, we did kinda hate it.

1717
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,400
I think I was on record,

1718
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,920
I did like a Patreon trip report.

1719
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,840
The Sesame Street Dance Party was nice,

1720
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:24,120
and then from that point on, so hot, no shade,

1721
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,480
didn't feel like seeing, didn't see shows,

1722
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,920
coasters don't work for Kiddo,

1723
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,880
the crazy lines for everything, crazy crap.

1724
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,760
Realized quickly, oh, his favorite attraction today

1725
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,760
has been the hangers for the shirts in the gift store.

1726
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,720
Well, we have those at home.

1727
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,120
And then, I mean, really where I hit the wall,

1728
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,720
hey, the animal stuff, whatever,

1729
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,440
but the bad food, that's where I drew the line.

1730
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,080
I've had this at different theme parks over the years

1731
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,240
where if it's getting into the dinner hour,

1732
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,080
and especially the heat you're feeling

1733
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,520
of having to feed the kid, and you realize,

1734
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,080
oh, all the food here is shit,

1735
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,760
and it's 45 minutes to get the shit,

1736
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,320
and wait, if we leave right now,

1737
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,880
the only food he eats is chicken tenders.

1738
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,720
So we could go to a Ralph's

1739
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,200
and get better, cheaper chicken tenders,

1740
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,880
and not be in SeaWorld anymore.

1741
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,760
So that was the choice we made.

1742
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,200
I gave some consideration to maybe I'll catch a lift

1743
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,400
to meet you guys, I'll go look at Journey to Atlantis,

1744
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,520
because that seems kind of cool.

1745
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,480
The longest line, and there was so much COVID around

1746
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,160
that point, like, do I wanna get COVID,

1747
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,160
or just weird water poisoning somehow

1748
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,720
from all the wet people in this line?

1749
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,600
It's just all like, nope, out, out, tapping out, done.

1750
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,280
So that was my little trip report,

1751
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,480
not dying to go back necessarily.

1752
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,800
So coasters I can't speak to.

1753
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,960
Were any of those there when you were there?

1754
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,960
Only Journey to Atlantis and the Raft Ride were there.

1755
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,000
The Rapids are on?

1756
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,840
What's that?

1757
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,680
The Rapids are on?

1758
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,000
Yeah, the Rapids Ride.

1759
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,160
Journey to Atlantis, I watched a couple ride throughs,

1760
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,800
it's very interesting, because it has a big log flume drop,

1761
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,960
long set up for a short roller coaster, Jackson,

1762
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,920
and then another log flume drop.

1763
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,440
But it's not a shoot to shoot,

1764
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,120
it's listed as a water coaster.

1765
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:22,960
Okay.

1766
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,560
Those melded rides are interesting.

1767
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,760
I think there's one of those at Lotte World

1768
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,600
we just talked about.

1769
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,160
I like the idea of the melding of water ride and coaster,

1770
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,520
but it seems like they don't always pan out the best.

1771
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,640
Like this one scene, I don't know,

1772
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,960
I watched a ride through, like, is it good?

1773
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,800
Did you do it?

1774
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,640
Is it good?

1775
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,480
It's funny, I was like, I swear that it was there

1776
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,120
because I remember the dolphins,

1777
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,920
which are in the Atlantis area,

1778
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,000
and I know I would have done the ride,

1779
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,040
but I didn't really have any sense memory

1780
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,520
of having done it, but I'm pretty sure

1781
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,320
it was open at the time, so I must have gone on it,

1782
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,520
but I have no sense memory of it,

1783
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,000
which indicates to me that it was forgettable

1784
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,400
or that I didn't happen to go on it.

1785
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,280
But I remember, I mean, I definitely went on the Raft Ride

1786
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,120
a bunch.

1787
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:06,960
Sure, sure.

1788
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,800
Forever.

1789
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,160
Those are solid, usually, it's hard to get those.

1790
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,200
I mean, this is also like, I was there at the transition,

1791
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,000
like, it was crazy that they had a roller coaster at all.

1792
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,040
Like, that seemed really strange to us

1793
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,040
because that just wasn't what,

1794
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,680
it was like having a roller coaster at the zoo.

1795
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,400
Like, literally, it would have been like that.

1796
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, kinda strange.

1797
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,560
But I kind of been doing some research

1798
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,240
and watching some videos and stuff.

1799
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,680
It seems like the coasters are pretty solid.

1800
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,040
I don't know, it seems like they've really

1801
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:32,880
been going into them.

1802
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,720
Yeah.

1803
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,400
There was just, a couple days ago,

1804
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,200
as we're recording this, there was a media day

1805
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,960
for a new coaster at SeaWorld in Orlando,

1806
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,640
like a stand-up surfing-themed coaster.

1807
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,880
So, like, they're pumping them out,

1808
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,000
and there's Arctic Rescue, which is like,

1809
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,320
a snowmobile-themed kind of roller coaster

1810
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,080
is opening soon out here.

1811
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,200
Oh, okay, they had an Arctic,

1812
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,480
they had the Arctic Rescue before.

1813
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,000
I thought that's what it was called.

1814
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,360
But it was a, kind of like a Star Tours kinda thing.

1815
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,200
What do you call those ones?

1816
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,040
Like a simulator?

1817
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,040
A simulator ride, where you simulated

1818
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,040
going down into the Arctic,

1819
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,680
and going to an Arctic station.

1820
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,080
It was kinda cool, because it was,

1821
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,880
you would line up, you would go into a helicopter

1822
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,160
or something, and have a bumpy ride,

1823
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,680
and you would see the polar bears and stuff,

1824
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,560
and then you would land,

1825
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,440
and then you would be at Arctic Station,

1826
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,040
and then that was where all the animals were.

1827
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,360
So you had to do the ride to go see the-

1828
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,680
Oh, it was like a pre-show to a full-

1829
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,280
Yeah, to a full, and to a full exhibit,

1830
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,480
to polar bears and penguins and beluga whales.

1831
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,120
But wait, do they have this now,

1832
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,200
but they aren't running the simulator?

1833
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,520
Or did I just go into it in a way

1834
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,360
where I didn't do the simulator?

1835
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,440
I know it was possible to do without the simulator,

1836
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,400
but you had to plead disability or something like that.

1837
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,440
Or maybe COVID protocol,

1838
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,560
don't lock everybody in a room with that plane.

1839
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,720
Yeah, it's also possible the ride

1840
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,760
just doesn't work anymore or something.

1841
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,600
Well, that's what happened,

1842
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,280
that there was this Mars restaurant in New York.

1843
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,640
Of course, Mars 2121.

1844
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,160
Mars 2121, yeah, we did a whole show about it.

1845
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,160
We sure did, yes, with an audience.

1846
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,760
And people seem to be very fond of it.

1847
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,360
But there was a simulator that got you to Mars

1848
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,960
until the simulator broke and their solution was

1849
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,960
no more simulator.

1850
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,280
That was the classic bit on UCB Herald Night

1851
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,680
was that we're gonna go to Mars,

1852
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,240
get dinner there as a Herald team.

1853
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,080
Oh.

1854
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,840
But my team's never, we always like,

1855
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,120
eh, we don't really wanna do that.

1856
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,640
I have no idea what, just to take a wild stab,

1857
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:37,320
I bet that place was way too expensive for,

1858
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,160
for the bit. Oh, yeah.

1859
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,120
I bet your team ends up racking up,

1860
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,240
like this joke cost us four times

1861
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,280
what a good meal would cost.

1862
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,120
Sure, that's true.

1863
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,360
Just to guess.

1864
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,400
It is funny, cause like, the building of the,

1865
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,080
like, you know, is the Sesame Street fully built now?

1866
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,280
Cause you were there before it was,

1867
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,400
they fully opened like their whole Sesame Street,

1868
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,240
I believe.

1869
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,320
Now, oh, you mean, well, there is now a full other,

1870
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,760
they also own, it used to be a water park called Aquatica,

1871
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,560
now that has become Sesame Place.

1872
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,400
The second Sesame, right.

1873
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,720
And that's open.

1874
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,800
And I remember thinking,

1875
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,560
that seems like a short timeline to convert a,

1876
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,440
whatever it was, to convert a water park into Sesame Street.

1877
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,280
And I talked to somebody who went and they said,

1878
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,600
it seems like they maybe didn't have a lot of time to,

1879
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,920
all right, yes, confirmed.

1880
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:25,760
Okay.

1881
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,760
I heard one not good review,

1882
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,400
but I don't know, maybe people in the audience have been.

1883
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,000
But now, because they think,

1884
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,440
now they think it's redundant to have a little Sesame Street

1885
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,720
in Sea World and that whole other park.

1886
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,280
So they're converting the little Sesame Street.

1887
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,720
So the only thing I went for will soon be gone.

1888
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,560
Okay.

1889
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,440
They're just gonna paint over all the rides

1890
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,680
and they're calling it Rescue Junior,

1891
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,640
which is not a good name.

1892
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,480
No.

1893
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,800
I don't think you, verbs shouldn't get junior.

1894
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,840
Is junior being rescued?

1895
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,160
Like it's an action, like we have to rescue junior?

1896
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,440
No, because it has like a period, it's JR period.

1897
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:06,520
So it is like, it's a junior version of rescuing.

1898
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,280
Kids doing the rescuing.

1899
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,200
But isn't rescue kind of a, that's a concept.

1900
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,120
That's like, it's saying democracy junior.

1901
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,120
But that suggests kids doing democracy.

1902
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,800
Which they should be allowed to do.

1903
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,240
Yes, they should.

1904
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,720
Well, I've advocated for six year olds to be able to vote.

1905
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,240
To do, yeah, democracy junior.

1906
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,640
They've recycled a lot of terms at Sea World.

1907
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:32,680
Did you guys come across the submarine quest ride?

1908
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,520
Yes.

1909
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,560
There's a great defunct plan about this.

1910
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,520
Where it was like, new management took over,

1911
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,240
they were really pumping up this big new area

1912
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,200
and they were gonna put in this ride called submarine quest.

1913
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,160
And this is post, this is a CEO who has the impossible task

1914
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,960
of we have to get, change everybody's notion of Sea World.

1915
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,160
It's so dark, there's been this documentary, what do we do?

1916
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,280
This area is gonna wait till you see,

1917
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,600
prepare to be dazzled.

1918
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,400
And it's like the opposite of,

1919
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,480
we just talked to Rachel Bloom about

1920
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,200
like different fit to not stuff.

1921
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,360
And when nots kinda doubled down,

1922
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,200
the whole Cedar Fair organization of like,

1923
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,520
we gotta get some new dark rides in there.

1924
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,800
We gotta start competing with Disney and Universal.

1925
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,360
We gotta get some rides like that.

1926
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:21,520
Sea World's seemingly less successful.

1927
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,520
It was a submarine ride that was above everything,

1928
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,320
like the people mover is.

1929
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:32,680
And it was supposed to be very dark,

1930
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,760
but it was always sunlight.

1931
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,600
When it was huge.

1932
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,920
It ran in broad daylight.

1933
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,200
And it's just, there's coral above everything

1934
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,680
and there's a bad touch screen in the ride

1935
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,520
and the most annoying.

1936
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,760
That you can't see because it's bright.

1937
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,600
You can't see it.

1938
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,720
All for the, for 80% of the ride.

1939
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,320
There's one or two rooms where it's like,

1940
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,280
you're in, you're underwater.

1941
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,240
Where it's a little better,

1942
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:58,240
but mostly it's just a very shrill robot screaming at you.

1943
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,560
Well, and then that culminates in again,

1944
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,400
all right, so submarine quest.

1945
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,480
Get ready to go below.

1946
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,280
This is the word is submarine.

1947
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,120
They give you literally the opposite.

1948
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,520
You go above and it is dry.

1949
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,440
Yes, yeah, you were in the air.

1950
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,760
Whatever the proper term for that would be.

1951
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,040
And then the finale is this one room

1952
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,600
that where there is, you encounter a big digital octopus

1953
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,800
in a place where you could see a real octopus.

1954
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,640
Yeah.

1955
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,480
And so, ooh, look, I did it.

1956
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,120
And like, oh, you mean, so, but like on a big old screen,

1957
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,320
well spread out over six screens,

1958
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,680
like the one in this room.

1959
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,360
It's spread, you know, like if we put a bunch

1960
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,800
of those together, that's as good as one big screen, right?

1961
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,360
And then you see it briefly

1962
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,560
and then the robot screams at you and you leave.

1963
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,600
And then a jet of water shoots at one person

1964
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,320
out of the six in the car.

1965
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,200
Just like one, you just get hit by a hose blast.

1966
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,880
Only the person in the front right.

1967
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,920
Wasn't even randomized.

1968
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,400
Well, they pick whoever in the car seems the most annoying.

1969
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,240
Yeah, yeah.

1970
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,440
Who's most like the robot on the screen, you know?

1971
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,040
And this is still in operation?

1972
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,240
No, this closed down in like 2018.

1973
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,920
It closed in seven months.

1974
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,560
It closed very quickly.

1975
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,480
So much, but yeah, this is really rare.

1976
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,240
Maybe the most notorious Disney flops are gone really fast,

1977
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,600
but even those are exceedingly rare.

1978
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,240
For something to only make it seven months,

1979
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,160
when it's been picked as like, this is what's this,

1980
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,040
say goodbye documentary, we got a plan.

1981
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,480
And then they're putting out videos

1982
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,680
which Kevin puts in so many of those,

1983
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,200
like the team that's so excited.

1984
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,560
And here's the vehicle.

1985
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,200
Wow, we can't wait to have you.

1986
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,960
And then all this buildup and then it's gone in seven months.

1987
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:39,800
It's gone.

1988
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,480
This was a video, the video about it,

1989
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,400
the defunct lane about it was one that I was like hitting

1990
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,080
the 10 seconds back a lot.

1991
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,640
I was like, no, that can't be right.

1992
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,920
That absolutely can't be right.

1993
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,600
Because they're also open these giant blockbuster,

1994
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,040
well-received roller coasters.

1995
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:02,040
They also, the ride submarine quest is in a,

1996
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,240
not a land, but a realm.

1997
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,400
It's in their new realm.

1998
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,960
It's SeaWorld's new realm, Ocean Explorer.

1999
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,840
You know, so the way Disneyland has fantasy land

2000
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,400
and tomorrow land here, their realm is called Ocean Explorer.

2001
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,520
So a lot of people, there's even like,

2002
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,480
there was some press thing where somebody works

2003
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,720
with a company like, so tell us about your new ride,

2004
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,920
Ocean Explorer.

2005
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,400
And the guys to go, well, our new realm, Ocean Explorer

2006
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,880
is opening with a ride submarine quest.

2007
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,360
But Ocean Explorer sounds like the name of a ride

2008
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,040
and what they opened could have been called Ocean Explorer.

2009
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,000
So that does not negate what it was

2010
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,720
as opposed to submarine quest,

2011
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,040
which is the opposite of what it is.

2012
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,920
Realm is a fantastical sounding word as well.

2013
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,720
One of the cool, imagine if you could actually access a realm.

2014
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,880
Yeah, Merlin knows about realms,

2015
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,680
but like practical, real animals.

2016
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,480
Coin of the realm.

2017
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,880
Yeah.

2018
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,840
That's exciting.

2019
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,200
And yet in this case, a realm is just where you like,

2020
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,560
it's just a realistic, it's got a swing ride.

2021
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,040
That's what's in the realm.

2022
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,720
The swing ride appeared to be the best received

2023
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,440
in the realm.

2024
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,960
Better than the marquee attraction.

2025
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:15,800
Yeah.

2026
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,360
So they took down almost immediately

2027
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,160
and then had CEO quit.

2028
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,920
I just, this was the plan.

2029
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,760
What happened?

2030
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,000
I don't understand.

2031
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,240
I am baffled by, it seems like they had ample junctions

2032
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,240
to fix that ride.

2033
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,080
Yeah, really.

2034
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:29,920
Absolutely.

2035
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,760
Just L after L.

2036
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,840
Like they could have enclosed, that was the other thing.

2037
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,680
These so-called submarines open on the,

2038
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:39,240
really open on each side of the vehicle.

2039
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,360
And like they easily could have like closed them off

2040
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:45,920
and put a screen or done something to save it.

2041
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,160
But I think it was just beyond saving at that point.

2042
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,000
They were all flailing.

2043
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,760
I mean, it feels karmic, right?

2044
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,760
It feels like this was like a karmic time for them

2045
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,560
where everything that they had been doing came back at them.

2046
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,840
Blackfish came out.

2047
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,680
Oh.

2048
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,520
And just kind of a reckoning internally.

2049
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,600
And their PR response to blackfish was terrible.

2050
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,960
Like they kept saying, oh, it's propaganda.

2051
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:06,800
It's propaganda.

2052
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,280
It's like propaganda for what?

2053
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,160
And then there was like a thing where

2054
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,960
there was like an open survey.

2055
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,960
And then they're like, well, out of nearly 400 responses,

2056
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,520
most people said they didn't think it was a problem.

2057
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,560
They didn't think it was bad.

2058
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,840
And then they tracked like nearly 200 of those responses

2059
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,960
to a SeaWorld IP address.

2060
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:28,800
What?

2061
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,000
Which they then doubled down on.

2062
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,760
It's like, well, that was employees coming up

2063
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,320
and using this computer to express their pleasure.

2064
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,000
That was the, they just kept doing

2065
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,280
the worst crisis PR you've ever seen.

2066
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,480
200 educators indicated they thought everything was fine.

2067
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,320
Yeah.

2068
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,160
Interesting.

2069
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,120
And what's your dog?

2070
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,440
Another educator seemed random to me.

2071
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,600
And these people had,

2072
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,800
for everybody could fill this form out freely.

2073
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,800
There was not a shark hovering above the computer

2074
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,440
ready to be unleashed if what they filled out

2075
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,760
was not someone's liking.

2076
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,600
So I'm trying to remember what it was.

2077
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,760
The most positive stuff they have had

2078
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,360
have been the big roller coasters.

2079
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,720
And then at some seasonal events, they go like,

2080
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,840
okay, we're bringing back the two seven ounce

2081
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,280
pure beer pours for guests.

2082
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,560
We're bringing back the free beer.

2083
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,400
Yeah.

2084
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,220
And people like that.

2085
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:22,060
People love that.

2086
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,720
I think Bush Garden started doing that too sometimes.

2087
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:26,840
Just giving people free beer.

2088
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,960
Just that was a thing.

2089
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,120
They're like that we by popular demand,

2090
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,760
we brought back the free beer.

2091
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,120
If I had found an easier way to get beer

2092
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,780
without standing in a giant line,

2093
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,120
maybe I would have stuck it out.

2094
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,760
Maybe I wouldn't have complained about it

2095
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,440
on this than on a previous episode.

2096
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,400
You needed to be loaded.

2097
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,240
Yeah, yeah.

2098
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,720
That was your secret there.

2099
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,560
You would think like,

2100
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,520
cause every time you mix theme park and animal,

2101
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,360
never good.

2102
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:57,160
Almost everyone, there's famously at least some stories

2103
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,520
about something bad happening

2104
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,360
at the very least at the start of the endeavor.

2105
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,640
This one specifically continued for a long time.

2106
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,720
I don't know what's going on.

2107
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,560
I can't tell you if the people,

2108
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,280
the animals in the tank are happy and the zoo.

2109
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,280
I don't know.

2110
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,120
Yeah.

2111
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,520
I don't know if animal kingdom animals are happy.

2112
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,360
You know what I mean?

2113
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,480
They're all mixed together in a way that is ungodly,

2114
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,520
essential they're together.

2115
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,640
But seemingly it's okay right now.

2116
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,720
But I would think the SeaWorld people would like,

2117
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,760
once Blackfish was introduced,

2118
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,240
they all sat down and they're like,

2119
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,160
well, we had a good run.

2120
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,000
Let them go.

2121
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,920
We know, let's turn the key.

2122
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,920
We have all the rides ready to go.

2123
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,800
Time to close up the fish shop.

2124
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,000
It feels like they are though.

2125
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,720
They're phasing to being just like a roller coaster ride.

2126
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,560
Yeah.

2127
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,640
I guess, but again,

2128
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,000
the people who love those animals the most

2129
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,360
are the trainers.

2130
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,480
They've sure, that was who I was working with

2131
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,160
were people who, it was their childhood dream

2132
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,760
to become a dolphin trainer.

2133
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,200
They love the dolphins.

2134
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,760
They just wanted to know everything about them.

2135
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,120
They wanted to work with them.

2136
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,720
I'm sure that that's kind of an incredible,

2137
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,040
honestly then they were gods,

2138
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,480
because they weren't, there wasn't this Paul,

2139
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,720
there wasn't this sense that maybe what you were doing

2140
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,560
was wrong.

2141
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,320
Instead just to be a dolphin trainer.

2142
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,960
I mean, you would look at kids watching the trainers

2143
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,160
when they would come out and stuff after a show,

2144
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,200
the kids would swamp them for autographs

2145
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,120
and stuff like that.

2146
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:26,960
Sure.

2147
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,760
And yet you didn't ultimately take the next step.

2148
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,520
Your journey stopped at Educator.

2149
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,360
It did.

2150
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,400
Yeah, yeah.

2151
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,840
So this is a story that when I was thinking about

2152
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,360
coming here, this is not as big as the things

2153
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,120
that I'd said before, but for me,

2154
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:47,640
I re-looked at an event that happened in a new light.

2155
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,480
And it was, you know those moments in your life

2156
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,960
where you're like, oh, I wish I had done this differently.

2157
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,360
Like, damn it, had I just done that thing,

2158
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,920
everything would be different.

2159
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,840
I had one of those at SeaWorlds

2160
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,760
where there was one of my bosses.

2161
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,160
She was a little older.

2162
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,200
You know, I was 19, I was a single man

2163
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:12,200
and I had a strong crush on this educator manager.

2164
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,920
She, I was from a SoCal boy and she was from,

2165
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,320
I believe Buffalo.

2166
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:21,200
And she had like a raspy Buffalo voice that I found,

2167
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,480
like I just loved, I couldn't get enough of it.

2168
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,320
Sure.

2169
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,560
Anyways, I was always like, ooh, if only,

2170
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,520
maybe I could ask her out.

2171
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,400
I don't know, she's older than me, who knows?

2172
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,360
But one day she was like tasked with shadowing me

2173
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:38,360
at my position and to write up a report on my spiel,

2174
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,280
on my whole thing.

2175
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,160
And I'm like, hell yeah, like it's her, it's me,

2176
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,120
I can do this, I'm gonna show her my hour,

2177
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,320
I'm gonna crush this, like everything's gonna,

2178
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,080
I'm gonna get bumped up, promoted to become one of like

2179
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,280
the big educators and maybe I'll get a date

2180
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,280
out of this whole thing.

2181
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,040
But then they scheduled me at the one exhibit

2182
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,160
that I like never went to because of like a quirk

2183
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,360
of the scheduling.

2184
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,000
I had never developed like an hour or whatever

2185
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,520
for the pinnipets, for the seals and sea lions.

2186
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,040
And that's where they stuck me for this.

2187
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,200
And I kind of like stammered and didn't do a good job

2188
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,040
and I did my best.

2189
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,120
And she, afterwards she was like, hey, you know,

2190
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,440
you're okay, you know.

2191
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,120
And she didn't know that I didn't say like,

2192
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,080
this is my first time here or my second time at this,

2193
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,240
but I didn't say anything, just kind of gave me a B

2194
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,800
and kind of was that, was that.

2195
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,400
And I'd always been like, that was it.

2196
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,840
I could have gotten the girl, I could have gotten the job.

2197
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,920
I mean, now, old, now in my life, looking back,

2198
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,200
like that was not a turn that I wanted my life

2199
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,080
to go down at all.

2200
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,240
Anyway, I love my, I have a beautiful wife and kid

2201
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,320
and I love my life now.

2202
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,080
There's no reason I needed to go with that woman.

2203
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:44,080
I certainly didn't want to work, start going down the path

2204
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,800
of, you know, dropping out of college

2205
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,960
because I could be going on the trainer track

2206
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,760
or something for dolphins.

2207
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,080
Like I don't, I didn't want that.

2208
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:51,920
But I never.

2209
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,320
I'm the person taking peacocks up into a tower

2210
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,160
to drive them.

2211
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,600
It's going to work this time.

2212
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,800
I know, I'm the whisperer.

2213
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,520
It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself

2214
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:03,000
right here that that wasn't the right decision.

2215
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,840
That's all I'm saying.

2216
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,680
Maybe I'm still in the room.

2217
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,080
You don't know, really.

2218
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,520
To your penthouse forum,

2219
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,440
I never thought it would happen to me.

2220
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:16,440
I fucked up my pinniped presentation and lost the girl.

2221
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,080
How much older was she than you?

2222
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,080
Maybe two years.

2223
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,360
But then when you're 19, that's everything.

2224
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,200
That's true.

2225
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,040
Yeah.

2226
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,600
No, it could have been 15 or it could have been one

2227
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,640
in my head.

2228
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,040
Maybe she was like six months older.

2229
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:30,880
Yeah, yeah.

2230
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:31,720
You're like, why?

2231
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,520
She was a sophomore, rising junior.

2232
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,600
Like there's no way.

2233
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,440
You imagine though.

2234
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,080
Seniors in college, when I was in underclassmen,

2235
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,120
I was like, oh man, they've got to figure it out.

2236
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,120
They're real artists.

2237
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,920
They're real adults.

2238
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,000
They're making real work.

2239
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,160
They're making real work.

2240
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,920
Yeah, and then we became seniors.

2241
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,840
And it's like, it's just terrifying.

2242
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,360
I don't want to leave this.

2243
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,440
This lovely crib, this liberal arts crib.

2244
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,280
I don't want to go out into the real world.

2245
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,120
You're a do-gaga.

2246
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:57,960
I don't want to leave.

2247
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,800
You're a do-gaga.

2248
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,000
The bar has the buy a pitcher of beer,

2249
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,520
get a token for another pitcher of beer deal.

2250
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,800
It's unclear how they make any money.

2251
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,000
Does that happen out in the world?

2252
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,840
That doesn't happen.

2253
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,680
What about mozzarella sticks?

2254
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,080
I don't think they had a kitchen,

2255
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,640
but the bill is couple doors down.

2256
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,480
Really?

2257
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:17,480
Wow, okay.

2258
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,640
You could bring stuff over again.

2259
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,800
I believe it was a bring your Jimmy Johns over to that bar.

2260
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,640
Wow.

2261
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,240
Maybe they had a deal with Jimmy John people.

2262
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,400
Jason, this was your peak.

2263
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,400
This was my dear fan house for him.

2264
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,120
I fucked up the sandwich bar.

2265
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,360
You should have stayed in the crib.

2266
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,560
I should have stayed in the Ithaca crib.

2267
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,280
You should have married a sandwich.

2268
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,120
I know.

2269
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,520
The Van Wilder.

2270
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,360
Married a sandwich.

2271
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,400
Jason showed up at Van Wilder

2272
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,680
where he's still at school, married to a sandwich.

2273
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:47,600
Bought a lot more sandals and fleece vests.

2274
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,280
I could have had it all.

2275
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,360
I think there's still time.

2276
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,760
Yeah.

2277
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,200
You can go back.

2278
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,040
I keep getting older,

2279
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,920
but the sandwich, it stays the same.

2280
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:57,760
Yeah.

2281
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,400
Sandwich with a wig on.

2282
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:02,880
Jason's bride.

2283
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,440
The lipstick I put on it only grows more beautiful.

2284
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,800
Just have to replace the bread.

2285
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,280
You just replace the bread and the meat at different times

2286
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,840
so there's continuity with the other old sandwich.

2287
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,560
It's like the boat or whatever.

2288
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,760
The boat of the sandwich of Theseus.

2289
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,840
Is it still the same sandwich from before

2290
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,200
that you replaced all the components?

2291
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,240
It's like ourselves.

2292
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,720
We replaced them over the years.

2293
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,680
And always the same dress too,

2294
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,080
which comes in handy as a wrapper as well.

2295
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,920
Yeah, of course.

2296
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,280
Well, I'm sorry you didn't get your...

2297
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:36,920
Cause now I'm picturing that the I do happens,

2298
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,240
but with both of you lifting out of the water,

2299
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,840
you're both on Shamu.

2300
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,360
Oh yeah.

2301
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,920
And he chomps my beautiful wife.

2302
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:44,760
And then he chomps you.

2303
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,600
Five feet up.

2304
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,440
And then he chomps you.

2305
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,280
The plan.

2306
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,120
They murder.

2307
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:50,960
The orcas.

2308
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,800
They murder.

2309
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,080
And then you're like the rest of your life,

2310
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:55,920
sometimes you wonder,

2311
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,360
this is juncture points in your life.

2312
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,040
And sometimes I wonder how would my life have turned out

2313
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,680
if my wife hadn't gotten chomped by Shamu.

2314
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,320
This is another, by the way,

2315
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,000
that like, do you guys remember this occurred?

2316
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,240
This was like an early for me,

2317
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,200
Santa Claus isn't real kind of moment.

2318
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,840
The realization, I think probably the first time

2319
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,360
that I went to a second Sea World.

2320
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,880
And I was like, wait a minute,

2321
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,600
how are they always called Shamu?

2322
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,840
This is something we had to explain to everybody constantly.

2323
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,080
Cause it's kind of a difficult concept to understand

2324
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,520
that like they're all Shamu,

2325
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,440
but none of them are Shamu.

2326
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,760
Like right now it's Shamu.

2327
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,000
If you're seeing it and it's jumping, it's Shamu.

2328
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,120
But as soon as it goes down and focus turns to another one,

2329
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,360
that one's Shamu.

2330
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,200
Whoa.

2331
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,600
The transitive properties are, yeah,

2332
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,920
they can like lead to defense.

2333
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,960
If one goes behind this wall, he is not Shamu.

2334
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,800
He's no longer Shamu.

2335
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,440
Okay. It's like professional wrestling.

2336
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,680
There was multiple doing the clowns.

2337
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,520
I guess so.

2338
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,560
Is that right Mike?

2339
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,560
Can you fact check that?

2340
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,400
There were many, it meant multiple, yeah, doings.

2341
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,240
Yeah.

2342
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,320
Multiple, multiple rockopelos.

2343
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,160
Yeah.

2344
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,480
No, the real Shamu, I mean the first,

2345
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,720
somebody was named Shamu somebody, some guy.

2346
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,160
Some guy.

2347
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:09,120
But that was, they died in 1971.

2348
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:09,960
Oh really?

2349
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:10,800
That was the first one.

2350
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,920
Mm-hmm.

2351
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,520
So there's not, yeah, the true Shamu.

2352
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:15,360
Right.

2353
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,720
I just want to dedicate this episode to the true Shamu.

2354
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,080
The TRU Shamu.

2355
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,720
They should have done it like horror hosts

2356
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,680
and been like son of Shamu.

2357
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,680
Well, they have the baby Shamu.

2358
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,520
Do they call it baby Shamu?

2359
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,400
It's the same thing if there's a baby in the tank,

2360
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,280
it's baby Shamu, but then if it goes away,

2361
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,560
then it's no longer baby Shamu.

2362
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,080
But that's the official branding.

2363
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,000
The branding is baby Shamu.

2364
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,640
It's hard for a baby to have an important title

2365
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,200
if you're stripping it.

2366
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,560
But it sounds like there's no longer

2367
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,880
gonna be baby Shamus.

2368
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,200
It sounds like not.

2369
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,360
Oh, we may have had our last.

2370
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:52,080
I hope though that we don't lose the walk around Shamu.

2371
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:52,920
Oh yeah.

2372
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:53,760
That one is okay.

2373
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,720
In the suit.

2374
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,560
Which is funny that there is, you can go,

2375
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,800
this is a place where you can go see a real killer whale

2376
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,120
and then get your photo with a furry killer whale

2377
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:07,640
who has his tail splits into legs and walks around upright.

2378
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,160
That's just, that's a college freshman

2379
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,800
from Cal State, San Diego,

2380
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,000
and you can just abuse them left and right.

2381
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,040
They also do kill, but it's like whatever.

2382
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:16,880
Yeah, yeah.

2383
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,360
I remember, my only memories of,

2384
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,200
I think my family went to the Sea World in Florida

2385
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,320
when we were down there for a little bit.

2386
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:30,240
And I only remember going once.

2387
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,560
And the two things, I remember,

2388
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,520
I think they had that Arctic simulator,

2389
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,360
had a bunch of them,

2390
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,920
because I kind of remember doing that

2391
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,120
and then coming out into like,

2392
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,160
here's the penguins and the polar bears.

2393
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,080
The other thing I remember is we went,

2394
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:48,040
the time of year when the massive Brazilian tour groups,

2395
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,720
when it's winter in Brazil,

2396
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:53,680
and so they do the big tour packages to come to Florida.

2397
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,600
And there was like a whole section of bleachers.

2398
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,080
Everyone is wearing like the tour group shirts,

2399
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:07,080
and they had the most choreographed chants and shouts

2400
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,920
and stuff I had ever seen.

2401
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,880
And it was just so unnerving to see

2402
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,040
an entire bleachers worth of people

2403
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,120
all doing the same thing.

2404
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,720
And just- Chants for Shamu?

2405
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:21,720
No, chants for just like Brazil and their tour group.

2406
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,960
Like an athletic event or something?

2407
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,760
And basically, yeah, it was like you see soccer

2408
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,760
in other countries, and everyone's doing the-

2409
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,560
But they were doing this at Shamu.

2410
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:36,520
They were just doing it, no, before the show started,

2411
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:40,400
they were just doing it to celebrate the tour,

2412
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,600
to celebrate the good time.

2413
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,440
Everyone's having a ball.

2414
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,520
And you didn't join in?

2415
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,520
No, we didn't really know-

2416
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,000
He's not from Brazil, he can't cheer for Brazil.

2417
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,280
I think it was a few days later

2418
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,440
we finally asked a cast member or something,

2419
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:55,080
it's like, hey, is there a lot of people here from Brazil?

2420
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,080
Cause it looks like it.

2421
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,480
And they're like, oh yeah, well actually yeah,

2422
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,120
they do big tours this time of year

2423
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,320
cause it's colder down there.

2424
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,400
And then you said, well they let me chant with them.

2425
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,240
And they said no.

2426
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,880
You have to show a birth certificate.

2427
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,600
Sixth grade Spanish is pretty rough, Michael,

2428
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,280
so I don't know that I, or wait, no, do they speak Portuguese?

2429
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,120
They do, yeah, yeah.

2430
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,960
Yeah, well then it was really rough.

2431
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,800
Yeah, that's why you couldn't, thank God you didn't do it.

2432
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,960
That was a turning point moment,

2433
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,280
and thank God you didn't chant with them.

2434
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:25,040
But I mean, they certainly gave the whales

2435
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,400
and everything a roaring round of applause.

2436
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,040
And whales love applause.

2437
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,120
And they love loud, sudden noises.

2438
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:31,960
Loud noises.

2439
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:34,360
Why don't we give Shamu a big round of applause

2440
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,320
and let's see how high he'll jump.

2441
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:41,480
They would jump, every Shamu jumped four inches higher

2442
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:45,240
that day, high enough to reach that little bird

2443
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,640
they were trying to grab.

2444
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,880
It wasn't like watching the show a bunch of times

2445
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,080
you did get to see, they would mess it up sometimes.

2446
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,280
Sometimes the whales, cause they don't,

2447
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,840
the whales just kind of do stuff,

2448
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:59,040
and then it seems like it was on purpose.

2449
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,120
And sometimes shows will happen

2450
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,920
and the whales wouldn't jump nearly as many,

2451
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,800
or as many times as another one.

2452
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,640
Or they'll say that Shamu is about to do something

2453
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,480
and then it doesn't do it,

2454
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,320
and they just kind of gloss over

2455
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:10,440
and move on to something else.

2456
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,000
And then whales just don't want to do it that day.

2457
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,640
Dolphins are off book.

2458
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,920
Whales are still acting like they're in tech rehearsals.

2459
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,040
Dolphin's better trained?

2460
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,680
I feel like dolphins always nail it.

2461
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,960
More dependable.

2462
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,040
Is that your experience?

2463
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:25,880
Yeah.

2464
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:28,880
I feel like you also should not do a show seat.

2465
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,920
The other thing is I loved watching the shows.

2466
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:33,880
I would love to see it again,

2467
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,960
but I don't know if I ever will.

2468
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,000
But the dolphins would jump so high.

2469
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,880
But what birds did they eat?

2470
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,160
At what cost?

2471
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,240
What meaningful birds?

2472
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:48,000
Until they eat a really important,

2473
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,840
until I see a dolphin eat a rare dodo.

2474
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:56,800
It was two lovebirds and now it's just one morning dove,

2475
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,960
because it's morning the one that got eaten.

2476
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,600
I will say this just to also maybe complicate orcas.

2477
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,640
Have you guys been hearing about the murderous,

2478
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:12,400
the orcas in South Africa that have been surgically

2479
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,680
removing the livers of great white sharks?

2480
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,520
No.

2481
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,360
Oh, I have heard about that.

2482
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,280
And destroying the population down there.

2483
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,120
Wow.

2484
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,240
Yeah, dismantling.

2485
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:24,320
So to speak about what it's like in the wild,

2486
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,560
these are no angels, these orcas.

2487
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,520
So the story goes, and this is like a published paper,

2488
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:33,880
that these two teen orcas moved into this area

2489
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,720
near Cape Town where a lot of Shark Week is filmed,

2490
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,240
where they famously have the sharks

2491
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,920
that jump out of the water and stuff like that.

2492
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,840
And they moved in and they started,

2493
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,840
as it says, with surgical precision,

2494
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,920
removing the livers of great white sharks,

2495
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,560
eating only the liver and leaving the rest of the carcass

2496
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,920
just fall into the depths of the sea,

2497
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,320
and then move on to another one.

2498
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,840
And they got so good at this that all of the sharks

2499
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,640
have now left the area.

2500
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,480
Wow.

2501
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,240
The entire shark diving industry of South Africa

2502
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,280
is destroyed.

2503
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,320
The sharks are gone.

2504
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,360
They have all fled because of these two teens.

2505
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,200
These two teens.

2506
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,440
It's like natural born killers or something

2507
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,920
like of the orca population.

2508
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,160
It's just them against the world.

2509
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:16,720
Oh my God.

2510
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:17,960
Yeah, and then apparently though,

2511
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,040
they might be teaching it to other orcas, this technique.

2512
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:21,880
Oh man.

2513
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:22,720
Oh no.

2514
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:23,760
Oh wow.

2515
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,480
All right, so if this gets taught,

2516
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,120
if this can get taught to the ones at SeaWorld.

2517
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,680
They can just bridge the gap.

2518
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:35,600
And they somehow also learn how to jump from tank to tank.

2519
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,120
Well, but it's with surgical precision.

2520
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,560
So maybe people who need to have their livers removed,

2521
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,680
you just stick them in the tank

2522
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,960
and the orcas will suck it out.

2523
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,800
So the geneticists should be working

2524
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:50,800
on getting surgeon orcas ready to do surgery on humans

2525
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,000
and every other animal.

2526
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,920
Doctors with a big list who can't get patients in soon enough.

2527
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:01,000
You start just recommending orcas to do it in the sea world.

2528
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,520
The orcas have to do gig work too.

2529
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,560
Blackstone is killing this country.

2530
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,520
Nobody can get a decent job.

2531
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,280
It's like Uber for orca surgeons.

2532
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,560
It's hard.

2533
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,720
There's no discipline.

2534
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,560
There's no professionalism.

2535
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,400
There's none of that anymore.

2536
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,920
Do not have to make ends meet.

2537
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:22,160
This was such a pile of insane stuff.

2538
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,040
Oh my God.

2539
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,440
You really pulled us into the tank with you.

2540
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,520
I don't know.

2541
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,240
Closing thoughts, anything before we go?

2542
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,840
For me, man, I don't know.

2543
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:34,680
We did it.

2544
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,160
Sea world, I just do, I don't know.

2545
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,560
It's up for everybody to decide what they're gonna do.

2546
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,360
And I don't know, maybe someday I'll go back.

2547
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,200
I don't know.

2548
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,040
I don't know.

2549
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:43,880
Is it okay?

2550
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:46,920
Well, we will reevaluate once they've instituted

2551
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:48,240
the MEG program.

2552
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,080
Once the MEG's there.

2553
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,360
We'll see how they're treating the MEGs

2554
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,480
and then we'll evaluate off of that.

2555
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,760
Oh, Matt, I had a question for you.

2556
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:59,120
I might be misremembering my comedy lineage.

2557
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,480
Did you work for The Onion at one point?

2558
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,320
Absolutely.

2559
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,840
Did you ever pitch, did you ever get any

2560
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,440
Sea World headlines in?

2561
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,920
Because I feel like they've been pretty brutal

2562
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,240
to Sea World over the years.

2563
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,080
Yeah.

2564
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,480
I might not have, was I there?

2565
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:16,720
Well, so my Manatee story actually is depicted

2566
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:20,720
in a horrifying planet, which was,

2567
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,960
we did these YouTube series for,

2568
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,400
which was like when Sex House,

2569
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,000
like if you guys have seen Sex House,

2570
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,240
that was like everyone.

2571
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,560
And then we, so YouTube gave us a grant.

2572
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,520
We did a bunch and we just needed to pump shit out.

2573
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,520
And one of them was like a horrifying planet.

2574
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,040
It was like a fake planet Earth.

2575
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,000
And I wrote one that was kind of a testimonial

2576
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:38,880
about the Manatee thing.

2577
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,960
And it's a little bit illustrated there.

2578
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,400
It's not quite anatomically right,

2579
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,520
but it's got the gist of it.

2580
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,240
But, and it's amazing, but it's a kind of,

2581
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,760
it is a version of that.

2582
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,640
That's out, horrifying planet Manatee.

2583
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:54,320
I think if you put that into YouTube, you'll find it.

2584
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,560
I don't know if I wrote,

2585
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,680
I'm trying to think if I wrote any,

2586
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,640
because I don't think I was there after Blackfish,

2587
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:02,600
because that was 2013 and Blackfish must've come out then.

2588
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,040
So then I probably, and then if,

2589
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,320
and then I came back for a little bit,

2590
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,080
but the moment might've passed.

2591
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,520
But I'm sure I wrote some, like I used,

2592
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,800
because I wrote for the videos and like,

2593
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,600
we used to have like a little scroll at the bottom.

2594
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,840
And I'm sure I wrote some jokes,

2595
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,000
some Sea World jokes for that.

2596
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,320
I just can't remember, I don't know.

2597
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,240
I don't think so.

2598
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,880
You got the sea in your brain, it was bound down.

2599
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,040
Well, I would always do like the climate change one,

2600
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,440
or like environmental, or like earth science things.

2601
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:25,280
I don't know.

2602
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,880
You sort of brought that to the, oh, interesting.

2603
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,160
Well, that, well, look, that dovetails right into the,

2604
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,120
let me first say thank you for all this.

2605
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,640
Thanks for this pile of insanity.

2606
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,560
That Climb and You Survive podcast, The Ride.

2607
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,640
Oh, wow, thank you.

2608
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:40,040
And with that, exiting through the gift shop,

2609
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,400
is there anything you'd like to say about your show,

2610
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,240
High Science?

2611
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,520
Speaking of, this is really,

2612
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,200
now I see the through line of educator

2613
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,640
into a show with some education,

2614
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,160
mixed with some comedy.

2615
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:54,160
Yeah, yeah, no, thank you.

2616
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,320
Yeah, the High Science, it's on HBO Max.

2617
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,360
It's also on Discovery Plus, if you've got that too.

2618
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,200
But yeah, it's-

2619
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,020
Is it going away?

2620
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:01,860
Is it emerging?

2621
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:02,700
I don't know.

2622
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:03,800
It's gonna be Max.

2623
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,700
It will be, but Discovery Plus is also remaining separately

2624
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,200
because they didn't wanna leave money on the table,

2625
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,440
I think, because there are subscribers

2626
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,120
who just like the Discovery content,

2627
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,440
don't wanna bother with all this white lotus and-

2628
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,440
Okay.

2629
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,280
Yeah, that's like how-

2630
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,240
Don't mix my white lotus,

2631
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:20,880
don't mix my succession with my 500 pound life.

2632
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:21,720
Is that a show?

2633
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,960
Yes, my 500 pound life.

2634
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,520
That's like how AOL, like, lingering,

2635
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,360
kept dial-up internet for some people for so long

2636
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,840
because no one ever just wanted to change their provider

2637
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:31,680
or their billing or anything.

2638
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:32,600
I think it's still going.

2639
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,120
I think there still is AOL.

2640
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,160
But yeah, no, High Science, yeah,

2641
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:39,180
so it's like we made a science comedy show.

2642
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:40,720
It's basically like Bill Nye for adults,

2643
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,360
or it's like Magic School Bus

2644
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,680
on magic mushrooms or whatever.

2645
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,760
The idea is that we wanted to make a real,

2646
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,680
like you learn facts science show that was like fun,

2647
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,920
but it was geared towards like people who get home late

2648
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,160
and like have one last joint

2649
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,720
before they fall asleep or whatever.

2650
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,320
And so that's kinda who it's for.

2651
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,520
But there's like real science.

2652
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,800
We talk to science experts in every episode.

2653
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,320
There's like, you learn real shit.

2654
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,060
And then the whole time it's me and Zach,

2655
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:05,240
the guy that I made it with,

2656
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:08,200
just kind of like asking dumb questions and doing bits.

2657
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,640
And then it's where basically the concept is that we,

2658
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:11,480
if we wanna learn about something,

2659
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:15,720
we smoke it out of a giant robotic talking bong.

2660
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,480
So if we wanna learn about the moon, we smoke the moon,

2661
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,740
like herb labeled the moon.

2662
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:22,640
We smoke it out of a talking robotic bong named Doctor O

2663
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:24,840
that's voiced by Paul Bettany.

2664
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,320
And then we hallucinate a journey of learning

2665
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,520
and discovery about that topic.

2666
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:30,360
Wow.

2667
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:34,080
Which is actually a logical way to get to Bill Nye style.

2668
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,800
Hey, we're going on a little now.

2669
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,400
You've actually applied logic.

2670
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,240
Yes.

2671
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,680
How does the visual adventure happen?

2672
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,640
Bill Nye was insane.

2673
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,960
It made no sense why he was doing

2674
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,120
any of the things he was doing.

2675
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,120
And we've corrected that.

2676
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:47,280
We now make sense why we are doing what we're doing.

2677
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,000
Yeah, yeah, added the logic that Bill was missing.

2678
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:50,840
But yeah, I'll plug that.

2679
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,200
I have a couple other things to plug if that's cool.

2680
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,040
Yes, please.

2681
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,480
For some reason, a bunch of my stuff came out this month.

2682
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,660
I also have an Audible show called Blood Weed

2683
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:01,560
that if anybody listening to this is an Audible subscriber.

2684
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,640
I made this with Dan Averson,

2685
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,000
another former Funny or Die writer.

2686
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,640
That's like a scripted podcast starring Haley Joel Osment,

2687
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,260
Maria Bakalova, Zach Cherry.

2688
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:09,100
It's a cool show.

2689
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:09,940
I'm Audible if you're an Audible person.

2690
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:10,780
It's a great cast.

2691
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:11,600
Oh my God.

2692
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,780
Yeah, it's a fun other Stoner show.

2693
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:15,880
And then also Smarter, which is a show I made

2694
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:18,620
with Sam West and Chris Artinsky, old Onion writers.

2695
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:19,460
Team Coco.

2696
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:20,460
Yes, Team Coco show.

2697
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:22,260
We made this satirical tech show

2698
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,220
like three years ago for Luminary.

2699
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,900
And it was hidden behind a paywall for three years.

2700
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,460
And it's finally emerged and is coming out once a week.

2701
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,100
That, as all this is happening.

2702
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:31,940
Wow.

2703
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:32,760
Everything is happening.

2704
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,220
So on every platform, whatever you have,

2705
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:36,180
you can find something that I wrote.

2706
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,760
I have heard Smarter's so funny.

2707
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,880
I'm glad it's fully, more easily accessible.

2708
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,160
It's weird how you paywalls are so high.

2709
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,200
Higher than a tank at SeaWorld.

2710
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,520
It's impossible to scale sometimes,

2711
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,040
but I'm glad you're free.

2712
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:52,880
Thank you.

2713
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:53,720
It's free range content now.

2714
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:56,000
We brought the wall down and now you can leap

2715
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,960
into Smarter from your tank at home.

2716
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,920
That's great.

2717
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,920
Thank you so much for having me.

2718
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,760
Of course.

2719
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:02,600
That was the last.

2720
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,120
Thanks for bringing all these experiences

2721
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:10,120
and the specific madness of educator life circuit 2004.

2722
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,320
I do feel cleansed.

2723
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2724
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:15,000
It feels good to get all that out.

2725
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,360
You needed it clearly.

2726
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,320
That rattling in your head.

2727
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,080
Hey, as for us, thanks Brett Bohm and Forever Dog

2736
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:43,000
The ride are it's not weed, but it's smoking related.

2737
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,400
We have a little educational journey coming up

2738
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:48,600
into Disneyland smoking areas.

2739
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,640
We'd in our efforts and this is the audience chose this one.

2740
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,040
This is also at club three.

2741
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,040
You see the audience selects the topics in a poll

2742
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:57,960
and this was suggested.

2743
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:01,520
So we in our never ending effort to keep as many rides

2744
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,800
on the table as possible.

2745
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,800
I think the audience has helped us with what are non ride

2746
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:08,920
facets of theme parks that we can explore.

2747
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,360
Parking garage is great.

2748
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:13,000
As Blenards, we haven't done them, but we will.

2749
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,360
Do all Disneyland have smoking areas?

2750
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:17,480
I haven't done my research.

2751
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,400
I don't know. I haven't either.

2752
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,120
I think they've been kicked out of the parks.

2753
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:20,960
They're not in the parks.

2754
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:21,800
They're all in the parks.

2755
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,640
Improperly.

2756
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,480
We have to go all the way.

2757
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,320
Except in Paris.

2758
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,000
Or Tokyo I imagine.

2759
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:27,840
Maybe Tokyo.

2760
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,960
I don't know in Tokyo.

2761
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,200
We're gonna have to find out.

2762
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,760
You're catching us with our pants down.

2763
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:34,600
We haven't done our smoking areas.

2764
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,640
We'll know by the time you hear us there

2765
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,840
at patreon.com slash fuck is right.

2766
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,040
Okay, so get ready for us to know.

2767
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:42,880
Do you guys smoke?

2768
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:43,720
Sorry.

2769
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:44,560
Forever.

2770
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,040
Dog.

2771
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,520
This has been a Forever Dog Production.
