1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever…

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,240
Dog!

3
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,740
The podcast The Ride presents…

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,860
The City Walk Orlando Saga.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,660
Multiverse of madness.

6
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,040
A daily, extremely necessary series.

7
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,780
Exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,940
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando.

9
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,800
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The City Walk Orlando Saga.

10
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,860
Multiverse of madness.

11
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,700
I'm Scott Gardner.

12
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,700
There's Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,620
Yo, I'm here.

14
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,840
There's Jason Sheridan.

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,560
Chocolate!

16
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,260
Well, you cut right to the matter, which is what I'm trying to do.

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,660
Although really quick, I want to say we are back on the main feed.

18
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,540
We found a cosmic screen door that led us out of the paywall verse for now.

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,140
So if you want to hear the three sectors you missed over the last couple of days,

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,220
all of that is at patreon.

21
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,140
com slash podcast the ride.

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,220
But I want to cut to the chase because there's a lot to do,

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,920
a lot to get through, a couple of people to meet.

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,560
And I also, I feel like, I got a feeling there is a big one coming today.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,260
I've got a hunch that we are heading for one of the big ticket items of the series,

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,540
but I don't know for sure.

27
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,020
And the only way to know for sure, to see where we are going today at CityWalk,

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,300
we need to check in with our guide, the Sector Keeper.

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,780
There it is.

30
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,480
You were right.

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:17,980
Toothsome.

32
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,460
Chocolate.

33
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,780
Emporium.

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,020
Big periods after every one of those.

35
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,400
Well, Toothsome Chocolate Emporium and Savory Feast Kitchen.

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,920
And wait, slow it down, do it, do it, do it, really like trailer stuff.

37
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,640
Oh yeah, sure.

38
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,860
Toothless.

39
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:30,700
No!

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,240
Toothless?

41
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,340
I'm already…

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,320
How about just when you thought you were toothless.

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:35,740
Yeah.

44
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,020
Start that way.

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:37,960
Turned out.

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:38,760
Okay.

47
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,860
Toothsome.

48
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,180
Chocolate.

49
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,820
Emporium.

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,880
And Savory.

51
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,340
Feast.

52
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,280
Kitchen.

53
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,160
Yeah.

54
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,400
Yes.

55
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,280
Savory Feast Bathroom.

56
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,300
We'll get to the bathroom.

57
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,720
We've got so much to discover.

58
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,500
There's so much just in that name.

59
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,460
That's not even all of the big words that are on the outside of the building.

60
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,800
That's how much we have here.

61
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
This is Orlando.

62
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,280
This is Hollywood.

63
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,360
We have not done a Toothsome episode at all.

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,740
No.

65
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,620
No episodes about the Universal Steampunk Chocolate Restaurant.

66
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,020
And today, that all changes.

67
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,060
We're in it.

68
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,800
And we could not do just some ordinary episode.

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,320
We needed to assemble a super group, a Toothsome Tribunal.

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,980
And we reached out to two people who are as fascinated by this smokestack strewn enigma as we are.

71
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,280
And I'm so excited to introduce them from a great podcast that I love doing,

72
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,860
Who Cares About the Rock Hall, and a very funny album called Funny Songs and Sketches.

73
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,740
Returning to the show, Joe Quazzalla.

74
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:54,600
Guys, I am so deeply excited to talk for maybe four hours about Toothsome with you guys.

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,420
Seems possible.

76
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,280
That's what I wanted to blast through.

77
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,860
No tangents at the beginning.

78
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:07,500
We've got to break through this wall and go meet our friends, Professor Dr.

79
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:07,880
Toothsome.

80
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,680
Professor Dr.

81
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,640
Penelope Tibo Tinker Toothsome.

82
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,260
Is it Tibo?

83
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,300
I was going to have that question.

84
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,120
Tibo.

85
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,420
E-A-U-X.

86
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,460
So however you pronounce Tibo.

87
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:18,820
Yeah.

88
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,700
Well, there'll be questions.

89
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,440
We need to be sure about how to say that and be sure how to say almondine.

90
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,580
Because we've been through that.

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,380
I don't want to say almondine now.

92
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,360
Now we know almondine.

93
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,580
That came up before.

94
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,460
It'll come up again.

95
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,580
But yes.

96
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,060
No, no, no.

97
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,260
I was going to say it sounded more like a medicine than a dinner.

98
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:34,900
Right.

99
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
The way I was saying it.

100
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,620
You're severely lacking in almonds.

101
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:37,880
Almondine.

102
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,260
I need to get you some almondine.

103
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:39,920
Almondine.

104
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,920
And if that weren't enough, also joining us today, an under acknowledged figure in the

105
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,960
story of podcast The Ride, the reason we are at Forever Dog, which has been our network

106
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,980
home for a long time, the co-founder of Forever Dog, a producer and on mic presence on the

107
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,400
great show Double Threat with Tom Sharpling and Julie Klausner.

108
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,260
He's got a show called Weekend at Bergman's.

109
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,940
He's got a show called Movies Baby.

110
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,320
For the first time on mic with us, it's Brett Bowen.

111
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,120
Oh, guys.

112
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,620
It is so good to be here.

113
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,900
You know, I love this show.

114
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,920
You know, it's been such a joy having you on the network.

115
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,340
I can't believe I'm finally here in the in the circle.

116
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,120
This is amazing.

117
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,860
In the building that you're always in otherwise.

118
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,300
You came to this corner, hopefully not avoiding any important business.

119
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,600
Down in the in the boiler room of the Derisable this morning, working on the gears, making

120
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,760
sure everything's functioning.

121
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,600
I climbed that old steampunk staircase and I'm here.

122
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,400
It's good to be here.

123
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,100
I cannot wait to talk about the greatest restaurant on God's planet.

124
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,320
Green Earth, Toosome's Chocolate Emporium.

125
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
And you also were generous enough.

126
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,260
You you cleaned out your checking account to get some to some artifacts.

127
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,780
Oh, yeah.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,600
Presumably.

129
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes.

130
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,060
With how many items?

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,880
Financially.

132
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,360
So I went to Toosome this morning and I've got a lot of treats here.

133
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:06,380
I've got some apothecary sweets, Jacques brand coffee, some unidentified mounds of sugar

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,500
and chocolate rocks, chocolate rocks, truffles.

135
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,480
I got a little bit of everything, guys.

136
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,980
Feel free to help yourself.

137
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,980
I can pass these around.

138
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,280
Glad Jason's right there, though.

139
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:14,820
Yeah.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,640
He needs these.

141
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,720
He needs to reach these.

142
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,760
Jason must eat that grounds of coffee alone without.

143
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,780
I am actually running low on coffee.

144
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,680
Dip your finger in.

145
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,400
Dab dab dab.

146
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,680
Can you explain to us what the green one is?

147
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,760
Yes, this is.

148
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,240
And for those listening, it's like a sort of a old style, almost like a perfume or medicine

149
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,820
bottle.

150
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,300
And it says Penelope's apothecary sweets.

151
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,540
So I think this is sort of like rock candy.

152
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,680
There's a lot of like green, almost translucent like rocks inside.

153
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,060
So I believe this is like a rock candy.

154
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,480
I'll go ahead and try one.

155
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,560
From a distance, you would think it would be filled with liquid.

156
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,280
But then you get close and you're like, oh, it's rocks.

157
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,320
Another mystery from Dr.

158
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,320
Penelope.

159
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,460
A very nice decorative glass that you will not be able to take into the theme park.

160
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,720
No glass allowed inside Universal Studios.

161
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,300
Do people run into this?

162
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,460
That they buy some of this glass bottle?

163
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,260
I think Mini Monster was running it.

164
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,720
I think maybe now it's all plastic bottles.

165
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,280
But the original Mini Monster.

166
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,640
Well, what if you buy like a signed piece of glass from the celebrity Authentics?

167
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,980
Can you bring that into the glass from the movie Glass?

168
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:37,160
I mean, you got to put it in some of the lockers by those Greyhound Busty Shibay after-rooms that are halfway through City Hall.

169
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,460
That's true.

170
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,280
You're having a problem?

171
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,940
Okay, you got it.

172
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,820
No, no, it was just…

173
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,720
I want to say like sort of crystallized mouthwash is kind of the…

174
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,080
Ooh, lovely.

175
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,220
Sweet, crystallized mouthwash.

176
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:48,800
Yeah.

177
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,340
We'll get the review from Joe.

178
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,320
You know what?

179
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,180
Like you, Joe, I thought that was going to be liquid.

180
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,000
Especially because the last time I was up there in the store, I opened a much smaller bottle.

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,460
I'm sorry, not opened.

182
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,260
I looked at a much smaller bottle that looked very similar in a similar greenish color.

183
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,460
I just picked it up was all I did.

184
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,080
And then I immediately had green goo on my hand.

185
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,220
It was out in the store and the one that I picked up was dripping on me.

186
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,940
I'll post a photo of that.

187
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,040
I'm experiencing some green goo myself.

188
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,580
There's a lot of viscous in two shots.

189
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,200
There's little candies in my palm.

190
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,960
Hey, your hand is stained now.

191
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,800
Whoops.

192
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,560
It's not like I took a lot of them.

193
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,620
Took like a very normal to small amount from the perfume bottle.

194
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,420
I think I'm going to not.

195
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,160
I think I'm going to focus and not be distracted by the green on my hand.

196
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,140
Although now I'm distracted by the back where it says a story.

197
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,620
Penelope would lock herself away, endlessly experimenting with this sweet concoction.

198
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,120
Its possibilities seemed infinite and she was determined to discover everything there was to learn about chocolate.

199
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,360
Again, what we're looking at is not chocolate.

200
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,180
No, that's sugar candy.

201
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,160
Penelope played by bad cumers and a case of hysteria.

202
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,140
I came up with new chocolate delights.

203
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,280
There is a deep sadness to the lore of Toothsums.

204
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,580
I'm sure we'll get into this, but there is like a deep sadness at the core.

205
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,180
From the get.

206
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't know if we just want to jump into it, but the lore is that her and her robot Jock were traveling the world

207
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,780
and they're derisable, having adventures, discovering different recipes for chocolate and things.

208
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,520
And then when they get back home, their parents are gone.

209
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Her parents are gone.

210
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,580
And there's a letter that says something to the effect of like, you'll find us wherever chocolate is made or something like that.

211
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,400
I think specifically they like left because they're like, where's our daughter?

212
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,740
Yes.

213
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,980
Which implies that she didn't tell her family that she was leaving.

214
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,000
And then so then they go to try and find her in some tragic case of miscommunication.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,040
And then it leaves.

216
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,720
Yeah, the parents leave a note that say, you know, we will we will be wherever there is chocolate.

217
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:07,760
So then she starts a chocolate restaurant, the chocolate factory to to get her parents to entice, to coax her parents back into her life.

218
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:15,560
So every time you go to Toothsums and Penelope waltzes over to your table and does a little routine, that woman is desperately hoping every day she comes to Toothsums.

219
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,260
She's hoping that her parents will walk through the door of Toothsums and she'll be reunited with them.

220
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:26,320
So while you're having like a nice, fun little meal at Universal, this woman is like desperately hoping to reunite with her parents.

221
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:26,800
Sobbing.

222
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,500
Which never happens.

223
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:27,880
Yeah.

224
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,420
Sobbing as she puts a circular brandy on top of a filter straw.

225
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,860
So all of the showiness of it, because this place is jaw dropping.

226
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,700
Every stab, every version of it is astounding to look at.

227
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,320
And all of that is just as if to say, hey, I'm dad here, I'm here.

228
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,520
Yes.

229
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,420
And there is, to be clear, if you're lucky and you do enter the restaurant at a certain time, Penelope will be there.

230
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,560
And I do feel like we should be sensing a little bit more of that despair.

231
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:10,680
I would like to see the Penelope actor have a lot of excitement and then extreme disappointment every time any person walks into the restaurant.

232
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,100
Yeah.

233
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,780
Anytime there should be a bell on the door and every time it rings, she turns like wistfully hoping.

234
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,280
And goes, mother?

235
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:16,700
Father?

236
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,360
And when it's not, throws a plate against the wall.

237
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,000
You should hear from anywhere in the giant open, like giant.

238
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,460
It reverberates through the big echoey ceiling.

239
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,580
God damn it!

240
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,620
A Girl Scout troop again!

241
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:41,940
Let's back up to the beginning a little bit here, because there's a ton to unpack.

242
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:53,360
I think that this is a, okay, Toothsome Chocolate Emporium, which you could, could, and maybe should be called a factory, what with its smokestacks.

243
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:03,800
But there might be, could be some legal reasons why it's not called a factory and why they don't want to nod to other famous candy or chocolate factories out there.

244
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,520
But the idea is you are entering this world's, okay, it's steampunk, but is it supposed to be the past?

245
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,700
Are you time traveling when you go there?

246
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,300
Or does steampunk also represent now?

247
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,800
And that's just her vibe and it's 2024 and it's now.

248
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,060
This is a great question that I was afraid to ask the actors.

249
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
I think we did say like, is it now?

250
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,460
Because we did end up talking to Penelope and Jacques for a long time, one of the times we went.

251
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,100
And we just, we were, we like a little, a little bit overloaded them with questions about like, what's going on.

252
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,800
Am I allowed to, do you know about Dune 2?

253
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,660
I know that in real life, the movie theater is right outside, but in your reality, is it not?

254
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,180
Do you know that there's anything beyond the square footage of this place?

255
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,980
Because we asked them about Wonka.

256
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,400
I went.

257
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,380
Like, drag her outside.

258
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,380
Look, what is that?

259
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,300
Can you see it?

260
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,360
Screens, airplanes, pitbull playing.

261
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,900
Have you seen Wonka?

262
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,760
Are you just up to the train coming right at the screen?

263
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,100
Yes, right.

264
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,200
Yes.

265
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,060
It's been precisely one movie.

266
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,660
I don't know.

267
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:24,760
But either way, yes, you're entering this experimental laboratory of this fantastical professor type character, a female professor,

268
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,360
Professor Dr.

269
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,760
Penelope Tybo.

270
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,140
Tybo Tinker.

271
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,640
Tybo Tinker.

272
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,680
And she has a human sized robot named Jacques.

273
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,300
Has is, yeah, a verb that we can try to parse out with what's going on.

274
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,200
Is it her friend?

275
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,060
Is it, I mean, sidekick is the verbiage they use in the lore.

276
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,560
Yeah.

277
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,040
But what exactly does that mean?

278
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,020
When I saw them, they were holding hands.

279
00:13:59,440 --> 00:13:59,800
What?

280
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,900
So that, you know, implies potentially a relationship beyond sidekick.

281
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,800
Although in the past, maybe people were just holding hands with friends more often.

282
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,620
But what about a steampunk future?

283
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,460
Maybe they don't come back.

284
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,340
Well, in the future.

285
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,080
They realize the bond that we need with others that we've been ignoring for so long.

286
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,000
If it's the future, though, that means they're fucking.

287
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,720
Yes.

288
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,440
They're having sex.

289
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,340
They spend a lot of time together, too, on the Derisable, on adventures.

290
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,800
I mean, they're not part of some team.

291
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,480
There's not an extended cast.

292
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:34,780
It's really, they've been alone together for a long time and they seem to get along really well, which I think implies a complex relationship.

293
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,080
There's one other character Jason was bringing up a character.

294
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,260
Oh, sure.

295
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,780
Well, spot the dog.

296
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,360
No, not the dog.

297
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,200
No, I'm sorry.

298
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,900
That is the type of mechanics he is a spot.

299
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,860
He is a dress.

300
00:14:51,980 --> 00:15:04,760
They took a spot, which is the Boston Dynamics robot.

301
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,600
Police force.

302
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,660
It can detonate a bomb if you want it to.

303
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,160
Yeah, it can go into an apartment and notice if there's any explosives in there.

304
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:19,680
So latte, you know, they include some dog ears and snout and a bunch of gears to him.

305
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Meters and clocks.

306
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,680
A little hat.

307
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,340
A little hat.

308
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,420
And you could only like they had a little meet and greet with him from four to six.

309
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,260
And this was only for the month of September.

310
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,880
I should say the month of September 2020.

311
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,700
So if this all feels a little apocalyptic, here's Professor Toothsome in a mask.

312
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,380
Yeah, this was this was in the era of outdoor masking.

313
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,720
We all knew we would.

314
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,960
It is crucial for us to do outdoor masking at all times.

315
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,120
And they did this presentation and invited like theme park media to come check it out.

316
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:07,060
But Professor Toothsome was in a mask, a brown leather mask in keeping with her vibe and also in like a little cage so that she was forced to keep her distance from everybody.

317
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,980
And the vibe is so weird.

318
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,400
You're like, could this not have been?

319
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
Did this have to happen in deepest pandemic?

320
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,020
No, it's September 2020.

321
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,580
Clock's ticking.

322
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,760
We got to roll out latte.

323
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,980
There is no other way.

324
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,120
The stockholders are going to be so pissed.

325
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
They had to get back to the police force in Orlando.

326
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,120
They had it only for a certain amount of time.

327
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,640
Latte had to get back to bodying jaywalkers.

328
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,980
Throwing its full robot weight at like going across.

329
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:48,040
This does bring back to what I think is one of the most interesting parts of Toothsome's and one of the most mysterious parts is the money and the finances of this place and how it because stuff like that does feel like they were

330
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,140
built.

331
00:16:49,380 --> 00:17:02,400
Some bill had to get paid or there was some like they because the first time I went in there, I was like how I immediately thought this is either a front or some tax shelter or something is going on here because the ratio of how much they spent on the

332
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:14,160
overhead versus how many actual tables they have in the restaurant is insane because if you go into like Bucco di Beppo, they could pack like a Titanic's worth of people in Bucco di Beppo every night.

333
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,120
You can sit everywhere.

334
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:27,300
Toothsome's there was so much open space, so much unused space, giant staircases going up and even though there's a second floor, there's also not that many tables up there.

335
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,960
So I was like how did they spend so much overhead?

336
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,400
This place, they had this real estate for years before it opened up.

337
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,900
They were working on this thing forever.

338
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,860
Hard Rock Cafe went down, this is the Hollywood one, Hard Rock Cafe went down way, way in advance.

339
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,440
The makeover to Toothsome took forever.

340
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,240
There was a lot, at least with us, a lot of hubbub.

341
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,420
When is it going to get here?

342
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,380
When is it going to find so much build up?

343
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,260
An important part to the story was just like what on earth is this?

344
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,480
What is it going to be?

345
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,180
And like this real estate is like prime.

346
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,220
It's like central.

347
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:08,640
That also felt very end of the world where it's like Toothsome got half built, everything closed because of the pandemic.

348
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:16,480
And then when CityWalk opened back up, you could just go up there any time of day and steer it like a construction site.

349
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:25,440
And then in 2021, I remember going back up there because like the AMCA list was like we're giving you three free months because of the lockdown.

350
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,460
So I went up there to see like the last screening of Black Widow of the night.

351
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,240
And then I'm just watching like the third shift soldering Toothsome.

352
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:45,520
And then one magical day, as though they were announcing a new pope, there's smoke started coming out of the one of the smokestacks.

353
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,020
And it was like the day has finally arrived.

354
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,920
Toothsome is actually going to open up.

355
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:50,900
2023.

356
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,160
Is that that was the timeline that it was paused due to pandemic.

357
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,520
So it ended up being like a four year process, roughly.

358
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,360
I think so.

359
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:09,800
It's like how there was a Minions rise of grew like giant billboard at CityWalk for years because that was supposed to come out in the summer of 2020 and just kept getting pushed.

360
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,920
This also seems like it's the Los Angeles.

361
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,740
Universal Orlando builds in like six months and then everything in Los Angeles seems like it takes forever.

362
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,040
The rumors like take years.

363
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,440
There were rumors this was coming.

364
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,780
Believe me, we were talking about it for years prior.

365
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,920
We named checked it in the first saga, I think.

366
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,200
It's Toothsomes or whatever.

367
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,720
But it took forever.

368
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,900
There was also a rumor it was going to be built from scratch on the Saddle Ranch space.

369
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,760
Was there?

370
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,560
I don't even remember.

371
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,180
I think that's what we were saying.

372
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,140
Instead of what that ended up being a weird lawn that's never opened for anything.

373
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,300
I got to go on that weird lawn for that Nintendo event we went to though.

374
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,580
They opened it up for that and that's it.

375
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,780
Otherwise it's just vacant grass.

376
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,920
Why was this added to CityWalk?

377
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,140
Big mystery we do not know.

378
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,620
That's right because like Voodoo Donuts took forever to actually open up too.

379
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,400
I remember that was a like coming soon for at least a year or two years and that's just like a little corner spot.

380
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,340
I don't know.

381
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,740
Yeah, LA it's like it's tougher.

382
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,460
Orlando everything goes up so fast.

383
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,200
The roller coaster is being built quickly.

384
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:08,940
I'll say that.

385
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,540
The Fast and Furious coaster they're building now.

386
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,040
That's quick.

387
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,940
But everything else.

388
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,240
Come on.

389
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,820
Hurry up.

390
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,080
Well, the Orlando one, you know, there's some differences.

391
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,500
There's differences in the speed at which they build things.

392
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,700
And in general, I would say the vibe is kind of different at the Orlando one, which arrived in 2016.

393
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,780
Beijing in between.

394
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,440
This is an international brand.

395
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,740
The smokestacks have traveled the globe.

396
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:42,780
And, Brett, everything you're saying about the weird sparseness of the Hollywood one is not true in Florida.

397
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,660
It's so packed.

398
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,240
This is one.

399
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:52,020
And in a place, CityWalk Orlando is nothing but two story jam packed restaurants.

400
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,420
It's unreal.

401
00:20:53,560 --> 00:21:00,660
I feel like what is the total dining capacity of the entire if every restaurant was totally full, is that like 300,000 people?

402
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,620
That's my guess.

403
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,600
300,000.

404
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,220
It's so crazy.

405
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,640
But it is like, you know, whereas all these other things, it's like we're there in the middle of the week.

406
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,400
It's a Thursday night.

407
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,020
Nobody's there.

408
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,740
Not tooth.

409
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,800
So tooth some line out the door every single time ever.

410
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,200
Yeah.

411
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,220
And in decor, I thought it was like better done in there.

412
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,960
It's cooler.

413
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,100
It's a little more you get transported to a world a little bit more.

414
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,840
It's dark and lantern lit.

415
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:33,340
And as opposed to the Hollywood one, which is kind of like sterile, I might say.

416
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,340
Yes.

417
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,460
Once you get in, it's kind of gray and flat.

418
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:48,080
That big open area and those tall ceilings, I think partially because there did used to be a large rotating convertible on top of the Hard Rock Cafe bar.

419
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,800
Oh, right.

420
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,200
Yes.

421
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,860
You remember that filled that big empty space pretty nicely.

422
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,180
Yeah.

423
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,640
Yeah.

424
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,740
I think they just yeah, maybe they were the maybe there were some budget cuts because it does seem odd.

425
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,860
Because if you guys have not been to the Orlando one, no, no, you should be jealous of us.

426
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:14,260
First of all, number one, number two, imagine like a 90s Batman movie where they're having like a gala and it's packed and everybody's maybe dressed more in their like tourist clothes, regular clothes.

427
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,620
But you don't even feel that because of the way it's packed in there and the way that the lighting is.

428
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,900
And there's just so many people in there.

429
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,480
It's like this is the coolest place.

430
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,300
Everyone who's anyone is here right now tonight at two sums on a Tuesday night after Orlando.

431
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,980
It's entirely dignitaries and cabinet members.

432
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,280
Right.

433
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Yes.

434
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:31,700
Yeah.

435
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,080
And there is from other names.

436
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,500
This is dining at a table over by the like big tube that shoots fudge.

437
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,460
And that's what I expected when I first time I walked into the L.

438
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:41,540
A.

439
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:41,640
one.

440
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,760
I thought I was going to be brimming with I was like, man, they got to start moving food if they're going to pay for this real estate.

441
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,140
And then you go in there and you're like, is this a cloud kitchen?

442
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,500
Is it kind of can I eat here?

443
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,500
Like, what is this?

444
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:57,160
This is like there's just it's just weirdly sparse and weirdly not concerned with like it's a weird spot.

445
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,300
Maximizing the space.

446
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:58,780
Yeah.

447
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,140
And not exactly great sign.

448
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,820
Like I didn't know they had the milkshake counter and the souvenir counter.

449
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,300
Excuse me.

450
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,640
Do you have a milkshake counter or not?

451
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,560
From the outside, I didn't really know what was.

452
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,300
But when I was inside, I was like, oh, there's a store.

453
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,040
There's like dessert counter.

454
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:27,440
But when I eat there, I do have to say in the bathrooms, you know, they have like circ like oval brass mirrors.

455
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,520
But then they just have these gear decals just on the mirror.

456
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,120
This is the main place making in the bathroom.

457
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,140
But six stickers.

458
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,840
That'll do it.

459
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,680
Yeah.

460
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,780
Yeah.

461
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,220
They didn't spend the money on this Los Angeles.

462
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,640
Also, Jason, what you're describing, like what part of the words dessert foundry do you not understand?

463
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,960
You get your milkshakes at the dessert foundry.

464
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,060
It's clear as day.

465
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:59,820
Look, I like the commitment to like old timey language, but the words we don't use.

466
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,680
Another little sign at eye level of like desserts to go like would be helpful.

467
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,940
I agree with you because there I was going to bring up like there's a bar there and I don't know what happens at that bar.

468
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,800
I don't know.

469
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,820
It takes up a lot of space in there and I don't see there's no one there and there's often not a bartender there.

470
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,780
So, yeah, it's just like this waste.

471
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,640
And I was like, do you go and get chocolate there?

472
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,440
Like, I don't know.

473
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,020
Is it an out?

474
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,000
Is it an alcohol bar or a milkshake bar?

475
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,800
I actually don't know.

476
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,040
Right.

477
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,880
I don't think they serve alcohol there.

478
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,980
I think it is a dessert foundry.

479
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:39,440
Yeah, because the bar location used to be the center of the ground floor.

480
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,980
And now I think that's just a handful of booths.

481
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,340
Yes.

482
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:54,600
I think also to the Florida one benefits from two massive theme parks being let out right behind it and then hard rock live is steps away.

483
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,920
So when concerts get out, people in just go right next door.

484
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:16,260
I think there's some sort of like insect catching net that you could like you could you could show like a diagram of an insect catching net and then put it up against the outflow of traffic coming out of Universal Studios Los Angeles, where the stuff that is right outside the theme parks are catching the most people wanting to eat dinner.

485
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,740
And then you get all the way down.

486
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,880
They wrap all the way around.

487
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,400
By the time they get to Tucson, there's not many insects left.

488
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,780
And especially then when you get to Margaritaville, there is no insects left.

489
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,920
Everyone has been caught by that point in their dinner trap.

490
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:34,400
And that's like sort of the principle how you can like they should have put to some overwrite when you come outside the theme park.

491
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,160
And then I think maybe it would be packed.

492
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,040
What you get is a lot of people going, well, this point we're almost back to the car.

493
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,280
Let's just go home.

494
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,820
I got to go to a factory.

495
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,480
I went up to a factory.

496
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,420
Yeah, yeah.

497
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,800
Hot up here earlier because you're close to the sun and now it's cold and the wind is burning the sunburn.

498
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,060
I've been walking around all day.

499
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,520
I can't deal with lore.

500
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:10,100
Well, and the the inefficiency of the place to extends into their hiring practices, because I have a little inside Intel here, which is because an engineer at forever dog dated someone who worked at two some for a while.

501
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,380
And so I have just been getting all the inside Intel from from her.

502
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:30,560
But in order to work at two sums, you and anybody, not just if you're like playing a character, anybody on the floor, you have to do a three week paid training where you have to go deep and learn all of the lore in addition to the learn all the lore.

503
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,880
And then you get tested on the lore.

504
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,260
And if you don't pass, you don't get hired.

505
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,640
And so on the one hand, I'm very glad they are paying for that training.

506
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,880
On the other hand, I don't know if everybody in the restaurant needs to be completely versed in the lore before they.

507
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:53,700
And so they're they're literally paying for people to like test and fail the lore, the lore quiz that don't become, you know, employees.

508
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:00,140
You take the quiz once as like when you go to the DMV, you can take that test three times in one day or you have to do one and then you're done.

509
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,300
Question number one, does Jacques believe in God?

510
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,000
Is it chocolate?

511
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,400
OK, Christian, Jewish or Muslim?

512
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,220
Which God is Jacques?

513
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,120
Do robots know fear?

514
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,340
Trick question.

515
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,920
Yes, but Jacques does not.

516
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,980
That's what makes Jacques special.

517
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:32,720
You can see into the kitchen and I have noticed that they have to be done up in in steampunk gear.

518
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,440
Really?

519
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,100
Yeah.

520
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,100
And I assume it's because you can see so easily into the kitchen.

521
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,280
You can't break the illusion.

522
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,080
Like you're passing by just outside at City Walk.

523
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,680
That's right.

524
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,200
These poor are they using like old time copper instruments to cook the food?

525
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,540
They're cranking an oven.

526
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,260
Just doing all this like weirdly.

527
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,720
I guess that's steampunk.

528
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,040
Did the burger buns have to go through a full Rube Goldberg device?

529
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,560
Oh, yeah.

530
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Can we not just toast them with a toaster?

531
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,240
Why do they have to go all the way through the top of the restaurant and back?

532
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,060
Do we have to play dun dun dun?

533
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,440
Do we have to play that every shift?

534
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,560
Definitely loud.

535
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,960
I can't hear the orders.

536
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,480
We're all screaming all the time.

537
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,720
Lore quiz.

538
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,940
I don't I would love to see the lore quiz.

539
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,020
I just any quiz.

540
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,320
Please just question 12.

541
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,920
I wonder if we get a leak here.

542
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,660
Can somebody leak us the one of us could just apply.

543
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,740
But they were just to do the quiz.

544
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,560
Yeah, that's true.

545
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,160
Because the published lore, the lore that's available online is not that like thorough.

546
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,200
Extensive.

547
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,760
Yeah, it's pretty short.

548
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,640
But there must be like a second level to the lore that likes like Scientology.

549
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,860
You get to your right here.

550
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,100
You learn the secrets.

551
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,460
I know somebody who occasionally works there, too.

552
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,460
And the next time I see them, I'm going to be very annoying.

553
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,600
I just want to know about the lore.

554
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,000
So it's more quiz.

555
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,200
Let's get into it.

556
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,660
Yeah.

557
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,460
So, Jason, you didn't say hello.

558
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,220
And what lore?

559
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,340
You scream lore quiz at me and expect I know what you're talking about.

560
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,080
Look at me.

561
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,520
Look at me.

562
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,240
Don't look away.

563
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,060
OK, does shock believe in God?

564
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,960
The lore used to be in the menus.

565
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,880
And I've gone twice.

566
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,160
One early on and then one later, I guess we'll say.

567
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,320
A little bit of giving up perhaps.

568
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,040
Yes, they've scaled back.

569
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,180
And the second time it was just a one a one shooter for the menu.

570
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,280
But the first time I went, they went like in May.

571
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,880
And then I went in at the end of the year around December.

572
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,520
And then it was like almost like a like a booklet at first.

573
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:53,560
And you open it up and you could read about the story of Penelope and the tragic disappearance of her parents.

574
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,020
And I think there were more there were more like food options as well.

575
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,560
And then when I was there in December, it was just no lore.

576
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,340
Here's our food.

577
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:07,860
They gave up the no because this is something I was going to say is that I went kind of early on into the run.

578
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,860
And when they handed that book, the book was like the finest engraving.

579
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,180
I could not believe the quality.

580
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:28,800
I believe that there that some people in history have served as pope and their personal copy of the Bible was not as fine as just ever any run of the mill to some menu.

581
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,150
And my guess is they all got dirty or were stolen.

582
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,420
Yeah, it was not practical to have every menu caused.

583
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,540
$150.

584
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,140
They were incredible.

585
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,480
I thought they were fantastic.

586
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:54,240
But the other thing I heard is is you know when you're working at a place, particularly like a day job and you kind of start to get a sense like I don't think this place is doing that well or it might be in some sort of trouble.

587
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:04,580
That seems that was the vibe I was getting from from this hearsay from people that work there is there's a sense that maybe it started out very ambitious and then quickly was like cool.

588
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,320
Like not quite shredding documents in the back office.

589
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,740
But like but there was definitely a turn at some point where it's like OK, we're going to go.

590
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,520
We're going to start cutting costs like significantly across the board.

591
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,040
What's the lowest budget steampunk chocolate emporium we can do?

592
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,560
What's that or no?

593
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,280
What's the five times less cost of that?

594
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,900
We tried the dream version.

595
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,900
That was obviously a bad idea.

596
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,280
So now we're going to go with a slightly lower budget.

597
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,900
Like all the merchandise is just going to be replaced by like Harley Quinn Funko pop soon.

598
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,560
Like I don't know.

599
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,920
It's too much money to make this stuff and no one's buying it.

600
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,480
Besides me and my father-in-law, I've never seen anyone buy anything in the gift gift store at two sums.

601
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,960
I do wonder if that stock is like the original stock that was there on day one.

602
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,020
It's turning white.

603
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,900
Well, I have I bought some chocolate.

604
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,260
I bought a couple of things from this.

605
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,420
I bought some chocolate a few weeks ago.

606
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,220
I brought it home.

607
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,180
I thought I was a big hero for everybody to have some of this fine to some chocolate.

608
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,440
And then we turned it around and the expiration date was a week from then.

609
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,940
Oh, my God.

610
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,280
And I was like, wait, what?

611
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,120
That's pretty.

612
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:14,700
And then I went back a week ago and then it was like a year from now was the new expiration dates on all the chocolate bars.

613
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:22,180
So I had gotten the last possible second you could have sold these things into some of the original pressing possible.

614
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,520
Yes, it's possible.

615
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,880
Been there for 11 months.

616
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,020
Well, maybe it was seven.

617
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,740
Like there was seven.

618
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,640
Maybe it was October.

619
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,460
That was the new bars expiration dates.

620
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,800
So maybe it lets at least you say six months.

621
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,060
So the bars were not a hit.

622
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,880
Nobody like these.

623
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,380
Well, and they've gone to waste.

624
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,340
I guess there's still some Jason probably would eat them.

625
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,960
I well, yeah, we'll see.

626
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,120
We had the both experience like we got some chocolates.

627
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,280
We got a souvenir box like bread has some chocolates here.

628
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,860
We got them in Florida.

629
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,480
And Jane was apparently the last customer of the night.

630
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,720
And we were eating them like the last couple of days.

631
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,260
We're in Florida.

632
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,700
You're like, oh, these are really good.

633
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,340
These are good.

634
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:18,140
And when we were up there recently, we went to the Hollywood one and she ran in and got some chocolates and they gave it to her in like a wax paper sleeve.

635
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,000
No souvenir box in sight.

636
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,240
And we're eating them and they're like, oh, these are not like it was like nine day.

637
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,880
This downturn.

638
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,880
What were those dates again, Joe?

639
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,160
Because that was not a big stretch of time.

640
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,260
Yes, I went in May and then I went in December.

641
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,260
That is not much in the same year.

642
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,260
That seems wild.

643
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,980
And sorry, my timeline is all thrown.

644
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,760
This is not this has only been open in Hollywood for like a year and a month as we record.

645
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,420
Yeah.

646
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:48,760
Correct.

647
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,160
Right.

648
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,820
How has there already been a rise and fall?

649
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,180
Was there already like the supreme version?

650
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,440
And now they're like, I don't know, stickers.

651
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,080
How about we laminate a piece of paper?

652
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,120
How about that's the menu?

653
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,420
No more Gutenberg Bibles.

654
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,620
You know, I would all I would say is that as far as drawing down the ambition, I don't think we've seen anything yet.

655
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,740
I think that's exciting.

656
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,480
I have to revisit.

657
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,460
I'm not saying I know anything.

658
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,680
I'm just saying I think the possibilities of lessening the ambition is possible.

659
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,580
It was very, very positive.

660
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,500
Tooths and Penelope's been doing some cheapening experiments.

661
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,120
The science of cutting corners.

662
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,380
The party city version of Josh is coming.

663
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,760
It's coming very sooner than you think.

664
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:36,640
That kitchen you saw, Joe, will be outsourced to the Bucca Ghost Kitchen that Guy Fieri is.

665
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,900
They'll be making Mr.

666
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,340
Beast burgers in no time.

667
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,160
The Bucca Ghost Kitchen.

668
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:47,500
Can we kind of like describe the experience a little bit of like the first of all, like just

669
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,860
walking up to this place to either one.

670
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,940
Both of them are so they're so humbling.

671
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,760
They make you feel like a needle in a haystack.

672
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,580
They're just they're unbelievable.

673
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,700
A little more like I think both of them have, you know, big lines of like, you know, old fashioned like early electric lights or candles.

674
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,240
Yeah.

675
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,160
And then the Orlando one is these ornate like spiraling bushes.

676
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,420
The landscaping is incredible.

677
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,860
Every every banister is done beautifully.

678
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,380
Like they I think they've kept up that like the facade, the outside of both of these places is unreal.

679
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,160
You can't believe you're looking at it.

680
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,660
I still every time I go up there like, wow, and that logo is mammoth.

681
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:30,960
Yeah.

682
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,200
They don't make things like that for movie.

683
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,820
Mike, you're describing, you know, Schumacher era Batman.

684
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,800
They don't everything CGI now.

685
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,180
They don't they wouldn't make a prop as like massive and incredible.

686
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,420
And like you just want to give it a hug.

687
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:44,880
Yeah.

688
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,060
To said big main to some beer.

689
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,420
And we should say that we complain for years and years that this is what we want in the world.

690
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,200
We do want this.

691
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:55,680
Yes.

692
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,020
Yeah.

693
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,700
This is what we so don't get us wrong.

694
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,260
It's such a throwback to the air to the Arab dive.

695
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,080
The Steven Spielberg submarine restaurant.

696
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,140
It's a throwback to all these things that we've talked about on the show.

697
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,980
But they're all ancient history lessons.

698
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,560
And we're all, you know, combing through the three websites that bottom one blurry video.

699
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,440
I can't believe this all is happening in the 20 20s.

700
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,720
Yeah.

701
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,740
Does this not feel like a failed premise that we discover from 1987?

702
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,520
Nobody bothered to take a picture.

703
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,060
We are so lucky to be watching this rise and presumably fall.

704
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,240
It is.

705
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,280
We're lucky to be on the planet Earth at this moment.

706
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,160
I agree with you.

707
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,240
Cross has our Venn diagram crosses.

708
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,420
Can I say that I just because I like to say the word.

709
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,780
Can I tell the guest?

710
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,480
Do you guys know before Saddle Ranch?

711
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:51,380
Initially, there was a place called Whomp Hoppers, which was like a wagon wheelery, which was like as big as the biggest saddle.

712
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,820
Like it was the same sort of outside building that Saddle Ranch had.

713
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,960
And then when they tore it down.

714
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:01,680
So I don't think they altered it too much, but it had like a narrative and it had like an old like prosper wagon wheeler or whatever you call it.

715
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,660
Wheeler dealer.

716
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,700
I think it was described.

717
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,620
They had lore there as well.

718
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,200
So like there's Whomp Humpery Whomp Hoppers is the name of it.

719
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,500
Yeah.

720
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,340
And it was a wagon wheeler.

721
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,360
It was a wagon.

722
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,260
I'm going to make sure I get this right.

723
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,880
Whomp Hoppers colon.

724
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Oh, wagon wheeler.

725
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,200
There might be a different fine wagon wheeler.

726
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,800
Specifically, you would sell wagon wheels to everyone going through the Cahuanga Pass.

727
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,200
Yes.

728
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,640
Okay, I'm sorry.

729
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,240
Whomp Hoppers wagon works.

730
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,780
But I think maybe in the there's some wagon.

731
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,400
But it was an old wagon factory.

732
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,740
This was mainly up in the 70s.

733
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,580
So this really does.

734
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:45,720
Tooth Sim does like bring it right back to a restaurant with a premise and a red and built out of everyone loves it.

735
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,880
Regular people love to go to a restaurant that's built out of something.

736
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,240
It used to be something else.

737
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,600
We've seen it time and time again.

738
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,720
The fireworks factory in Pleasure Island in Florida.

739
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,160
If you love eating somewhere that used to be a factory, everyone loves it.

740
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,540
That's bigger than like the Harry Potter castle.

741
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,860
That restaurant is huge.

742
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,440
That was next to it.

743
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:15,200
One point in time is a walk away from a restaurant you could take a trolley car to.

744
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:15,940
Yes.

745
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,300
Right?

746
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,700
Yeah.

747
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:16,880
Yeah.

748
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,380
They were both up there.

749
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,620
A train station restaurant.

750
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,740
And everything.

751
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,700
And then it was Tony Romas for a bit.

752
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,180
Then it was just Tony Romas.

753
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,220
And it had no premise.

754
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:24,560
Sure.

755
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,660
I guess.

756
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,440
We had a safe bet for a couple months.

757
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,580
Oh, wait, wait.

758
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:29,780
Hold on.

759
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,060
Hold on.

760
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,080
I just saw this.

761
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:31,740
Okay.

762
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,800
Whomp Poppers from 81 to 86.

763
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,920
Then it was just called Whomps from 86 to 88.

764
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,840
That'll trick them.

765
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,200
Tony Romas from 88 to 94.

766
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,040
And then it just says unknown 94 to 95.

767
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,500
Which then it was Country Star Restaurant.

768
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,180
Oh, right.

769
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,540
When it was a big jukebox.

770
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,160
Country music restaurant.

771
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,980
Saddle Ranch 2003 to 2018.

772
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,300
Interesting.

773
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,160
It feels like this is there other lost periods in there from 2000 to 2003?

774
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,500
No.

775
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,020
That one's accounted for?

776
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,460
Or no.

777
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,000
Well, you know, you're right.

778
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,080
It doesn't say anything.

779
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,060
Oh, maybe it just sat there empty for three years until Saddle Ranch was built.

780
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,380
Okay.

781
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,000
That might be right.

782
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,540
I think I do recall just a darkened build.

783
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,400
You left Universal Studios and walked straight up to a darkened building.

784
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,160
Here's some pictures of Whomp Hoppers.

785
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,280
With like a big wagon above your head.

786
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,800
Oh my gosh.

787
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,500
Incredible.

788
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:29,780
Well, that does, because going back, I mean, Universal Citywalks, they must be partnering or like somewhat subsidizing the thing.

789
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,740
Because if it goes down, they sort of share the shame of it.

790
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,640
I think they own it.

791
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,700
I think they own it too.

792
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,040
They own the whole thing.

793
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,180
There's no website.

794
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,020
You have to go to the Universal Studios website to learn anything about this restaurant.

795
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,220
Well, they've done this big, we've discussed it in this series a little bit.

796
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:54,920
They have slowly bought up all the, not all of them, but a lot of the spots that they were leasing to outside vendors and replaced them with fake restaurants that are things that they own.

797
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,020
And it's these, I feel, that I've had the most trouble with food and such because they aren't real restaurants.

798
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,820
Professional.

799
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,660
Yeah.

800
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,180
Restaurateurs are not taking care of that.

801
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,680
Yes.

802
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:05,980
Yeah.

803
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:14,100
But that's the idea is that like, OK, you know, we're like, we're losing the profits to this place on our property to some other restaurant establishment.

804
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,940
We need things that we own.

805
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,920
So all of it, it's like the consolidation we're seeing with the studios.

806
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,960
It's the same idea.

807
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,980
So they're probably taking a loss on the record itself.

808
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,080
But the way they rationalize it is it's part of the spectacle and it's part of the we use it.

809
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,880
I mean, it's on the billboard as you come off Lancashim to go up.

810
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,440
So it's like it has other uses for them besides just making money off the restaurant.

811
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,380
That must.

812
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:38,740
Yeah.

813
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,220
And I have way that restaurants making money on its own.

814
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,260
I wonder if there's like an ambitious theme park person, too, that's like, you know what?

815
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,520
And then we'll make the universal movie.

816
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:46,800
Yeah.

817
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,520
Like, that's maybe what we're headed.

818
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,420
I would assume there's some ambitious person that thinks that whether that's actually a high up decision.

819
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,800
You think you're eating in a restaurant, you're eating in an IP generation.

820
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,000
Yes, I think that is right.

821
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,660
I do.

822
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,180
Well, I don't.

823
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,840
God, I mean, I hope we're seeing like universal had the biggest year.

824
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,260
Oppenheimer's them right.

825
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,020
And they kind of like, you know, what?

826
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,040
Mario's them.

827
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,480
Yeah.

828
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,980
Well, like, you know, sequels and franchises have ruined other studio.

829
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,560
Not really.

830
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:21,160
I saw yesterday they were the first time since 2016 that they had the biggest they had the biggest year at the box office.

831
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,000
They did.

832
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,140
It was Disney for 10 years.

833
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,440
Yeah.

834
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,380
And then it was this year was universal.

835
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:26,560
Wow.

836
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,120
Well, one kind of to cool this hot.

837
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,060
Then some delicious ice fun.

838
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,380
Then like the opening credits and like the year was 1873.

839
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,440
I found my when I was only two years old, I had a sweet tooth.

840
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,160
Jared Leto is Jacques.

841
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,780
My friends and I did try to cast this movie and come up with different.

842
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,320
But we also tried to do it in the in like the least interesting way and like the most typical.

843
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,500
We're like, well, obviously Jacques will be voiced by Keegan-Michael Key.

844
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:16,400
And we were like, maybe because we also had to create more lore just to make a story because it's just, you know, so we were like, OK, you make Bryce Dallas Howard, Professor Toothsome.

845
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,380
And then you she has a rival played by Jessica Chastain.

846
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,760
And they're kind of like doubles for each other.

847
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:31,340
So you get America gets angry because they're like, no, I confuse these two actors all the time.

848
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,320
And then that's on top of their additional.

849
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:44,800
I feel like any time there's like a steampunk movie or like a whimsical year, like everyone's like, no, I'm not going to see this.

850
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,960
I'll say the little the little secret steampunk movie of last year was Poor Things.

851
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,380
Poor Things.

852
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:49,640
Yeah.

853
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,340
Oh, yeah.

854
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,040
Yeah.

855
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,260
Yeah.

856
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,260
But not not a gear in that poster.

857
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,900
No, you think they don't tell you.

858
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,420
Here's him.

859
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,660
Get your don't tell you that's a little steampunk and they don't tell you.

860
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,220
Wanka is a musical.

861
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,220
Get your ghost to direct this Toothsome movie.

862
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,120
He's poised.

863
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,100
He's hot.

864
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,840
But he's going to have to go I.

865
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,020
P.

866
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,540
someday.

867
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,560
He's going to have to get ruined at some point.

868
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,980
He's he'll add all the fucking in it.

869
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,080
He'll add all the.

870
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,560
Yeah, there you go.

871
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,500
And the dreary net, like all the morose news of the favorite.

872
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,080
You can incorporate of course, you're right.

873
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,900
Oh, it's into her sad search for the parents.

874
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,100
Please indulge me as I read some Whomp Hoppers copy real quick.

875
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,740
I'm so sorry, but I have to do it.

876
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,240
Whomp Hoppers Wagon Works was inspired by C.

877
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:38,380
L.

878
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,420
Whomp Hopper, a legendary slick talking wagon salesman who invented wheeling and dealing.

879
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,060
As a young man, C.

880
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,180
L.

881
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,820
perfected a sales pitch that could sell perfume to a buzzard.

882
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,240
He began with horse trading, which led him to wagons, buggies and backboards.

883
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:04,580
By the time he descended on the unsuspecting citizens of early Los Angeles, he'd taken in enough cash to open giant Whomp Hoppers Wagon Works perched atop a hill overlooking the much traveled Coanga Pass.

884
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,180
Today, old C.

885
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,280
L.

886
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:13,060
is gone, but his legend lives on at Whomp Hoppers Wagon Works restaurant operated by his descendant C.

887
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:13,240
L.

888
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:21,560
Whomp Hopper the fourth with the assistance and cooperation of MCA Recreation Services, a division of MCA Incorporated.

889
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,400
Let's save the best part for the end.

890
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:24,660
Yeah.

891
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,940
Let's go out with a bang.

892
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,620
And there's more, but I really.

893
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,220
Why?

894
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,260
Who would want to learn this story?

895
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,220
Like, OK, so learn about a man.

896
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,460
So that's whose restaurant it is.

897
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,260
No, this great grandson.

898
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,340
An 1880 style wagon factory and dealership.

899
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,960
So it was a wagon dealership, like a car dealership.

900
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,060
Lease a wheel.

901
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:45,560
Yeah.

902
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:45,980
Yeah.

903
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,000
So it was slick talking wagon salesman.

904
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,800
Am I being stupid?

905
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,800
Is that real?

906
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,140
Like, is that true?

907
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,180
Was the restaurant real?

908
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:53,780
The real story of the story?

909
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,980
That's a real story.

910
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,100
That's not like.

911
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,560
I don't think there was a C.

912
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:57,660
L.

913
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:57,960
Whomp Hopper.

914
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,900
No, that's all K.

915
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,140
F.

916
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,260
I know.

917
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:03,280
We just read you a made up story that isn't fantastical or fun at all.

918
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,160
It was so boring.

919
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,420
I was like, wait, is this.

920
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,060
Surely this must be true.

921
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,620
With the MCA stuff at the end, I was like, oh, wait, is this just like a real.

922
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,920
It's just it was on that they incorporated the real name of the canyon into it.

923
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,520
I guess that's just what that was on this universal land, I guess.

924
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,080
That's deeply boring.

925
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:26,940
The only justification for that, if it was just a real thing they felt like legally obligated to say.

926
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,200
Yeah, I know.

927
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,660
I think I mean, unless look, this guy dressed to see a Whomp Hopper.

928
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,200
Do I think he's a real guy?

929
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,860
I don't know.

930
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,660
Who was an actor who also played the Dream Finder, right?

931
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,000
Sorry.

932
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:38,940
We found that.

933
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,780
Yeah, I was just marveling at that fake picture.

934
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:42,800
Yeah.

935
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,240
Do you think they had a wagon repo men?

936
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,680
Well, but would you buy a wagon on credit?

937
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,100
Did they have credit back then?

938
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,240
Because that's usually when a repo man has to go into action.

939
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,400
Were you allowed to smoke in C.

940
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:54,560
L.

941
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:54,840
Whomp?

942
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,220
Oh, yeah.

943
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,000
Of course you were.

944
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,660
They just invented putting bacon on a cheeseburger.

945
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,000
This is like, oh, this is good.

946
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:08,320
I would kill to smoke a cigarette and see a Whomp Hoppers like tonight.

947
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:08,940
Yeah.

948
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:15,040
I would pay $500 if I could go back in time and smoke a cigarette and Whomp Hoppers.

949
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,040
Unfiltered, just breathing in everybody else's.

950
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,020
I'll smoke a pack in there.

951
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,740
Put me next to the smallest children.

952
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,180
I want to smoke cigarettes in here.

953
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:34,720
I am glad this, besides the crazy backstory and the premise that Tucson has in common with Whomp Hoppers,

954
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,960
I think with that, it's not him, it's the fourth.

955
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,640
Right.

956
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:49,060
They've kept up that confusion as well because, all right, we've said this backstory that the whole thing is about trying to get the parents back.

957
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:55,860
And what's so weird is, like you said, Joe, you get the immaculate menu and you're, okay,

958
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:02,940
I'm in a steampunk chocolate emporium and I guess there's a professor who runs this place and there is a robot.

959
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,380
I've got a lot of questions.

960
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,200
I'd love to know their story and how this all came to pass.

961
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,540
And then you open the menu and it says the story of Toothsum.

962
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,000
Great.

963
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,700
This is exactly what I'm looking for.

964
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,980
First line of the story of Toothsum.

965
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,520
Shock landed the derigible in front of the small cottage home in London, England.

966
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,860
And then they're just straight.

967
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,860
So the story starts way past.

968
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,140
You're not even close to knowing where shock came from or who shock is or why.

969
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,800
Yeah, that's all boring.

970
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,760
We need to get to a cottage and departed parents.

971
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,620
Wait, but I'm just adjusting to Professor Toothsum and Padelope and Jock.

972
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,120
No.

973
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,460
All right.

974
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:40,920
Forget that.

975
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,860
You now need to learn about Thomas and Violet Toothsum.

976
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,260
Why am I going to meet them?

977
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,940
No, not unless their story ends and then the restaurant will close.

978
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,720
You will never meet Thomas and Violet Toothsum.

979
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,960
Well, I have to know about him.

980
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,720
You do.

981
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm just eating chocolate bread here.

982
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:57,280
Right.

983
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,200
Yes.

984
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,420
The menu writer took very literally.

985
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,680
There's a saying that Kurt Vonnegut used to say, one of my favorite writers.

986
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:13,380
He would say, write 15 pages and then throw out the first five and start your story there.

987
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,420
So the first five pages of Toothsum are in the garbage somewhere.

988
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,320
Crucial pages.

989
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,660
You noticed Vonnegut influence.

990
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:22,340
We've got to do it.

991
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Vonnegut said it.

992
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,900
We've got to throw him away.

993
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,520
Page number six starts with Jock landing the dirigible.

994
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,460
So Jock landed the dirigible.

995
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,320
Jock flies dirigibles.

996
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,340
Very cat's cradle.

997
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,400
Very breakfast of champions.

998
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,300
People know that word now because of that one, the rich people sub that imploded, I assume.

999
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,500
That was a dirigible?

1000
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,560
Dirigibles can go under the sea too.

1001
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,620
They aren't just flying.

1002
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,300
I'm looking it up unless I'm just totally…

1003
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,900
Is a wagon a dirigible?

1004
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,460
It can be steered.

1005
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,700
This is true.

1006
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,480
We've got a lot to learn here.

1007
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,280
I also, again, all right, you're right.

1008
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,220
The first five pages are in the garbage.

1009
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:14,860
And it does, it leaves us, those five pages contain something I think important, which is like what brings us to this world at all.

1010
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,000
And I, okay, I read, I read a, oh yes, go ahead.

1011
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:18,440
I'm wrong.

1012
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,040
It's a, I'm confusing dirigible and submersible.

1013
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,840
Oh, that sounds right.

1014
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,640
Yeah, yeah.

1015
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,640
I confused it.

1016
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,680
People know, people have been thinking about dirigible because of that submarine that blew up.

1017
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,240
I confused the BLE.

1018
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,620
The BLE was the confusing one.

1019
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,240
I almost lost faith in language because I was like a dirigible can go under water?

1020
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,180
Well, that first submission screwed me up too.

1021
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,460
We all bought it.

1022
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,460
We all bought it right there.

1023
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,100
I'm leaving it in.

1024
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,780
I won't cut it out.

1025
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,280
We have to know the process.

1026
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,180
We aren't throwing those pages away.

1027
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,320
We will not throw it.

1028
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:52,300
You know what?

1029
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,380
I only just learned how to say power more correctly.

1030
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,140
We're all learning.

1031
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,360
We're all learning.

1032
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:58,920
We all grow.

1033
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:08,080
So, you read some copy of this place and the copy says it's like stepping inside a steampunk chocolate fantasy.

1034
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,940
And now let me ask, whose fantasy is that?

1035
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,240
Who has ever had that fantasy?

1036
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,160
Why?

1037
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,840
The biggest, we've been talking for a while.

1038
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,560
The biggest question is why?

1039
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,820
I mean, clearly people are into it, at least in Orlando.

1040
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,040
But how did this come about?

1041
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,820
Who thought that this would be a viable idea?

1042
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,800
It has to begin with how do we, without licensing Willy Wonka, how do we do this?

1043
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,240
Who?

1044
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,960
Wait, I'm sorry.

1045
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,500
Who is that?

1046
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,740
I don't know of this man.

1047
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,960
This came out, and I know we'll talk about the lawsuit around Orlando,

1048
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,160
but there was a lawsuit around the Orlando one that had to do with sort of IP and this and that.

1049
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:55,960
And in discovery, it came out that the original name was like the Tucson Chocolate Factory,

1050
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,500
and then that got changed to Emporium and Savory Feast Kitchen later on.

1051
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,180
So they must have been, I almost feel like they knew they were going to change it.

1052
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,600
It's like so obvious that they're just doing a Willy Wonka thing without having the IP,

1053
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,600
and they probably knew it was just a placeholder.

1054
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,420
It's like at some point we're going to have to change this name.

1055
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,960
But the earliest documents, the planning documents all say to some chocolate factory.

1056
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,880
So is steampunk a way to get out of that territory, get into a different era and time?

1057
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,700
Is it a way to justify a top hat?

1058
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:25,960
Oh yeah!

1059
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,100
Why are there also top hats here?

1060
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,860
Well, it's steampunk.

1061
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,480
We had to.

1062
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,960
It's steampunk, and it goes with the goggles.

1063
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,500
It's a woman.

1064
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,080
Woman.

1065
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,520
Willy Wonka's not a woman.

1066
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,880
When was the last time you watched Willy Wonka?

1067
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,600
Not a woman.

1068
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:43,340
I can see a planning meeting like five, six, seven years ago where they were like,

1069
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,980
we need a distinguishing thing.

1070
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,420
We need something so this is clearly,

1071
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,500
like the lawyer was like, you need one thing that makes it clear this is not just a Willy Wonka ripoff.

1072
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,180
And you can see ten marketing people coming in with like ten ideas where somebody was like,

1073
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,080
it's underwater.

1074
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,180
And then somebody was like, it's, you know.

1075
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,040
It belongs to Abraham Lincoln.

1076
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,100
One thing just says, ancient Rome, question mark.

1077
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,680
Like there's tons of ideas.

1078
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,940
And then somebody was like, one person was like, steampunk?

1079
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,020
And then everybody had to be told what steampunk was.

1080
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:13,780
There it is.

1081
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,080
I like the Lincoln idea that either it's happening concurrently,

1082
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,080
like not satisfied with nearly being the president.

1083
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,740
And also operates the factory of his dreams.

1084
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:32,060
I would love it if she hocked the Daniel Day Lewis Lincoln like, this country!

1085
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,040
That weird voice.

1086
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:34,360
Wow.

1087
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,740
You've jocked it.

1088
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,880
Wait, I want to hear more of this.

1089
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,100
Your impression of Daniel Day Lewis Lincoln.

1090
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,580
He's simultaneously high pitched and gravelly.

1091
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,360
I always thought Day Lewis's Lincoln kind of sounded like Mr.

1092
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:50,780
Burns.

1093
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:56,340
Like when you, some of them were like, you don't see the way that we need this country to come together.

1094
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,280
Like this sounds like Charles Montgomery.

1095
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,140
Did it sound like that or did it sound like, hello, I'm Lincoln, hello, hello?

1096
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,600
Sounds like a Julia Child.

1097
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,020
Scott Thompson's queen.

1098
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,400
Scott Thompson's queen, boys.

1099
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,600
I am the president, Klob, and I'm in power.

1100
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,640
Ooh, the theater, don't mind if I do.

1101
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,780
It's me, Jacques Vanellope, get your hysteria under control.

1102
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,620
We've got milkshakes to make.

1103
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,140
The Google Now's concert just got out.

1104
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,400
Let's talk about this lawsuit a little bit more.

1105
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:38,860
Alright, so it's in the air, it's maybe something people know about and haven't looked into,

1106
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:43,560
that in the backstory of this establishment there was a lawsuit that threatened the entire thing.

1107
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,240
And you hear that and you go, oh, so Wonka probably was probably the Willy Wonka people, right?

1108
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,300
Or D'Arc, or Worm Brothers, who was it?

1109
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,500
Not the case.

1110
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:56,100
Brett, you've talked about this on Double Threat a little bit, and I've had info about it,

1111
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,460
but if you feel like you want to give us some basics.

1112
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,020
Yeah, it's pretty simple.

1113
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:05,460
There was a guy in Ohio who apparently had a couple meetings with Universal, Orlando Universal,

1114
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:13,440
and they sound like very general meetings, but he was basically pitching them on a chocolate factory restaurant.

1115
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,020
So he was pitching them on kind of the general concept of this.

1116
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:25,140
He does admit in the lawsuit that he got the idea from a drawing that his young daughter had made in elementary school,

1117
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,600
his young daughter had made some sort of fantastical world sort of sketch,

1118
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:34,360
and there was a cotton candy bridge and this and that, and there was a chocolate factory.

1119
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,140
He seemed weirdly unaware of Willy Wonka.

1120
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:43,460
And I think that explains a lot of this, is that he apparently saw this, his daughter had done this,

1121
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,200
and he gave him the idea, he was like, a chocolate factory?

1122
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,500
That's a brilliant idea.

1123
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,900
Why didn't anyone ever think of this?

1124
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,260
Why isn't?

1125
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,340
There's no such thing in the world as a chocolate factory.

1126
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:56,860
And so he apparently had a couple like generals with the universal where he was pitching them on this

1127
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:01,100
and I guess showing them his daughter's drawing and being like, you do this and pay me.

1128
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:06,960
I don't know how the meetings went, but then years later they come out with two sums and you could,

1129
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,740
you know, you can see him in Ohio finding out about this and it's just his head exploding.

1130
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,480
He's like, they did my idea and they're not paying me.

1131
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,180
And so he sued Universal.

1132
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,180
It went to court.

1133
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,260
It was a trial that people had to show up for and like, and there was a jury.

1134
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,920
An attempt at forty million dollars.

1135
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:23,360
Forty million.

1136
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,260
He was doing them for forty million dollars.

1137
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,740
He lost and then he had to pay Universal's legal fees as a result of the lawsuit.

1138
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,060
So he really, not a good idea.

1139
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:42,420
And they just, they said he was just not able to prove, you know, to the sort of level of the law

1140
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,680
that there was, that they had directly taken the idea from him.

1141
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,920
And he also didn't, you know, he didn't give them any sort of like, you know,

1142
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,400
he didn't make Universal sign anything or do an NDA or anything.

1143
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,400
Like there was just, it was just a couple general.

1144
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,900
Yeah, there was no paper trial.

1145
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:01,520
And I've even seen in Googling the case, I've seen it on the website of a Florida lawyer

1146
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,740
who specializes in copyright as a case.

1147
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,800
I don't think even taking a side in it, but just saying, well, the ruling went this way

1148
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,780
because even if he did, they did take his idea.

1149
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,860
There was not one way that he locked that idea down.

1150
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,920
Yeah, which sticks, because I mean, like, you know, I feel like copyright law is,

1151
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:20,480
it's very easy for big corporations to win because they have huge legal departments

1152
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,580
and they always dot their, you know, eyes and cross their T's.

1153
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,080
But this stuff, it's so hard for people like that to win a copyright case.

1154
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,660
It was something like this because it's just like they had a couple meetings

1155
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,680
and maybe that at some point percolated and became twosomes.

1156
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,280
There might be some legitimacy to it.

1157
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,340
But he just had no way of proving it in a way that he was going to win the case.

1158
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,080
But there's also is the specter of Willy Wonka over all of this that like,

1159
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,360
this is no, neither of you's idea.

1160
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,040
This idea like, both of you.

1161
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,300
I was like, just call it a day.

1162
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1163
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:03,460
There's another bizarre aspect of that, which is that the drawing that his daughter did

1164
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:08,740
came from another business he was trying to do called 1-800-Santa Claus.

1165
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,320
I forgot.

1166
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,300
There's no further details about that.

1167
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,680
But just, hey, draw me a map of the North Pole.

1168
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:21,520
And then she drew such a map, which included a small building called the Chocolate Factory.

1169
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,080
He said, what is that?

1170
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,220
And she said, that is where the elves eat.

1171
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,480
And then that became the whole.

1172
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:27,960
That became it.

1173
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,660
Yeah, that's right.

1174
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,940
I'd like to know more about what 1-800-Santa Claus was.

1175
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:32,880
That sounds good.

1176
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,380
I mean, there's a number we could call.

1177
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,040
It's going to go to the long haul.

1178
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,200
Try, yeah.

1179
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,760
Universal Bot Bet 2.

1180
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,660
That just reruns you to the book booking a hotel for them.

1181
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,020
The number you've dialed has been disconnected.

1182
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:48,920
All right, let's find out.

1183
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,280
You want to try?

1184
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:49,740
Let's try it.

1185
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,080
Let's try it.

1186
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:50,900
Let's find out.

1187
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,320
1-800-Santa Claus.

1188
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:58,120
Please leave your message after the tone followed by the pound key.

1189
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,160
Hi, is this Santa?

1190
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,620
Just curious.

1191
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:03,520
Thanks.

1192
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:04,380
Goodbye.

1193
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,000
I guess they'll call back.

1194
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,680
Don't leave the phone on silent.

1195
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,320
Make sure they can call back during the podcast.

1196
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,620
Well, if it's Santa, he will know.

1197
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,660
Oh, yeah, that's a good point.

1198
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,720
Does this answer your question?

1199
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,260
Hello?

1200
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,400
Hello, Joe.

1201
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,440
You've been very good this year.

1202
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,800
But not when you were nine.

1203
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:30,720
How did you get my personal number?

1204
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,760
Are you being mean about Toothsome on a podcast?

1205
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,080
That's not very nice.

1206
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,500
I do have such a soft spot for people like that, though.

1207
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,420
This guy's clearly just trying to come up with something.

1208
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,180
Dreaming big.

1209
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,300
Dreaming big.

1210
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,300
He's trying.

1211
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,920
He got a meeting with Universal.

1212
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,140
I was going to say, who is the guy to get a…

1213
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:49,880
Some guy in Ohio.

1214
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,600
No, he's in Ohio.

1215
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,240
Yeah, I don't understand what he is.

1216
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,280
He's an entrepreneur of some kind.

1217
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,520
And now he just has the…

1218
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,720
He has the Facebook group, The Chocolate Factory,

1219
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,320
which is mostly pictures of three chocolates next to each other,

1220
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,300
and then also the full legal affidavit explaining this entire case.

1221
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,360
What I just read about when I entered Santa Claus is from his Facebook,

1222
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,980
which has a lot of hashtags like

1223
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,540
Justice for So and So, whatever it was,

1224
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:18,100
Toothsome Chocolate Emporium, Toothsome Chocolate Factory,

1225
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,120
Chocolate Factory.

1226
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,120
Maybe people will use the hashtag of what it was supposed to be called,

1227
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,800
and that will prove me right.

1228
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,140
Does he have any punny hashtags like

1229
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,220
Toothsome Chocolate Fraudtory or anything?

1230
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,840
It feels like there's a missed opportunity there.

1231
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,880
He needed a punch-up guy to really get a good…

1232
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,960
Truthless Emporium.

1233
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,340
If he's listening, we'll do the documentary.

1234
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,060
We'll do Truthless, the Truth About Toothsome.

1235
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:49,360
If you're watching this, you assuredly have been to

1236
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,260
and enjoyed the worldwide phenomenon Toothsome Chocolate.

1237
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,200
What if I told you it's not everything you think it is?

1238
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,440
Do you think anyone ever sued over Wompoppers?

1239
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,800
That they felt like they had the idea for…

1240
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:05,660
Yeah, C.

1241
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:05,780
O.

1242
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,160
Wompopper III.

1243
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,980
Got cut out of the story.

1244
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,980
Was like, what about me?

1245
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,140
I went to culinary school.

1246
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,680
All this backstory and mythology,

1247
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,520
and now we know legal troubles that they've had,

1248
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,560
I think we should maybe for a little bit boil it down to

1249
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,680
the basics, which is the experience of going there.

1250
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,520
We touched on that with you, Joe, a little bit about

1251
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:38,220
a perceived lapse in quality between the first and second.

1252
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,740
In either one, is there anything you want to tell us about

1253
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,320
your specific Toothsome time?

1254
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,120
which is a mistake, I think.

1255
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,020
Which part?

1256
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,520
I would say the dinner part.

1257
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,920
I've done it with a group of friends, and going twice in the same calendar year

1258
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,600
is a way to test the patience of your close friends and loved ones.

1259
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,840
You went for dinner because the pasta menu is not available at lunch.

1260
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,560
Yes.

1261
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,960
From what I've seen online.

1262
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,380
The first time I went, I was disappointed that Penelope and Jacques

1263
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,460
were not around.

1264
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,640
It's just like, well, what's the point here?

1265
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,660
Can I say, I've never been to any of these with them there.

1266
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,640
You have, so can I?

1267
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:32,840
I have, yeah.

1268
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,960
I've got a picture with them.

1269
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,240
They were there, asked them a couple questions.

1270
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,480
They did their whole routine.

1271
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,760
But it's, I think, just once they've been there.

1272
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,700
It's really random whether they're there or not.

1273
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,760
I have a picture with them.

1274
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,560
Oh, there you go.

1275
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,160
I have a number of pictures and an extended video.

1276
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:50,840
Oh, wow.

1277
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:51,880
With Penelope and Jacques.

1278
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,160
Send it my way.

1279
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,040
We'll post it.

1280
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:58,680
We went to, so a group of friends, we like, we're all on the A-list for AMC,

1281
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:02,140
and when we can, we like to pair a restaurant with the movie.

1282
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:06,540
And we were like crossing our fingers that Toothsome would make it to Wonka.

1283
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,460
Because it was like, this place seems like it's not long for this world.

1284
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,000
Like, is it still going to be around?

1285
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,040
And we got lucky, and so we went and saw, we went to Wonka after we went to Toothsome.

1286
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:25,040
And we spent some time, more time in the restaurant than I would have expected

1287
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:33,300
because we had wanted to go in the theme park, but it was a, it was like a Thursday that was a blackout day.

1288
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,940
So my pass didn't work.

1289
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:38,780
Around the holidays, there were more blackout dates, I think, at the park.

1290
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,680
So we just had to, like, kill a lot of time at City Walk.

1291
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,560
So we just ended up going to the restaurant sitting near the dessert foundry.

1292
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:53,540
And, but Penelope and Jacques were there, and they were making the rounds together, holding hands.

1293
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,240
At each table, just kind of, you know, saying hello or whatever.

1294
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:05,460
People seem to not really be engaging, maybe are a little confused as to why these freaks are joining their table.

1295
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:15,000
But we essentially engaged in a four-minute improv scene with these two characters as they're talking in character.

1296
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:20,420
And they seemed to be, like, kind of into it because it was like, oh, people actually want to talk to us.

1297
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:23,660
They're not, like, eating and kind of, you know, shooing us away.

1298
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,300
So we got, we got to talk to them.

1299
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:30,460
And Jacques is essentially C-3PO.

1300
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,160
He, like, you know, he kind of talks like this.

1301
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,280
He has one of these dandy British accents.

1302
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,320
I didn't know until right now that he talked.

1303
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,800
Yeah, and it's unclear.

1304
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,200
I wondered if he just made, like, clank clank clang.

1305
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:44,640
No, he talks.

1306
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:52,180
There's, like, a bit of a filter on the microphone to make him sound exactly robotic, but, like, mechanical.

1307
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,660
Yeah, he has one of those speaker boxes.

1308
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,480
Yes, yes.

1309
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,400
And you can see, like, 20 sets behind them.

1310
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,700
It's usually a universal person with an iPad controlling it.

1311
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,020
I didn't see that.

1312
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,240
It's not the person, so it's not the person in the suit.

1313
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,260
Somebody, a little steps away.

1314
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,680
I didn't know this.

1315
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,980
Wait, did you feel like they weren't responding with, like, real sentences?

1316
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:18,440
No, no, they were taught, they were just, I think, doing the levels on the mic box.

1317
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,340
Oh, I see.

1318
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:22,320
I think the person inside is responding.

1319
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:22,600
I see.

1320
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:23,980
Yeah, they're talking.

1321
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,840
The hand holding just clicked for me, too.

1322
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,460
As someone who's tried to navigate a horror convention while wearing a mask, Jacques has no visibility.

1323
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,740
Oh, right, right.

1324
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:33,860
That's great.

1325
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,060
Practical thing, yeah.

1326
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,600
But, yeah, we ask them a lot of questions.

1327
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:46,400
We ask them what do they recommend on the menu, which I got to, you know, I got to have the wonderful moment of Jacques going,

1328
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,740
well, I quite like the flatbread barbecue chicken.

1329
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,340
Oh, and yes, the aji tuna.

1330
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:54,980
Isn't that good?

1331
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,260
Oh, yes, it's wonderful, Jacques.

1332
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,240
Like, getting them, because at first she was like, oh, the chocolate almond bread is very popular,

1333
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:09,420
and it's like, okay, that fits with the theme, but then when they started just going towards, like, hey, when the Brussels sprouts are…

1334
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,380
Our Napa cabbage is very fresh.

1335
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:14,060
Yeah.

1336
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,820
That's better than, like, everything is good.

1337
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:17,960
Yeah, it's true.

1338
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,040
I ate that when you asked, like, hey, what should I get?

1339
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,840
And I'm like, oh, the whole thing is good.

1340
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,160
Ew, you can't go wrong.

1341
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:31,320
I don't want to sidetrack, but like, okay, if the whole thing is about your parents,

1342
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,140
we will find you wherever chocolate can be found, and then they make it sure.

1343
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,960
What is obligating Toothsome to make aji tuna salads available?

1344
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:51,440
If chocolate is what is to lure her parents, she should not be wasting energy and time making anything from the savory feast kitchen side of this restaurant.

1345
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:58,060
It should exclusively be about chocolate production, and like, she should be expanding more.

1346
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,780
Like, if we need to cover the spread here to find her parents.

1347
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,240
We don't need…

1348
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,760
Yeah, every one of these should not be for businesses at once.

1349
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,680
Focus on the one.

1350
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:13,480
Also, because non-canonically, the savory feasts are shitty feasts.

1351
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,520
So, don't even bother.

1352
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:25,480
We think created the savory to just feed Penelope, because she can't leave, because she doesn't know if she leaves, they might come when she's gone.

1353
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:29,980
If she has to eat her meals in there, if she eats only sweets, she's going to die.

1354
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,700
Penelope quite likes dog food.

1355
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:36,920
Yeah, that's a good point.

1356
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,540
That's a very good point, right?

1357
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,280
Girls gotta eat.

1358
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,520
Professors gotta eat.

1359
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,460
But yeah, it was very, very stupid.

1360
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,640
And Jock eats.

1361
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,040
Well, I will tell you…

1362
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,140
Because he recommended the pizza, I'm just saying.

1363
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,120
So he's obviously eating as well.

1364
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,600
He's powered by the savory.

1365
01:06:54,020 --> 01:07:03,300
Well, we asked, we had said, we were, you know, like, I forget how we got to it, but we said something about like, you know, like, we'll give you a little bit of oil if you're good or whatever.

1366
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:07,440
And then Penelope had to go, oh, he runs on chocolate.

1367
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,940
He goes, oh, yes, I run on chocolate.

1368
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,600
And so we learned that this is a robot whose oil is liquid chocolate.

1369
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:16,580
Oh, OK.

1370
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,900
That is part of the lore.

1371
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:24,320
Why do you have to, I mean, I guess leaving some mystery is good that you had to like engage in a conversation to figure out.

1372
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,640
But that's number one thing I want to know in the story.

1373
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,200
I don't want to learn about the parents yet.

1374
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,340
Instead of just Jock, it should be chocolate powered robot.

1375
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,300
Yeah.

1376
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:38,300
These are things we should be getting in line one of the the exposition.

1377
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:57,720
It's interesting that Penelope intervened to say that it almost you know, sometimes in sci fi where like a character thinks one thing is like, I wonder if they tell Jock he's like Jock thinks he's powered by chocolate and you can't like ruin the myth that if you ever saw like a rear mirror or something and he saw what's going on inside.

1378
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,400
You know, like there might be some like maybe they tell Jock.

1379
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:00,800
I don't know.

1380
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,020
Yeah, yeah, deeply.

1381
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,380
But but I know you're saying, yeah, right.

1382
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:14,040
They don't want they don't want to tell him that he's like he's powered by like battery parts that have to be mined from impoverished countries that destroy the planet as you harvest them.

1383
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,200
Your chocolate comes from Boston Dynamics.

1384
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:24,520
By the way, in chip wrapping the powered by discussion, I believe, latte the dog is powered by coffee.

1385
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,840
That is that is part of his if you were wondering coffee milkshake.

1386
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,160
Okay, this makes sense.

1387
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,460
Why limited though?

1388
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:34,720
I wonder why limited.

1389
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,600
I don't know.

1390
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:37,820
It sounded really good.

1391
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,260
Oh, yeah.

1392
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,840
Do some of Jock's coffee here.

1393
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,180
Jock has coffee too.

1394
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:42,820
Cream coffee.

1395
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:43,840
But not latte.

1396
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,380
It's not latte coffee.

1397
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,280
Concoctions.

1398
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,660
Does that mean it's is it just beans?

1399
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,440
It's just beans in here.

1400
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,860
But the dude the language always makes you think something else is going on.

1401
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:55,160
Coffee flavored candy or so.

1402
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,640
Is it ground or whole beans?

1403
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:58,580
This smells like coffee.

1404
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,960
It smells like sweet coffee.

1405
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:00,480
Okay.

1406
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,640
And it's beans.

1407
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,420
It says here on the back.

1408
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:07,980
Jock engineers his coffee concoctions using the finest beans in the universe.

1409
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:11,860
Fused with the Emporium's most tooth some flavors.

1410
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,660
The most tooth some of all the flavors.

1411
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,520
That's a last name.

1412
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,860
That does that means nothing to me as an adjective.

1413
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,400
Hmm.

1414
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,160
We're all baffled.

1415
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:21,880
Interesting.

1416
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:23,300
Jason, would you eat a bean raw?

1417
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:30,320
Well, I love chocolate covered espresso beans, but I feel like those are specifically made to be.

1418
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,720
They're still roasted.

1419
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:32,420
That's true.

1420
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,240
Yeah, you don't want to do a raw one.

1421
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:39,800
Do we miss anything about your you had a great conversation.

1422
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:40,440
Oh, yeah.

1423
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,180
The barbecue chicken flatbread was bad.

1424
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,040
Surprise surprise.

1425
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,340
He has no taste buds though.

1426
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:49,800
No, I know.

1427
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,900
I guess humans like different things.

1428
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,800
It quite tastes like chocolate because you run on chocolate.

1429
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,980
Just chocolate with a little bit of metal.

1430
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,160
That's what I like.

1431
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,140
Ah, yes.

1432
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:00,580
Perfect.

1433
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:03,400
It just like go it's like go straight through him.

1434
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,640
It's like hits the floor.

1435
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:07,000
It's going through a mouth, but it just like.

1436
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,020
We did ask them.

1437
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,280
We were like, are you pro or anti Wonka?

1438
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:19,780
And that did make them break character and like immediately like laugh because I think they were not expecting such a kind of complicated.

1439
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:20,940
Question for them.

1440
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,260
And I think they did trivia with me.

1441
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,100
Whoa.

1442
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:29,000
They asked, what was first company to make a chocolate bar?

1443
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,060
And the answer is Cadbury.

1444
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,000
I already knew that.

1445
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:32,500
Did you try to say it's toothsome?

1446
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,740
Of course.

1447
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,820
Hit me with a hard one.

1448
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:39,580
One of the questions did reference Willy Wonka.

1449
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,280
Really?

1450
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:42,240
So I don't remember the other.

1451
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,360
They're playing fast and loose.

1452
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,020
So yeah.

1453
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:51,860
The official response was that it's healthy competition and it's good for both brands to be happening rising tidal.

1454
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:54,000
So she lives all dirigible.

1455
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:03,200
So this was addressed in meetings then that feels like that was somewhat like maybe because I kind of watching her Penelope.

1456
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:11,080
She took the question watching her like laugh and then you kind of see the actor and then you see the gears.

1457
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:20,360
It felt it felt like an actual improv moment of like I think this seems like the right answer to this.

1458
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,080
Very political.

1459
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:26,560
Yeah.

1460
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:27,400
As diplomatic.

1461
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:27,920
Yeah.

1462
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:28,420
Certainly.

1463
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:38,700
And then also a friend of ours brought had bought steampunk goggles on Amazon to bring them and then put them on as we saw them walking by.

1464
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,720
They laughed at that.

1465
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,780
I think we were giving them a good time.

1466
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:50,620
Especially compared to like these families who are just maybe maybe some of them don't speak English or like they're just like not interested.

1467
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,900
Whatever it is that they're just kind of like what.

1468
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,120
OK.

1469
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:53,360
Hi.

1470
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:53,940
Hello.

1471
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:54,480
Goodbye.

1472
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:59,880
They might think that people are people are coming around to do one of those like take a picture things where they charge you twenty dollars.

1473
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:00,460
Yeah.

1474
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,040
That's usually just kind of go like no I don't know.

1475
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:03,320
Thanks.

1476
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,540
We look them in the eye.

1477
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:04,760
Yeah.

1478
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,340
We're getting soaked in most restaurants.

1479
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:06,600
Yeah.

1480
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,020
If someone's coming to your table that's about they're not your waiter.

1481
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:09,980
That's what's going to happen.

1482
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:10,300
Yeah.

1483
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,100
Does Bucca do that.

1484
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:12,960
Yes.

1485
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:13,320
They do this.

1486
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:13,680
Yeah.

1487
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,240
Bucca does do that.

1488
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:19,200
This robot is going to sell me the most expensive and crappiest rows of my life.

1489
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:35,000
And the only other thing from my experience is just I don't know that we have fully like given the proper explanation to how expansive the gift shop is like they're just so many knickknacks.

1490
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:42,500
And you know Brett brought some stuff but and also we haven't mentioned that there's wardrobe that you can get goggles hats.

1491
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:48,060
I forgot that one of my friends it was bought me a hat that I have in my home.

1492
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,260
You have a top hat.

1493
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,100
It's not a top hat though it's like almost like a bowler.

1494
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,220
So they have different styles.

1495
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,820
That's the thing is it's really expansive the different things that no one will buy.

1496
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:10,820
I do some different types of hats and goggles and this type of chocolate and shot glasses and mugs and shirts and high level stuff like in you'll see like in glass cases like a little like member like like figurine.

1497
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:11,760
I have.

1498
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:16,620
Yeah I have pictures of that expensive big price tag on you can buy and I'll read some of them.

1499
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:29,100
You can buy like it says all with top hat on book stack and it's like a I don't know if it's cop bronze like a bronze statue for real and it's fifty four ninety five.

1500
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:34,420
You can buy octopus secret trinket box for ninety four ninety five.

1501
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,780
I'm not going to lie.

1502
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,900
They're not bad.

1503
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:45,920
Look trinkets are just everywhere and you're trying to get a handle on octopus magnifying glass.

1504
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:52,480
Forty dollars is octopus a pre agreed steampunk animal.

1505
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,260
That's a great question that I don't know the answer to.

1506
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:59,340
Is it does it tie I mean it feels right because of like twenty thousand lead maybe.

1507
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:04,440
Yeah steampunk octopus spirit decanter eighty nine ninety five.

1508
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,780
But we've also established dirigible is do not go in the water.

1509
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:08,520
I guess.

1510
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:09,320
Well right.

1511
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,600
Yeah dirigible is do not and yet all this octopus merch.

1512
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:16,680
Yeah right.

1513
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:22,080
Question underground twenty thousand leads in the sea like bio dome is sort of steampunk.

1514
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,140
Isn't it the video game series that's all under.

1515
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,020
I was shocked.

1516
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,600
I was like the poly shore.

1517
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:30,040
I don't think so but I'll hear you out.

1518
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,540
The posters really hit the steampunk elements.

1519
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,420
I think underwater is in is in universe.

1520
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:41,240
Yeah because there's another fish there's another fish statue for one hundred five dollars.

1521
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,980
Then there's all with goggles and jet pack thirty four ninety five.

1522
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:50,640
Who is buying owls with jet packs at this disappointing restaurant.

1523
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:58,500
You know as a reminder when Julie Prescott was on I forget whether she told us this in the episode or after her husband and her.

1524
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:04,200
When they went to do some play the game where they would cover the price tag and say how much is this.

1525
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:08,320
And then when they would reveal it they would just laugh and laugh there.

1526
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:15,400
OK two more real quick skull on gear stand one hundred and twenty dollars skull on gear stand.

1527
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,500
What are the odds that this is inventory from somewhere else.

1528
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,600
A high high chance that that's right.

1529
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:27,700
But then there's also steampunk decorative skull with movable jaw which is for some reason sixty nine dollars.

1530
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,880
So yeah you can you can like have it talk I guess.

1531
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:36,240
Maybe these were all props that were built for one of the dark universe movie.

1532
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:41,300
The dark you know maybe they got ahead of themselves and now they got to move them.

1533
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,660
Well you know Russell Crowe's Dr.

1534
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,620
Jekyll character was in charge of like a shield like agency.

1535
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:55,860
So maybe these are some of the artifacts he's captured of the supernatural realm.

1536
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,080
The whole series is going to come in a big fight with an octopus.

1537
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,560
That's where the dark universe is all hitting.

1538
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:09,720
No.

1539
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,280
OK.

1540
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,380
I wish you'd been wearing.

1541
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,340
I've actually worn this.

1542
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,160
I understand.

1543
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:17,340
What is that satisfied.

1544
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:27,660
On double threat one live stream I had to smash a geode as part of the live stream and for some reason just felt right to be in steampunk gear while you're smashing a geode.

1545
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:31,820
Is it Gallagher asked to wear that type of hat and smash something.

1546
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:35,020
That might have been the connection I was making in my head was it like yeah.

1547
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:41,480
And it was so yeah I I I'd already gotten these for fun but then I've actually worn them.

1548
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:41,760
Yeah.

1549
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:42,080
OK.

1550
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:47,680
Well I didn't mean to shame you and I just wanted to know what I was headed with as the manufacturer of this.

1551
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:48,420
Oh oh.

1552
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:49,200
And I don't know a ton.

1553
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:53,960
There's not a ton there but I just wanted to say so it's a it's a company called a low low low.

1554
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,360
Oh it says it in there.

1555
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:55,780
OK great.

1556
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:58,660
But what I just want to say what that stands for.

1557
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,120
Oh I see.

1558
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,820
Does it say it in there.

1559
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,200
Oh no.

1560
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,580
I never noticed that.

1561
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:07,500
It stands for everybody is laughing on planet Earth.

1562
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:15,440
That's.

1563
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,520
Check out this asshole.

1564
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:19,300
Sure.

1565
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,740
Everybody is laughing on planet Earth.

1566
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,040
Wow.

1567
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,540
That is I think that takes the crown of dumbest acronym for most Southwest Grill H.

1568
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,800
A.

1569
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:29,800
A.

1570
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,080
That's right.

1571
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:36,260
Musicians outlaws and entertainers also the acronym of the hashtag laugh with a low peer.

1572
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,300
And it's yes.

1573
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,000
It's not with the E.

1574
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,140
L.

1575
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:39,140
I.

1576
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:39,700
It's E.

1577
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,200
E.

1578
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:39,900
L.

1579
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:40,080
O.

1580
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:40,200
P.

1581
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:40,660
E.

1582
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,260
E.

1583
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:40,880
L.

1584
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,060
O.

1585
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:41,260
P.

1586
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,940
Just make it everyone's.

1587
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:43,740
Put an apostrophe.

1588
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:45,740
What are they doing.

1589
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:46,600
I don't know.

1590
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,160
Wow.

1591
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:47,420
Wow.

1592
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,560
What a brand.

1593
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,200
You can also you can buy monocles there too.

1594
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:51,600
Yeah.

1595
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,880
I don't think we've addressed that.

1596
01:17:54,020 --> 01:18:01,640
I was also we were in the store with an upcoming guest who I don't want to spoil but our guest

1597
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,460
for phase six sector one.

1598
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:19,380
place is if you look on the railings like on the second floor level that there's like

1599
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,060
basically there's still guitars.

1600
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:22,960
It's guitars.

1601
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,580
They just painted them gold.

1602
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,140
It's Hard Rock Cafe guitars and they never change that.

1603
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:29,660
So to catch that detail next time.

1604
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:33,560
That's actually an OSHA like oh the mysterious organization.

1605
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:35,200
Do you think.

1606
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,820
Do you think those are any famous guitars or less famous guitars they were just like

1607
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,520
let's just paint over them.

1608
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:42,160
Yeah.

1609
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,900
I mean it's like it's thousands of guitar shapes.

1610
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,520
There's a Steve Vai signature under there.

1611
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,620
Yeah that's what I'm saying.

1612
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,480
I'm like you can either like try to find a buyer or just paint over them.

1613
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:55,520
Can I talk about my experience.

1614
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:56,560
Yes.

1615
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:57,320
To some.

1616
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:04,520
So I went to the Hollywood one about a month ago for a lunch on a Saturday with Jane and

1617
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:09,300
I had only been to the Florida one a couple of times.

1618
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:14,740
I went in 2017 a year after it opened and I just kind of walked through the restaurant

1619
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:24,100
and the smell of like garlic Parmesan fries and cocoa was not a combination.

1620
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:31,460
It may be a little crazy but I went to the takeout counter and I ordered like a brownie

1621
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:38,020
sundae and they handed me like a clear plastic dinner plate with a sundae on it.

1622
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:44,180
So then I'm like oh I guess I'll just sit by the water and eat my dinner plate.

1623
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:48,420
It wasn't bronze or they didn't serve it inside a big goggle.

1624
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:50,340
It wasn't even a bowl.

1625
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,840
Except to do some experiments.

1626
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:57,520
Ice cream on a plate perhaps.

1627
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,420
Pretty quickly.

1628
01:19:58,420 --> 01:19:59,140
Have an open mind.

1629
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:06,120
I mean it was night but pretty quickly on August night in Florida it started kind of

1630
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:06,900
sloshing around.

1631
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,020
It transforms into an ice cream soup.

1632
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:09,860
An experiment.

1633
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,580
So a little easier this time.

1634
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,400
So we ate a full meal.

1635
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,040
I had to try one of the baked milkshakes.

1636
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:23,380
So I got a brownie milkshake and here you can see me looking at it lovingly.

1637
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,140
Chocolate is your god.

1638
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:26,100
Yeah.

1639
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:34,340
And then we got a pineapple upside down cake milkshake which is in theory vegan.

1640
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:40,620
And they were out of soy milk and or the vegan ice cream so we didn't quite get it vegan.

1641
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:50,320
And then Gene got the avocado toast and I mostly was the one who ate the chocolate bread

1642
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:57,100
which I only ate a slice of and then ate it for breakfast like three days in a row.

1643
01:20:57,220 --> 01:21:00,580
You took it home and ate it three days later.

1644
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:04,700
I could only eat one slice of it.

1645
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,140
You had two milkshakes to have.

1646
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,740
We were sharing them.

1647
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:12,500
Jason started spreading peanut butter on his chocolate.

1648
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:16,380
Well it comes with caramel butter.

1649
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:23,060
And this is like you have to pay for it but the bread they bring to your table like the Italian restaurant they would

1650
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:24,280
is essentially cake.

1651
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,780
It's so sweet and soft.

1652
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:30,080
It's like the first thing they bring you is a large chocolate cake.

1653
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:30,820
It's sweet.

1654
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,440
It's like a breakfast cake.

1655
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,600
Chocolate almond bread with salted caramel butter.

1656
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,740
I didn't like this.

1657
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,520
I'm glad you had a good time eating it for three days in a row at home.

1658
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:47,100
But I'm like this fed my meal was like okay well at least this will be great.

1659
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,120
I thought it was really bland.

1660
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:53,900
If we're fusing savory and chocolate that's the point.

1661
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:59,020
I know they're going to mess it up with like it's on chicken wings or whatever but the bread is going to be good right.

1662
01:21:59,060 --> 01:21:59,860
I didn't like it.

1663
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:00,880
Am I crazy Jason.

1664
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,240
I thought it was fine.

1665
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,400
He didn't like it either.

1666
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:05,940
I didn't love it.

1667
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:06,640
I didn't love it.

1668
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:07,120
Normally.

1669
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,020
Another day.

1670
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,220
Back to the bread.

1671
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:19,900
I love that kind of almond flavoring and I thought it was just like not enough chocolate too much of that almond extract flavoring.

1672
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,880
So knowing I was going to have a lot of chocolate I went like light meal.

1673
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:29,280
I got a superfood salad and it was pretty good.

1674
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:32,220
Reveal it's like arugula.

1675
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,540
Scared us with that.

1676
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:34,300
You really showed it.

1677
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:37,220
Romaine and avocado and quinoa.

1678
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:39,040
Like I thought it was pretty good.

1679
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:43,520
Gee they told her she was she's like I'm vegetarian.

1680
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:44,700
What can I eat.

1681
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:45,420
What do you recommend.

1682
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:49,020
And they're like oh any of the burgers you can get a Beyond Burger Patty.

1683
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:54,420
So she got to be on burger Patty on the teriyaki burger.

1684
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:58,340
Teriyaki glaze grilled pineapple chutney.

1685
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:02,840
Shiitake mushroom Asian slaw sesame seed bun.

1686
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:10,180
Pretty quickly she took a bite and really made us like a sour face.

1687
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,240
Like she did not.

1688
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:19,000
She was like oh and then I had some and I'm like yeah this is not good.

1689
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,240
Like I don't know how you messed up a Beyond Burger.

1690
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,860
You took it home and ate it for three days.

1691
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,220
Three days really breaking me down.

1692
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:33,280
Like we it was really overcooked.

1693
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:37,300
Again I don't know how you overcook lab grown fake meat.

1694
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:40,880
Was it like tough like when you were chewing?

1695
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:43,480
It was tough and it was like.

1696
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,360
Was it chocolatey did they.

1697
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,120
I wish it was chocolatey.

1698
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:51,980
No like the teriyaki like nothing tasted right.

1699
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,500
And I don't think we have.

1700
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,120
We have never done this before.

1701
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,420
We sent this back.

1702
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:56,960
Can I.

1703
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:02,560
With the exception of Jason's salad my thesis for Toothsome is nothing tastes right.

1704
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:03,460
No.

1705
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,160
Nothing tastes right.

1706
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,000
You compare everyone's stories.

1707
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:07,580
Absolutely.

1708
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:14,320
Everyone has the same story down to the candy down to the savory meals down to the sugary meals.

1709
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,100
Nothing tastes right.

1710
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:17,700
And I don't know why.

1711
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:24,860
Like because every other you know we've said this before on the show you know Margaritaville you give a bet you get a bad meal.

1712
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:29,500
You go back next time and you get an OK meal like you're always you're rolling the dice a little bit.

1713
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:34,520
But for some reason no matter what coast it is nothing tastes right here.

1714
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:41,300
It's funny you say that because you know Jane got the avocado toast appetizer and it just looks off.

1715
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,960
I don't know what I'm looking if you hadn't I couldn't have guessed what you're showing us.

1716
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,240
So busy that's a lot of toast.

1717
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:54,620
It looks like spin on it like an avocado shop tomatoes but then crispy onions a crema and balsamic.

1718
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,880
Like there's too much stuff on it.

1719
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:03,560
I see intellectual understanding you're saying but really all I know is the feeling of what you're saying is that this didn't taste.

1720
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:04,400
If nothing was right.

1721
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:12,980
The only the only exception I think for me when I've been there is I think the milkshakes all tastes like very good fun milkshake.

1722
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,040
I agree with that.

1723
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:14,520
Great.

1724
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:21,040
The brownie was I find a lot of place brownies are like really stale or dry.

1725
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,900
But this was really better.

1726
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,260
I think the milkshake is fine.

1727
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,480
Yeah but that's what they do there.

1728
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:28,860
And I go this is fine.

1729
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:33,260
But like you put a throw a brownie in a McDonald's milkshake and I think it would taste the same.

1730
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,920
They at least there's thought put in there's a throw up or something.

1731
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:44,720
It feels like a milkshake like a milkshake stand that that sure unnecessarily build out a bigger menu.

1732
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:48,260
I would say the what's a black tap is better down at downtown Disney.

1733
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,420
At least it was a year or two ago when we had our crazy milkshakes down there.

1734
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:52,580
I think so.

1735
01:25:52,640 --> 01:26:02,620
I mean they're both trying to do the like Instagram heavy like crazy better that you got the one with the big Jason a full slice of cake.

1736
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:21,220
I think for about five six seven years the whole time we've been doing this podcast we've been talking about well it's the Instagram of all the first year whose Instagram feed in 2024 is still like a milkshake in a jar not a glass and with a rice crispy treat on top.

1737
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:21,940
I'm sorry I'm sorry.

1738
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,040
A dessert on top of a dessert.

1739
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:26,260
I need to save this.

1740
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,740
I need to follow whoever this is.

1741
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:28,820
I need to know everything about them.

1742
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,140
I need to know where to get that.

1743
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:37,820
Who's still who's getting knocked out of their chairs by a tall milkshake in the year of our Lord 2024.

1744
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,620
I don't know.

1745
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:43,380
I know you know and you're right.

1746
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,120
That is that is the copy that they all say shut off.

1747
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,500
It's just like I'm just like that.

1748
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:54,180
I just I'm just deconstructing the notion that this would be like the coolest post.

1749
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:55,960
They're so common now.

1750
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:57,720
Yeah no they're really common.

1751
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:03,960
And like then you run into times I think Mike got well with nerds rope and the rappers still have on.

1752
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,220
I didn't like that ice cream.

1753
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:10,180
I did not like the rapper in the thing still because I don't know if they sanitize that rapper.

1754
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:27,700
I was trying to find something there's a there's a like a burger place in Dubai that is so grotesque in their different Instagramable attempts that where it's just like it's piled this high and it's just cheese and then there's like a firecracker and like a life of firecracker that would like you would see at the Hollywood Bowl.

1755
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:34,900
Or something that's that big to the equivalent of like Fashion Week when you see people walk the runway and you're like well that's obviously not meant to be worn.

1756
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:43,240
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like they're getting to the point where it's like this is just an art piece at a point or some weird item yes like kitsch or something.

1757
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,040
But surely someone can't sit down and eat that.

1758
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:47,560
I don't even know where you would begin right.

1759
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,760
The milkshakes honestly are kind of arduous to get through their kind of there's a lot.

1760
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,840
Well I didn't finish mine.

1761
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:56,680
Yeah I get mine was figure out the architecture of it and make sure you don't spill it.

1762
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,160
Well they actually.

1763
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:00,600
My mouth is bleeding and Jason still drank from my straw.

1764
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:08,860
By the way by the way since we talked about that a couple days ago video proof that Jason did drink from your straw.

1765
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,320
I tried.

1766
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,360
It's in the video.

1767
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:16,740
Jason I bit my mouth there's so much blood in my mouth you probably don't want to do this.

1768
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:18,960
I mean.

1769
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:19,840
You only live once.

1770
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:27,900
The best milkshakes ever had it's usually you know there was a place someone asked about this on Twitter.

1771
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:35,440
Lately where I was talking about Delaware or something there's a place called Charcoal Pit Wilmington Delaware.

1772
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:39,420
It's been there since the 1940s or 50s at least.

1773
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:41,420
They have these amazing milkshakes.

1774
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:48,060
They're literally just the metal mixing cup and they give you a glass and you pour it in glass.

1775
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,400
That's the best tasting milkshake.

1776
01:28:50,960 --> 01:29:02,220
I don't think these crazy milkshakes it's never as good at least here they were like oh do you want us to rinse out the souvenir glass and put it in a paper cup for you with a lid.

1777
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,120
And we're like yeah please.

1778
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:08,400
Well this is they give you or to go you get the plastic to some cup.

1779
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:21,040
And then you have it is a struggle because you're like once I'm done with this walking around I got to go in a bathroom and rinse it out so I can transport it without getting like just liquid milkshake all over my car.

1780
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,380
That happened at the Epcot Food Festival.

1781
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:33,180
I had like the crazy pickle plastic cup and yes I have to rinse this out in a bathroom because I promised the level keeper could have this.

1782
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:39,080
And if you get the mint one which is my favorite it's like entrusted with chocolate around the rim.

1783
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:43,140
You don't have to wash it out you have to like figure out how to like scrub the chocolate off.

1784
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:53,520
There's several milkshakes that are like that where they have the adhesive style stuff around it with sprinkles.

1785
01:29:54,360 --> 01:30:02,080
Because I got like a seasonal milkshake when I was there in December that had like gingerbread and stuff and it was just encrusted with this like.

1786
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,740
And I was like am I supposed to attempt to eat this.

1787
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:11,220
I think you are but then also it's like sometimes with that stuff I feel like it's decorative.

1788
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:13,440
That's how I found it.

1789
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,800
Like it's a Christmas because when I was a kid I learned that you're not supposed to eat a gingerbread house.

1790
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,760
Because like the I mean most of them at least the ones you buy like a store bought kit.

1791
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:25,040
It's like actually the frosting is glued don't eat that.

1792
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,020
Because the frosting won't keep the house up and that really ruined the whole thing for me.

1793
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:33,580
It's not for eating it's for Instagramming that post is going to blow people's minds.

1794
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:43,360
Like I wonder what would if I just posted a picture of just a picture of a milkshake with a brownie on top and there's sprinkles birthday cake sprinkles and a candle or something.

1795
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:46,180
And my caption was just like holy moly.

1796
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:47,320
For the win.

1797
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,580
Would that perform well.

1798
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:51,480
I think it's worth a try.

1799
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:53,620
Maybe I just got to do that.

1800
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:59,220
Well no one will ever see it because the algorithm will just bury it under.

1801
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:08,640
Unless I can catch the tailwinds of fancy cake milkshake Instagram that algorithm which is seemingly thriving.

1802
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,860
I might end up with a hundred thousand new subscribers.

1803
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:11,820
We have our own Dr.

1804
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,660
Toothsome on the show and it's Jason Sheridan.

1805
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:19,420
And I think that if he gets in the lab he could concoct something that would blow the socks off everyone on Instagram.

1806
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:27,580
As far as a crazy contraption of a milkshake hot dog hot dog straw.

1807
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:34,080
Maybe it's maybe it's like here we go.

1808
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:39,840
Maybe it's like a big it's a big like a two gallon bucket full of milkshake.

1809
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,980
And then there's a full pizza.

1810
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,800
And then there's another like a milkshake on top of it with a hot dog straw.

1811
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,040
And then is the pizza touching the milkshake.

1812
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,860
It's soaking in the milkshake.

1813
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:56,520
Could at least have a nasty plastic wrapper still on it.

1814
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:57,480
The pizza is wrapped.

1815
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:01,300
The pizza is a tombstone pizza with its wrapper still on.

1816
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,000
It's soaking in the milkshake.

1817
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:06,660
Can the milkshake cup be a bunch of pressed together pepperonis.

1818
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,740
Yes it can be that.

1819
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,560
Well now hold on a minute.

1820
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:15,760
There's no need to pay.

1821
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:20,680
I can't even get it out.

1822
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:22,980
I think we could do it.

1823
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:27,380
I think we could actually up the arms race that is Instagramable milkshakes.

1824
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:30,120
I don't like this stuff that much.

1825
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,600
I wanted to taste it.

1826
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,400
I don't want to talk about.

1827
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:35,460
This is about.

1828
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:36,660
Likes and quits.

1829
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,640
That's what the world is in 2024.

1830
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,480
I don't know if anybody's looked around and realized it.

1831
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:46,200
Seems like everybody's crazy for liking as of about a year or so ago.

1832
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:46,680
Breaking news.

1833
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:53,600
You know Scott if you posted a milkshake I don't think it would necessarily blow things up.

1834
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,260
But the key is you have to start an account called LA Dessert Dude.

1835
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:08,660
It's only like graphic super close shots of overflowing ice cream sandwiches and milkshakes.

1836
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,640
And then you would get to a hundred.

1837
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:10,960
Yeah.

1838
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,540
And those like labels like the captions that never move.

1839
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:16,560
Like OK so there's this place in Sherman Oaks.

1840
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:16,860
Yes.

1841
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:18,080
And they do an incredible.

1842
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:18,480
Yes.

1843
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:22,400
Because you always see these things and you're like is this an expert or is it somebody who

1844
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,120
started doing this six days ago.

1845
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,020
Oh it's that.

1846
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,140
It's usually that.

1847
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:32,200
I followed a couple of those and I thought it's like oh I'll get to see some places that

1848
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,200
have been here forever.

1849
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:38,780
And they spend so little time on that and so much time getting their cheese bowl correct.

1850
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:39,620
Yeah right.

1851
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:40,560
And then you're like getting that.

1852
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,060
This is a phrase I've learned recently.

1853
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,900
You got to get the cheese pole.

1854
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,580
That's like I know it's like a Pizza Hut commercial.

1855
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:47,480
Is that like the fondue?

1856
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,480
That's like it's like.

1857
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:53,960
I've seen it's like a fondue like they have a big cheese wheel or like they do like at

1858
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,640
an Italian restaurant they do it live.

1859
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:57,060
Table side cheese.

1860
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:59,460
This is like indistinguishable from body horror.

1861
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,960
It's like there's so much like this kid is in a goo.

1862
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:03,320
There's a lot of goo.

1863
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:05,540
I do click on it though.

1864
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:06,860
And I do follow some of those accounts.

1865
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,160
Oh I watch all the goo.

1866
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:14,220
And that's what my my discover page and Instagram tends to be like pizza and like weird chips

1867
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:14,760
and ice cream.

1868
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:15,680
You got a goo freak.

1869
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,340
Start feeding me goo.

1870
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:18,480
Give me the goo.

1871
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:22,340
What's up LA goo freak here.

1872
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:28,740
Wow that grilled cheese was cut in half and they very slowly separated it.

1873
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:32,940
I'm trying to think of like what the copy is for these this type of video because it's

1874
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:36,820
like I've been hearing a lot about do some chocolate emporium and I decided I had to

1875
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:37,860
go and check it out for myself.

1876
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,680
It's on Universal City Walk which is by the theme park but I decided not to go today.

1877
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:46,120
So instead I went and got the seasonal gingerbread milkshake and then I got a flatbread pizza

1878
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,100
with barbecue chicken on it.

1879
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:49,120
The flatbread pizza was bomb.

1880
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:53,060
And so and so was the gingerbread milkshake.

1881
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:53,700
Pretty good.

1882
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,560
I think I'll maybe come here again and I'll maybe try some of the Brussels sprouts.

1883
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,300
I got to see a robot.

1884
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:00,260
Joe that was so good.

1885
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,560
We can just hold that video.

1886
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,960
Let's just start this account.

1887
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:03,900
Cheese Louise.

1888
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:06,300
And start raking in the money.

1889
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,680
Do these things make money.

1890
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:08,460
I think so.

1891
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:08,780
How?

1892
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:14,620
I've seen some of these some of these places suddenly they're like I decided to go to BJ's

1893
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:17,460
to try one of their famous pizookies and I was like wait a second.

1894
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:18,700
What are you going to BJ's?

1895
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:20,000
You don't go to BJ's.

1896
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:23,420
You go to taco shops and you look and it says add on the bottom.

1897
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,420
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

1898
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:27,800
I'm here at Dubai's first Shake Shack to see.

1899
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:32,640
Because there are restaurants to have started to utilize this strategy because there's I'm

1900
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,700
not going to say the name of it but there's a burger place right up the block here.

1901
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:41,640
A smash burger place that has they started doing it was just sort of you know run of

1902
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:45,020
the mill and they started doing some crazy social media like viral marketing.

1903
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,060
If you drive by it that place has a line like down the block.

1904
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:48,320
Yeah.

1905
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,280
And like I used to eat there before they had the lines.

1906
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:51,740
Yeah.

1907
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,140
Totally fine run of the mill like burgers.

1908
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:59,120
But you would think this place is like is like burning up some specials going on in

1909
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:02,720
there as because they started like working with these like influencers and stuff and

1910
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,780
they are packed every every day of the week.

1911
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:12,280
Well there's a brunch place in the area too and Giro del Toro posted a picture of it

1912
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,700
and we had been there a couple of times.

1913
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:21,140
Similarly like yeah it was a nice breakfast lunch place and then it got more crowded and

1914
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:26,540
we even we said as we were walking in with that it's like oh you see Giro del Toro posted

1915
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:27,800
a plate from here.

1916
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:31,220
He did not do that video though where he was like I'm in the valley and I went to.

1917
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:31,560
Yeah.

1918
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,540
I was at the model shop with Steven Spielberg.

1919
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,440
Giro del Toro is L.

1920
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:38,540
A.

1921
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:39,240
brunch bro.

1922
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:48,080
What I encountered was anything but a nightmare.

1923
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:50,120
I'm hungry.

1924
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:51,640
You mentioned body hard.

1925
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:56,420
Some of these do have like David Cronenberg style editing tricks and stuff for I'm like

1926
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:59,880
I'm dizzy like I feel unnerved watching.

1927
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:00,880
That's how they keep you.

1928
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,080
And I have to eat it.

1929
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:06,060
And it's like an 80 year old man scooping chili into a bowl.

1930
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:09,960
It's nothing out of the ordinary but something like whoa look at that dump.

1931
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,700
Look at that scoop.

1932
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,860
Let me hit my tooth some meal a little bit.

1933
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:23,160
I went to a long I went a while back a future podcast where I guess Van Robe show got a

1934
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:25,180
group together and I was like oh I'll pop up.

1935
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:28,160
Well you know I'm going to be up there I'm sure for research for the side but you know

1936
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,840
I'll do one that's you know where I'm not absorbing every detail one that's just for

1937
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:34,740
and then the meal was such that I was like well that'll do it.

1938
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:37,100
I won't be going back here again because I got some.

1939
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:40,780
OK we haven't talked about dessert cocktails which don't work.

1940
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:41,040
Yes.

1941
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,300
Chocolate old fashioned bad.

1942
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:42,940
That's that.

1943
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:45,580
That's cool in your head but I hated what I got.

1944
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:49,320
I feel like people maybe somebody likes the PB Cup old fashioned better.

1945
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,660
But do you remember you did.

1946
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:51,360
I did not.

1947
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:52,720
I did not get any alcohol.

1948
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,620
Some people in my party did and I forget.

1949
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:56,940
I think it was chocolate martinis or something.

1950
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,040
Yeah.

1951
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:02,880
And maybe maybe some of it was like chocolate coffee kind of thing.

1952
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,500
But I stayed away from that part of the menu.

1953
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:06,480
Didn't work.

1954
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:07,260
Didn't blend at all.

1955
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,080
Can I ask has anyone here had an espresso martini.

1956
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:12,880
I hear those are popular nowadays.

1957
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,500
Do those work.

1958
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,460
Do you like those.

1959
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,420
Yeah I like espresso martinis.

1960
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:16,640
OK.

1961
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:22,420
Yeah it's nice to if you particularly if you if you have agreed to go out with drink someone

1962
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:26,020
with someone and you go and you're like it's been a long day and you're very tired.

1963
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:26,720
Oh OK.

1964
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,960
The perfect like cocktail to get to give you a little bit of a there's you know there's

1965
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,660
typically like you know some sort of espresso based liqueur in it that you know it's like

1966
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,060
it's like having coffee in a drink.

1967
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:43,200
insane.

1968
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:45,640
You know espresso martinis tend to be pretty good.

1969
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:46,660
A little more balanced.

1970
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:47,640
Yeah.

1971
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,020
And I had is there a root beer old fashioned on that menu.

1972
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:51,740
I guess where I had a root beer old fashioned.

1973
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:54,520
Not great.

1974
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:57,920
I much prefer the what's the Irish pub in Universal.

1975
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:03,460
And they do a Guinness old fashioned which I really we call we did an episode about that

1976
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:04,040
on Second Gate.

1977
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,520
We call that the Irish bar where you can get hammered.

1978
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:07,880
Yeah.

1979
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:11,860
That's part of my core is I take Sandy over to minions.

1980
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:13,220
I stop off with the Irish pub.

1981
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:13,840
Yeah.

1982
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,520
Get us all fast and then we go to Minions.

1983
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,000
Oh geez.

1984
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:17,040
I like the Guinness old fashioned.

1985
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,840
It feels more like it's a little you know it's more just sort of in you know there's

1986
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:21,960
no risk to that.

1987
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:22,940
The root sweet.

1988
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:24,340
The root sweet just doesn't blend in.

1989
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:27,160
Unless it's fully a dessert with a little bit of alcohol.

1990
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:28,060
Yeah I was not a fan.

1991
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:31,200
The thing that I ate was the oh sorry.

1992
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:35,340
I was just going to say I was looking through my pictures of from this outing and I did

1993
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:42,100
find I think what is a chocolate martini with a like full biscotti on top.

1994
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:47,060
And so they're doing that for the alcoholic drinks too just like pile of dessert on top

1995
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:47,940
of it.

1996
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:52,340
Instagram that hurry you that's just been in your pocket and you're not profiting off

1997
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:52,940
it.

1998
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:53,560
Hurry up.

1999
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:55,640
So I heard they're putting biscotti on top of martinis.

2000
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:59,140
That's one of those things that you do not want to get if you're not planning on eating.

2001
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:02,380
Like if someone just if I did not order a biscotti I don't want you to bring me just

2002
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:02,800
the thing.

2003
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:06,840
I need to know that I'm getting it.

2004
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,760
I have to account for that in my plans.

2005
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:12,740
Also a biscotti meant to be dipped to soften it a little.

2006
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:13,520
Yeah in gin.

2007
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:16,060
Not meant to be put sideways.

2008
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,680
It's just like all of it is wet now.

2009
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:20,720
A little drink bridge.

2010
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:24,840
I did want to get something that where there was a chocolate component.

2011
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:26,600
Stupid me.

2012
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:30,940
I was I did never until I until I took my first sip of that drink and my first bite

2013
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:33,400
of that not good chocolate almond bread.

2014
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,380
It did not occur to me until that second.

2015
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:39,960
Oh this place could be bad in all those years we're waiting.

2016
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:44,100
How am I not trained at this point from all this time on this podcast and all this time

2017
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:44,260
in city.

2018
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:45,920
But this one I was like it's impossible.

2019
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:48,340
It just never even entered my head that it could be.

2020
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:49,540
By that point it was too late.

2021
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:54,520
I had ordered the cocoa pork tenderloin which they describe as an innovative dish featuring

2022
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:58,700
a chocolate crust and reduction along with sweet potato mash and vegetables.

2023
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:03,300
And I'm like oh that sounds oh you know because we're in that area of like what's the savor

2024
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:03,880
like mole.

2025
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:05,720
That'll probably be like mole influenced.

2026
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:09,420
And then it comes you don't taste the chocolate whatsoever which thank God because that would

2027
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:09,940
have fought.

2028
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:13,780
But also these are just the blandest pork tenderloins.

2029
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:18,920
There were less on my plate than there were in the picture I saw on the Web site earlier

2030
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:19,600
in the day.

2031
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,440
This was wedding food.

2032
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:25,460
Sometimes wedding food is great but sometimes you go to a wedding and it's like well that

2033
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:28,180
wasn't that good but they had to rush it all out and make a lot of you know I'm here for

2034
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:29,120
the party and it doesn't matter.

2035
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:31,440
I'm just glad I ate something that it was that.

2036
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,940
But you forgive it at a wedding.

2037
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,800
You don't forgive when you're paying thirty forty dollars for it.

2038
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:41,200
And you're and you realize all the money went to you know the the embroidering on the book

2039
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:42,960
menu that's in front of you.

2040
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,480
So that was insane.

2041
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,900
And Mike I want to make sure you get a little bit of time.

2042
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:53,420
Several days ago we talked about some of your meal experience but I don't but Joe and Brett

2043
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:54,580
don't know about this.

2044
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:58,360
And I we're going to have to go backwards a little bit but there's some stuff you didn't

2045
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:59,320
say about it either.

2046
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,120
Yeah.

2047
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:00,580
OK.

2048
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,300
Let me just pull up my pictures here.

2049
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:03,580
So I wanted to order.

2050
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:08,080
I wanted to you know most people say they want to go and have the restaurant experience.

2051
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,940
I decided to test what it's like to go as far as what it's like to take a picture.

2052
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,800
Take a meal and not to go to the restaurant.

2053
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,440
What it's like.

2054
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,440
Excuse me to go out.

2055
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:20,700
What it's like to go with to go.

2056
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:21,460
So right.

2057
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:27,020
So and this of course was in Orlando not here in Los Angeles where I'm sure your meal would

2058
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:28,140
have been which I'm sure.

2059
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:28,300
Yeah.

2060
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:31,880
They got it down because there's easier parking spots right by the restaurant where you could

2061
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:36,860
go for an Uber Eats or people are Uber Eats and some left and right.

2062
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:43,440
And of course I would you have you have you told me the name of it because they took it

2063
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:43,940
off the menu.

2064
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:45,320
You say you have to say it.

2065
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:45,920
That's the rule.

2066
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:46,460
Is it fly.

2067
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:47,200
Is it flounder.

2068
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:47,900
Yes.

2069
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:49,600
Flounder Almondine.

2070
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:52,000
Oh brother.

2071
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:57,100
To go to the other side of the lagoon.

2072
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,300
I love Bugada Pappo with Almondine now.

2073
01:42:59,660 --> 01:43:01,540
I'm worried I'm going to say it wrong.

2074
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:04,020
Welcome brother.

2075
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:06,680
On the edge.

2076
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:07,300
Yeah.

2077
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,360
So it's really it scares me when to say it.

2078
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:16,340
So this food this was like once it was opened this was like dry flounder.

2079
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:21,260
I want to show them a photo of it because it's hideous.

2080
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:26,680
Well the sector the other day described it as looking down into an open trash can.

2081
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:32,100
Now of course they didn't like just because it was in a to go container it's not going

2082
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,240
to have the presentation.

2083
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,820
Of course I get that.

2084
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:36,820
Why are you apologizing for them.

2085
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:42,020
But I would say that you would I will say this confusion is probably what you would

2086
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:43,840
think when you see it.

2087
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:47,300
It's an almond sliver.

2088
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:48,600
It's just like almond slivers.

2089
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,420
It's like what the bag you get at Trader Joe's that maybe goes on top of your oatmeal.

2090
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,740
They just open that bag and like yeah.

2091
01:43:55,040 --> 01:44:00,680
And so like half like I don't think it's I think it might be an accident that half of

2092
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:03,300
the fish is burned one side and then the other is not.

2093
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:08,360
It's like oh is it blackened trout or something and you're like well why would it why would

2094
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:11,980
half of it be blackened and the other half wouldn't be.

2095
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:14,560
So that was a slant that day.

2096
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:16,580
They had one of the legs collapsed.

2097
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:17,020
Yeah.

2098
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:21,000
And I don't know I'm not always having almondine of any kind.

2099
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:22,560
So I don't know maybe I don't know.

2100
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:23,500
Almondine standards in 2024.

2101
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:28,460
Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about but I bit into it and it was just it was disgusting.

2102
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:32,260
It was so gross and I really I love fish.

2103
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,540
I'm not a picky eater.

2104
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:35,540
I will eat OK shit constant.

2105
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:36,380
I don't care.

2106
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:41,820
This was really gross and it was only I would say like we had some do we.

2107
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,920
Oh yeah I forgot to we say the mix up even.

2108
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,820
No no no no we say that for this.

2109
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:45,980
Sorry.

2110
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:47,300
So we had to go.

2111
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:50,540
There was the question of how do you do to go orders.

2112
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:51,220
Yes.

2113
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:57,300
In Orlando and I tried the whole stand you realize that you had to go I tried to call.

2114
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:05,140
I was on the phone with tooth some walking through city walk trying to be like operator get me to go counter it.

2115
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:08,160
Well they still haven't assembled the phone from gears.

2116
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:09,020
Well right.

2117
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,580
They still say ahoy ahoy.

2118
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:11,920
Yeah there was a big.

2119
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:16,340
Is the answering message in universe is it like Penelope or Jock or.

2120
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:19,660
I was having a tough time finding the number for it.

2121
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:23,440
I was and then I think I did call it and they were like you cannot order on the phone.

2122
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:24,380
Like you cannot.

2123
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:25,600
We will not do that.

2124
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:32,940
And I said OK and they said you can come in come in and do it and I said OK and you go in and like I was saying it's packed in there.

2125
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:38,320
Who's who of Orlando is just you can't you can't stand it's uncomfortable if you were to stand.

2126
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:47,080
So somebody finally directs me and goes you have to go upstairs to the bar to order a to go thing and I go OK so you go upstairs and again it's packed everywhere.

2127
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:54,940
And I go up to the bartender and I take a stick spiral staircase like in your kind of big kind of.

2128
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:59,680
I mean there's a couple of different lamps are unbelievable and then there's like animations we haven't talked about that.

2129
01:45:59,680 --> 01:45:59,860
Yeah.

2130
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:00,560
Right.

2131
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:07,920
Yes on the ceiling on the walls they flesh out this whole world of like conveyor belts and lots of boxes going by.

2132
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:13,560
It's wild animation all the money 95 percent of money went to the wrong things.

2133
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,400
I mean the right things for us.

2134
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:23,920
And I also believe I said this on the show that I kind of believe that they also are stealing some Harry Potter aesthetic as well.

2135
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:26,340
That one especially especially that one there.

2136
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:29,180
There it's a feeling of like being in some of the Harry Potter shop.

2137
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:37,680
So I kind of feel like they were like well let's make people feel as comfortable here as they are when they're in the Harry Potter land and what we own this.

2138
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:46,160
So like we're slowly transit like transitioning them into our own place so they can spend as much money on flounder almond.

2139
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:53,000
Because the casinos that are like 30 minutes away from Las Vegas like before you get it's like if you don't want to go all the way to Harry Potter world.

2140
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:53,420
Yes.

2141
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,860
Don't come in here.

2142
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:55,340
Yes.

2143
01:46:55,340 --> 01:47:06,000
We have our fun treats as well which I would also say like all the treats at Harry Potter and stuff and ice cream and everything is pretty like top notch for fast service that thing in a theme park.

2144
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:07,840
They really nail it.

2145
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,380
And it's been consistently good.

2146
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:12,880
And not the case here.

2147
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:18,240
But so I went upstairs I finally flagged out a bar packed to the bar flagged the guy down.

2148
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:19,980
One comes over.

2149
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:27,480
I order a milkshake and I order this meal and he's he's like oh yeah okay like I was expecting him to go what are you talking about.

2150
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:29,520
Why would you ever do this.

2151
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,280
Leaving you're leaving this restaurant with something.

2152
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:35,840
I don't have those buttons on my computer.

2153
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:36,900
I can't do that right.

2154
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:37,780
It's impossible.

2155
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,720
You could maybe steal a plate and I'll look the other way.

2156
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:46,100
That's the only way you're getting out of here with a piece of fish from the Orlando to some.

2157
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:48,780
Can you just buy a chocolate bar and fuck off.

2158
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:50,340
Yeah right right right.

2159
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,120
I got an hour left to my shift.

2160
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:53,120
You're killing so.

2161
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,420
So Scott eventually joined me up there and it took a long time.

2162
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,440
Enough for me to have a full glass of wine.

2163
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,120
I had a glass of wine at the bar.

2164
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:02,980
Chocolate wine.

2165
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:11,020
And so finally I see the guy and I like because I think I even asked him like are you still doing it.

2166
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,260
Are you still working on it.

2167
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:13,480
Like oh yeah yeah don't worry.

2168
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:18,120
And then finally he goes oh yeah there he points to me whatever and he hands me this big bag and I go OK great.

2169
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:22,540
And we both leave and all the way down the stairs all the way down.

2170
01:48:22,660 --> 01:48:25,200
You're now you have a to go bag and merch from earlier.

2171
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:31,420
Yes and you're and you're not only holding the milkshake but drinking the milkshake while walking down the stairs.

2172
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:32,940
Yes because I filmed a lot of this.

2173
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,620
I'll do we have video of it.

2174
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:41,760
So I sit down all the way out of Toothsome keep walking over to much closer to the entry to Islands of Adventure.

2175
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:45,600
Now we're in front of the theme park to find somewhere calm to sit and start eating your food.

2176
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,440
It's like it takes forever to get from that bar to the front of Islands of Adventure.

2177
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:51,300
And it's not that far in reality.

2178
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:58,380
And I open the bag to take a look at the fish and I have a massive brownie sundae in a to go container.

2179
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,820
I do not have the meal.

2180
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:07,220
I was wondering I was like well I didn't get any brownie sundae.

2181
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:08,340
Where did that go.

2182
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:09,480
It's huge.

2183
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:10,300
Why didn't you.

2184
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:11,340
You returned it.

2185
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:12,960
Well I was hoping.

2186
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,940
You had a hungry boy your same age essentially waiting.

2187
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:19,440
He could have had that thing.

2188
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,960
They're like the fish is under the brownie.

2189
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:23,560
It's possible the fish is under the brownie.

2190
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:27,020
But with all our entrees we do put a layer of dessert above everything.

2191
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,140
You came to Toothsome under the brownie.

2192
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:33,900
Unadvertised like the martini biscotti.

2193
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,120
So you went back on the stairs for fish.

2194
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:43,700
So I'm just waiting what to do and I'm like I could just keep this and eat this.

2195
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,080
I go but I really want to try the fish.

2196
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:49,200
I want to see how they're doing fish down here.

2197
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:54,440
And I was hoping that I'd get up there and they would let me keep the.

2198
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:56,620
I was hoping that would happen.

2199
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:00,060
I wasn't going to I wasn't going to suggest it.

2200
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:02,460
But sometimes especially McDonald's fast food whatever.

2201
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,040
Sometimes they hand you something.

2202
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:08,620
You look through it and maybe you open it or something and they go yeah just keep it whatever.

2203
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,720
Well maybe make it for the other person.

2204
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:20,400
I once like one time at McDonald's really quickly I I ordered a kids chicken nuggets or like a small like yes chicken nuggets.

2205
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:24,320
And I happen to open up because my my kid was starving.

2206
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:26,260
So I'm opening up as I'm leaving the parking lot.

2207
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,120
I kid you not.

2208
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:31,080
It is a is a box full of pickles.

2209
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:35,400
It's not like a large quantity of pickles.

2210
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:40,580
I can tell as I was opening up I was like the weight here is not like doesn't feel quite right.

2211
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:45,720
And then so I had to I had to go back and depart go back inside.

2212
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:49,200
And as I'm walking up I'm like I was like I don't even know how to have this conversation.

2213
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:55,980
But they're going to think I'm making that was just like I ordered chicken nuggets like I got this and she's like OK.

2214
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:58,820
It was like that happens all the time.

2215
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:01,280
Filling pickle orders so constantly.

2216
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:05,460
Was it the one question was it the one close here terrible one up there.

2217
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:13,040
Yeah because I've had a weird thing too where like I forget if I ordered I ordered something that should have an egg on it and they gave me a big fish patty.

2218
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:14,180
Yeah.

2219
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:16,780
There's some like it was a crazy substitution.

2220
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,760
I've had your trickster in the back.

2221
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:24,200
Very low level pranks on people.

2222
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:30,840
If I could see their face and I can't because they'll be miles away because I had mistakes there like you were saying where I'm like I'll just live with this.

2223
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:32,020
This is why I don't care.

2224
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:35,300
Yeah but the pickles I was like I got to.

2225
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:38,580
Yeah that's not how can I cut you a deal.

2226
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,740
How would you like many many people.

2227
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:41,200
Yeah.

2228
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:53,560
I that McDonald's I went to I put in a mobile order once when they were doing like breakfast pastries and I was like I'll take the cheese Danish and I went.

2229
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:58,260
And they were you know running a little behind and they're like what was your order.

2230
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:03,100
I was like it was a nice coffee and a cheese Danish and they went OK.

2231
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:09,580
And it it was a cheese Danish and it was pretty good but I still felt like alluded to going to McDonald's.

2232
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:11,620
Wait I don't understand this.

2233
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:12,140
What happened.

2234
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:14,100
So this story is just you ordered a Danish and got it.

2235
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:15,500
And I got it.

2236
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:18,380
Some stories can be nice.

2237
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:20,680
Yeah I just had to wait a little while.

2238
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:26,960
But it felt really weird when they're like we have apple fritters and blueberry muffins and cheese Danish.

2239
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,460
It felt weird though.

2240
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:31,960
It was just odd because it was McDonald's.

2241
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,600
And it was like cheese Danish was on the menu.

2242
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,020
I didn't know it was on the menu.

2243
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:36,600
It's not on the menu anymore.

2244
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,140
After Jason gave.

2245
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:41,320
Yeah.

2246
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:44,600
OK.

2247
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:45,120
OK.

2248
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:49,660
So we went all the way back up there and he's like oh yeah yeah yeah.

2249
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:55,660
And he took the thing all the way back up the stairs and has the whizzing and whirring and the land ice cream involved too.

2250
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:57,420
So that was melting already.

2251
01:52:57,680 --> 01:53:00,880
So I don't see if he handed that to somebody else.

2252
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:05,340
That's why I was hoping he would just say well you can keep this because we got to put fresh ice cream on this.

2253
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:06,780
But no no offer was made.

2254
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:14,180
So I took the bag went all the way back down and then I was drinking the milkshake the whole time.

2255
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:15,220
And again the milkshake was fine.

2256
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:18,640
I mean it find a good but it's one of those where you're like this is what you do.

2257
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:23,360
This should be some transcendent experience drinking a sweet a sweet thing.

2258
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:31,480
So yeah we walk all the way on the other side of city walk and we post up in like up this ramp that's like in there.

2259
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:34,360
We never figured out an official name for this area.

2260
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:36,300
The weird stairs and ramps Lombard Street.

2261
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:37,180
Yeah Lombard.

2262
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:44,100
There's ramps and stairs and that's where they're like phase three fast food balcony is where Burger King Whopper.

2263
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:49,060
And that's where the bar is and a place called Bread Box is where you can get some tomato soup and a sandwich.

2264
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:50,840
That's fine.

2265
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:53,420
Honestly one of my better meals I had here.

2266
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:53,980
Fine.

2267
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:54,780
I liked it.

2268
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:55,500
It was good.

2269
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,660
So yeah so then I'm there's some tattoo parlor antics happening.

2270
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:02,620
If you're listening to the show you've heard it already.

2271
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:06,520
And I'm eating and trying to figure out what's going on.

2272
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:08,620
And again take a bite.

2273
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:09,680
This is awful.

2274
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:10,560
I hate this.

2275
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:12,220
And I'm trying to push through it.

2276
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:13,400
Maybe I'm being negative.

2277
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:19,000
But every aspect about it these like potatoes just like they look sick.

2278
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,800
The potatoes look kind of sick.

2279
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:22,400
Were they potato croquettes?

2280
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,300
Well that's in there too.

2281
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:25,240
That's in there too.

2282
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:26,560
Those are pretty good.

2283
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:27,540
That's here too.

2284
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:30,140
Jason finished so much of this for me.

2285
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:30,880
I love a croquette.

2286
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:32,560
Despite Mike bleeding profusely.

2287
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,240
And they were fine.

2288
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:33,900
So yeah so basically.

2289
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:36,520
That does not look like one of the things that Brett brought.

2290
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:37,900
Right.

2291
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:39,280
Brett brought potato croquettes.

2292
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:40,520
Chocolate croquettes.

2293
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,220
Yeah so and I didn't say.

2294
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,260
So basically what happened.

2295
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:47,300
In the middle of all this chaos that was happening at this tattoo parlor.

2296
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:50,920
I bit into the left side of my mouth harder than I almost ever had.

2297
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:53,060
And drew pretty good blood.

2298
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:59,520
And so I'm eating this fish and drinking this milkshake with blood accumulating in my mouth.

2299
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:03,940
And it's one of those where I'm like I can't put the napkin there.

2300
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:04,820
Because it's going to.

2301
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:05,680
It'll stop.

2302
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:07,820
But I'm eating my own blood.

2303
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:09,800
And I'm eating fish.

2304
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:10,260
To go.

2305
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:11,900
Styrofoam flounder.

2306
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:13,020
Covered in almonds.

2307
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:13,540
Yeah.

2308
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:14,140
And.

2309
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:15,900
Having made the walk twice.

2310
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:18,160
This wasn't the dessert you ordered.

2311
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:18,800
No no no.

2312
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,460
I didn't order dessert at all.

2313
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:21,540
I ordered the flounder.

2314
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:26,640
And you probably would not have bit yourself on the cheek if you had not had all that duress leading up to it.

2315
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:28,320
It was like a stress reaction.

2316
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:29,940
There was a lot of duress I completely agree.

2317
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:32,440
You should have just eaten the brownie sundae.

2318
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:32,940
I should have just eaten.

2319
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:34,280
This is my dinner yum yum yum.

2320
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,220
I'm a little treat boy.

2321
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:37,800
Yeah.

2322
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:38,860
And.

2323
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:44,840
I think I maybe have been the least negative about the food on this saga in general.

2324
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,860
But I will say.

2325
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:48,920
Bar none this is the worst meal I had.

2326
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:52,060
No question like no question about it.

2327
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:54,500
The worst thing ever.

2328
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,000
And I understand maybe I was.

2329
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:59,380
I don't know I was going to say it's a little it wasn't fresh fresh.

2330
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:02,240
But maybe that maybe that delay.

2331
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:04,260
Is what made it so bad.

2332
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:05,500
Maybe it would have been perfect.

2333
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:07,560
Like five minutes later after it was cooked.

2334
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:11,800
And for listeners keeping track this is still not the food poisoning.

2335
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:12,940
That's still coming.

2336
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,840
I didn't have a weird shit or throw up or anything.

2337
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:17,680
But there's still there are situations.

2338
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:18,940
Go again.

2339
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,340
Slap that on the side of two.

2340
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:20,720
Yeah.

2341
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:21,700
No weird shit.

2342
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:22,460
No throw up.

2343
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:23,080
Testimony.

2344
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:28,580
It's like when there's people who aren't technically canceled but are still awful people for other reasons.

2345
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:31,700
That's kind of the territory we're in with some of these places.

2346
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:34,360
I believe there is something strange in the air.

2347
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:37,160
We've all talked to all these those the McDonald's pickle thing.

2348
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:39,120
Things like that happen here a lot.

2349
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,020
I started going through the one star Yelp reviews.

2350
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:44,100
And what and I do that a lot for establishments on the show.

2351
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:49,060
And often it's people who have a bone to pick with the staff.

2352
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,120
And they're like it was just like they were rude.

2353
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:54,600
And some you know just there was some confrontation on that level.

2354
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:56,840
But that's not what these are.

2355
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:58,220
That's not what these are ever.

2356
01:56:58,440 --> 01:56:59,920
These are things that are a miss.

2357
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:05,800
Like where there's just like almost like aliens are putting the food to is that the secret story of tooth some.

2358
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:22,020
But you think it's about a robot and a lady but it's about aliens because like you know somebody went in several months after opening their out of chocolate ice cream chocolate ice cream and tooth some show what the vegan ice cream mentioned by Jason.

2359
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:23,180
They haven't had that for months.

2360
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:25,100
That's been gone for a long time.

2361
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:27,460
Somebody ordered French toast.

2362
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:32,120
And when it came out it was covered in cheese and a burger patty.

2363
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:33,840
What's the McDonald's thing I just said.

2364
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,840
There's a new way to deconstruct.

2365
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:37,880
How does that one happen.

2366
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:38,900
I'm sorry.

2367
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:40,380
I need more information.

2368
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:43,560
Like surely it's not what I'm imagining in my head.

2369
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:46,480
Maybe just a full powdered French toast.

2370
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:46,860
Yeah.

2371
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:54,780
And then blanket of cheese and I don't know why I can't help you with the why much like tooth some and the dirigible and the parents.

2372
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,080
I don't there's no why here.

2373
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,040
It must have dropped.

2374
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:02,480
It must have been on its way to a burger and then just fell on to the wrong thing.

2375
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:06,080
And it was Jacques who was delivering the food so he can't see.

2376
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:06,560
Right.

2377
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:06,860
Yeah.

2378
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:09,120
People food is anyway.

2379
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:10,660
As far as he knows.

2380
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:11,180
Sure.

2381
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:15,160
This very much reminds me of like an early Twitter.

2382
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:25,200
I don't know if it was a bit or if it was a joke but it's still a very funny image where someone says I went to Wal-Mart and I bought a router when I opened it up inside.

2383
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:26,980
There was no computer parts.

2384
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:30,060
It was just a bag of dirt that said who to.

2385
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:39,160
And that that kind of reminds me of like you have French toast with cheese and a burger patty on it is very alien.

2386
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:45,180
Yeah it's like ratatouille like if the rats didn't know how to cook like if it's like the very good realistic right.

2387
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:46,440
It's a good movie.

2388
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:48,380
What happens when you put rats on your head.

2389
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:51,640
This is sorry.

2390
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:55,000
This pasta is just a bunch of forks in a bowl.

2391
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:57,100
It's not what pasta is.

2392
01:58:57,100 --> 01:59:03,160
Somebody went and got chocolate milk for their daughter and they're like huh.

2393
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:05,000
Like mommy this is weird huh.

2394
01:59:05,060 --> 01:59:05,840
What they drink it.

2395
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:06,980
Yeah this is warm.

2396
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:08,240
Why is it warm.

2397
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:15,880
And then the waiter comes and they tell him about it and he says oh I think the person who made it probably poured hot water in it.

2398
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:22,100
The chocolate milk chocolate milk as far as I know has one ingredient post to that.

2399
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:25,200
I mean for at the factory there's there they do the ingredients.

2400
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:28,880
Once you open it at the restaurant there's no further preparation.

2401
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:37,440
Better warm it up phrases you don't want to hear from your waiter person who made it and probably everything about that.

2402
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:39,220
The human being who made it.

2403
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:43,080
Similar to your thing might the fish.

2404
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:51,580
The only one that seemed cooked instead of microwaved was salmon and it was burnt and then they're sitting and then they're finishing it and people come down the stairs right next to where they're sitting.

2405
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:55,780
And the people coming down the stairs loudly say that food was weird man.

2406
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:57,900
Such a good way to describe it.

2407
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:58,960
That just boils it down.

2408
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:01,820
Even if it's not fully bad it's just weird.

2409
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:06,780
And then there's one more step of this that Jason alluded to maybe but this still might be a separate thing.

2410
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:08,560
Here's a review.

2411
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:13,680
The cookie jar shake tasted like cookies cookies and cream honestly was pretty good but nothing special.

2412
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:20,200
Presentation it smelled bad like rotting cheese or meat that had been left out.

2413
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:26,860
The place itself looked nice but it was kind of hard to eat anyway because of the rotting smell.

2414
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:30,260
Is this Orlando or?

2415
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:31,120
This one's Hollywood.

2416
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:35,840
Now we're dealing yes I believe that this issue I'm getting into is a Hollywood exclusive.

2417
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:36,800
A different review.

2418
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:42,140
Upon walking in my group and eyes watered from the stench.

2419
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:43,700
It was unexplainable.

2420
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:46,140
What could possibly cause that smell?

2421
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:47,500
And then I'm like all right.

2422
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:51,460
These people all seem very reasonable but Yelp reviewers of course you know they're angry.

2423
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:55,820
They're trying to you know pump up their stats or meta reviews or whatever.

2424
02:00:56,520 --> 02:01:01,300
I need a but separate actually before I read all this I had spoken to friend of the show.

2425
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:04,580
Bug main buzz buzz and he said he tried to go here.

2426
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:08,020
He sat waiting for a table like he just checked in with a host.

2427
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:13,520
Oh yeah one second then he's sitting in the lobby and the smell was so horrible he had to get out.

2428
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:21,160
I think this is and this doesn't start appearing in the reviews until like December maybe even after when you went Joe because you didn't experience.

2429
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:34,060
I know I didn't there was no stench but it makes me think like was it a weather thing because it was like raining right a lot like did that was it not equipped for that amount of precipitation interesting.

2430
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:37,020
Southern California and like it.

2431
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:37,420
Dr.

2432
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:38,720
Doosan never did rain experiments.

2433
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:42,620
Yeah I mean I'm one that's the only thing I can think of.

2434
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:56,320
Yeah yeah those comical steam pipes it's exposed I mean that yes yeah it's a big building and that's directly this year's there should not be a stench a stench far before long before you get to the food.

2435
02:01:56,660 --> 02:01:59,480
What do you mean the stench what's happening.

2436
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:11,140
Why are burgers going on this all goes back to my like my like initial feeling when I walked in I was like this is a front for something like whatever to some is the it's not a restaurant.

2437
02:02:11,140 --> 02:02:13,480
It's not like it's not the food is not the game.

2438
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:28,220
There's like a game behind the game for two sums and I don't know what it is but the restaurant feels like held together with tape and like barely like like barely thought out always in in danger of just falling apart.

2439
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:31,080
You know there's something else going on with two sums.

2440
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:38,820
This we sent that burger back and they were like oh we'll send a manager over the manager was very nice and it's like oh we'll take it off your bill.

2441
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:40,740
So sorry it was bad.

2442
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:51,940
Let me just have a flatbread you can take it with you and it's like oh yeah sure and then we you know get into the car and just kind of eating that we're like okay yeah this is kind of nothing.

2443
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:53,620
Eating it in the car.

2444
02:02:53,620 --> 02:03:05,120
I was like okay it's fine like eating in the car and then when we got home so I was like all right it's a little cold but yeah it really doesn't taste great and you had it for breakfast three days later and it was still just okay.

2445
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:10,100
I you know I just thought the almond taste got a little cloying after a while.

2446
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:11,180
There's more almonds.

2447
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:14,100
Oh and the chocolate bread.

2448
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:24,640
I don't know it's weird because it's like.

2449
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:27,480
Chuck is the first robot almond Dean.

2450
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:29,300
Powered by almonds.

2451
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:41,960
I know what you mean like when we went everyone was very nice but there's so many reviews and other experiences where it's like it's not working as a basic restaurant.

2452
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:43,840
Was your oh was your burger not good.

2453
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:46,880
Oh we'll be happy to take that off the bill can we offer you a free glass of stench.

2454
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:56,580
This feels this restaurant is like a perfect representation of what my brain is like post pandemic.

2455
02:03:57,040 --> 02:04:01,820
It's like a perfect pandemic restaurant where you're like everything is wrong everything's off.

2456
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:04,160
I should be eating here every week.

2457
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:07,580
What are you doing to make me not want to be here.

2458
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:12,920
Why do I feel so bad why does this smell so bad and why can't it be fixed in a simple way.

2459
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:17,020
I want to be I want to be up there every day.

2460
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:19,800
Yes you're the audience we want to be there.

2461
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:22,440
We've all still been multiple times despite all of this.

2462
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:23,240
I'll go back.

2463
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:25,380
Yeah I will give it another chance.

2464
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:28,600
You guys probably will as soon as we're done recording if I had to guess.

2465
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:32,700
I have a hunger for it after talking about it knowing it's so close to me.

2466
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:34,180
I kind of want to do it.

2467
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:37,640
Are we going to eat Brett's coquettes of course as soon as this is done.

2468
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:42,640
We're going to finish that weird green jar that Brett brought us definitely.

2469
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:44,180
We're going to be dying the green jar the whole time.

2470
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:47,860
Are we going to ground it up and free bear it or should we be able to go straight up our noses.

2471
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:51,500
I want to order a Danish from this McDonald's up the street but we can't.

2472
02:04:51,780 --> 02:05:00,520
By the way I might be more averse to confectionary extracts that is I believe meant to be watermelon flavor.

2473
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:03,640
What did you just declare about yourself.

2474
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:05,080
You're more averse to.

2475
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:09,580
No I'm more versed in like candy like.

2476
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:10,500
You can tell fakes.

2477
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:12,000
I can tell what fake.

2478
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:15,800
Are you saying you're better at telling what fake watermelon is than I am.

2479
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:16,640
No than you.

2480
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:18,000
No no you're in the best.

2481
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:22,780
Sivako.

2482
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:26,120
Don't use the word more.

2483
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:27,100
Say it's a tie.

2484
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:30,880
I feel that I tie in the watermelon runt sciences with you Michael.

2485
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:31,300
I do not tie.

2486
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:32,920
No Mike's the expert.

2487
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,100
But as soon as I bit into it I was like oh yeah it's watermelon.

2488
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:37,380
That's interesting.

2489
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:46,740
I don't know if I've had watermelon raw candy but I don't know that was twenty dollars to get that bottle that is probably two dollars at Michael's Chris.

2490
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:49,620
Guys closing theories about what it is.

2491
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:51,200
But you brought up the front theory.

2492
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:55,140
We kind of corrected it with the universal owns it but I don't think that fixes the front.

2493
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:57,560
Is it something to do with that they want to make a movie.

2494
02:05:57,700 --> 02:06:02,000
But if so then why would they make the food so bad that it could drive it all out of business.

2495
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:03,180
What has happened.

2496
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:04,220
What are we missing.

2497
02:06:04,220 --> 02:06:09,720
We have a flow chart up here and this goes to here and this goes to here but there's a ton of question marks.

2498
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:11,360
What are the question marks.

2499
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:15,020
Yeah it's because it's it's IP.

2500
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:17,300
It is definitively IP.

2501
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:17,980
Yes yes.

2502
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:32,980
But like when there's IP that is like confusing attached to nothing has no real consistent like visuals like there's Penelope and Jacques but like Penelope is acted.

2503
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:50,820
There's several actors who have portrayed Penelope and when it's so deeply derivative of something we already have and as discussed a genre that if made into a film would be avoided at all costs by the American public.

2504
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:51,980
Yes yes.

2505
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:54,040
I don't know.

2506
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:54,660
I don't know.

2507
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:58,760
It's like it seems like it's a real estate play like it's just like they.

2508
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:08,540
Like we need to gain this space back before because the other one was something called NBA City that I don't know how NBA City which is undocumented at this point.

2509
02:07:08,540 --> 02:07:09,500
Fills the space.

2510
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:10,940
That's what Orlando was.

2511
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:12,000
The original one was.

2512
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,200
I would live there.

2513
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:22,740
A giant statue with giant like fake stone statue of like a basketball player a nondescript basketball player.

2514
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:26,200
Yeah I found articles that referred to him as Jersey man.

2515
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:29,360
That was the unofficial name.

2516
02:07:30,460 --> 02:07:39,280
Somehow it was a giant and then so is it just universal saying like we need to get something in there that maybe gets a lot of quick attention and if it rots away then it does but now we own the building.

2517
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:46,460
We have kicked out the NBA we've kicked out these hard rock people who have made money on our land for too long.

2518
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,620
Things that feel sort of analogous to this.

2519
02:07:48,620 --> 02:07:52,820
There is like there's things like you know I don't know.

2520
02:07:52,980 --> 02:07:56,920
There's there's Warren Beatty doing Dick Tracy every 10 years so we can maintain the IP.

2521
02:07:57,060 --> 02:08:02,260
There's a little yeah yeah they're played in like and like the economy is so weird right now.

2522
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:08,820
There's such there's a there's always a value in big companies like Universal losing lots of money in specific ways.

2523
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:11,880
There's always a value for companies in terms of taxes and this and that.

2524
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:20,140
So it feels like there's some I feel like behind the scenes this all works fine for Universal and they're getting what they want out of it.

2525
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:22,000
I but I want to know what that is.

2526
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,260
Is it they need to take a loss for taxes.

2527
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,080
Is it they're trying to build IP.

2528
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:30,960
Is it there's some they have some weird competitive thing with Wonka.

2529
02:08:31,100 --> 02:08:32,880
They knew Wonka was coming out so they're going to have.

2530
02:08:32,980 --> 02:08:37,700
Well if Wonka breaks then we'll have a sort of like derivative IP we can sort of move around.

2531
02:08:37,940 --> 02:08:40,800
But there's there's some play and has nothing to do with food.

2532
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:47,840
Well my only theory is if it anything food based talking about Instagram because Black Tap comes to do it.

2533
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:51,020
Downtown Disney in 2018 or 2019.

2534
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:51,560
Yeah.

2535
02:08:51,560 --> 02:09:00,700
So around when they're starting to put this together I kind of think maybe they started from the fact of like let's put a Rice Krispie treat on top of a milkshake.

2536
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:04,420
And then let's let creative run wild with the narrative.

2537
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:06,000
That's my guess.

2538
02:09:06,060 --> 02:09:06,500
OK.

2539
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:09,480
Where maybe it starts because they're like we want it.

2540
02:09:09,580 --> 02:09:19,920
We obviously NBA City isn't doing so well and then we'll we'll try to come up with something that's big and flashy that will get people and then they start adding all their stuff in.

2541
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:25,940
And we already have what two candy stores on City Walk like to like exclusively candy and sugar.

2542
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:26,760
It's sugar.

2543
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:28,840
And there's like the Sparky Sparky.

2544
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:30,340
He's has a lot of candy.

2545
02:09:30,580 --> 02:09:31,100
Donuts.

2546
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:31,620
Yeah.

2547
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:35,100
Voodoo is there's donuts and Sparky's and there's donuts in food to don't.

2548
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:37,680
Milkshakes I guess is on is not a covered area.

2549
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:38,360
Johnny Rockets.

2550
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:42,840
But you're going for the music.

2551
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:50,160
I mean you're not going to hear a straight cat song.

2552
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:58,240
You know I think what we saw down in Florida City Walk during the day is a ghost town.

2553
02:09:58,240 --> 02:10:09,840
But when the park's closed it is packed and I don't know what the routine is here because City Walk always seems like a ghost town.

2554
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:10,580
Yes.

2555
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:14,740
The questions we're asking could be questions about the entire thing.

2556
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:15,900
Just the Hollywood one.

2557
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:33,540
But I'm wondering if that period when people are leaving the theme park or going into the theme park at lunch or later in the day is that spending enough.

2558
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:36,920
Is that enough to account for the emptiness.

2559
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:39,460
I think I feel like you're thinking too practically.

2560
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:44,560
I think there's something more nefarious going on here and something just occurred to me.

2561
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:49,980
Is it that we will introduce the walk around robot character first.

2562
02:10:50,140 --> 02:11:00,360
Then we introduce Latte the dog and Latte the dog is how we will get people used to seeing weird robotic dogs in their town and in friendly places.

2563
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:01,160
Is the whole.

2564
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:01,680
Yes.

2565
02:11:01,820 --> 02:11:02,480
Sigh up.

2566
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:06,480
All paid for like and it's the police or the government or the military or something.

2567
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:07,760
But we start with Latte.

2568
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:08,980
The sheriff's substation.

2569
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:09,320
Yeah.

2570
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:10,480
Yeah that's right.

2571
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:11,320
At City Walk.

2572
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:11,680
Yeah.

2573
02:11:12,220 --> 02:11:12,980
Mayor steps away.

2574
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:14,540
We don't know what's in there.

2575
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:16,340
That's not a place in City Walk you can access.

2576
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:33,560
You might open a door and see one thousand robot dogs one thousand spots all like gnawing and like getting ready to just like to just dive forth at one hundred twenty miles per hour and tackle the next person stealing from the sock store they see.

2577
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:35,040
That's the best explanation I've heard yet.

2578
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:40,460
Toothsomes is a sigh up to make the public comfortable with their eventual robot overlords.

2579
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:40,780
Right.

2580
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:41,800
They knew they fucked it up.

2581
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:44,000
They knew that like people started to bust in dynamics.

2582
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:46,300
This video is like wow that's a little scary.

2583
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:46,600
Right.

2584
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:47,520
I know this is a little intense.

2585
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:48,320
This is a little popular.

2586
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:48,640
OK.

2587
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:49,200
Start over.

2588
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:49,760
Start from scratch.

2589
02:11:49,980 --> 02:11:51,060
Stop posting those videos.

2590
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:52,920
We need to put a little hat on him.

2591
02:11:53,000 --> 02:12:03,600
Put a little hat on him and I'll be able to be fine and then they won't blink when they see three of them marching on the street and then 20 and then one hundred and then ten thousand stay in your homes or you'll be mauled.

2592
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:07,620
Guy runs into the room he's got a he's like I got this drawing from some kid in Ohio.

2593
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:09,300
Is this anything.

2594
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:10,140
Is this anything.

2595
02:12:10,140 --> 02:12:11,620
Go with it.

2596
02:12:11,620 --> 02:12:13,280
Don't look into the legality of it.

2597
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:14,420
Start making the dogs.

2598
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:27,480
Throughout Southern California a lot of military bases military contractors all town companies on the west side like Venice and Santa Monica.

2599
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:31,140
Well what happens when the military unleashes Project Jock on the public.

2600
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:34,380
Or Army of Jocks.

2601
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:37,900
Chocolate fueled robots.

2602
02:12:38,240 --> 02:12:39,180
The perfect soldier.

2603
02:12:40,980 --> 02:12:45,500
Oh you know what I would recommend is you come with me and go into one of our camps.

2604
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:50,240
Oh Jock runs on chocolate not the military industrial complex.

2605
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:51,580
Sweet chocolate.

2606
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:52,720
Don't you see.

2607
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:55,760
Well I think we made some progress.

2608
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:56,880
I think we finally cracked it.

2609
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:57,880
Hold on I'll cut you off real quick.

2610
02:12:58,220 --> 02:12:58,280
Yeah see yeah.

2611
02:12:58,420 --> 02:13:00,540
In any closing thoughts or stray observations.

2612
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:02,000
God knows there's a ton here.

2613
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:09,160
They also have like they have art that would make you think they're also working on Toothsome Babies where they have art like like a little

2614
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:14,180
baby versions of themselves.

2615
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:15,000
Little octopus.

2616
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:17,840
And there is a little octopus with a monocle.

2617
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:22,060
But then there is also like kind of like baby Toothsome drawing as well.

2618
02:13:22,420 --> 02:13:25,360
And they don't have this branding officially like Toothsome Babies.

2619
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:31,840
But it kind of feels also like maybe they're soft soft launching the idea that these characters are all going to be kids.

2620
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:37,560
Well that's in case Penelope's parents wonder in and they go like why that looks like our lost child.

2621
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:39,840
Oh because then they don't recognize her as an adult.

2622
02:13:44,200 --> 02:13:48,840
It's all these avocado toasts fried chicken sandwiches.

2623
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:51,600
The savory kitchen of Feast Kitchen.

2624
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:57,560
You know what I think that answers the question that she's she's a Gen Z or millennial because of this avocado toast.

2625
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:58,340
Oh boy.

2626
02:13:58,660 --> 02:13:59,200
Oh boy.

2627
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:01,740
I think we all should make an agreement here.

2628
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:05,800
When Toothsome's eventually does is about to go out of business and they're having their final weekend.

2629
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:13,620
One of us needs to dress up get a beard and like sort of dress age up and wander in in a daze.

2630
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:15,060
We'll see Penelope.

2631
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:15,680
Penelope?

2632
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:17,520
My daughter!

2633
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:20,980
I was looking at you.

2634
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:28,140
I was looking for you where cocoa is grown the hotter climates and you were here this whole time.

2635
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:30,040
Mother didn't make it.

2636
02:14:35,020 --> 02:14:38,080
She got dizzy and fell out of the Dirigible.

2637
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:48,840
I was trying to find you but I looked up the most highly rated chocolate establishments in Orlando and Los Angeles and this wasn't even in the top 100.

2638
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:58,020
I was trying to enjoy some opium but my spark caught the hydrogen of the Dirigible just went up in flames and I was thrown far.

2639
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:05,000
Well absolutely and all the you know between all of us somebody can pick father but we can flesh out the you know there's uncles and cousins.

2640
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,260
There's gonna be like a ton of two-some characters.

2641
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:09,820
I hate to contradict you here I think we should all play father.

2642
02:15:10,340 --> 02:15:11,560
No I'm the one!

2643
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:12,500
I am father!

2644
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:17,540
A real Mamma Mia situation with Penelope.

2645
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:24,460
I fell into the prestige machine and there's even more of me under the restaurant.

2646
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:36,060
Alright this is a good plan and like oh wait oh my god I think we've made it to the end because I see the sector stone that shows that we've completed our mission.

2647
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:42,140
There it is oh my god it looks like is it a little owl but it's not it's no ordinary owl.

2648
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:44,940
I think that's an almondine owl.

2649
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:51,700
Wow it's an owl with a jet pack and it's covered in little slices of almond and Mike's blood.

2650
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:56,700
Yeah and it's got a little price tag on it that says nine hundred dollars.

2651
02:15:57,500 --> 02:15:59,140
Hey and Jason's licking it.

2652
02:15:59,980 --> 02:16:02,620
I think there might be some fudge on this fanboys.

2653
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:04,140
No there's my blood that's why you're licking it.

2654
02:16:04,140 --> 02:16:05,460
He's got a taste for it now.

2655
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:08,720
This is interview with the vampires starting.

2656
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:21,260
Well there it is we'll keep this in our hearts forever and oh my god Joe and Brett you have both survived podcast the ride the city walk Orlando saga multiverse of madness.

2657
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:23,920
Let's exit through the plug portal.

2658
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:26,160
Joe we'll start with you anything you'd like to plug.

2659
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:30,840
Yeah so I have this podcast about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame called Who Cares About the Rock Hall.

2660
02:16:30,980 --> 02:16:36,820
We are in nomination season so it's the most exciting part of the year for us.

2661
02:16:37,140 --> 02:16:45,740
The ballots out we're talking to voters on our Patreon a newly established Patreon and yeah we're going through the artists on the ballot.

2662
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:48,980
There's a lot to talk about and the inductees will be revealed at the end of April.

2663
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:51,880
So jump in now see what's see what's going on.

2664
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:58,660
Also I do have an album out called Funny Songs and Sketches that the title is explanatory.

2665
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:09,180
I think you understand what that means listeners but it has a lot a lot of people on it as well that I bet the listeners here would enjoy whether that's David Cross or Patton Oswald or I.

2666
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:09,240
A.

2667
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:09,240
O.

2668
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:15,160
Debreed Nick Kroll Al Madrigal a lot of very funny people so you can check that out wherever you get albums.

2669
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:21,240
Absolutely albums great and the podcast does it like you ask the question who cares about the Rock Hall.

2670
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:29,560
I think if you start listening suddenly then the induction ceremony will become the World Series and you'll feel like you're following the whole season.

2671
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:30,040
Yes.

2672
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:32,240
Like suddenly it will become sports.

2673
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:34,620
I think it will transform if you listen to your show.

2674
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:35,260
Absolutely.

2675
02:17:35,980 --> 02:17:37,260
I like that framing of it.

2676
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:38,140
It's all.

2677
02:17:38,140 --> 02:17:44,560
I think you're hearing about every round and the All-Star game and now the playoffs and you do make every piece of it exciting.

2678
02:17:44,660 --> 02:17:47,360
I never cared about any of it and it's I do now.

2679
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:49,540
Brett anything you'd like to.

2680
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:54,500
Yeah we've got a lot of great podcasts on the Forever Dog Network in addition to podcast the ride.

2681
02:17:55,600 --> 02:18:00,040
The best show with Tom Sharpling double threat office hours live with Tim Heidecker just to name a few.

2682
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:13,560
And then my buddy Joe and I do two movie podcasts on Forever Dog weekend at Bergman's where we compare a arthouse movie in a mainstream movie that share a theme such as Weekend of Bernies and the Seventh Seal was the very first episode we did.

2683
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:18,060
So it gave the show its name and then we also have a show called Movies Baby.

2684
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:22,240
That's just like a weekly rundown of movie news reviews of the latest movies etc etc.

2685
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:33,520
We live stream those back to back on Thursday nights on YouTube on the Movies Baby YouTube or you can get them as a podcast and we have a Patreon Patreon dot com slash Movies Baby with Five Wise Movies Baby.

2686
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:35,780
Five Wise.

2687
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:37,340
That is good to have people.

2688
02:18:38,900 --> 02:18:40,780
Other people have done three and seven.

2689
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:44,220
You don't want to end up in a lawsuit situation.

2690
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:45,680
Well thanks for doing it.

2691
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:51,600
So glad to have you have you Brett and good opportunity to say thanks for everything overall over all these years has been a great home for us.

2692
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:52,040
And a blast.

2693
02:18:52,220 --> 02:18:54,120
You guys love this thing.

2694
02:18:54,320 --> 02:18:58,200

I organic content.

2697
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:23,120
There's ads in there but we never did.

2698
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:26,540
He would never do an ad for something that he doesn't really care about.

2699
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:29,440
So I decided I was going to finally check out podcast the red.

2700
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:37,680
So I went to the Apple Tunes and I checked out I said where can I find out a podcast that talks about theme parks but also has guys exploring the friendship.
