that we are doing our first live show in a while

7
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,980
in Los Angeles.

8
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,760

And we're very excited.

13
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,020
We got a lot of big stuff planned.

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,080
Very big.

15
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,720
Mike, cut the part where we say that

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,400
we haven't planned anything yet, but we will.

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,960
We have plenty of time to plan something,

18
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,540
but don't use me saying this.

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,240
All right, I will cut it out.

20
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,240
Yeah, this is just a reminder for us to talk about

21
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,700
how we have to actually plan it.

22
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,220
Okay, so big stuff planned, huge stuff.

23
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,880
This will be like a circus times the Super Bowl.

24
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,400
Oh my God.

25
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,040

Standing, working out, Peloton.

43
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,880
Real, this is, we're not restrictive like most live shows.

44
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,200
No.

45
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,160
We think outside the box.

46
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,520
You can even lie down on the floor of your garage

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,160
and watch it on a phone.

48
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,860
Lie flat on your back on the floor of your garage.

49
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,500
That's right.

50
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,920
Don't look at it or just look at it on mute.

51
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,540
Really, you can customize any options.

52
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,840
Anything you're experiencing this.

53
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,100
Multidas, do something else as you consume it.

54
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,260
Anything you want.

55
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,660
The choice is yours.

56
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,580
Be there.

57
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,960

Dog.

59
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,120
Ride vehicles.

60
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,340
The way we get around on our favorite rides.

61
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,760
There are unlimited options when it comes

62
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,060
to these fantastical modes of transit.

63
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,880
But which one is best?

64
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,380
Which vehicle can win a highly competitive

65
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,060
bracketed tournament scenario?

66
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,980
Listen as the track take on the trackless.

67
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,060
Coasters take on kitty cars.

68
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,280
And logs take on dogs.

69
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,400
It's Final Four Five.

70
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,280
Vehicle Vengeance on podcast, The Rides.

71
00:02:42,136 --> 00:03:12,116
Welcome to podcast the ride final four five vehicle vengeance a high octane but even more highly nerdy battle to determine the best vehicle in theme park history here to see through this history is me scott gairdner also mike carlson hi mike carlson here i'm soaked with adrenaline and testosterone i'm just uh it's certainly like with the testosterone is out of your

72
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:29,716
body and on on your skin now so yes the adrenaline is outside my body uh the reason i say this because i used to work on a clip show called sports crash and whoever was writing clips they would call like a racer like a car racer an adrenaline soaked throttle jockey

73
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:40,916
so i always think about being soaked in adrenaline from that so i'm stealing it honestly but but it is true i am soaked in it sorry call what type of vehicle like a guy racing a car

74
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:54,556
person not the vehicle not the vehicle yeah so i was wondering if that the drive was applicable for any of the vehicles we're gonna go through today possible or do they make you feel like an adrenaline soaked throttle jockey throttle jockey

75
00:03:54,556 --> 00:04:10,556
make sure i have that phrase down adrenaline soaked throttle jockey while i introduce adrenaline soaked throttle jockey jason sharridan yeah uh sorry drew barry moore's character and donnie darko's seller door is no longer the most beautiful phrase in the english language it's

76
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:29,476
adrenaline soaked throttle jockey that was knocked back by that jason took us on a lot of door that's something that's said in that movie i it said i think it's a reference to a writer a poet who claimed that you know it's not an original donnie darko is um

77
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:39,676
i think it's meant to be it's meant to be a paradox uh like the uh like the zen riddles you know

78
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:55,056
the zen the zen like uh i'm forgetting the name of them now there's a thing you're meant to meditate on and consider i see this is a piece of pop culture i did not know or have forgotten oh okay so that's the only reason i look dumbfounded i was a real annoying 18 year old

79
00:04:55,056 --> 00:05:09,656
i had all the good posters that's the entire that that describes the audience of donnie darko entirely yeah that's every member of the audience donnie darko fight club pulp fiction all the good college posters but there's so i would argue there's

80
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:28,716
non-annoying audience members of these other films oh yeah donnie darko entirely annoying i i mean partially uh i think uh replicated and and bought as much as it did because donnie darko usually cost uh nine or ten dollars and was available at every best buy

81
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:38,916
so you'd like to because it was a budget film yeah i loved budget dvds it's artsy and cheap so like la confidential was always 15

82
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:46,556
donnie darko you remember the specific this is fascinating this is a fascinating discussion but we really have so much to get there's a

83
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:58,336
keep digging into like your memories of how much dvds cost we should just try to like if you can remember a price as like kind of a chaser after every round if you can remember that's good yeah

84
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:17,516
of a dvd that you just try to throw it in there i love it if they're if they're not in your head whatever but um okay so uh it's it's the fifth final four if you can believe it uh the final fours which is are of course where we take 16 topics

85
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:38,556
and find and there is a final four in there somewhere eventually so the title is accurate right got it uh well i think we will see no comments this year saying the boys don't even understand that how the brackets work yeah it's so cute hearing how the boys don't even know actually how brackets work

86
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:43,456
guess what everyone we've heard your thoughts and comments and we've made it even stupider

87
00:06:45,176 --> 00:07:13,436
uh yeah that's true we are look we're changing it up this year because i think the first four final fours were kind of of a piece and part of that piece is that the word fake was in the title that was always part of it stemming from fake rocks and the things kept being fake but today the word fake is out this is all too real this is a very serious topic we're determining an actual thing um a thing that needed to be determined i think we're going to be able to do that

88
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:39,696
i don't know i i'm not sure i think it'll be interesting no no still not and it's still an arbitrary split up of elements yeah of rides but that's one thing i think to make clear about this that we are we are talking ride vehicles specifically not rides right so as you know classics are thrown out and and butt heads we have to remember we're not

89
00:07:40,296 --> 00:08:09,376
we're not talking about the quality of the ride we will we will be very cruel to rides that are very excellent but that's not we're talking about just what you're sitting in yes so so when we're talking about what we're sitting in let me ask you this do you do you consider how the vehicle moves on the track is the sensation is that part of our process today novelty you're saying no i'm saying more of like is the ride smooth or are we just judging sitting in and the aesthetics

90
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:39,356
of the vehicle this is tough we haven't talked about this that's what i think something you got to be careful of is are we describing the track right are we talking because this isn't a competition of tracks i agree the vehicle does on the track so i think we need to restrict to just if we had the ride vehicle in this garage and we were sitting in it and looking at it yeah so you're are you saying this is tough are you saying that what it does movement wise

91
00:08:41,276 --> 00:08:59,076
irrelevant but but are there not vehicles that where it what it does is inside the the vehicle yeah it's kind of a piece i think i think these could be considered intangibles like oh i can't quite describe it but it well we better figure out how to say the right answer

92
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:28,976
podcast we're gonna have to think of some words it sounds like i've been outvoted as far as my feelings well i don't i don't think so i think you've just maybe not made that a criteria for jason and i i think you're allowed to make any if you want to not involve movement in any of your choices i'm gonna try to not involve movement that's great okay that's good well look and i don't you know and we'll we'll dig in we don't have to talk about criteria forever but a movement it certainly isn't like it's not number one

93
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:58,956
on my list i feel like a phrase iconic is is in my head the word right phrase you might say iconic is in my head which and part of that being would i want a toy of this sure is there a toy of the vehicle should there be a toy of the vehicle not crucial but it's it's it's gonna help at least my votes yeah the phrase is toy attic is the ride vehicle toy attic and you're which you're harkening to jill schumacher in his discussion of batman forever i harkening

94
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:28,936
most are batman and robin which had to be extremely toy i most things i try to tie back to jill schumacher and batman forever or batman and robin uh so yes yes now okay maybe i'll think about the movement in this way if the movement was just if if the ride was just in a parking lot and there was nothing around it there was no pre-show there was no yeah lights there was no arrow smith what would be what would be the experience i feel like that's going to be impossible for you to to remove the arrow smith

95
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:58,916
fully from because again we want to talk so that's an arrow smith soaked throttle machine yes the stretch limo not to give away too many of the things we're talking about what people don't know about the rock and roller coaster in orlando is that they uh you know like popcorn smell they pipe in they actually pipe in steven tyler's adrenaline into the room at the pre-show to get you revved up because he has very specific adrenaline that's great that's something you want piped in yeah you could mist a mist of

96
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:28,736
steven tyler's adrenaline this is not the first time you've discussed his bodily fluids being on you yeah there was one where you said you said that you wanted to go to the deuces wild show oh yeah and for him to like breathe it on you or spit on you or sneeze on you or that you would get covid i wanted to get covid from steven tyler in the in the general admission pit of arrow smith's deuces are wild los vegas residency this is again you know to to like imagine two

97
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:58,716
vehicles uh racing next to each other and i feel like we started at the same starting line with arrow smith and started moving at the same pace and the first thing we talked about it which was like oh i like the song jaded you like the song jaded oh do you also want to get his spittle all over you you're way past me i stall way back towards the starting line you're just trying to get some of that rich guy adrenochrome you know you're just trying to get some spray that's a whole other story yeah it's a whole other part and i'm distracted i'm at the hershey's store about half

98
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:28,696
a block away from that venue you're soaked in adrenaline for a different reason yeah because you're around so much chocolate you'd rather have chocolate than old man's spittle an old creepy man's spittle i this is going to be the hottest the hot take that starts us off i would rather have chocolate than old man fluid yeah all right to each his own um jason any criteria for you is any is anything like a singular aspect of the decision

99
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:58,676
you'll be making uh well i think you know i i scott i i mentioned novelty and i think the the toy attic as might put it that your version of like would i want this as a toy like is this aesthetically pleasing to look both look at and sit in yeah i think is good i think the uh uh is it pleasant to sit in might come into play what are the safety restraints not judging by like oh that's a very old version and this is the very new version

100
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:16,276
oh yeah and are the safety restraints uncomfortable or are they like part of the pleasantness yeah is it like a warm hug from mommy is it like a warm hug from mommy does it make you feel safe or does it make you feel because i've ridden some roller coasters was like this actually makes me feel worse

101
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:28,676
uh-huh i think if i think is so rickety yeah this is all i got yeah yeah yeah um i hadn't i hadn't thought about restraints being part of it but that is is part of it and do we have to

102
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:57,916
have like lock points if it's just a just a strap or if it doesn't really need a i guess we'll see yeah against it in something where you know some of these vehicles it's like part of the the the body of it is where you sit but if if it's if the seats are kind of different than if they're like added furniture to the ride vehicle is that that's part of it i think i guess it is yeah i think it has to be part of it i guess anything in the vehicle

103
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:08,296
decor yeah yeah um yeah i mean i guess you know if you're judging a car you would count the air freshener yeah of course or lack thereof right yeah

104
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:13,796
so all right these are all things we'll be taking into consideration and here's another

105
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:21,996
way that we're going to depart from previous final fours um well a couple things in the past we've kind of worked up

106
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:51,976
appropriate thematic pairings you know like these two are sort of similar in these ways these two fake theme parks are both from films released in 1994 they should go up against each other in this case not only have we not done that it's randomized and we don't know what's going to be against what in this first round so we've done no preparation in that regard we have no arguments in our head because we don't know what we have to argue yeah we're hearing

107
00:14:51,976 --> 00:15:21,496
about this for the first time yeah i am calling this first round the chaos round yeah and it is much closer to actual march madness where 16 seed will knock out like duke or purdue or something it is very similar to the basketball tournament yeah i'm dead serious it's serious as a heart attack it's done in one day in several hours instead of many weeks that's right there's a lot in common but here's the other big thing

108
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:37,836
you might be wondering how did we narrow this down to 16 this is such a wide area there's so many great iconic theme park vehicles and we did not narrow it down to 16 for the first time ever we are starting with 32

109
00:15:38,516 --> 00:16:05,236
possibly the most unwise aspect of this year's competition and you're and you're also maybe wondering at this point so this is a four hour episode not true i hope we'll see because we will certainly see but we have kind of put our own rules in place here i'll just say what i am calling this first round which is the hurry through 32

110
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:35,216
so it uh this implies speed it has to be a speed round not to say that we can't discuss the choices that we're making but i think it's got to be limited to emotional reactions to a couple of words yeah we could try to dissuade each other if we're really passionate about a point right we can certainly attempt maybe we could even at the end go back and say is there one that we need to to litigate yeah but i think mostly we just got to fly off a gut here this is yes

111
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:46,096
this is going to be the quick we're going to start with a burst of speed a burst of uh adrenaline here is it possible that we do this and i'd almost everyone we're like oh

112
00:16:46,096 --> 00:17:01,576
so we all start standing up like we have to pee and we're like oh yeah i'm drinking coffee and it's a little brisk outside today i gotta take a walk i can't do the first round yeah yeah it's possible it was very possible

113
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:30,056
then we get back on and we say hey we're back it's been two weeks and we threw all that out we had to do a lot more thinking about it now it's 64 we've added more we've it was unfair the one that didn't get in yeah uh we're gonna try we'll see yeah you might hear some drastic edits but hopefully we just plow through this thing right and get in get through the hurry through 32 are we ready for the hurry through 32

114
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:46,096
let's do it and just remember this is the law when this gets decided this is legally binding yeah you have to think it as a listener to this show you gotta do it the longer you've been listening to the show the more you have to agree with all our opinions

115
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:59,076
yeah and you have to start saying this opinion at parties or at theme park outings it's yours and if we left one of your favorite vehicles out it means it's bad your choice was bad yeah means we don't like it we don't like the ride

116
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:11,616
well so you know yeah you'll you'll just hear them all random i and we'll hear for the first time what's competing against what even i tried to not really look at i didn't look at the list

117
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:22,076
but i guess we'll dig into the list and i think we have so we'll we'll we'll go around because we it still has to be like we gotta there's gonna have to be breaking of ties

118
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:32,196
um so we'll change up who starts every time so let's start with jason okay as we get into the first one what is it okay

119

00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,060
Hmm.

169
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,540
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

170
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,160
Tick tock.

171
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,140
Tick tock, tick tock.

172
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,240
Tron, sleek vehicle, Skyway bucket, classic.

173
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,140
Classic.

174
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,980
Tron light cycle.

175
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,780
Okay, Jason, what do you think?

176
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,800
Giving it to the Skyway bucket.

177
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,700
Oh wow, this is awful.

178
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,920
I hate this.

179
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,380
Sorry, Mike.

180
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,260
Okay, let's, oh god.

181
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,740
I want light cycle.

182
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,860
Wow.

183
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,480
Yeah.

184
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,160
Oh boy.

185
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,300
Ah.

186
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,780
I was part of the decision and it still hurts.

187
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,360
Yeah, it hurts.

188
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,720
Okay, so last one goes to Jason.

189
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,420
Peter Pan pirate ship versus splash mountain log.

190
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,380
Ha!

191
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,660
Oh, also, boy, we've had a few

192
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,700
that could have been in the final.

193
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,200
Really?

194
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,920
Okay, okay, okay.

195
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,960
I'll say pirate ship.

196
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,920
Yeah, pirate ship.

197
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,060
All right, it's in.

198
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,420
What am I saying?

199
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,460
As a protest vote, I will say.

200
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,780
Yeah, splash mountain log.

201
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,800
It's been noted.

202
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,940
Okay.

203
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,140
All right, I feel awful.

204
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,980
I feel sick.

205
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,620
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

206
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,780
Without thinking too much about what faces what,

207
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,660
what was the hardest in what we just,

208
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,820
and as you look at this list, what tears you up?

209
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,260
I'm, again, I was part of it.

210
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,040
I'm upset about Tron light.

211
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,600
I'm upset about Skyway not getting in there,

212
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,200
but let me say my rationale,

213
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,420
which is we have Classic.

214
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,620
You'd look at it at the auction gallery.

215
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,860
You'd buy it if you had a million dollars.

216
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,340
I think those are in there already.

217
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,440
If that was the first round,

218
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,980
maybe I would have said Skyway,

219
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,180
but of course you wanna argue Classic,

220
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,620
and in a lot of cases, we went Classic,

221
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,380
but that Tron, and I haven't been on Tron, by the way,

222
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,900
but you could tell that is an awesome vehicle.

223
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,180
Yeah, and I think people have compared it

224
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,260
to the Pony Express at Knotts, which we've done a lot.

225
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,600
Which we cut out of the Pony Express at Knotts.

226
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,100
We tried to have things that were not Disney and Universal.

227
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,560
This is very Disney heavy, obviously,

228
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,000
but Knotts, Pony Express did not make the cut.

229
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,480
The thing that really upsets me

230
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,860
is that the Space Mountain Rocket is not in here,

231
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,980
because that's one of those,

232
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,900
you look in the stock report when you're little,

233
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,120
and you see that iconic photo of everybody on Space Mountain,

234
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,720
and it looks so cool, and that's burned in my brain

235
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,240
as being one of the coolest looking ride vehicles.

236
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,240
So I don't like that Space Mountain has been taken out.

237
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,880
But that's against Doom Buggy?

238
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,920
Look, I signed up for these rules,

239
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,160
so I'm comfortable with it, it just makes me upset.

240
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,120
There's a few of these that were more curated.

241
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,760
I think you'd see a couple of these go all the way to the end.

242
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,080
Sure, but the rules are the rules.

243
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,620
And the winner is really all that's important.

244
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,060
So the winner should win in any situation.

245
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,840
Yes, ultimately, that's the thing.

246
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,360
Yeah, any pair up, they would always take it.

247
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,960
Jason, is anything bothering you

248
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,760
as you look over the battlefield?

249
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,300
Well, you know, that first Cars Land-based ride,

250
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,180
that was really tough.

251
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,320
That's a little insane what we did there.

252
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,840
Yeah.

253
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,520
But I feel good about it.

254
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:08,960
Okay.

255
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,280
I feel actually fine about that.

256
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:16,420
To be very clear, just because this ride is not everywhere,

257
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,760
Radiator Springs Racers is the big one,

258
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,980
which is also the same as Test Track, essentially.

259
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,420
So we've eliminated that vehicle,

260
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,140
which is also Journey to the Center of the Earth,

261
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,620
not the shape of the vehicle,

262
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,280
in favor of Mater's Junkyard Jamboree,

263
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,020
which is where there's the stationary tractor in the front,

264
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,500
and then your part swings back and forth,

265
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,460
which is also alien flying saucers in Florida.

266
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,940
And there's a Baymax one, I think, maybe in Tokyo.

267
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,540
Yes, yes.

268
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,240
I mean, I even said, just to do the check at the beginning,

269
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,920
I said, should this come out?

270
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,220
And I was worried you guys were gonna say yes.

271
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,460
And you all said, no, I really like that ride,

272
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,820
and that ride mechanism.

273
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,320
Yes.

274
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,540
That is like a, it's a sleeper.

275
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,780
You can take people who are not at Disneyland all the time.

276
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,420
If you're in that moment of like, I wanna go on a ride,

277
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,700
but I don't wanna wait for 45 minutes for something,

278
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,600
and you know about that one, and that's only 20,

279
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,300
and everybody's laughing and smiling and giggling,

280
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:13,920
that is a very fun ride.

281
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,520
That is a delight, that ride.

282
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,760
And the Florida one, real sleeper, too.

283
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,960
If you go on it at night

284
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,900
with all the different colored lights

285
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,100
and techno instrumental versions of Toy Story Land songs,

286
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,420
blasting at you, it is a delightful surprise.

287
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,740
I should do it, and I'd really like to do the Baymax one.

288
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,440
You should go to that new family-style barbecue restaurant

289
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,660
of Lock Away in Toy Story Land,

290
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,040
and then immediately get on the flying saucer ride.

291
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,000
Eat a big pile of meat, and then get spun around.

292
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,480
Anything, are you Mike Reeling from Super Stretch Limbo?

293
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,820
I am, but if I'm being honest,

294
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,520
it's like you have to take the Steven Tyler

295
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,400
out of the ride, the vehicle.

296
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,260
And out of society and being talked about anymore.

297
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,260
That's a different story.

298
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,580
Should he be banished?

299
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,580
Yes, but that's...

300
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,080
But if he...

301
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,880
Your decision, ultimately.

302
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,900
If there was like a big Steven Tyler head

303
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,120
on the front of the vehicle,

304
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,940
I think I would be more upset.

305
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,880
Or if there was a little Steven,

306
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,700
on ET, where ET's in the basket on the ride,

307
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,660
if Steven Tyler was in a basket on the front of the limo,

308
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,140
and he would turn his head around

309
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,420
and look at you while you were on the ride,

310
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,860
then I would be more upset

311
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,380
that the Rock and Roller Coaster limo has been eliminated.

312
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,520
Hey, you, you're the most rockin' guy on this whole train.

313
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,900
You in the 12th row.

314
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,720
All right, back to the ride.

315
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,860
If it was a Rise of the Resistance-style,

316
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,140
elaborate pre-show and pre-show with Aerosmith,

317
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,880
and like, yeah, Steven Tyler was like the droid or something.

318
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,580
Yeah, then I would be more disappointed.

319
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,660
Where there's a horrifying visage,

320
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,580
like there's a horrifying mini version

321
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,040
that he could turn his head 360 degrees

322
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
like Linda Blair in The Exorcist.

323
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,900
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

324
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,320
And spray vomit at you.

325
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,080
Yeah, so they're like, check out Steven Tyler's hat,

326
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,640
and then this little animatronic of Steven Tyler

327
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,920
turns his head 360 degrees with his hat on.

328
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,280
He goes, that's rock.

329
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,300
Sometimes my scars get caught in the engine.

330
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,040
You're on your own.

331
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:16,780
Does anything, or do you think that anything that we cut

332
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,400
would have stood a chance?

333
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,380
Or do we get the right 32?

334
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,920
I mean, ET Adventure Bikes could have stood a chance.

335
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,120
I don't know if that's making it to the very, very end,

336
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,440
but that felt like it would have made it longer.

337
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,780
You know what I thought about there is that,

338
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,480
I like being on the bikes,

339
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,460
but ultimately aren't you on just kind of

340
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,040
like a perfunctory platform?

341
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,080
A platform, yeah, yeah, yeah.

342
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,920
Yeah, you're just like on a black panel.

343
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,260
That's what, the bikes themselves, great, of course.

344
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,820
And again, we're trying to separate a vehicle

345
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,560
from mechanism, but ultimately everything's tied together.

346
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,500
I mean, nothing is making me too upset here.

347
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,540
Oh, one thing needs to be talked about

348
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,600
before we move forward.

349
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,480
One back and forth that we're looking at,

350
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,720
the rise of the resistance, the trackless vehicle

351
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,440
lost to Spider-Man Scoop from the Spider-Man,

352
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,960
Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man in Islands of Adventure.

353
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,160
Of course, I knew you guys were gonna go that way with that.

354
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,080
I'm not mad about that one.

355
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,300
Even, where is the resistance?

356
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,660
I don't know if that was gonna go all the way.

357
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
It's a cool vehicle.

358
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,860
Like if there's a droid in it, that was the argument.

359
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,140
But when we were, this was maybe the only prickly thing

360
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,180
when we were narrowing it down to the 32,

361
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,500
is that the longer list included both Scoop,

362
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,100
the Spider-Man vehicle, and Evac, the Transformers vehicle.

363
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,360
Yes, that's true.

364
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,060
We were kind of like, well, should we,

365
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,500
I kind of felt like initially they should have both been in,

366
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,040
even though they were kind of the same ride.

367
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,980
I'm actually now feeling a little bit regretful

368
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,580
that I didn't push for Evac more over Scoop.

369
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,700
Because I kind of feel stupid, I'll be honest with you guys,

370
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,500
because Evac's a character.

371
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,860
Evac has more to do on the ride,

372
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,940
and I feel like the biggest mistake I made

373
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,940
is not pushing for Evac,

374
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,640
because he has more to do than Scoop does.

375
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,380
But that's a guy.

376
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,440
What he's doing is voiceover,

377
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,540
that's little arms on a screen.

378
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:09,900
I know.

379
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,440
No, no, that's coming out of your vehicle.

380
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,780
That's true, but the knowledge that you're inside Evac,

381
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,440
still to me makes,

382
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,420
I think I should have pushed for Evac over Scoop.

383
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,800
I made a mistake.

384
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,300
Jason would have walked out.

385
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,940
Jason would have quit the show.

386
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,140
Jason wants to...

387
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,380
I would have slapped your laptop out of it.

388
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,020
Jason would want to Scoop bed.

389
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,840
He would want to make his bed out of Scoop.

390
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,560
You know what?

391
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,440
Usually I'm a little creeped out by ideas

392
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,880
where Jason has to be in a little thing.

393
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,620
I think that's a nice idea for Jason.

394
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,220
I think Jason should try to get a Scoop.

395
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,420
Like a race car bed,

396
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,920
but it's Scoop, the ride vehicle from the Spider-Man ride.

397
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,820
It would lend itself to bed.

398
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,380
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,460
Open air.

400
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,480
But you're a little...

401
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,900
You got a little cocoon.

402
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,860
What do you think you could fit?

403
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,780
Could you fit a California king inside Scoop?

404
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,820
Is there any other podcast?

405
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,080
In the actual size of it?

406
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,380
Yeah, in the actual full vehicle,

407
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,760
how big of a mattress could you fit?

408
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,080
If you took the seats out.

409
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,880
That's a very inconvenient mattress size.

410
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,260
It's comically big.

411
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,140
California king?

412
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:07,560
Yeah.

413
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,560
Oh, well we've had a California king.

414
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,140
It's not so bad.

415
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,680
Do you have one?

416
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,020
Yeah.

417
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,300
Is that bigger than king?

418
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,280
Well it's different.

419
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,060
It's a shorter...

420
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,000
It's bigger in some ways,

421
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,680
but it's not...

422
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,420
I forget if it's length...

423
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,060
Head to toe it's shorter, I believe, than king,

424
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,880
but it's wider.

425
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,120
Okay, okay.

426
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,920
So, but they're both big.

427
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,340
King and California king.

428
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,200
Not sure.

429
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,480
I think you get the biggest possible mattress size

430
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,300
in that...

431
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,060
Might have to be custom, but...

432
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,640
Yeah, yeah.

433
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,500
If somebody can make Jason a custom bed frame that's Scoop.

434
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:39,960
Sure.

435
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,480
Sorry, we're not asking for art.

436
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,940
We're asking for a bed frame.

437
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,600
Somebody has to build Jason.

438
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,640
Carpenter has to make Jason a...

439
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,860
It's like Nick Offerman's shop over in California

440
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,660
can make Jason.

441
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,080
I know they do woodworking, but if they can make...

442
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,520
Custom woodworking or 3D printing massive plastic panels.

443
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,740
So like, you know, sometimes we do these live shows

444
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,880
and people are nice and give us little gifts.

445
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,700
So sometime we're doing a show

446
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,180
and then a massive truck pulls up.

447
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,800
Beep, beep, beep.

448
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,000
Four workers get out.

449
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,060
It's just start pulling out slabs.

450
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,440
Like, oh, that must be the...

451
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,680
Guess Jason got the bed.

452
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,540
Jason got a bed.

453
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,780
And they're delivering it to the theater, not to his house.

454
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,220
I'm not sure how we're gonna move it from the street.

455
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,340
He's gotta take it home somehow.

456
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,780
The main thing to say though is that

457
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,500
when we were going through the list,

458
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,900
we were trying to find what...

459
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,340
And I said, I think the vehicles

460
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,360
that are essentially the same should not really be on the...

461
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,100
So Dinosaur time vehicle is out and Indiana Jones Jeep is in.

462
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,240
And I said, maybe not both Scoop and Evac.

463
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,220
And the looks that I got from both of you guys,

464
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,420
it honestly felt like you would...

465
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,860
I would have bought that you guys would have left here

466
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,120
and then gone to the front yard and said,

467
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,200
so we gotta get Scott off the show, right?

468
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,500
This is where it's course.

469
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,100
Yeah, I think.

470
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,840
What's going on with him?

471
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,600
It's come to a head.

472
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,840
I've been waiting to say something and I don't want to,

473
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,620
but did you hear him in there?

474
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,000
Did you hear him?

475
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,020
Look, we had a discussion about replacing you.

476
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,440
That's true, after you said that.

477
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,660
We did talk about it.

478
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,160
There was a couple names, but we decided,

479
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,980
not before this final four.

480
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,680
Can we get...

481
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,660
At least we're gonna wait until after.

482
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,360
There's a lot of...

483
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,140
With the advances in AI recently,

484
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,680
can we get an AI that sounds like Optimus Prime,

485
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,240
who would only agree with us, tell us he's proud?

486
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,940
I completely approve of both of your diets,

487
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,800
Mike and Jason.

488
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,040
I will never roast you about any of these things.

489
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,260
I booted up ChatGPT and it immediately started telling me,

490
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,880
maybe you should go do something reckless, live a little.

491
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,720
Oh look, I'll be honest.

492
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,580
We sent a contract to Paging Mr. Morrow,

493
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,280
but we couldn't meet our demand.

494
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,800
He couldn't agree on terms, so you're still in for now.

495
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,980
Look, I gotta tell you, he'd be tough to have

496
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,300
in this exact episode,

497
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,160
because he'd say, I can't choose.

498
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,800
I love them all.

499
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,240
And he'd be right.

500
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,580
And he'd be right, yes.

501
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,920
We're wrong to do any of this.

502
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,840
Look, ultimately, we're gonna get to the end of all of this,

503
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,900
and there will be an arbitrary winner,

504
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,260
but of course they're all winners.

505
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,780
Even the ones that didn't make it.

506
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,340
All right, I think that we should take a little break.

507
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,560
I'm gonna put these into a genuine bracket format,

508
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,180
so we will re-document, and we will pick things up

509
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,060
at the 16, wait, I'll just say the name now,

510
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,040
which is the Please Remain Seated 16.

511
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
We'll pick it up there.

512
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,440
Welcome back to Final Four Five, Vehicle Vengeance.

513
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,240
We return now for the Please Remain Seated 16.

514
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,300
We ourselves are on the move due to a neighbor's yard work,

515
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,340
not wanting to ask him to stop.

516
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,260
We're too scared of the neighbor to ask.

517
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,060
Yes, yeah, well, you know, less teep.

518
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,940
If he is an adrenaline-soaked throttle jockey,

519
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,100
I don't want him throttling me.

520
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,900
Well, turning the weed whacker on you.

521
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,580
Yeah, that's true, he does have a weapon.

522
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,980
It's a murder weapon.

523
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,060
Yeah, could be carving up a body as we speak,

524
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,500
like the last podcaster who asked him to stop.

525
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,460
Oh my gosh.

526
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,220
So if the sound is different, that's what's happening,

527
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,040
and if the sound changes again, that's again what happens.

528
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,720
Yep, we'll be back outside, who knows?

529
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,360
If one of us is dead by the end, we got weed whacked.

530
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,540
But we are now into it.

531
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,900
We have a bracket in front of us,

532
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,120
and we can still discuss a little bit,

533
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,780
don't wanna go forever, but we can rationalize these,

534
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,620
and I think we're gonna need each other's help

535
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,160
figuring this out,

536
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,940
because there's big ones going up against each other.

537
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,560
So let's start it off with

538
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,240
Mater's Junkyard Jamboree Tractor,

539
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,980
who again vanquished the bigger radiator springs card,

540
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,240
unanimously versus Dumbo the Flying Elephant,

541
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,380
and I think Mike is gonna have to start this one,

542
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,540
if I remember the order correctly.

543
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,340
Yeah, I mean, I'll start it.

544
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,240
Yes, so this, okay, so I think

545
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,580
the Mater's Junkyard Jamboree winning was correct.

546
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,440
I think that vehicle is cuter,

547
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,820
and I also like the coziness of it,

548
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,080
so I do think that was correct.

549
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,540
I have no regrets about those.

550
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,500
It's very nice molded foam.

551
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,160
Yeah.

552
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,620
They're just very pleasant,

553
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,440
and you're excited when you're sitting in them.

554
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,040
Yeah.

555
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,800
Dumbo is iconic.

556
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,500
You mentioned iconic earlier,

557
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,580
and it's maybe the most iconic ride vehicle ever.

558
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,500
Could be.

559
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,420
Could be.

560
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,780
That thing that I said about Skyway

561
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,240
that I feel like we've covered the type of vehicle

562
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,760
you'd wanna buy at the auction,

563
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,400
like you just saw one in the wild,

564
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,920
you'd gasp, Dumbo one of those big time.

565
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,240
But here's the thing, I don't love sitting in it.

566
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,340
It's not the most comfortable thing to sit in.

567
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,040
And yeah, I like being in it,

568
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,680
but I don't like the sitting.

569
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,420
The comfortability of Dumbo is not high.

570
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,600
You would say the tractors are more comfortable

571
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,480
than that wagon? Yes, I would say that.

572
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,040
Okay.

573
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,360
And there's something unique about being pulled on that too.

574
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,700
I like being pulled along in a way.

575
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,240
It is what's happening.

576
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,460
You're being pulled essentially.

577
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,120
You're on obviously a track as well.

578
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,700
But I like the unique, you're being towed.

579
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,500
Back and forth.

580
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,800
Which is fun and unique.

581
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,800
Being towed is unique.

582
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,980
But Dumbo, I don't know if it's,

583
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,780
it's hard to beat the iconic Dumbo.

584
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,600
Yeah, that iconic is the biggest thing it has going for it.

585
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:40,900
Certainly.

586
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,300
And it looks good.

587
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,580
Also, just side issue,

588
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,920
we moved into my office, which has toys on it.

589
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,880
And now I'm like, what about Skyliner?

590
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,640
We didn't do it.

591
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,220
We forgot Skyliner.

592
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,980
Skyliner is a good vehicle.

593
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,860
I mean, I don't wanna like,

594
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,940
but hey, if we all forgot it,

595
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,420
how was that gonna take it all the way?

596
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,580
Well, that and Monorail, I think of more as modes of transit.

597
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,700
Getting from place A to place B.

598
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,220
We took out Universal Tram too.

599
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,080
And you know what never entered the picture is the train.

600
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,460
So I mean, based on our own internal criteria,

601
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,060
we didn't have a lot of disagreement on it.

602
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,420
I guess we gotta feel okay about it.

603
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,980
Well, next year, final four will be modes of transit.

604
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:24,880
Okay.

605
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,180
Well, there we go.

606
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,920
Now Jason's excited.

607
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,240
Jason's checked out till next year.

608
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,120
An Enterprise rental car versus your legs.

609
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,200
Well, our legs are free.

610
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,460
We do have them.

611
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:40,780
Yeah.

612
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,620
This is wear and tear over the years, but,

613
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,280
okay, to solve this one, I don't know.

614
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
You wanna lock one in?

615
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,380
Dumbo.

616
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,380
Wow, okay.

617
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,680
Yeah, I gotta say Dumbo too.

618
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,560
Yeah, clean sweep, I'm also gonna give it to Dumbo.

619
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,260
Okay, okay.

620
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,780
Probably bonus points for, again,

621
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,580
we gotta decide how much we weight range of movement,

622
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,720
but Dumbo spins around, but also changes elevation.

623
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,280
That's true.

624
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,740
Does two things.

625
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,780
Right, it goes around and goes up and down.

626
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,760
Yeah. Two things.

627
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,800
And some of these just go forward.

628
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,820
Yeah. Boring.

629
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,900
So, something to consider as we move into the next round,

630
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,360
which I think I have to start it off,

631
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,500
and this is Hagrid's motorbikes and side cars

632
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,540
versus the Alice in Wonderland caterpillars.

633
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,180
Alice in Wonderland caterpillars is another one

634
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,360
I was worried somebody would want to take off,

635
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,420
but I guess I don't know.

636
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,860
I don't know your guys' particular fondness

637
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,760
for those vehicles.

638
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,400
I really like them.

639
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,120
Yeah.

640
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,380
It's like a, I like that they're longer.

641
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,780
I feel like the Fantasyland rides,

642
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,480
the long ones are kind of trumped,

643
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,360
or they trump the smaller one.

644
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,760
Like, you know what didn't make it is the snow white cars

645
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,040
or Jupiter, wood carvers' carts,

646
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,580
which is the Pinocchio vehicle.

647
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,220
Yes, that's true.

648
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,540
We never discussed a wood carver's cart,

649
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,520
which is what you climb aboard in Pinocchio's

650
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,060
during Journey.

651
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:09,360
Right.

652
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,680
But look, it's called March Madness,

653
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,240
not March Sensible Discussion, you know?

654
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:13,960
Right.

655
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,260
This is mad.

656
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,380
What we're doing is mad.

657
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,080
Yeah.

658
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,820
We're getting mad.

659
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:19,700
We're getting mad.

660
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,020
That's the thing I like to say.

661
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,620
And then you, I,

662
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,900
it was brought up for discussion cutting Hagrid's motorbikes

663
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,100
and side cars, but we got, when we did that ride

664
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,320
and we got to try both,

665
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,100
the fact that it is a different experience on both sides

666
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,780
and they feel markedly different,

667
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,680
and that, it's a really well done vehicle.

668
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,980
Like that could be a,

669
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,480
every one of those vehicles could be a prop and a film.

670
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,000
Yeah.

671
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,560
Those are camera ready.

672
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,200
Right.

673
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,440
I might have to stare at one.

674
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,840
I'm gonna pull up a picture.

675
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,780
Do you guys have any points on this?

676
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,680
I'll lock one in.

677
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,500
Oh, you're locking in?

678
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:55,880
Yeah.

679
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,860
I'm gonna go with the Caterpillar.

680
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,460
Because if we're just looking at vehicles,

681
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,580
it's like a whimsical colorful,

682
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,020
like creation versus dirty, brutish motorcycles.

683
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:13,280
Oh, you really got dirty in my head.

684
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,060
I kind of can't unsee that.

685
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,820
That made me feel good better about the motorcycle though.

686
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,660
It's a more of a descriptor.

687
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,340
It for wizards who can do anything.

688
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,800
There's a lot of filth in their world.

689
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,180
There's a lot of.

690
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:29,820
Oh, is that right?

691
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,460
Is that what Tagline, one of the Harry Potter movies?

692
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,360
Yeah.

693
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,580
There's a lot of filth in our world.

694
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:35,800
Interesting.

695
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,580
Scott, do you wanna lock something in

696
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,480
or do you want me to lock in?

697
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,500
Geez.

698
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,200
That's tough.

699
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,900
Because I'm ready to lock in.

700
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,500
Well, if you're, then mine doesn't matter.

701
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,500
So yeah, if you're.

702
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:47,820
Not necessarily.

703
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,060
Oh, oh, you're right.

704
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,800
Oh, wait, wait.

705
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:51,780
All right, what are you going with?

706
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,820
I'm going with a dirty British motorcycle.

707
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,480
That's so funny.

708
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,900
Dirty pushed you one way.

709
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,200
And I think it pushed me the other way.

710
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,660
I love the Caterpillar, but the uniqueness of sitting,

711
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,220
got two different types of sittings.

712
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,100
Two different kinds of sitting.

713
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,380
Totally unique, both fun in their own way.

714
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,360
The look of it is, as you're saying, a movie prop.

715
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,040
It's perfect.

716
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,900
This Caterpillar is really fun.

717
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,580
Sitting in it is fun, but I would say

718
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:25,120
there's nothing else that feels like Hagrid.

719
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,180
I mean, I guess there's similar things,

720
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,260
I guess like Pony Express or something,

721
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,340
I assume what Tron feels like, but I don't know.

722
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:38,740
I think this, the Hagrid's recreates a ride vehicle

723
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:42,820
from a movie in a perfect way and doesn't,

724
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,500
I don't know why I don't say cheap out,

725
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,000
but I can imagine a version of it like 10 or 20 years before

726
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,420
where they're just sort of suggesting that ride vehicle

727
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,780
and you're sitting in little chairs.

728
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,220
I think they nailed it.

729
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,080
It wouldn't have looked as, and you know what, look,

730
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,300
we pulled out ET and I think ultimately,

731
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,820
well, it's so cool to sit on a bike and that that flies.

732
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,080
They didn't go all the way.

733
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,420
And they don't really look like the movie.

734
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,900
It's also confusing ET a little bit.

735
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,540
It's a bunch of bikes all next to each other.

736
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,420
How, you don't get to see ET pop up

737
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,300
and you know that it's there, but he's not turning around

738
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,940
and looking at you like Steven Tyler.

739
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:23,200
Ooh.

740
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,000
You know what, that way we got,

741
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,360
getting to do it both sidecar and, yeah, yeah,

742
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,600
I think you talked me into it with that.

743
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,640
I think I'm going with the, and there's gonna be other,

744
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,040
look, cute is represented.

745
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,460
Cute is represented already with Dumbo.

746
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,300
That was gonna be a battle of the cute

747
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,720
and I think Dumbo takes the battle of the cute.

748
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,820
And we love cute here on this podcast,

749
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,120
but there should be some realism and some dirt

750
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,780
and this represented in this tournament as well

751
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,800
and that's what this is.

752
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,080
Vehicles get dirty.

753
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:55,660
Dirty.

754
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,560
Monster trucks, dirt bikes.

755
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,060
It's right there in the name.

756
00:48:59,120 --> 00:48:59,520
Right.

757
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,060
And I would say sometimes you get one of those caterpillars

758
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,920
and it's dirty and not in a fun way.

759
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,180
It looks just kind of like the paint

760
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,960
hasn't been freshened up in a while.

761
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,620
Hmm.

762
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,700
It doesn't always look like a fresh caterpillar.

763
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,500
Not an artifice kind of dirt.

764
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,000
Right.

765
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,740
Okay, I feel hesitantly comfortable with this.

766
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,200
I think the recurring thing with all of these

767
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,480
is it's less us yelling at each other,

768
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,860
arguing with each other and more just it's hemming and hawing.

769
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,800
These are the real winners of all of these are hems and haws.

770
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,420
Yeah.

771
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,300
It comes down to two and it's an even tie.

772
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,340
Well, I think there might be-

773
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,260
We can get some yelling in there.

774
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,240
I think there's about to be some yelling, honestly.

775
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:37,740
Uh-oh.

776
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,540
As far as the next matchup.

777
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,220
Okay, watch those levels, Mike.

778
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,680
Because I think Jason leads the discussion

779
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,580
or makes the first choice if you want

780
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:50,200
on Big Thunder Mountain Mind Train versus Spider-Man Scoop.

781
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,780
I'm going to start off the discussion.

782
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,820
I wonder where.

783
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,620
I wonder where.

784
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,940
I'm going to punt my voting.

785
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,080
Well, one of you already or if not both of you have already done it.

786
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,920
So Big Thunder Mountain, if we're just looking at vehicles,

787
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,680
ooh, this is tough because we can't not mention range of movement.

788
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,040
Big Thunder Mountain, kind of interesting.

789
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,240
It's a train, changes elevations, moves around a lot.

790
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,600
Scoop also, you know, kind of swivels you a lot,

791
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,720
hooks into an elevator at some point,

792
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,480
but it's also just a big mold of plastic.

793
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,080
So if we're just stepping back and looking at the vehicles

794
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,920
and inspecting the vehicles.

795
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,080
Oh, wow.

796
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,280
I think it might have to be Big Thunder Mountain.

797
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,380
Oh, wow.

798
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:43,780
Shots.

799
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:44,880
Wow.

800
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,380
Wow.

801
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,580
You know, the chaos round has just inspired me.

802
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:52,520
It's infected me like a rich man's adrenochrome sweat.

803
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,480
OK, and I feel I'm off the leash.

804
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,360
I'm like the secret lies of pets.

805
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,260
I'm unleashed.

806
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,400
Imagine though being you're leaving all your teenage dreams behind.

807
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:07,080
But my childhood dreams, young childhood,

808
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,140
Big Thunder Mountain was just scary enough.

809
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,380
You should write your own.

810
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,140
This isn't just an idea I had.

811
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,000
This is a side note.

812
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:18,000
If we could write a parody of Katy Perry's teenage dreams song,

813
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
which I think is one of my favorite Katy Perry songs,

814
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,020
not the favorite,

815
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,160
well, write it about you and Islands of Adventure.

816
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,260
Oh, OK.

817
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,960
Yeah, because I well, I say to you when we were walking to our cars

818
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,280
the other night, I was like my YouTube subscriptions and algorithms

819
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,580
are now just like old theme park clips,

820
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,540
weird, weird German guy opening packs of trading cards and

821
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:46,140
dead malls, dead and dying malls.

822
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:46,540
Right.

823
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,840
So all stuff I liked as a childhood,

824
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,240
preferably the malls were not dead at the time.

825
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,640
That's the female X-Men is a storm.

826
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,120
Yes. Yeah. OK.

827
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:03,120
The opening lines of this song are I think storms pretty without any makeup

828
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,160
on being part of entry.

829
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,700
I'm grabbing some sin of bond.

830
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,340
Perfect. Great.

831
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,960
We're off to the races.

832
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,620
Well, where does that take you, Mike?

833
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,080
In the new and then another part of the song.

834
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,300
I mean, I meant that I mean, feel free, but also.

835
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,640
Oh, and also we forgot to check for any DVD prices in Jason's brain.

836
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,000
Oh, yeah. He's teenage dreams.

837
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,700
But no, I mean, of course, of course, of course.

838
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,140
Yeah. Big Thunder Mountain versus Scoop.

839
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,540
I think it's got to be Big Thunder.

840
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,120
Yeah, I love Scoop and Big Thunder is such, you know,

841
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,480
I don't have to explain, honestly.

842
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,980
No, I don't either. I'm going Big Thunder Man.

843
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,680
Look, I didn't know if we hadn't talked about this stuff forever.

844
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,160
I didn't know Scoop. I didn't know this Scoop.

845
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,880
We all say Scoop is and then it's Scoop and Scoop and Scoop and Scoop

846
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,700
and even Scoop, you know, it's tough, but I'm going to have to go Scoop.

847
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,600
I didn't know the name of Scoop.

848
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,500
And you're right. Ultimately, it's molded plastic.

849
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,440
It's great. Yeah, it's great.

850
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,340
And mechanism wise, one of the squinching.

851
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,620
This is going to happen a lot with these vehicles.

852
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,340
If it's like if it's a vehicle, like if it was the Spider Mobile,

853
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,720
which I believe was the name of his dumb car.

854
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,800
Yeah, that was his car in the 70s or something.

855
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,620
They all had cars.

856
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,080
It's obviously the Batmobile, we all know, but Superman definitely had a.

857
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,880
Yeah. And like Joker has a car like the Joker mobile.

858
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,000
Like here and there, all the characters eventually have mobiles.

859
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,060
Helicopter with his name on it.

860
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,100
Oh, yeah.

861
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,300
This is for he didn't have that in the movie.

862
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,640
No, he didn't.

863
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,540
So, yeah, if it's just yeah.

864
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,200
OK, I feel good. Big Thunder.

865
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,940
You know, what else didn't make it to the 32 is the

866
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,200
the web slingers, big red box.

867
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,680
Oh, right. Web slingers, miniature circuit city boxes.

868
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,060
Within the building that is also a big circuit city box.

869
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,760
There is. Yeah, there's an element of that ride that makes you feel like

870
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,520
you're on a conveyor, like you're in like a factory kind of being,

871
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,460
I don't know, processed in some way.

872
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,960
This is the way the whole thing moves.

873
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,540
It feels like almost like on Radiator Springs when you're getting like

874
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,200
your wheels checked or you're getting a new coat of paint.

875
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,240
Oh, yeah. There's just something about it where it's like

876
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,280
you go to the station, you go to the station.

877
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,420
I Jason, do you want to throw the next category to to Mike?

878
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,260
Sure, Mike, this next category, you got Slinky Dog Dash,

879
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,000
the Slinky Dog Dash vehicle versus the PeopleMover car.

880
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,360
Who is right?

881
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,720
Who will always be right?

882
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:28,340
This is interesting because PeopleMover,

883
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,120
I think we all have a lot of affection for it.

884
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,220
It's a little blue box, essentially, but throwing out boxes.

885
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:41,740
But it's I would say is of all the boxes, it's the most comfortable.

886
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,220
Box, maybe. Yeah.

887
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,400
It's like being in a little private booth.

888
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,560
Yeah, like a better Vegas luxury box or a.

889
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:57,400
Yeah. If they could sell like cabanas, like a Vegas pool, that would be like

890
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,960
you could set it on the PeopleMover track and ride it around like there would be

891
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,680
VIP PeopleMover boxes.

892
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,860
Yeah. With like a little more shade and like a bottle of Grey Goose.

893
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,880
Oh, God, they should.

894
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,760
This is a really good like I'm not usually for the like charge up ideas,

895
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,280
but shape back stuff.

896
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:20,780
But oh, I would love the bottle service on the bottle service on the PeopleMover

897
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,480
would be a huge hit.

898
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,440
And you get multiple laps. You get like, you know, you can spend a couple hours.

899
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,920
Yeah, you can do it all day.

900
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:28,900
Yeah. If you want.

901
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,560
This is such a good every eight or every tenth car is like the bottle service

902
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:38,200
car on the PeopleMover because it is a comfortable seat compared to,

903
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,080
you know, other theme park rides, because that's what it's designed to chill.

904
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:41,860
You're designed.

905
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,040
You're supposed to chill out on it.

906
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,840
If you were the group had bottle service on the PeopleMover

907
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:51,300
and you can hang out there for hours, would you split it up with people if you want?

908
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,320
Yeah. Would you?

909
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,860
I feel like three thousand dollars would be fine.

910
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,000
You'd never forget that day.

911
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,160
So sick you are.

912
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,120
But I agree with you.

913
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,080
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

914
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,560
If I had the money, sure.

915
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,360
So, OK, I've given Disney a great idea here.

916
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,340
But Slinky Dog is maybe

917
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:18,640
and I'm trying to think of before I make this point, so I don't seem like a moron.

918
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:24,400
Is there a better representation of sitting inside a character

919
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,080
than Slinky Dog?

920
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,080
I don't think on this list.

921
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:28,800
Not on this list.

922
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,500
Caterpillar just went out. Right.

923
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,080
So that sort of feels like the dream from my kid brain.

924
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,100
It's like, oh, my God, I'm sitting inside or on top of a character from the movie.

925
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,700
And he looks just like the character in the movie.

926
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,860
I love the care. Slinky's awesome character.

927
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,680
I guess it's what are you prioritizing sitting on or in a character's body

928
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,180
versus comfort?

929
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,140
Well, right. Florida PeopleMover, like you say, it's very comfortable.

930
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,440
It's very relaxing.

931
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,480
I was talking to my dad about this the other day.

932
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,780
He's like, look, I always liked Florida Tomorrowland

933
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,980
because it was very like all of those rides early on.

934
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,160
We're super relaxed.

935
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,140
Florida Tomorrowland?

936
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,680
Yeah, Florida Tomorrowland.

937
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,960
No, not Space Mountain.

938
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,040
But like if you had wings.

939
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,780
Oh, yes. PeopleMover and the Carousel of Progress.

940
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,520
Yeah, that's a good point.

941
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,900
But but as we said at the start of this,

942
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,280
we got to take the ride away.

943
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,940
Yeah. And it just has to be the vehicle.

944
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,920
Yeah. So even though those seats are comfortable,

945
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:35,180
we're not getting the comforting experience of being on the PeopleMover.

946
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:41,320
So you're left with a nice seat, fine seat, interesting little box.

947
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,180
And I think even though it's less comfortable

948
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:50,940
sitting inside of Slinky, one of the best characters in Pixar history

949
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,320
wins out. Wow. Wow.

950
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,180
And a great representation, better than the Caterpillar, I would say.

951
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,960
It is. Yeah.

952
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:04,080
Big two. It's a really satisfying character to see big.

953
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,140
And when it pulls into the station and you watch that smile,

954
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,700
yeah, you see people on it.

955
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,740
I remember watching videos of it getting delivered, of it pulling up

956
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,760
to Hollywood studios.

957
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:19,360
I also think I think this is a strange idea, the idea that it's

958
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,520
uncomfortable in there.

959
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:24,740
It's not like being in a, you know, you like sitting across from your friends

960
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,040
or like being seated backwards in the PeopleMover.

961
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:33,660
I'm also I'm trying to like not throw out the Disneyland one with a little roof.

962
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:38,660
Sure. No, probably aesthetically the better design.

963
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:43,240
Maybe kind of over the years as they added more and more safety bars

964
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,320
looked uglier and uglier. Right.

965
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:45,960
Sure. Sure.

966
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:52,200
But as I said, I was remembering like some smaller regional parks I was at, like

967
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,120
I was thinking about the sky bucket and I looked up pictures and they did have a full

968
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,840
floor, but I definitely remember riding some sky bucket like rides

969
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,880
where there was just like a square hole in the middle.

970
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,880
And they're like, don't worry, you won't fall through.

971
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,020
And thinking back, I'm like, why was there just a hole on this thing

972
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,240
with no seatbelt? Like, why?

973
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,760
So a plus of a lot of these is no hole.

974
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,080
No hole. Yeah.

975
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,280
You're not falling out of most of these vehicles.

976
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,120
I think, you know, I think your argument really won me over.

977
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,820
I think I'm slinky. Yeah.

978
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,660
Yeah. Jason, what would you have said?

979
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:35,420
Well, I actually was going to, you know, in the in the interest of making it

980
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:40,780
interesting, I was going to say PeopleMover because my concern is that

981
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:46,580
we end up with a just a lot of cute ride vehicles and that novelty outweighs

982
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,600
comfort for the whole bracket.

983
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,420
It wasn't cute. Yeah, we got a lot.

984
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:51,400
I went with it so far.

985
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,580
Now it's even, I'd say, between cute and dirty.

986
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,880
Yeah. I guess if we're discovering a dirty component, most maybe most right.

987
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,840
Yeah. Let's fall into those categories.

988
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:05,540
But I would like to see one little box go all the way.

989
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,880
I would. Well, I don't happen in here, pal.

990
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,360
OK, fair enough.

991
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,820
Look, I'm not. I'm not.

992
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:12,960
Dreams in a little box.

993
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,800
Yeah. And shove them.

994
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,320
Um, this next one,

995
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,560
Mike, you want to do the honor?

996
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,360
I think I'm. Yeah, it's Haunted Mansion, Doombuggy versus Mr.

997
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,340
Toad Motorcar. Wow.

998
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,960
This is interesting.

999
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:34,040
Yeah. And let's I mean, now the dirty and cute are the sort of things

1000
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,780
where we've really separated vehicles by.

1001
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,680
These are both.

1002
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,280
Well, Mr. Toads is more cute, I guess.

1003
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,060
It's a cute little again, but it is also a dirty British motorcar.

1004
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1005
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,840
So is it boxed out by Hagrid's in some way?

1006
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,120
I don't know. That's not its fault.

1007
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,480
That's not it. Got in first Haunted Mansion, Doombuggy.

1008
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,820
I would argue.

1009
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,080
Doesn't look very good.

1010
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,100
Isn't visually that interesting to me.

1011
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,940
It's famous because of the ride.

1012
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,360
And by the way, it's kind of representing Omni-Mover shells in general.

1013
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:17,460
Is there an argument that the Little Mermaid ones are kind of more fun?

1014
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,040
Big show. I think there are.

1015
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:22,040
If we're just separating the art from the artist,

1016
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,060
the separating the ride from the ride.

1017
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:31,360
Well, this is what's your what's your what's more important?

1018
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,780
I guess is it novelty or is it minimalism?

1019
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,900
Because I think it could be made that the Doombuggy's are cute.

1020
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,100
They're cute little curved guys.

1021
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,560
They kind of hug you.

1022
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,140
I feel very safe in a doombuggy.

1023
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:50,260
Well, that's as there's horrors, a house of horrors that you're going through.

1024
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,800
You know, that's your argument to make. That's fine.

1025
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,580
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1026
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:59,900
For to visual protection, if you want to have brief awkward teenage makeouts.

1027
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,580
Yes. And look, I will say this.

1028
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:08,560
The biggest thing the Doombuggy is, is that it's, I think, the coziest vehicle in any theme park.

1029
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,080
Yeah, I took my first time back at Disneyland.

1030
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,520
I took a brief nap in it.

1031
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,200
It is cozy as shit.

1032
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,960
Boy, and it does. It makes you feel good.

1033
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,020
It's covering you. You're in the dark already.

1034
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:25,460
You could be alone. You could be packed in there with three people, with two people.

1035
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,880
It's it's unique in that way.

1036
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,240
And it's coziness.

1037
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:34,260
But aesthetically, I don't think it's cute.

1038
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,540
I'm sorry. I'm not going to go with you on cute.

1039
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,060
I think I think cool and that it's like a big coffin that you're riding in.

1040
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:42,000
And I like that the bar lowers.

1041
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,060
You've got to give it that. That's one bit of functionality.

1042
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,740
I don't even know what I'd say. Cool.

1043
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,620
If it was separated from the ride.

1044
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,880
I think people are going to hate this opinion.

1045
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,280
But you know what? Bring it on.

1046
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,400
I think this is I think is mine to to lock in.

1047
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:55,160
I'm going, Mr.

1048
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,300
Tell. I can't believe it.

1049
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,260
I like because you think I would take Doombuggy all the way.

1050
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,620
It's fame. The name is fame.

1051
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:07,020
But, you know, let me get a non intellectual point.

1052
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,660
It's got a little wheel and you spin it around.

1053
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,500
You can do that. Your kid can do that.

1054
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,060
Yeah, it's fun to pretend you have some control of it.

1055
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,660
It gives you like interactivity.

1056
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,300
They all have different names.

1057
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:21,480
I did. It's Mr. Toad. It's Mr. Toad for me.

1058
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,300
You want to vote next?

1059
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,880
I yeah, I think coziness hasn't come up yet.

1060
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,160
And I think it's important.

1061
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,040
I think both the I think both you're right.

1062
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:37,320
Both the stands for coziness, the curve combined with the lowering lap bar,

1063
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:42,080
which is kind of like a safety feature that's pretty difficult to mess up.

1064
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,500
You know, what do you mean?

1065
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,500
So you're cozy behind and then it's I find the lap bar lower.

1066
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,080
I find that comforting.

1067
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,300
I feel like I'm tucked into this ride.

1068
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,240
So Jason has chosen the ride that tucks you in.

1069
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,380
Now, that's he's not wrong.

1070
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,340
That is that is a very unique thing, but it's it's pure black.

1071
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,660
Well, you want to get tucked into again.

1072
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,040
But it's a it's a psychological factor.

1073
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,660
Not it's not like a blanket.

1074
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,840
And I don't think that's that's not the purpose of the ride.

1075
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,020
Yeah, it's to make you feel like you're tucked in.

1076
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:17,420
But it's part of they've incorporated into the narrative

1077
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,000
that that's what the ghost host is doing.

1078
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:22,580
It honestly never occurred to me until this moment

1079
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:25,080
that you are essentially tucked into a coffin.

1080
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,060
But that is interesting to think about.

1081
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,000
It is interesting to think about, isn't it?

1082
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:35,200
And I'd love to think about it for more than the next minute.

1083
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,040
But sadly, we have to keep rolling here.

1084
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:41,320
It's tough because I you do make a good argument

1085
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:46,820
that the tucking in and what I was saying, the coziness of it is unique.

1086
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:51,880
It is the closest ride you can get to feeling like you could go to sleep easily.

1087
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,200
That it's backwards, backwards.

1088
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,780
Like that's a perfect time to go to bed is when you're going down into the cemetery.

1089
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,500
Can I throw in that?

1090
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,360
I mean, I already locked in my vote, but just to confuse things,

1091
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:08,000
the ability of the OmniMover car to direct your attention,

1092
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:12,040
to stare at this, to lock your focus in on this

1093
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:17,060
at the half box ghost or the scared guy at the bottom of the hill.

1094
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,440
That's that's something it is.

1095
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,160
You know, Wallenauer was talking about.

1096
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,720
It's like the POV direction of ride vehicles.

1097
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1098
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,080
Innovation of that. Yeah.

1099
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,020
That said, if you look at them from 10, 20 feet away,

1100
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,220
Mr. Toads is obviously more colorful, more whimsical.

1101
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:41,700
Yes. Yes. So I think here I'll go.

1102
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:46,100
I think, though, if you take the ride out of the doom buggy.

1103
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,500
The coziness becomes claustrophobia.

1104
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,920
That without the fun is of the music and all of that,

1105
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:00,500
you're sort of trapped in a not cute looking vehicle.

1106
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,940
And yeah, I can move you around, but you're not going to feel that same warmth

1107
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,040
because you're not on the Haunted Mansion.

1108
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,360
You're just in an odd piece of metal.

1109
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,060
Yeah, I think I know where you're going, Mr. Toad.

1110
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,880
Yeah, Jason, another to say dirty British car.

1111
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,960
You said it. I think you're ready.

1112
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,680
Oh, OK. Got it.

1113
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:31,160
OK, so, geez, I am I am surprised that I wouldn't have thought that before we started today.

1114
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,860
Yeah, I thought Dumbuggy could have been the winner.

1115
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,740
But when you talk through it, when you realize things,

1116
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,040
that one started with me, right?

1117
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:44,480
So Jason, you can make the first choice if you wish on Mad Tea Party

1118
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:48,000
versus the Back to the Future Eight Passenger.

1119
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,400
Oh, my God.

1120
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,780
Oh, boy, this is a tough one.

1121
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:57,840
I'll say this year, that randomizer, that chaos around us led to some very interesting.

1122
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1123
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:03,200
Ones that shouldn't have happened until the final the final four.

1124
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,780
Right. But that's the fun.

1125
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,260
That's the fun of this.

1126
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:10,460
Two Alice's Alice based attractions.

1127
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,420
Yes. To the sit down.

1128
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,740
Oh, yes. 16.

1129
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,760
Oh, yeah. Cars didn't get that.

1130
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,220
Mm hmm. Alice is better than cars.

1131
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,200
Yeah. Jason, what are your initial thoughts?

1132
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,940
Oh, my initial thoughts.

1133
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:26,440
I mean, the teacups are very pleasing to look at.

1134
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,160
Very, very pleasing to look at.

1135
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,120
I would agree completely with that.

1136
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,040
Wonderful. That Mary Blair color palette.

1137
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,660
And in a way, I sorry to interrupt you, but maybe the second most iconic Disneyland

1138
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:40,980
ride vehicles. You say Dumbo first and Dumbo first teacup second.

1139
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:41,700
Yeah.

1140
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:47,140
Hmm. And it's lasted and been replicated, you know, for a reason.

1141
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,660
Yes. Back to the future.

1142
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,000
Kind of an early.

1143
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:57,960
An 80s technological 80s, early 90s technological innovation.

1144
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:00,720
I mean, it's the DeLorean, the DeLorean.

1145
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,380
Yeah. And Doc figured out how to get eight people in there.

1146
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:07,720
Yeah. That's the innovation and remote control it.

1147
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,680
Right. It's the old DeLorean's

1148
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,540
could barely fit two people and a dog.

1149
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:21,800
This is tricky because the DeLorean does look like the DeLorean from the movie.

1150
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,220
So it's wish fulfillment in that.

1151
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,020
So you are it's got the panels.

1152
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,800
Everything's right. It's flux capacitor.

1153
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,680
Doors open. Yeah.

1154
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,040
The doors swing open.

1155
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,660
Yes, they swing open.

1156
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:33,600
So you get a view.

1157
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,560
You're watching a different video that's separate from the ride.

1158
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,900
You get your own thing up and it's, you know, if you're up

1159
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,160
steering, that's cool versus being in the back.

1160
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:49,320
Huh? This is tricky because I thought I maybe knew exactly what I wanted out of this.

1161
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,300
But now I don't know.

1162
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:58,680
Now I'm not sure because the teacup is so simple in its design.

1163
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,820
You know, it's like it's it's it feels pure to me.

1164
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:05,840
It feels like this is the embodiment of what you want on a ride.

1165
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,860
It's been around, but it also looks fun.

1166
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,820
It's got fun colors.

1167
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,800
All the vehicles are different colors.

1168
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:18,060
And that would be fun in any context, in a dirty parking lot, in a swamp,

1169
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,360
just spinning around in a cup.

1170
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,360
You don't need anything around the ride.

1171
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,420
It can still spin in the swamp.

1172
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,040
It could spin in the swamp.

1173
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,880
And you know what? Now that I'm talking myself through this, I think I've decided

1174
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,480
the teacups as a ride doesn't need Disneyland.

1175
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:43,660
You can have fun and that teacup anywhere you want on in on the moon, on Neptune,

1176
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:48,120
in the center of the earth, Jupiter, Jupiter, none.

1177
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,020
Alpha Centauri.

1178
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,740
I think I see what you're saying.

1179
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:54,740
The joy of the ride is built into the vehicle itself.

1180
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,060
Yes. Back to the future.

1181
01:09:56,220 --> 01:10:00,320
DeLorean is kind of dependent on a rotting IMAX screen.

1182
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,140
And it's fun because you get to see like, oh, that's I mean, it kind of

1183
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:07,220
if you look at the front part of the it doesn't quite look like the front of the

1184
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:12,180
DeLorean, it's a little bit it's not quite perfect like Hagrid's or Mr.

1185
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,740
Toad, but it's its own.

1186
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,000
You're right. It's its own thing.

1187
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:21,000
But if we're talking movement visually, yeah, it's teacup.

1188
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:23,860
It's got to be teacups. Jason.

1189
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,320
Scott, do you have one?

1190
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,360
Teacup, teacup. It's teacups.

1191
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,160
Keep boxing. Yeah, we keep just deciding.

1192
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,720
But what are you saying officially?

1193
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,240
What would you have said?

1194
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,240
Oh, I think I think I would have thrown it to back to the future because.

1195
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,880
Well, make your plea. Huh?

1196
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:42,740
Make your plea.

1197
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:48,000
Well, I think one thing is that like, you know, it's crazy to say

1198
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,320
an attraction kind of disrespect it through its history.

1199
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,720
Back to the future. Like gone. Sure.

1200
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,780
Is it gone everywhere? Yeah, it is.

1201
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:57,560
Yeah. OK.

1202
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:02,220
And and like probably one of the most common universal,

1203
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:04,220
like, why did they get rid of that?

1204
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,120
Well, that's true.

1205
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,900
But the upkeep on it, atrocious. Sure.

1206
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,480
But vehicle wise, vehicle purely, purely vehicle wise.

1207
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,040
What's your argument for it?

1208
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:18,120
I think it's very pleasing to see the control the panel.

1209
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,220
It's pleasing to hear the sounds and like,

1210
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,860
yeah, all the blinking lights and stuff.

1211
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:31,920
It is a particularly fun like think about that versus a radiator springs racer,

1212
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:34,360
which has no video. It's a car. Right.

1213
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,040
It moves. It moves better than right.

1214
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,480
Jostles you around. But I think think about that pair up.

1215
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,020
I think DeLorean wins handily.

1216
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,700
That's true. Yeah.

1217
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:47,000
A radiator springs racers, oddly, we're not going to go all the way no matter who.

1218
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,120
Yeah. Yeah. OK.

1219
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,520
I can't believe that. Right.

1220
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,100
But nobody nobody's mind has changed. No.

1221
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,040
I mean, I'm back to the future.

1222
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,280
No, I feel not. I feel great.

1223
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,400
OK, Jason, would you like to throw that?

1224
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,180
Oh, wait, did I? You took that? Yeah.

1225
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,940
Send the next one to Mike. Go ahead.

1226
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,940
No, you really excuse me.

1227
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,600
Send it to me. Casey Jr.

1228
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:14,440
Versus the seventh worst mine train mine cart. OK.

1229
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,120
Casey Jr., one of your favorite rides. Very cute.

1230
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,620
Very cute. Very cute.

1231
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,920
We can all agree it's a very cute ride.

1232
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,980
There's we're considering all the cars on Casey Jr.

1233
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:28,680
Because there's multiple again, like Hagrid's, there's you can have a lot of different types

1234
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:32,000
of experiences. You can sit different directions on it.

1235
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,680
You can sit in little cages.

1236
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,020
You can sit in regular seats.

1237
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,740
So we're going to we're going to put all of that in this, right?

1238
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,480
We're going to think about all of that.

1239
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,260
You just you just made the argument already for me.

1240
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,100
There's no question for me. It's Casey Jr.

1241
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,220
In this this one, not to make it less dramatic.

1242
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:52,820
What is possibly the argument on the other side?

1243
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:54,060
Yeah, a bunch of barrels.

1244
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,740
Yeah, I like bunch of it's better than just some boxy roller coaster.

1245
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:01,040
But compared to against Casey Jr., you've never been on the ride.

1246
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,280
I haven't been on the ride.

1247
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:07,560
They do rock. I will say these this rocking mechanism is so much fun.

1248
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,680
I don't know. You're right. You're right.

1249
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:13,880
This is important. And I will say because we don't have the original,

1250
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,980
like Snow White Scary Adventure ride vehicles.

1251
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,900
And I would say as a kid, it was a pretty close.

1252
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:23,040
I would say I would have given the edge to Peter Pan and the pirate ship.

1253
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,940
But as a kid, seeing those little wood carved vehicles

1254
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:30,540
on the Snow White ride was very exciting to me. Yeah.

1255
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,620
And I those probably those were the two vehicles

1256
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,480
I would have said were the best when I was a little kid.

1257
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:40,320
So these are now it's a roller coaster version of those hand

1258
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:46,620
carved looking wood things and a very unique, smooth rocking.

1259
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,520
And I love these ride vehicles.

1260
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,340
OK, I will say this.

1261
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,940
And I think this ride is maybe the ride itself, which we're not trying to.

1262
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:55,200
But the ride itself is too short.

1263
01:13:55,220 --> 01:14:01,000
But I think it's a really, really smooth, fun sensation.

1264
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,800
And I would say.

1265
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,380
That even though Casey Jr.

1266
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:10,360
is cute, I and again, it's a personal thing because of how much I like the

1267
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,880
the like the wooden ride vehicles, maybe from my youth.

1268
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,760
I think I give it the seven, seven dollars a mine cart.

1269
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,460
OK, honestly, well, I think Jason's the tiebreaker.

1270
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,400
Yeah, we know what he's going to say.

1271
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,940
I'm giving it to Casey Jr.

1272
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,200
All right. Yeah. Just pure vehicle alone.

1273
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:27,200
Again, stand back and look at it from a distance.

1274
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:32,820
It's like, oh, that's a delightful, colorful train with multiple options.

1275
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:37,160
And maybe I'm look, maybe I'm saying I don't like it as much because I'm a tall guy.

1276
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:40,240
And when they throw me in one of those cages, it's uncomfortable.

1277
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:43,560
Yeah, I'm too tall for the lion cage.

1278
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,800
Yeah. On Casey Jr.

1279
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,720
I mean, it's a ride for little kids also.

1280
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1281
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:50,260
And I'm a little baby.

1282
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,860
We've had a very I've had a nice time with with a baby on it.

1283
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:55,560
Sure. I'm with my own.

1284
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,360
I didn't take one. OK, good.

1285
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,560
But all right. All right.

1286
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,900
It's an odd one. But I hear you, Mike.

1287
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:06,260
And sure. Well, you want to send the next one my way?

1288
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,720
Yeah. Tron Lightcycle versus Peter Pan Pirate Ship.

1289
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,980
Oof. Look, I'm probably not the guy to start.

1290
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:14,480
Start with a lot of pan.

1291
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,280
You got to take your pan bias out of here.

1292
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,660
I know I do. And thank God I do.

1293
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,820
Do do do. It's I like Ike.

1294
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,260
It this is the epitome of I have to look at the vehicle

1295
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,900
and not think about the ways that I've been creeped out

1296
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:32,460
by the poster of every single Peter Pan.

1297
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:38,860
That comes every year and a half or the a reimagining.

1298
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,140
Yeah, not a reboot. Yeah, you're right.

1299
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,740
Well, because they're all the same.

1300
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:43,920
Yeah. Mythology.

1301
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,560
My feelings about Hook cannot be placed into the hook

1302
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,980
has nothing to do with this ship.

1303
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:55,580
You know what? How I feel is almost like a begrudging.

1304
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,820
Yeah, I guess I have to.

1305
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,440
There is there like Peter Pan Pirate Ship iconic.

1306
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:05,820
We threw out ET so we don't have it right.

1307
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,760
We don't have any rides that fly where that is.

1308
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,260
Yeah, that's up above you. Right.

1309
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,280
You got to take that into account.

1310
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:16,160
And honestly, for my taste, there's already too much new stuff,

1311
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,820
newer stuff in here.

1312
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,760
I think I'm putting my foot too many new rides.

1313
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,220
What do you like? You mean Hagrid and Slinky?

1314
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,580
Yeah, I think there's two bullshit.

1315
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:33,060
Two rides from the two thousands to rides.

1316
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,960
I now look, none of us have been on Tron, so we don't know.

1317
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:40,560
Maybe we don't.

1318
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,320
Maybe I have to stare at it.

1319
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,520
It is certainly we know it's good.

1320
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,140
There's that's got to be good.

1321
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:51,520
I think we didn't put on the cosmic rewind vehicles.

1322
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:53,560
Are those cool? They're OK.

1323
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,180
Kind of like Nova Corps.

1324
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,100
I think they're probably cool.

1325
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,620
And again, I think like like seven dwarves,

1326
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:02,660
I think they're very smooth and they're they they are cool.

1327
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:06,780
So there's probably an argument to be made for them somewhere.

1328
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,480
But visually, it's OK.

1329
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:13,840
You know, guys, Selka was down there is down there, like as we record.

1330
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,340
And he posted a thing about like my glasses.

1331
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,240
Like really, we're about to fly off on this thing.

1332
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:25,120
And that's what I I told him, like touring glans should track this.

1333
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,440
I am interested in like which ride makes your glasses.

1334
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,440
What I make your glasses fly off, because I definitely enjoy

1335
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,580
like attractions with show scenes more when I can see them.

1336
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,040
But I would like to keep my glasses also.

1337
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,800
Oh, yeah, because we I yeah, because that's like Hulk.

1338
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,300
You couldn't wear your glasses on.

1339
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,000
Oh, no, absolutely not.

1340
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,560
Yeah. And that queue was very dark like Hagrid.

1341
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,580
I'm going to have to stumble through that or Velocico.

1342
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,000
I'm going to have to stumble through that.

1343
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,860
You do the strap.

1344
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,660
Could you do the glasses strap like you're playing basketball?

1345
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,300
We're goggles. Yeah.

1346
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,040
Giles Grant or just yeah.

1347
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,560
Oh, finally, Grant Glock goggles for Jason during a theme.

1348
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,360
Oh, man. That would rule.

1349
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:08,220
Zootin up and then he limbers up.

1350
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:11,860
We need to get you course grant style goggles for theme parks.

1351
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,820
Finally, just stop being a baby and try contacts at 37.

1352
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,640
Oh, is that why you would never try it?

1353
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,320
Well, I have terrible astigmatism in one eye.

1354
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,380
So they tried to fit them for me once.

1355
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,920
And I was like, Doctor, get that out. Get it out.

1356
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,080
It's painful. Oh, really? Yeah.

1357
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,580
Interesting. So I do LASIK.

1358
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,860
I wouldn't do LASIK. Scared. Yeah.

1359
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:32,700
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1360
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,860
Of the laser. They shoot a laser laser is scared of like

1361
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:36,980
there's been follies.

1362
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:40,320
People have they've messed up laser, you know.

1363
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:45,220
Yeah. If you want to keep discussing astigmatism, that's fine.

1364
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,560
I'm looking at the vehicles.

1365
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,720
They light up, guys.

1366
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:52,560
Don't forget their light cycles.

1367
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,940
I know we already got Hagrid's on here, but they light up.

1368
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,360
It looks so cool at night.

1369
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,080
It looks so cool indoors.

1370
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,520
I am still a sucker for that.

1371
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:06,480
It's it's like a motorcycle and you ride it like a motorcycle

1372
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,740
that you're not sitting.

1373
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,580
It doesn't have the comfort, but you're you're at attention.

1374
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:17,440
You're it's and I guess I have to take my feelings about the movie out,

1375
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:21,260
which are not good, which I think both of the movies are boring.

1376
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,560
So it doesn't matter.

1377
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:28,840
I since I think it's so much more likely that one of or both of you will go

1378
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:32,120
with Peter Pan, I'm going with light cycle.

1379
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,360
I got it. I got to say lights.

1380
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,160
It lights up.

1381
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,560
Jason, I'd like you to go next.

1382
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,220
We have the light up.

1383
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,780
I mean, I'm a sucker for neon.

1384
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,580
I'm a sucker for colored lights.

1385
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:47,060
I feel like a lot of parks could like really level up

1386
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:50,440
just by putting in some good landscaping and colored lighting.

1387
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:55,260
And it would seem like a six flags could immediately seem

1388
01:19:55,260 --> 01:20:00,300
like a much more premium experience with like a little landscape architecture

1389
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,140
and some more colored lights.

1390
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:08,620
That said, the other competitor is a cute little pirate ship.

1391
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,320
And even though it slammed my ass multiple times

1392
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,160
on that aging track, it's a rough ride.

1393
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,440
Oh, this is a rough ride.

1394
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:20,660
Let's keep that in mind.

1395
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,920
Flying. Yeah.

1396
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,660
I feel like flying should have some representation.

1397
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,200
I like that you got leg room on that ride.

1398
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,620
I like a little bucket.

1399
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,120
You're not boxed in like being in a woodcarver's cart.

1400
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:38,440
And I like that molded plastic sail.

1401
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,220
I could say plenty of nice things.

1402
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,220
Yeah, the sail.

1403
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:45,240
So I'm going to I'm going to make Mike break the tie.

1404
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,320
I'm going to say Peter Pan pirate ship.

1405
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,040
That's right. Wow.

1406
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,560
Peter Pan pirate ship.

1407
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,660
Oh, again, I said this when I was a kid.

1408
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:56,260
That was it was that or the Snow White, where I was like,

1409
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,260
these are the coolest vehicles to be in.

1410
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,000
You're flying.

1411
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,420
Man, because that was like the first that was the first ride.

1412
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,380
I felt comfortable opening my eyes on, as I've said,

1413
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:08,980
because the characters were too far away.

1414
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,480
Snow White, I love the ride vehicle,

1415
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,140
but I closed my eyes the whole time on the ride.

1416
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,920
You wanted Horace Grant goggles, but painted black, painted black.

1417
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,400
Yes. So I couldn't see anything.

1418
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:24,980
But when you compare Tron Light Cycle to the DeLorean,

1419
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,360
it looks perfect.

1420
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:32,100
I think kind of it's a better movie represented like Hagrid's.

1421
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,360
Yes, it's recent, but look what we're able to do with right.

1422
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,740
Your technology, right.

1423
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:42,020
And again, it gives you the it gives you that motorcycle.

1424
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,680
I assume what riding motorcycles like.

1425
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,860
Yeah, you're tipped over like riding a motorcycle.

1426
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,620
Someone might say if they get on a motorcycle. Right.

1427
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,160
And I'll never be on a motorcycle.

1428
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,160
I have not been.

1429
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,740
But it's really this is hard because this is an emotional.

1430
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:03,240
There's an emotional argument in my heart for pirate Peter Pamp hardship.

1431
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:08,060
And I'm trying to I'm trying to remove the ride from my heart.

1432
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,100
When I'm if it was.

1433
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,620
Yeah, I imagine the photo op outside the that's a good way.

1434
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:19,160
We haven't talked about that for any of these, like not just like the testing,

1435
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:22,460
the seat functional. Can you fit in it? Yeah.

1436
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,800
But the just photo op outside the ride, which which is

1437
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,100
which do you like that photo of more?

1438
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,160
Yeah, yes!

1439
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,880
It's like I like it's a cute Peter Pan is cute, but I feel like the ships could be a little cuter

1440
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,480
Honestly as I'm looking now they could be cuter the ships could be cuter

1441
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:51,480
I'm sorry to add a new new another new thing when I when we say new ten years old

1442
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:58,400
Onto this but a lot of classics. I'm amazed at what we're not seeing in here that there's no people mover

1443
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:04,860
There's no pirate ship and and but it's it's still a diverse list. It's not entirely

1444
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:10,740
The big new shiny object. There's classics. It's a really good. I think it's good

1445
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:15,480
I think this is this might have been what we were dealing with no matter randomizer or not. That's what I'm saying

1446
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:23,600
Yeah, all right. Let's take another quick break. See if the gardeners are see if the see if my neighbors stopped and

1447
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,680
What we'll pick it up somewhere with the eight

1448
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:31,960
all right, we are back for the watch your step while exiting eight and

1449
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:38,880
Begins with Dumbo the flying elephant versus Hagrid's motorbikes and side cars Jason

1450
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,120
I think make could make the first choice if you wish

1451
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:45,440
Jason what do you think? I mean just both two loaded

1452
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:54,240
Properties you got the crows on the one end you got the one of the worst

1453
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,660
Billionaires we don't have to do this brain

1454
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:04,660
What's talking about the cars the ride vehicle from the rival art from the artists again, I think you know

1455
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:07,380
It comes down to like a

1456
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,200
simulation of a real-life thing

1457
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,960
versus like a whimsical dream a

1458
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:18,580
flying elephant versus once again a dirty British motor that flies

1459
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:25,480
Huh? Again, we shouldn't be talking about actually what it does in a conceptual way, but it does fly

1460
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,140
The motorbikes flies the brides on a track

1461
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:36,120
Well, there's a moved along a track. It was not really boring to battle on this ride. There's a big mechanical arm

1462
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:40,080
Yeah, but could you imagine I mean I can imagine motorcycle riding a track

1463
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:45,860
I don't know if I can imagine an elephant flying that's that seems impossible. Well, you can't imagine it

1464
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:52,240
I mean the greatest imaginer who also man imagine some terrible things, but they also imagined

1465
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,540
Who wrote Dumbo?

1466
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:00,380
Great from the mind of some art author who Disney stole from

1467
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:07,760
Well, I don't I feel like you know this I feel like yeah, you don't like Hagrid there's been a lot of yeah

1468
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:16,840
Vehicles again. One of these is a dirty motorcycle and sidecar and one of these is a cute different color outfit elephant

1469
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,960
You stand back and look at these from a distance, right?

1470
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:24,680
But sitting inside them and then moving is also a sure a different story, too

1471
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:29,160
And yeah that motorcycles a little uncomfortable to sit inside

1472
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:37,180
Hmm in the sidecar or on them on the sidecar is more comfortable. That's cozier the sidecar the sidecar is cozy

1473
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:42,280
So I think that's even something we haven't talked about is there actually is a cozy option on Hagrid's

1474
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:46,340
There's the sort of more action pose that you can do if you're actually like on the handlebars

1475
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:50,480
But then you are a little cozy in that sidecar. You're a little cozy

1476
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:57,680
So I think we haven't talked enough about the sidecar aspect of Hagrid's which is a big strike in its favor

1477
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,320
It's a bit it is

1478
01:25:59,320 --> 01:25:59,960
innovative

1479
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:08,260
And also I was more right than I knew just side track the rights for Dumbo were bought by Disney from the two

1480
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:11,480
Authors behind the book for about a thousand dollars

1481
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:14,300
So pretty best

1482
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:22,500
Do we support the current monster or the monster from the past who bought from a nice woman and ripped her up?

1483
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:29,260
None of these things it's about vehicles. It's irrelevant. You know, it's irrelevant. Um, I

1484
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,160
Hmm

1485
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:35,260
You have any any leanings Mike well

1486
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:40,100
Dumbo is a little uncomfortable for me as well sitting inside of it and especially when the ride vehicle

1487
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:45,060
I mean if it's just a vehicle itself, but if it's moving in the way that it moves

1488
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:49,660
I kind of slide around it and I kind of feel like I'm gonna tip over and fall out of it

1489
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:54,340
I don't know if that's due to my height or what or my just sort of fear of heights. I'm not sure

1490
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:57,940
Hagrid's I feel great on it the whole time. I

1491
01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:06,360
Feel better than in real life my normal day. You feel better than just being in your bed. Yeah. Yes. Yes

1492
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,560
Compared all the vehicles to our beds

1493
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,760
Well, that's it we should do it hold another episode about that

1494
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:17,600
But yeah, so I don't know the

1495
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,680
visually

1496
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:23,640
That Dumbo is hard to beat I

1497
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:24,840
Can I

1498
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,280
You know

1499
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:37,120
I'm at a loss for words. It's one it's you would want to own it over the motorbike. Mm-hmm. So

1500
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:42,420
Yeah, somebody might see the bike and think you have an old dirty British bike, right?

1501
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:48,580
But that's you buy that did you buy that for a thousand dollars the cost of one Dumbo story? Yeah

1502
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:53,360
I just need to purchase but that being said if it was a Harry Potter

1503
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,740
Look, I ain't buying a giant Harry Potter prop

1504
01:27:55,740 --> 01:28:02,380
No for many reasons at this point, but the bike divorced from it being Harry Potter is kind of cool

1505
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:07,900
Yeah, if you sort of just had that parked like you're you had a big dog garage and you had the Harry Potter bike in

1506
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:11,360
There but it was just a nondescript dirty British bike. It is kind of cool

1507
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:15,120
I think it's a cool old-school looking motorcycle. I

1508
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:19,960
Do agree that I think so much of it though. Yes, the

1509
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,180
Motorcycle and sidecar aspect is really great

1510
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:31,160
But what are those worth if it's not moving if you are just judging the vehicle pre movement versus a silly Dumbo

1511
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:35,960
What if you what if Jay Leno were driving the motorcycle and you were in the sidecar?

1512
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:39,600
What if he's driving the Dumbo like I mean

1513
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:45,180
Okay, you and Jay in the Dumbo car

1514
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:51,740
Would you rather have that or would you rather be on the bird of dirty British motorcycle with Jay driving and you're in the sidecar?

1515
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:59,040
This is maybe the toughest question answer in my mind. No, it's not seeing Jay Leno in a Dumbo would be the funniest thing ever

1516
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,520
Coming down the street

1517
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:07,160
Separate from the ride if you're a big rev and you turned your head and it was Jay Leno in a Dumbo

1518
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,640
1000% Dumbo locked in

1519
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:16,760
Dumbo to all right. Okay. What do you what do you think? I don't even want to vote now

1520
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:23,940
Say so if you're recording this officially Mike did not vote protest vote. We're back to some some tough ones

1521
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:28,780
Yeah, cuz it'd be you got the fun dirty train. You got slinky dog

1522
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,420
Slinky dog battle and that's the last one right and

1523
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:41,760
Big Thunder yellow key favorite ride for me again a divorce myself from that though

1524
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,440
the ride vehicle and the fun of

1525
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,900
Big Thunder, I think you know, it's an old ride

1526
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:54,380
It still holds up in the way that like you slide around it when you're moving and that's fun when you're sort of on a straightaway

1527
01:29:54,380 --> 01:30:00,200
It's fun when you're going up a hill like that all of that is still taken away from fake rocks

1528
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:06,940
The majesty of the fake rocks on Big Thunder. You're still enjoying the hell out of it visually. It looks cool, too

1529
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:11,040
Slinky is a different type of coaster, but it's similar

1530
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,100
I mean, it's they're both sort of like good starter coasters

1531
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:19,460
I think for for you know, you're young preteens, you know, just getting into coast maybe you're maybe you're eight or nine

1532
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:23,100
Maybe yeah, you know, they're both sort of in the same zone there

1533
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:24,420
So they're both

1534
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,620
independently kind of giving you a similar type of rides

1535
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,200
so

1536
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:33,280
the thing you're gonna have to I think judge on is

1537
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:37,280
Do you value realism over?

1538
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:39,140
whimsical magic

1539
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:46,680
Mm-hmm. I think yeah, I think what are your values. What do you believe in? Okay. I want to ask the listener that

1540
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,560
What do you believe in in your heart?

1541
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,720
Does it does your heart say?

1542
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:58,600
I want to live sort of in a fantasy land with talking animals or

1543
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:03,500
Do I sort of want to be in a heightened reality that doesn't maybe have talking animals?

1544
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:09,220
But you can experience buying animals venture. Well, yeah dynamite holding animals, right?

1545
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:13,080
But that's more realistic animals can hold dynamite in real life

1546
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:20,760
But yeah, they choose not to but they could but they could but yeah slinky toy slinky dog toy couldn't

1547
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:25,900
Actually put you in its back and you rider on a fun ride with a whole environment

1548
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:29,740
I mean you are on slinky and you are in like a backyard

1549
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:35,820
Filled with toys. Yes meant to look as if Andy built a theme park

1550
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:37,040
Yes backyard

1551
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:43,520
But I would argue in the same my same teacup argument is that?

1552
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,260
Taking the fake rocks away from Big Thunder

1553
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:54,680
It's a fun roller coaster movement thing you can take away the environment you could put slinky dog on the moon

1554
01:31:54,680 --> 01:32:00,100
On Neptune in a swamp at the center of the earth and you are still in a big dog

1555
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,500
You still have the knowledge you can see him you can see slinky in front of you

1556
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:07,700
You can still see that you are part of some sort of whimsical magic

1557
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:14,840
Well, don't we need to bring the head of big dog productions into the big dog Jay Leno

1558
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,780
Test again if Jay Leno is

1559
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:23,760
Pulling up to Bob's big boy and he's in a slinky dog or he's in yeah, that's unfair

1560
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:28,820
I mean that's gonna be here. It's always gonna be cartoon of two of her talking about. Yeah the jail and oh yeah

1561
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:30,140
Yeah, of course

1562
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:33,860
Fine let me just

1563
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:42,180
Discuss, of course, you're in it. You're in a train but colors. I don't think we've talked about I'm staring at one right now

1564
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,940
a very pleasing

1565
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:53,140
Red and green combo and I like that tan of the cars. I think that a big thunder choice

1566
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:59,440
Represents anything that's train style. This is common in coasters, but never pulled off this well

1567
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:03,000
Yeah, and I think you have to pick the best of a genre

1568
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,740
The slinky dogs in a genre of its own. Yes, I would say there's not a lot of big cartoony

1569
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:13,140
roller coasters out there but in terms of

1570
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,900
Well, I don't know if it's better than

1571
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:20,260
No, well, maybe it is better than Dumbo, but it's just not as classic. Oh

1572
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:23,360
Yeah, it's picking not classic throughout

1573
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:31,180
Right and what is classic? It's just a nostalgia. It's just you're you've known about it longer

1574
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:36,640
Yeah, true. I'm just having a time to just decide something is classic you have to judge something

1575
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,200
You know as if they both came out today

1576
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:44,140
Yeah, yeah, that's true if these rides were both new

1577
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:50,220
Slinky dog I'll say this in the favor slinky dogs slinky dog is smiling

1578
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:56,920
He looks happy. It's how we all want to remember the beloved Jim Varney

1579
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:01,420
I thought you were gonna say like taking a trip. I thought that's what you were gonna say too

1580
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:05,760
Jim Varney, I mean also that both can be true honoring

1581
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:11,720
Yes, a vote for this is honoring the great actor Jim Varney not dissimilar color schemes

1582
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:18,620
Sure, yeah kind of earth tones pops of green. I mean, you know, yeah, I

1583
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:24,180
Think Big Thunder for me wins out if slinky dog is a little less good is a little more caterpillar

1584
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:25,700
You know, yeah

1585
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:31,460
If it's not such the whole his butt slinky you would get you get the butt of slinky the seat

1586
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:35,600
The seat of slinky is on this ride the little tail

1587
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:41,380
I'm so sorry to say FN but the FN tail a part of occurs

1588
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:48,160
Yeah, that I mean look it's a big slinky you get to ride on it and it's fun as shit. I

1589
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:52,520
I think suddenly I'm like slinky. I was literally about to say Big Thunder

1590
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,780
But I'm looking at his face and what Jason said he's smiling

1591
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:59,080
I can't say no to him great actor Jim Varney and his floppy ears

1592
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:05,620
Slinky dog. Yes, I can't Wow. I was on the precipice of take the ride out of it a clean sweep

1593
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,140
I'm gonna give it to slinky dog, too

1594
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:11,980
I think every year we we have a round or two where

1595
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:16,720
There is a persuasive argument and I think Mike made a very persuasive

1596
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:20,980
Thank you. Yeah, you have changed my mind on it on a few

1597
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:23,540
Mike you want to give me the next one?

1598
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:31,160
Mr. Toad motorcar versus mad tea party teacup. Damn it. Oh damn it. Oh, oh

1599
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,200
interesting

1600
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:39,400
Interesting. I'm not I don't know that I have even an initial thought here. God. I'm not sure I do either

1601
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,500
But I better think of one. Yeah

1602
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:47,720
I was thinking about the toy aspect and I have never been tempted to get a toy of

1603
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:52,280
The mr. Toad motorcar. I almost was more in talking about it

1604
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,920
In winning the last round

1605
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:58,720
Hmm. I have a toy of the mr. I have a Funko pop

1606
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,900
Do you have one with a character writing it? Yeah put toads in it toads in it

1607
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:09,700
Okay, and I will say this I'm very upset with mr. Brian Marriott II for buying they bought Mondo and they gutted it terrible

1608
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:18,740
Oh for shame, mr. Marriott II sucks. I gotta say I I've got a couple now of the

1609
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:25,720
Disneyworld 50th like Funko where like Mickey is in front of Space Mountain

1610
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:29,000
And you gave us Mickey popping out of the skyliner

1611
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:35,400
Yeah, and it is it is a little shocking because they do have a Florida people mover car kind of a rare

1612
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:40,180
vehicle to turn into a toy and it kind of looks like shit because

1613
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:47,120
They stuck the logo on it and Pluto looks cute in it, but it it's just a little off. Yes, I agree

1614
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:49,040
I have the people mover Funko's as well

1615
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:53,460
But like that's that's where you're getting your most ride vehicle toys these days is from Funko pops

1616
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:59,300
Yeah, and some of them look pretty good and then some of them you're like this. That's okay, but

1617
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:05,400
Yeah, I look as far as toys. I I like the real is I like them to look is close to

1618
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:11,300
What the thing is and that goes for figures and that goes that's why I'm a big neck of guys because they do

1619
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,900
Really great recreations of whatever they're yeah generally

1620
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:20,400
Honestly, I've gotten the Funko pop I could care less about the little Funko characters

1621
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:26,920
I'm just like wow how often you get a a little Space Mountain in the little sign

1622
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:32,500
Yeah, and the sign have a few of those I have the space mountain one where it's just the little Space Mountain building

1623
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:36,800
But then I also have Mickey in the ride vehicle, but yeah, I don't care take Mickey out of it

1624
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:40,340
It's all for all I care. Yeah, you should rip him out. I could really have it

1625
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:44,880
Yeah, I'm looking at these two next to each other. It might help you guys too. I recommend it. I'm looking I'm looking

1626
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:51,500
I don't know if it's completely helping me, but you know what it's something big is hitting me

1627
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,680
Tea party cup

1628
01:37:53,680 --> 01:38:01,300
You are controlling the spin you have a big wheel in the center. That is the same weighty

1629
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:06,260
What not plastic? I don't know whatever material that the metal it's made out of

1630
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:08,960
And you're physically doing it

1631
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:11,480
Mr. Toad you are not physically doing it

1632
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:15,000
But you could take that wheel and just spin it and spin it as fast as you can

1633
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,180
I don't care that I'm not in control and that's the whole thing is right out of control

1634
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:23,700
I just compared mr. Toad. I really thought how

1635
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:30,040
More lo-fi mr. Toad style ride would be a better fit for Mario Kart than what they did

1636
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:35,900
You better believe no Mario Kart vehicle in this top 32 not even discussed not even for a second

1637
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:40,040
Which what a failure on the part of that right to not hit the 32. Yeah, good point

1638
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:47,700
I also like the kind of cushioning of that like the we got upholstery. We have like fine

1639
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:52,660
European fonts upholstery styling

1640
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:55,440
brass fixtures

1641
01:38:55,440 --> 01:39:00,080
It's not as fun and cartoony. I

1642
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:06,560
Mean icon is completely what I'm thinking with tea party, but what do I like more?

1643
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:12,580
I'm starting to head to tow well the thing with toad too is that toad has the thing that I love and we I think

1644
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:17,080
We've all talked about it where it's there's different names of different characters on the front and that goes a long way, too

1645
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:21,380
It's not it's not sitting inside a character. You're not sitting inside badger or something

1646
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:26,700
But just having the names on the cars is funny shit. It's really I don't know why that is

1647
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:32,960
Yeah, cuz I don't even like those characters, but really I don't really I'm not like hey badger go back and watch

1648
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,820
I mean, I'm watching yeah, they are still good not that I dislike no I have not watched this

1649
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:40,580
We watched a couple years ago. We're like this is funny

1650
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:49,660
Scott you make a per you made a persuasive argument though that I can't like get out of my mind now of the

1651
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:51,660
presence of control

1652
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:53,260
Toad is

1653
01:39:53,260 --> 01:40:00,420
What's left like toad is the only one that you control what no you know not toad

1654
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:01,400
Sorry

1655
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:05,880
Yeah, I'm so excited. I'm so focused on the control

1656
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:11,640
It just revealed a Jason thought for maybe 37 years that he's been controlling the car. I'm mr. Toad

1657
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,740
Oh, yeah, I go beep beep and they get out of the way

1658
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:20,800
I say beep beep and the other car and the did you stores open every time that you're a judge

1659
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,600
He steps the fuck off every time chasing itself. He goes. I am a good driver. I am a good driver

1660
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:29,340
I yell spin those beers man spin those beers

1661
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,540
Jason conducts everything like an orchestra

1662
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:37,300
So yes, but you're saying that's a teacup argument a teacup argument, you know, cuz control look

1663
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:39,920
We're all searching for control in our own lives

1664
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:46,440
And it's really hard because so much is out of our control in our own lives and for that brief moment on the teacups

1665
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:53,120
We are in control. We are gonna choose our destiny for however long it is two minutes or whatever

1666
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:59,320
it's it's you know, it's a conundrum because searching for control is folly and

1667
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:05,360
Accepting that you are out of control of much in your life. That's that's

1668
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:09,340
Harder to do but it's very hard to do but it's something we all need to realize

1669
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:12,800
Yeah, so much of our anxiety comes from trying to maintain control

1670
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:18,140
But if you accept reality as it is you're probably gonna have an easier go of it. Yes

1671
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:22,560
That's an argument for mr. Toad is what you just made but that became a good way

1672
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,740
seeking control

1673
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:26,580
Is

1674
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:35,100
Well, well, not exactly because so in the teacup you can you do have control so you can spin or as much as

1675
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:39,780
As little as you want. It's a brief moment when you do actually have control. That's your relation

1676
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:44,720
Jason turned it into mr. Toad, which is a wild ride that you should just give yourself over to life

1677
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:50,780
Well, I don't know if you've seen the end of parenthood, but you start to realize that life and especially parenthood

1678
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,580
Just a wild rollercoaster

1679
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:54,840
Are you talking about?

1680
01:41:55,460 --> 01:42:00,460
I'm assuming that's both the conclusion of the two-hour movie and the multi season

1681
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:06,060
I couldn't I couldn't tell you that one. Okay. No, I just every episode of parenthood

1682
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:09,660
Somebody else want to do it. I don't think I know I

1683
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:12,760
It's really tricky here because

1684
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:15,440
Here's what I think ultimately

1685
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:19,840
Mr. Toad again the movement of it separated from the ride

1686
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:26,940
The vehicles cute is cute I think and also interesting and fun

1687
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:34,960
The ride vehicle itself is like it kind of jerks you around and I don't know if that's so much fun without spinning beers

1688
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:42,240
I don't know if you take away the flats and the opening doors and the beep beeps. I

1689
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:46,720
Don't know that that's so much fun. And again, the teacup is fun

1690
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,460
wherever you are

1691
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:50,180
Neptune the moon

1692
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:53,040
center of the earth swamp swamp

1693
01:42:53,040 --> 01:43:01,700
This is a good this is a good thing to go back to I think it's been a reliable like very real pushing

1694
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:07,380
Pushing over the edge very reliable pushing the teacup till like the extra spin. I

1695
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:14,080
Decided by the way, I will say I like the brutal curved like fibreglass plastic of the teeth

1696
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:18,380
Like I don't want to be in it for more than three to five minutes

1697
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:24,840
But kind of like it I'm gonna go with

1698
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:31,820
Teacup I'm going teacup too. All right, then I will just counterbalance that with mr

1699
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:35,420
Toad, but it's impossible to be upset about that. Yeah. Yeah

1700
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:42,440
Yeah, I mean it's the cleaner pick. I wish there was a final four that had mr

1701
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:43,360
Toad in it

1702
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,720
So I will kick the next one to Jason and that is Casey jr. Versus Tron light cycle

1703
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:52,600
Oh boy, you know, you know, we don't you can just say your pick now. Oh sure. Yeah

1704
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,620
I mean if we all want to go home soon

1705
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:57,820
Yeah, I

1706
01:43:57,820 --> 01:44:00,800
Boy this is tough

1707
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:10,460
Casey jr. Is very cute and there's lots of different options and it's very fun to see from a distance

1708
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:13,100
Tron light cycle does glow

1709
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:18,860
Okay, I thought we're gonna go the other this was a lock for Casey. Yeah, I mean I think it is

1710
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:22,620
I think it is I I think I'm gonna throw it to Casey, but I'm not gonna be mad

1711
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:30,500
Yeah, I think what we're learning at least I'm learning about myself today is that I value high quality whimsy

1712
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:36,660
Over high quality reality sure, huh? And obviously the Tron light cycles very realistic

1713
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:38,600
Mm-hmm

1714
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:42,460
Whimsical it's a sci-fi kind of whimsy. It's like the real game grid

1715
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:49,700
But I think Tron lights like oh might win and against some other things. But yes the full Casey jr. Train

1716
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:51,380
You see it all

1717
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:54,140
It's hard to pass that up

1718
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:56,740
But it's uncomfortable

1719
01:44:56,740 --> 01:45:00,700
If I'm in the cage, but I don't have to write a cake think about a child

1720
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:05,540
I don't have to run and think about when you were a child. All right. Yeah, I do all the time

1721
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:10,780
Constantly thinking about that whole point of everything I think yes, it's a problem

1722
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:29,900
Okay here let me ask this question

1723
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:38,660
Do are we taking out when Casey jr. Talks and sings on the ride that we have to take that out of like when he's like

1724
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:42,680
It sounds like he's has asthma and he's we're going up a hill and he's like

1725
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:45,800
Is that not involved here?

1726
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:53,300
No, we said that we we said the beep beep beeps were part of back to the future. They were not mr. Toad

1727
01:45:53,300 --> 01:46:00,420
Those are beep beep beeps in the room, this is a ride that is kind of alive and it overcomes adversity

1728
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:05,620
It gets up that hill. That's true. Yes

1729
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:10,440
But it's like a little train that could a different totally

1730
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:15,080
Jason I know the story of Casey jr. Yeah the fable the legend

1731
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:23,280
but is it what isn't it also a great story that once there was a big cool motorcycle that glowed and

1732
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:25,720
It thought that it could go very fast

1733
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:30,080
You know what did and it blew everybody's faces back and it glowed all the way

1734
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:35,580
Here's what I'll say I'll say I'm actually gonna transport myself back in as it into a child's brain

1735
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:39,160
But even a very unusual for me to do think back to being a kid

1736
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:43,960
And think about let's say eight nine ten years old. I'm a kid

1737
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:46,640
Which one do I want?

1738
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:53,060
Outside of the ride in my backyard and I could ride around on it. The answer is Tron

1739
01:46:54,100 --> 01:47:01,100
Yeah, I even Casey jr. Is great. It looks cool. It's they would win against so many of these other ones. It's Tron

1740
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:02,460
Wow, ooh

1741
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:09,040
It's a kid honestly. I like Casey jr. More now as an adult and not as a kid because the kid I go

1742
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:15,080
Neon lights motorcycle. Are you kidding me? It's Tron, but none of us have written Tron

1743
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:22,340
Fiori theoretical I know what Tron's like. Okay, it lasts about a minute 15. It's awesome for the minute 15

1744
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:27,180
You're gonna be like, it's kind of short. But oh wow is cool those lights in the it's like Pony Express

1745
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:31,000
Which I find very fun and exciting where you're kind of like motorcycle

1746
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:36,820
We were saying before we started recording I think they didn't in losing

1747
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:42,820
Vehicles of a genre. Well, you know one can live on in the other of course

1748
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:46,460
Yeah, and that's and I think Pony Express lives on and Tron light cycle

1749
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:50,680
Yeah, I think Hagrid the motorcycle part lives on and Tron light. So yes

1750
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:54,840
I really liked that last argument Mike. I think it's Tron light cycle for me. Yeah

1751
01:47:54,840 --> 01:48:04,100
Okay, Casey jr. The cute getting shit Casey jr. But everything else is you that's what's interesting about where we go now

1752
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:12,540
Everything is cute. Yeah, all the ones that are left are cute in what I'm calling the permanent sir sentados por favor for okay good

1753
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:16,280
So first one. Oh, this is interesting

1754
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:24,260
Let's take let's I think this goes to Mike first and it is Dumbo the flying elephant versus slinky dog

1755
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:28,060
Slinky dog versus Dumbo and we've said a lot at this point

1756
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:32,980
Well some of the same arguments for both and now they go against each other, right? Right, right, right

1757
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:42,580
So again, I'm trying we were trying to take nostalgia even out of it if they both came out today and I

1758
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:49,000
Dumbo was not even one of my favorite movies as a kid. I liked I like Dumbo, but it was not like Peter

1759
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,720
It was not like pan. I was a pan kid. I was a snow white kid

1760
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,140
I

1761
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:57,700
Wanted it to be Michael and the seven dwarves. I wanted snow white out of there

1762
01:48:57,700 --> 01:49:00,600
I wanted to hang out with the dwarves, but Dumbo I liked

1763
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:06,720
But that was a weird sad movie. Yeah, and probably wouldn't have cracked my top five

1764
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:12,560
I like to Pinocchio better than Dumbo so it makes it tough to go up against something from Toy Story

1765
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:16,400
Toy Story is we grew up with and they made they stay so good, right?

1766
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:20,720
My biggest criticism is like four is oh four is like less

1767
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:26,020
Little less good of a masterpiece when the bar is master, but still like a fun movie

1768
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:32,600
And still I had it on every day for a long time because of the boy and it was yeah, I was not mad at it

1769
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:36,660
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so slinky dog Wow. Yeah

1770
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:41,260
I'm pretty sure about it interesting both of these

1771
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:46,780
Creatures are smiling. They're both smiling. That was I think an endorsement

1772
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:53,380
That pushed me for a slinky dog, but it kind of negates itself

1773
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:59,120
Cuz I think both of them once you remove the part of nostalgia that again is like you see the stock report of

1774
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:03,960
Disneyland of the kids in the Dumbo flying elephants once you take that away

1775
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:11,080
You come out into your backyard and you see slinky or you see Dumbo both good by the way, not neither one bad

1776
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:18,460
But you see slinky or Dumbo. I got more affection for slinky. But wait, do you need the whole are you saying the whole slinky?

1777
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,920
Yes, because you would need like

1778
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:29,080
In this scenario, I own that Michael Eisner house that he was selling which is like has ten houses on a property

1779
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:34,000
So there's enough room for the whole slinky dog vehicle. I

1780
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,280
It's

1781
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:38,460
I think it's slinky. Okay. Oh

1782
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:41,380
This is so much of what I want

1783
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:48,740
This is what I want from an adult's point of view and a kid point of view this fulfills both things

1784
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:49,940
hmm

1785
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:55,260
Ben's it has it takes a character who was not a ride, right?

1786
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:58,660
You know you have your back to the future and then you make the car and looks like the cup

1787
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:02,580
It's linky wasn't a ride before but we know about him. He bends and stretches

1788
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:08,040
He's drink very flexible again the right flexible to be human. He is the ride. The track is not the ride

1789
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:11,620
He is the ride. The vehicle is the ride in this instance

1790
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:15,500
I think like the surrounding stuff is great and it makes everything better in the

1791
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:21,400
Seeing wheezy at the end saying is amazing. Amazing. But I think

1792
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,860
this is this is

1793
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:25,800
This is pure. This is what I

1794
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:30,540
This is finally a juncture where I'm like, I feel like should I represent classic?

1795
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:37,160
You know and like what how much of Disney is built on Dumbo? Do we need to?

1796
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:42,580
We don't do we need to represent classic. Does it matter? Well, I think that's

1797
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:48,840
Everyone's individual decision. It's like a gut decision personal decision between you and your God and your pastor

1798
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:54,880
Yeah, your pastor. Yeah, do you want to represent classic in a tournament like this?

1799
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,660
Jason Dino

1800
01:51:57,660 --> 01:52:01,040
Looking hmm

1801
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:05,700
His paws are pointed up. He's got those fun paws

1802
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:09,040
Again in his seat is on the ride

1803
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:12,680
Imagine you're shrunk down to figure size

1804
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:19,820
Yeah, and and you could go on slinky your good friend who you do like more than Dumbo

1805
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:24,620
Yeah, we all like him more than Dumbo. No question. I want everyone to admit they like

1806
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:30,640
Slinky more than Dumbo. Of course. I do Jason admit it. I yeah, I think that's right. All right good listener

1807
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:36,440
I want you to pause this and admit it to yourself now in your car or wherever you are you're in a Starbucks

1808
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:41,600
I want you to make an announcement right now to the Starbucks. You like Slinky better than Dumbo

1809
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,780
Just yell to the room. Yes

1810
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:50,220
Then run out whatever you're doing push kick the door open and run out

1811
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:57,780
Wait, yeah, I know it's like class. Oh, like this isn't classic. I care about for some movie. It's boring

1812
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:01,720
Not bad it's great. Yeah, but

1813
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:08,700
Slinky versus Dumbo something that doesn't feel right to me, but Slinky ending up being the best

1814
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:13,900
Forget the forget the past killing if you must I okay. That's what I say

1815
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:19,920
I'm gonna save my classic vote. I'm gonna give it to Slinky

1816
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:26,200
Okay, but there's no fucking way I'm letting Tron win this. All right, okay

1817
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:31,140
Well, let's get into the pit then I might you know, then I'll just say Slinky

1818
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:38,640
For anyone keeping the records. I more I think it tops the model of if you're in a cute character

1819
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:41,360
This is this is this for the twenty-first. I'll be honest

1820
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,700
I'm disappointed in both of these answers in the sense that both of them were like

1821
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:49,240
I guess Slinky versus just an emphatic Slinky is the answer

1822
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:53,720
So it's I think it's tough for me in a way because it's a ride that I've been on

1823
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:58,800
I think only once it's in and it's in this one park and it's not like

1824
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,140
replicated everywhere

1825
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:06,060
This is I feel like it's like it's some kind of institutional guilt right that I'm supposed to pick Dumbo

1826
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:11,560
But maybe you're right Mike. Maybe you can help me break through that burn the sacred Jedi texts is what I'm saying

1827
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:14,860
Not paid doesn't matter not paid turns. They are not

1828
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:18,380
So that's my feeling. Okay

1829
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:25,480
Well, then let's let's hash this one out because this seems I think Jason is setting up a 12 angry men's scenario

1830
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:29,060
We don't get to leave the room. I don't I

1831
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:35,780
Tron is one of the oddest phenomena like you you were saying like you you found both those movies particularly boring

1832
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:40,120
I don't think I've ever sat down and watched either all the way through I think it is irrelevant

1833
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:41,580
Doesn't matter irrelevant

1834
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:46,880
But it's a rather fucking the institutional stuff comes up the movements come up

1835
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:53,700
Can't I can't get it out of my mind is that Tron is a thing that exists purely on

1836
01:54:53,700 --> 01:55:00,420
Aesthetics. Yes, like a hollow piece. It's like what what do you want a theater like but aesthetics kinder?

1837
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:07,020
No, I think all right, I think that the just aesthetics is probably not a great thing for theme parks

1838
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:09,000
Well, no, I would disagree with that

1839
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:09,780
It is that okay

1840
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:12,640
it's not completely irrelevant in the sense that I just

1841
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:19,600
The argument of character that you like because it's it's basically just decide which character you like and who you want to be in

1842
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:25,400
Right. So yes, your affection for the thing does come into play it comes into play

1843
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:30,560
So the teacups are winning by a country mile in that respect

1844
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:37,040
I mean, yeah, that Tron like cycle looks cool and it glows but I I don't have the personal affection

1845
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:40,980
I I have not ridden it so I don't have the direct

1846
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:47,580
Experience and it's also kind of like it's like one of those those kinder ball candies where they can't trust

1847
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:53,860
Americans to have a toy inside. So it's just a hollow ball with the the toy next to it. It's just full of air

1848
01:55:53,860 --> 01:55:59,900
It's just full of hot air. There's nothing in the middle, but there is a toy in those they just separate it from the chocolate

1849
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:07,940
So there is a toy. Yeah like over there. I'm saying Tron is kind of hollow like Tron. I don't know

1850
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:15,580
I don't but the thing about the ride. I think everybody likes this ride, but the ride you got to take away from it

1851
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:22,620
Yeah, well and if you guys you definitely have to take away the IP and also and what are we putting in Alice in Wonderland?

1852
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:26,760
There are no big teacups in Alice in Wonderland. Then we're really off the tracks. That's true

1853
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:30,480
There's no part where they get in a big teacup. They sip a teacup

1854
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:36,860
I will they and they grow and shrink spin around in this

1855
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:43,220
All day long if I could and I'd probably do it alone the earlier you said you only want to be in one for three

1856
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:44,680
to five minutes

1857
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:48,520
Yeah, but I don't want to be on a roller coaster all day

1858
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:55,920
Within minutes, we're all full of contradictions. Like I love it. Is it not to be human or to be contradicting yourself constantly?

1859
01:56:55,980 --> 01:57:02,160
It's the most philosophical episode. Yes, which yes it has to be in a lot of ways because we're trying to yeah

1860
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:05,120
To parse through this grappling with big control

1861
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:12,260
I think that that the fact that you this is an instance where you can control as much or as little as you want

1862
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:17,440
here and then let okay the last the last time Tron was in in this tournament I

1863
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:25,580
Again aesthetically I really convinced myself of the greatness of it because it is more

1864
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:31,800
Hitting me on an adult level and a child level because I've said this before I was I could not have cared less about the old

1865
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:37,740
West or like old-time whimsy when I was little when I was little it was all about space

1866
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:42,660
It was all about Tomorrowland. It was always always about colored lights and

1867
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:50,740
That's what this has this is my teenage dream my child's dream and my my adult

1868
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:57,900
Dream of a cool vehicle to ride on I wish I wish I had the balls to trip out my car

1869
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:01,580
In the way you see those obnoxious cars sometimes was like lights coming

1870
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:08,640
Underneath the car when they're driving at night and like they've customized their dashboard and there's different colored lights

1871
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,500
Like I wish I could do that

1872
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:14,940
I don't want to do that because I feel like I don't want to call attention to myself on the street and so I'll be

1873
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:20,600
Like like pretty cool ride, huh? Now. Let me just get my three-year-old out of the back. Yeah. Yeah

1874
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:22,400
It's a probably doesn't work

1875
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:29,200
But I do admire it sometimes when I see it the people that have like custom lights by the door handle inside

1876
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:35,480
Like you can do a lot of crazy stuff like that and that because that is a kid would have been my dream and to

1877
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:42,580
Have a car that has neon bright cool lights. I just saw that the company is making a color change car

1878
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:48,680
Unbelievable wait the lights underneath that the car itself. Oh, okay. Yeah

1879
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:50,380
Yes

1880
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:56,640
Just imagining Mike pulling up like at a stoplet like a drag racing scene and the other guy turns up

1881
01:58:56,640 --> 01:59:03,840
Like cool music and then Mike turns up like hey, it's a little Stevens garage. You're here with me a little Steven

1882
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:07,160
Perfect aesthetic match to a toy. Yeah

1883
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:15,220
This is so hard but the right yes the right

1884
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:21,320
It's tough it's tough tough now the only thing I would dock

1885
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:28,120
Tron is that once you take away the big rooms with the lights you are getting less lights

1886
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:31,320
That is part of it. You are getting less light

1887
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:37,000
There's lights on the vehicle, but a big part of that experience is going into that little that light room

1888
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,640
And you feel like you're on the grid. I

1889
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:48,040
Walk up to the line and get in line for the teacups drawn like okay, I did the virtual

1890
01:59:48,040 --> 02:00:00,540
Pain in the ass

1891
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:08,640
We set the rules here's this is all right, let me just I've been annoyed by everything Jason said in this round very well, however, I

1892
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:10,800
I I think I am gonna land at teacups

1893
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:17,400
Maybe if I landed teacups now, we won't have to hear any more arguments that are irrelevant. Well, we'll see I

1894
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:19,680
Think like it's something that influenced me

1895
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:23,800
I'm looking at Google images of Tron light cycle and I found what I think is

1896
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:31,580
Lentesta of touring plans in the Disney dish. I think this is him testing the one outside and he looks kind of uncomfortable

1897
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:39,060
And I don't know maybe that's just him. I shouldn't let that impact but like as opposed to nobody's unhappy in a teacup

1898
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:46,440
You know look kids all ages get represented and that is indeed lentesta and he didn't like it then it's teacups

1899
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:52,140
He might have liked the ride. He just like this this specific photo. Yeah, you're going teacups, too

1900
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:58,300
Well because of when because of in solidarity with when everything I just said you're concerned about him contorting his spine

1901
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:02,280
Yeah. Well, yeah everything I said, I don't believe in anymore because of what you just said about

1902
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:05,320
Wow, well that took a turn

1903
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:08,720
Okay, and that brings us to

1904
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:14,620
What the hell did I call it the the full and complete stop top two and

1905
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:15,160
that

1906
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:22,620
So we now are at I'm happy with the top two slinky dog versus teacups

1907
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:26,340
Whoo, this could have this could have easily been Dumbo verse teacups

1908
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:31,840
Which ultimately when I think that Dumbo and teacups are the two most iconic ride vehicles

1909
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:37,320
Makes sense. I like that. It's both things that are silly to be in

1910
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:45,840
You know, let's let's step outside of theme park super fans and let's go to your grandfather or a

1911
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,240
teacher or a

1912
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:47,740
visiting

1913
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:53,320
Dignitary that like Walt would have used to I I don't even know who he was Republican senator

1914
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:58,720
Yeah, yeah, think about an evil man who harmed this country irreparably and right about Walt

1915
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:06,100
Taking this person and like look how silly me in a big teacup me in a giant dog

1916
02:02:06,820 --> 02:02:12,400
Robert bird sitting in a teacup 90 years old. That's right. Yeah

1917
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:14,760
So I think we're in the right

1918
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:20,920
You know, but tech is represented the slinky dog is current and we I like that we have a

1919
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,420
2010s

1920
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:22,920
versus

1921
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:28,520
1955 yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's classic versus newer. Mm-hmm

1922
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:34,240
Oh who wants to even start? Well, I'll say that's in favor of teacups much more

1923
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:36,180
Whimsical color palette

1924
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:43,540
Yeah, I mean there's a very each car though is different yeah, but there's quite a few of them

1925
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:49,940
Yeah, so there's different styles range in this instance. So I think we would only be going with one ride vehicle or no

1926
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:54,240
I guess it's Casey jr. We were looking at the whole train. So I guess not I guess it is the full

1927
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:56,380
full slate of

1928
02:02:56,380 --> 02:03:01,300
Cups, it's all the cups. I think that it comes in all these varieties

1929
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:08,720
I guess you have to consider all the cups. Yeah, not just and maybe we would have to I'll go back and edit something

1930
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:12,400
Where we I had and say all the cups when we were start talking in the other rounds

1931
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:14,620
I started thinking just now

1932
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:21,080
Well, what did they look like to begin with because that's something we didn't really rule on right which era and I thought

1933
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:25,800
well surely the mad tea party teacups of

1934
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:29,620
Yesteryear of less yester land as I'm looking at right now

1935
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:32,060
Were

1936
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:36,840
Janky or hard steel cut kids in the back while the spinning happened

1937
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:42,980
Uh-huh, but in fact what I'm looking at is kind of what it looks like today. It's the same sort of

1938
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:48,320
Fun jagged patterns very similar color palette. I'm actually surprised

1939
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:54,300
I think I think probably Dumbo has changed more right then the teacups. So you really are

1940
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:55,040
honoring

1941
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:59,600
1955 and something they got right pretty early

1942
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:07,540
Yeah, yeah, I think if if you would call anything in media like untouchable, I think it's Mary Blair's

1943
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:13,100
Use of color. Did she do the teacups? Well, I know she did I think she did Alice

1944
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:16,940
I think she established Oh so much of the look of Alice

1945
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:24,260
I think is credited to her and then other small world and that uh, maybe she drew the things on the outside

1946
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:25,520
I don't know. It's a good question

1947
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:32,280
But I think it's hard to improve which is interesting to think about because when people talk about her it's like

1948
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:34,000
Oh, she would just kind of combine

1949
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:40,580
She went off her instincts and her got a lot. She would combine like, you know different

1950
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:42,540
pairings and oh, yeah

1951
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:49,100
So there is a I'll give it this there's this simplicity of course to the cups versus slinky

1952
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:52,660
Which is a big sort of unruly thing. It's a big coaster

1953
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:58,140
But you know, there's something to be said for simplicity I guess of design

1954
02:04:58,140 --> 02:05:00,320
Yeah, you know what? I'm seeing Jason's right

1955
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:05,980
I think according to one website at least that she did design them that like so these these designs on the back

1956
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:12,620
So you're getting a Mary Blair vote. I didn't know. Yeah, since we haven't done this as an episode. That's kind of interesting

1957
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:20,800
So she picked the colors she well, this is an interesting fact and that that pattern does feel like

1958
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:23,860
Her aesthetic so you're getting some like

1959
02:05:23,860 --> 02:05:29,860
You know like you're representing Disneyland 50s and 60s. Yeah in this

1960
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:34,940
Hmm I mean look we're not taking do with consideration

1961
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:39,240
But if you want to go back and watch a classic Disney purely for aesthetics

1962
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:45,660
Alice is I think the most pleasing to the eye the movie the movie

1963
02:05:46,060 --> 02:05:53,960
The movie is relevant in that it's it's you do maybe want to live in the world of a movie if there is a movie

1964
02:05:53,960 --> 02:06:00,720
In the attraction at least at least vibe wise. I mean slinky dog. It's a move. It's your friend

1965
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:07,120
It's your friend slinky dog. It is yeah, it's him and his seat

1966
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:09,840
Cups have handles there

1967
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,960
I like that you step up onto a plate

1968
02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:18,640
Your first step is you have to step onto that little plate and then climb inside of a cup right and that there's always there's a

1969
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:23,820
Little like do-si-do you got to do to fit in there, right? Right, right. I like closing that little door

1970
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:29,780
I like that the door protects you but it's very slight. It's not some big scary locking mechanism

1971
02:06:29,780 --> 02:06:35,400
I you make a great point both closing the door and the do-si-do to like scooch

1972
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:40,640
Scooch on in that's fun. Mm-hmm, but the slinky dog I find

1973
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:45,200
Satisfying as well. I find sitting on that seat fun

1974
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:49,520
It's not you know, it's not kind of like the people mover, but it does feel good

1975
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:53,320
That's open air and you know, you're not too locked in

1976
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:57,800
It's not a crazy high we haven't really even talked about harnesses at all. Mm-hmm

1977
02:06:57,800 --> 02:07:03,580
We talked to early on about it and we never really brought it up again, but there's not a crazy intrusive

1978
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:07,880
Harness, which is rare on a coaster, right? So you really feel like

1979
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:11,520
You're getting the wind in your hair on

1980
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:15,120
Slinky dog and it's not ever in a restrictive way like on

1981
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:20,000
In credit coaster or something, but so are you on teacups? I would say that's true

1982
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,140
You're getting wind in your hair and maybe aren't even going you're gonna be going way up a hill

1983
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:31,780
And a kid can get that wind if you're always gonna be spinning to some degree on in the teacups

1984
02:07:31,780 --> 02:07:37,860
Yes, yeah and on this some to some degree. Yeah. Yeah, and are we spinning on the earth?

1985
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:40,440
In the same way we're already

1986
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:42,980
We don't need to spin more

1987
02:07:42,980 --> 02:07:46,760
Now spinning let me ask as far as the sensation of spinning

1988
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:52,820
I feel like people generally have more of a of a not objection but generally version aversion

1989
02:07:52,820 --> 02:07:58,140
Yeah spinning versus going sort of straight ahead or bouncing up and down a little bit on a roller coaster track

1990
02:07:58,140 --> 02:08:03,520
so should we dock the teacups in a way because I

1991
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:11,200
Would say there's a probably a decent percentage of human beings on earth that don't want to spin like that because it makes them ill

1992
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:16,900
I don't think so because of what Jason said earlier, which is control and I think you know

1993
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:22,380
You've got your your big turntables and if you only want to spin to the degree that the turntable is right

1994
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:23,220
That's one thing

1995
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:27,940
But if you want to get a group together and spin the thing as fast as you can you can do that as well

1996
02:08:27,940 --> 02:08:31,060
That is pretty this is innovative for

1997
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:37,500
1955 yeah, this is some early Bob Gerr and again, I don't know his specific participation

1998
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:40,540
If I look it up in Bob Gerr was but it is stuck

1999
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:46,480
I think I mean arrow developments is involved a major company again irrelevant

2000
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:51,560
But if I see the name Bob Gerr, what choice do we have we're gonna say I'd rather

2001
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:55,980
Tell slinky dog to go away than Bob Gerr

2002
02:08:55,980 --> 02:08:59,700
Well, I don't want to tell Bob Gerr to go away so now you put this on the table

2003
02:08:59,780 --> 02:09:02,000
It would be upsetting to me to do that

2004
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:02,560
It's tough

2005
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:07,920
I I know Mike what you're saying with the aversion because I think Jane avoids the teacups a lot of people

2006
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:13,360
Cups to the same way that like stomach, but we did ride slinky dog last time we were in Florida

2007
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:19,620
So now I love to spin. Yeah, I was spinning in a chair and a little chair with my daughter yesterday

2008
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:22,740
I loved it and I'm a man in his late 30s

2009
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:25,660
So are you proposing that we put your chair in it instead?

2010
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:31,740
I would like to sub out the teacups for the office chair that I spun in yesterday

2011
02:09:31,740 --> 02:09:38,720
Let's put your daughter in both let's let her make the call I think she'd like teacups better sure

2012
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:42,820
I think that she would like teacups better at this stage

2013
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:44,860
Hmm

2014
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:47,940
Here's I think that

2015
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:55,220
With one of these choices that you represent a lot of history you represent tradition at the park

2016
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:59,640
You know the you know, what's alive in the teacups is?

2017
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:06,340
All carnival teacup ride the idea of the ride mechanism in general as it exists

2018
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:12,900
Outside of Disneyland even like the most basic primal a ride that spins round and round

2019
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:18,800
You also represent something that isn't slinky dog where you're suddenly small and you're in a big thing

2020
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:24,580
You get that in this you get bright colors you get to choose one you get control

2021
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:31,840
I think just like all of these facets that you would want out of any ride vehicle worth its

2022
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:36,300
Weight in salt worth its salts. What's the phrase?

2023
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:42,840
Whatever you feel about salt weight in gold gold nuts worth its weight in salt

2024
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:49,540
That's another so great that if the added assaults in the amount of it you could sell that salt for a lot of money all

2025
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:53,860
Everything you said is good, and it's it's correct, and it's a good persuasive argument

2026
02:10:56,060 --> 02:10:56,580
but

2027
02:10:56,580 --> 02:10:58,780
If you go outside and you see slinky

2028
02:10:58,780 --> 02:11:01,300
You got a friend there

2029
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:03,100
That's a friend

2030
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:07,620
Mmm, my relationship has been longer with the teacups

2031
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:10,500
But three toys, but can you be friends with a cup?

2032
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:15,660
I don't think that it's a requirement to be friends with any of these vehicles not a requirement

2033
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:21,300
But what do you value do you do you value history or do you value friendship more?

2034
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:26,460
That's my question do you value friendship with a fictional character

2035
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:32,400
Right who you have not met and who you do not interact with when you're on the ride vehicle

2036
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:36,680
Scott mentioned another good point not just the scooching and the door closing

2037
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:39,400
But yeah that moment of ooh, I want the purple one or ooh

2038
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:44,200
I want the green one and then racing to get it. Yeah, you don't get snaked

2039
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:49,300
That's fun other rides pull up and they choose for you. It's just whatever. It's just luck of the draw

2040
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:55,500
It's fun to be able to go pick my mind is made up it's teacups

2041
02:11:55,500 --> 02:11:58,220
And

2042
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:01,520
Tossing it to the wind. I'm gonna give it to teacups

2043
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:08,700
Wow. Well, that's it. But Mike, wait a minute. Take one shot at the buzzer. I

2044
02:12:08,700 --> 02:12:14,740
This is tough because I would I would rather Dumbo win the teacups win

2045
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:19,280
What happened but you like slinky better than Dumbo

2046
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:21,040
Ah

2047
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:26,480
We could really say screw it. Okay, we could all buy it right now to give it to Dumbo instead of the teacups

2048
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:31,660
No one want to do that. So an element of control you can go up and down true. There is an element of control

2049
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:36,040
Uh, that would really that would really screw the rules. I'm not changing mine. No, no me neither. Well

2050
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:38,620
I'm gonna vote for

2051
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:47,040
You're holding up the victory party the teacups are waiting to get full with a gatorade and champagne and you're holding them up

2052
02:12:47,620 --> 02:12:49,040
Let them go enjoy

2053
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:53,560
You just brought up a different thing that maybe that'll sway me you can fill up

2054
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:56,460
The teacup with champagne and and ride

2055
02:12:56,460 --> 02:13:04,740
I mean, I guess you could do that with slinky too, but in theory if you are at uh, I think one of uh, uh,

2056
02:13:04,820 --> 02:13:10,780
Didn't like uh, nick cannon and mariah carrey one of his marriages didn't he get married at disneyland?

2057
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:14,980
Yeah, yeah, or they renewed their vows or something. Okay. Well, yeah something like that, you know

2058
02:13:14,980 --> 02:13:21,080
Maybe at that level those two could have and should have filled up a teacup with champagne

2059
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:25,020
And then swam around in it and gulped it up. Okay. Now this is yes

2060
02:13:25,020 --> 02:13:27,520
They should have done that

2061
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:29,160
Having a teacup

2062
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:32,020
You can do jason you could fill that teacup up with broth

2063
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:35,240
And you could have a little like broth bath every night

2064
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:40,460
Um, okay. This is an interesting new wrinkle. I yeah me and broth

2065
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:41,980
Um

2066
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:45,960
It's gonna make him switch his vote. He doesn't want to burn alive and brah. Yeah, I don't know

2067
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:50,320
I know it's kind of uh the last few years. It's been very uh,

2068
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:54,520
Bone broth has been a big like superfood kind of thing. All right on that

2069
02:13:54,520 --> 02:14:02,380
Tea cups are the winner of I hate to interrupt the bone broth story, but teacups are the winner

2070
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:05,140
Five

2071
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:12,500
It's better as a ride giant teacup filled with champagne also sounds like it'd be on the rider for the deuces our wild residency

2072
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:19,060
Well, that's true. You know, all right, it could have been now we have gotten aerosmith representation in there somehow

2073
02:14:19,060 --> 02:14:26,720
Um our congratulations to the teacups on a well-earned victory. Hey, you've stuck in there for

2074
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:31,080
Many years however long disneyland's been open. I don't care to do that math

2075
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:35,120
uh, but since 1955 a classic and

2076
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:40,660
You did it the original spin doctors as I like to say

2077
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:42,300
teacups

2078
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:44,780
and uh

2079
02:14:44,780 --> 02:14:49,060
Uh, yeah. Hey, um a very interesting discussion. I think we got to the right player

2080
02:14:49,060 --> 02:14:53,680
Are we are we all ultimately happy? Are you gonna be uh, this honestly this of all the ones we've done so far

2081
02:14:53,680 --> 02:14:56,440
This one feels the most wrong as far as the winner to me

2082
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:59,000
I don't know why I feel like I feel like it was not bad

2083
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:04,100
But I feel like we did something wrong here today. I'm I'm I am curious what the listeners think

2084
02:15:04,100 --> 02:15:07,480
I think this is when by making it a little bit more real of the discussion

2085
02:15:07,480 --> 02:15:09,740
Something you actually could talk about

2086
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:14,580
Um, if if you had a group of people with this insular of interests as us

2087
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:22,180
If you you should talk this out, uh with anybody you you care to you pick your favorite you fill out the bracket which will post

2088
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:29,500
Um, if anything didn't make it to the 32 and it should have give us a good, uh, justice for give us a hashtag justice for

2089
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:34,080
whatever, uh for the one that I liked your pitch jason of uh,

2090
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:37,800
I'll say justice for nights and white satin mobile

2091
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:43,980
Good idea. Ultimately, I was like was it a good ride vehicle and I looked at it and I could not say that it was

2092
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:45,480
It's just kind of a default

2093
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:50,880
It was just kind of a default. I just threw some I I had some in there where I was like

2094
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:53,960
Like the omnibus, isn't that just a car?

2095
02:15:54,260 --> 02:16:00,580
Isn't that you had to take out some yeah, ultimately, uh, uh, yeah, I think ride vehicles have to be moved by some mechanism

2096
02:16:00,740 --> 02:16:04,680
What's more fun than the teacups maybe most of the rides we said, however

2097
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:10,160
It feels right ish to me. Does it not feel right ish to you? Let us know

2098
