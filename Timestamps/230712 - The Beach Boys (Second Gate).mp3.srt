1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,160
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:22,772
Alright, it's Scott's birthday shot.

3
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,652
I'm Scott, you guys are not.

4
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:27,112
Jason and I.

5
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,872
I'm not, hello, I'm here.

6
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:30,172
And Mike is also not.

7
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,712
Logging into the tea pub like,

8
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:35,952
get the I'm Scott, you're not shirt cooking.

9
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:40,132
I know, look, it's reminiscent of Chevy Chase, I know.

10
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:43,052
It's kinda, you know, hovering on his territory,

11
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:44,532
but I thought I'd give it a go anyway.

12
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:46,512
Yeah, look, this is it.

13
00:00:46,512 --> 00:00:47,972
I'm taking my birthday shot.

14
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:50,412
This is only the second one of these.

15
00:00:51,032 --> 00:00:52,752
Mike, you took yours with a net.

16
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:56,812
And now I'm following your lead

17
00:00:56,812 --> 00:00:58,872
and I'm bringing one of my passions to the table.

18
00:00:59,112 --> 00:01:00,512
I'm doing it a little early.

19
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:02,032
My birthday's July 29th,

20
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:05,472
but due to the Vegas schedule, we're fitting it in here.

21
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:08,052
And there's really only one thing

22
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:10,732
that my birthday shot could be,

23
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:14,672
which is the only thing that is second to theme parks

24
00:01:14,672 --> 00:01:17,612
that I could just talk about at length

25
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:21,252
without preparation, and that is America's band,

26
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:22,072
the Beach Boys.

27
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:26,532
Thank you guys for taking the shot with me.

28
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:27,292
Of course.

29
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:28,912
My birthday shot is just getting to talk about

30
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:32,192
the Beach Boys more than you were doing on the show.

31
00:01:32,412 --> 00:01:33,672
More fully than usual.

32
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:36,732
I know I jam it into every episode whenever I can.

33
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:39,272
The question I ask here maybe is,

34
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:42,292
does this feel like a chore?

35
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:45,592
Is this something that you're like, oh God, this?

36
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:48,032
Or I don't know where you guys land exactly.

37
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,872
Mike, I sense that you like some Beach Boys stuff.

38
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:51,952
Jason, I have no clue.

39
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:54,372
I have no idea where you've ever landed on this.

40
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:58,952
Well, I kind of learned about the Beach Boys more.

41
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:00,952
I mean, I always heard the big hits.

42
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:02,572
Obviously when we were kids,

43
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:05,732
Kocomo was big, but in college,

44
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:07,992
when I was trying to do the,

45
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:10,172
listen to all the seminal albums,

46
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:12,212
I listened to a lot of pet sounds.

47
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:15,292
This will probably make you,

48
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:18,992
I will look less cool in your eyes.

49
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:21,632
I knew that standard was already very high.

50
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:23,612
Don't erode your cool, Jason.

51
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:30,532
I remember one birthday getting the Brian Wilson solo

52
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:33,712
attempt at Smile came out when we were in college.

53
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:35,172
I don't think that would make you less cool.

54
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:35,932
No, not at all.

55
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:36,372
Are you kidding?

56
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:37,192
No, of course.

57
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:39,552
I love the Brian Wilson solo Smile.

58
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:40,192
Oh, okay.

59
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:43,032
Did you think he was like a smiley,

60
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,952
like a purist for the original?

61
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:46,192
A smiley smile purist?

62
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:49,492
No, no, I thought that had been dumped on before

63
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:51,812
and I am just recalling.

64
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:53,972
No, no, I remember one,

65
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:55,952
I think one birthday it was that

66
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:58,332
and like America the book.

67
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,772
We all remember, we all read every page

68
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:01,892
of the Daily Show book.

69
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:03,052
That's gonna be your shot.

70
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,692
Just a big tribute to Jon Stewart.

71
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:09,632
No, I'm thrilled to hear that.

72
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:13,932
Brian Wilson presents Smile is as close as we have really

73
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:17,672
to Smile, Brian Wilson's masterpiece being completed.

74
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:19,232
I thought it turned out great,

75
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:21,872
which and that's the story of Brian.

76
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:23,532
He flew too close to the sun

77
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:25,052
and never delivered his masterpiece.

78
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,292
It's all been picking up the pieces ever since

79
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,052
and it's been a journey to root for.

80
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,412
He's kind of the hero of the story

81
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:35,252
and there are some villains to the story.

82
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:35,992
Heroes and villains.

83
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:38,252
As well as heroes and villains to quote the song.

84
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,292
I've kind of always viewed the whole thing

85
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,272
through that lens.

86
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:43,652
But let me say first of all

87
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:47,632
that it is not some ironic interest on my part.

88
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:51,112
This is not some contrived thing.

89
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:53,512
Actually, Kokomo is good.

90
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:55,092
That's not where I'm coming from.

91
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:56,612
Do you think Kokomo is good though?

92
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:59,092
I have a complicated relationship with Kokomo.

93
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:01,092
This is the place to dive into it.

94
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,652
Let me say the whole thing

95
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:07,552
and then I think I can explain

96
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:10,232
where I land on Kokomo and why.

97
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:12,272
The basics of it,

98
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:14,252
there's two bands to the Beach Boys.

99
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:16,552
There's Brian Wilson's Beach Boys

100
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:18,012
and to some extent the other people

101
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:20,732
and then there's Mike Love's Beach Boys.

102
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:23,292
And I think if people grimace

103
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:25,272
when I bring up the Beach Boys on the show,

104
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:27,092
I think it's because they're thinking

105
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:28,732
of Mike Love's Beach Boys

106
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:30,672
and I could hardly fault them.

107
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:33,272
And Kokomo obviously is,

108
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:37,092
that is the most hardcore Mike Love of Beach Boys

109
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:38,532
there could be.

110
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:42,172
Did you find that Beach Boys first?

111
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:44,112
The full house Beach Boys,

112
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,512
the people wearing the worst leather jackets

113
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:48,612
you've ever seen

114
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:51,772
and the most ill-fitting ponytails you've ever seen.

115
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,192
Did you experience that and then go,

116
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,932
the Beach Boys stink?

117
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:57,412
That's a good question.

118
00:04:57,692 --> 00:05:00,252
Cause like many of kids,

119
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:02,832
Beach Boys appearing on full house

120
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:04,992
is a very strong memory when you're a kid.

121
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:05,552
Yes.

122
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:07,192
Which as a kid makes you think,

123
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:09,212
who are these cool guys?

124
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:13,092
The show only presents the coolest of pop culture.

125
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:14,312
Yeah, of course.

126
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:16,172
But I don't know,

127
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:19,752
my parents played a lot of old albums and stuff

128
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,152
which weren't that old at the time.

129
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:22,152
They must have been,

130
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:23,092
knowing your parents' music taste.

131
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:24,092
So I don't think,

132
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:25,532
so I think I kind of,

133
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:26,532
in my mind at all,

134
00:05:26,572 --> 00:05:30,152
I know the hits in that song kind of all at once.

135
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:34,552
So it didn't color my impression overtly.

136
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:35,872
I don't think.

137
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:37,092
Didn't spoil it for you.

138
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:39,232
You could still enjoy the,

139
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:41,472
you could enjoy the Brian Wilson Beach Boys

140
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,412
when it wasn't washed away by the other.

141
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:46,812
Yeah, and I associate Kermit with Kokomo too.

142
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:47,372
Yes.

143
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,572
Yeah, I was gonna say the Muppets.

144
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,372
That is forever linked to it.

145
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:51,232
And I do kind of,

146
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:52,432
I like Kokomo now.

147
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:53,912
Well, that's my-

148
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:54,672
I can enjoy it.

149
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,112
Yeah.

150
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:58,992
I mean, I think my feeling has just always been like,

151
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:02,252
I think it's maybe how people feel with like,

152
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:05,452
if you like a Dial of Destiny or something.

153
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,072
If you like have,

154
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:08,392
well, I don't know.

155
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,352
I don't know if it's the,

156
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:09,952
but you know,

157
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,112
I just love seeing my friends together.

158
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:12,492
Sure.

159
00:06:12,492 --> 00:06:13,692
You've said that about a lot of things.

160
00:06:13,912 --> 00:06:14,072
Yes.

161
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,032
There's a feeling about,

162
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:16,832
it's one of the only things I think I have it with,

163
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:17,752
where like,

164
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,512
well, it's still the voices.

165
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:23,712
It's still Carl's wonderful voice and Mike,

166
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:25,732
you know, doing some,

167
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:28,372
it's Mike Love's energy, let's say.

168
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:29,232
I don't know.

169
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:32,412
It's the people who have been part of things

170
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,012
that I care about very much.

171
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:35,392
And it's still them,

172
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:37,772
even if it's on kind of a schlocky thing.

173
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:38,112
I just,

174
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:39,132
I do,

175
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:40,672
I like seeing my friends together.

176
00:06:40,832 --> 00:06:41,792
Yeah, I get that.

177
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:42,632
Yeah, that makes sense.

178
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:43,332
I think,

179
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:43,772
I don't know,

180
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:46,212
the song is sort of redeemable,

181
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,792
I think in some ways too.

182
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:48,392
Yeah.

183
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:49,432
It's cheesy.

184
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:50,672
It's a cheesy song.

185
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:53,372
And probably a lot of it's just nostalgia for me.

186
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:54,132
Yeah.

187
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:55,892
That does a lot of heavy lifting for it, but-

188
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:57,612
Well, but it was around when we were what?

189
00:06:57,712 --> 00:06:58,572
Three, four years.

190
00:06:58,572 --> 00:06:59,712
And through our whole child,

191
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:03,332
the fact that it was part of like Muppet stuff,

192
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:04,192
it was very,

193
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:05,352
it was kept around,

194
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:07,772
kept around by the band today.

195
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:08,532
They've almost,

196
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:11,992
you almost regard it as one of the primary songs

197
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:12,932
at this point,

198
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:14,272
which is insane.

199
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:14,792
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,112
Because the primary song,

201
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:17,572
like the real,

202
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:20,632
the true period of the band firing on all cylinders

203
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,672
is like 62 to 66,

204
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:24,732
where they had so many hits.

205
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:27,932
And it's amazing that they landed one right at the end

206
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:29,592
that has nothing to do with any of that,

207
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:32,932
that doesn't sound like the rest of the music of the band,

208
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:34,512
but just through sheer will,

209
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:36,252
through Mike Love's sheer will.

210
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:36,952
Revenge.

211
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:37,812
His anger.

212
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:38,732
Absolutely.

213
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:39,812
Yeah, spite.

214
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:42,572
Well, yeah, that's what it is.

215
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:43,892
And maybe like,

216
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:47,132
I mentioned this notion of heroes and villains.

217
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:50,092
And I think if I just liked the music,

218
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:54,152
that wouldn't be enough to make it this fascination.

219
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,992
I think the reason I continue to love them

220
00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:58,572
and think about them all the time

221
00:07:58,572 --> 00:08:00,932
are the great characters.

222
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:04,232
I think you have wonderful characters in the story

223
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:07,212
who like weave in and out of each other

224
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:10,112
and like jockey to control the band's legacy.

225
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,532
And I do think it breaks down into heroes and villains,

226
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:15,512
which is a rare thing.

227
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:18,112
I don't think it's usually so cut and dry.

228
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,712
You hear like somebody in this band was kind of a jerk,

229
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:22,652
but it's not as clear as like,

230
00:08:22,872 --> 00:08:25,932
they are fully on the other side, super villain.

231
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:27,752
The devil and God.

232
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:28,432
Yeah.

233
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,992
It's the hardcore line in the sand.

234
00:08:31,152 --> 00:08:31,652
Pretty much.

235
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:32,892
As far as motivations.

236
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:36,372
So our heroes, the people that we root for,

237
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:39,612
it's the Wilson Brothers, Brian,

238
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:43,852
who is a true like struck by lightning

239
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:46,952
once in a generation musical genius.

240
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:50,932
Like truly early 60s, he's this like,

241
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:54,832
you know, vibrant right in there with the Beatles and Spectre

242
00:08:55,392 --> 00:08:58,532
like this defiant pop genius moving things ahead.

243
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:01,872
And then been very troubled for a long time.

244
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:05,192
Which has left us with the Brian we have today,

245
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:11,292
who is just a, this kind of like sweet troubled man

246
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,732
who is just, he's getting by.

247
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:15,012
Do you know about the interview

248
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,832
where he discusses his favorite movie?

249
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,392
I don't think so.

250
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,592
This is one of the great exchanges

251
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:23,252
in the history of press, of journalism.

252
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:25,172
This is Spin Magazine.

253
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:27,252
Question, have you seen any good movies lately?

254
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:29,152
Well, I've seen, I've only seen one

255
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,192
in the last couple of years.

256
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:31,972
It's called Norbit by Eddie Murphy.

257
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,812
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I've seen that.

258
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,412
How did you like it?

259
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:37,132
Fantastic movie, very funny.

260
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:38,752
What's your favorite movie?

261
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:39,592
Norbit.

262
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:44,132
Oh, Brian.

263
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:48,452
Yeah, which is how I, it's just like, oh, sweet, sad Brian.

264
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:51,912
Aaron had, I think a good metaphor for him

265
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:53,372
and to put it in PTR terms,

266
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:56,452
he's kind of a human truffles the bear.

267
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,592
The big sad bear who we love

268
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:01,312
at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.

269
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:04,432
He's just kind of like always slouched

270
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:07,712
and looking a little bummed and like he could use a hug.

271
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:10,292
And sometimes he's wearing a Hawaiian shirt.

272
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:13,532
So that's him, that's Brian is a human truffles.

273
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:17,612
You've got Dennis, the drummer, Brian's brother,

274
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:20,512
who's the only actual surfer and the only beach boy

275
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:23,912
who anyone might consider cool on any level.

276
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:24,452
Yeah.

277
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,332
That's one big thing about the Beach Boys.

278
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:29,072
They, I love their music very much.

279
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:30,512
They are not cool.

280
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,652
Nobody has ever called them cool.

281
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:35,832
Which is sort of interesting

282
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,492
because almost every, isn't that the appeal

283
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:38,672
of most rock bands?

284
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:42,792
There was just this tribute concert on CBS

285
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:46,812
where with all my favorite bands came out to,

286
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:48,512
all my other favorite bands came out to honor

287
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:50,572
my favorite band, Weezer, Fall Out Boy.

288
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:51,932
They were all there.

289
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,752
And Drew Carey came out and did a little tribute to Dennis

290
00:10:57,752 --> 00:11:00,132
and he made a joke that I liked a lot,

291
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,172
which was, he's the only surfer of the band.

292
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:06,452
He's the, probably the band's only sex symbol.

293
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:06,912
Oh, right.

294
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:08,672
And then he gestured to the band

295
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:10,532
who were all up in the balcony and said,

296
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,232
I mean, come on, right?

297
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:15,332
As if to say, look at yourselves.

298
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:19,112
And then it cuts to the Living Beach Boys

299
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:22,212
and especially Mike Love just glaring

300
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:26,072
with all the hate in the world you could have for Drew Carey.

301
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:28,292
Someone who no one hates at this point.

302
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:31,712
Well, Dennis also, Dennis died pretty young, right?

303
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:34,152
Yep, drowned in Marina Del Rey in 83.

304
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:38,532
Yeah, he got out of there while he was still relatively young.

305
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,632
You're saying he would have gotten old and uncool?

306
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:41,672
Oh, possibly.

307
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:43,732
They would have handed him every opportunity.

308
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:44,312
Yeah.

309
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:49,012
I mean, you don't make it out of full house appearances alive.

310
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,232
You don't end up seeming that cool.

311
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:55,572
If Dennis is doing like, you know, like, hey, Stephanie,

312
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,132
I'd be happy to help you with your homework.

313
00:11:57,952 --> 00:12:02,732
You know, DJ, maybe you and Steve aren't meant to be.

314
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:06,692
Maybe he cares about eating more than he cares about you.

315
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:10,892
Dennis, I feel like I picked up like little bits and bobs

316
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:15,072
of knowledge because whenever, I guess, few years ago,

317
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,292
once upon a time, Hollywood came out.

318
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:17,732
Yeah.

319
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:19,292
And the Manson connection,

320
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,012
like the kind of casual Manson connection.

321
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:26,772
Yeah, I think the way that Brad Pitt meets the Manson family

322
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:30,012
in the movie is very much based on how Dennis ran into them.

323
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:32,992
Where he's just like open chest,

324
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:34,872
can of beer while he's driving,

325
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:40,872
just like horny as hell and can get it

326
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:42,232
wherever he wants.

327
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:45,252
There's no shortage of sex opportunities.

328
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:48,472
And he like saw a couple of girls hitchhiking

329
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:50,432
and like, yeah, I'd be happy to.

330
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:52,692
All right, I have no further questions.

331
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:54,832
I just need to know where you live.

332
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:55,972
Okay, Chatsworth.

333
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:56,712
Spawn Ranch.

334
00:12:56,872 --> 00:12:57,452
Spawn Ranch.

335
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:57,792
I've heard of that.

336
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,152
Ranch living, huh?

337
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,372
Horses love it.

338
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:04,192
I would love to hang out with whoever you've got up there

339
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:06,912
for as long, for 24 hours or more.

340
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:12,072
Yes, which then leads to,

341
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:15,892
Charles Manson has a song on a Beach Boys album.

342
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:16,292
Yeah.

343
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:18,452
He wrote a song and for a while,

344
00:13:18,892 --> 00:13:22,032
the credit was just to Dennis Wilson and him.

345
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:23,792
And then the murders happened.

346
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:25,392
Like shit, shit, shit.

347
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:28,132
Like that record is in stores right then.

348
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:28,492
Yeah.

349
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:29,092
What do we do?

350
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,112
Crap, crap, crap.

351
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:31,832
We know, I swear we didn't know.

352
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:34,192
Then how come you wrote a song on your record?

353
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:34,992
Jesus.

354
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:37,992
And I've got some more.

355
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:40,472
I'm gonna play, basically the plan here,

356
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:41,432
just to announce the plan,

357
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:45,032
I'm gonna play a little pile of crazy Beach Boys music

358
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,072
for you guys.

359
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:48,372
And I think it's a testament to how much

360
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:49,992
the crazy Beach Boys music there is

361
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:54,112
that the song written by Charles Manson does not qualify.

362
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:54,652
Oh wow, okay.

363
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:55,372
It's not in there.

364
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:57,292
Actually, you know, honestly, it's not bad.

365
00:13:57,992 --> 00:13:58,012
Wow.

366
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:00,852
Have you ever heard his regular music?

367
00:14:00,952 --> 00:14:01,832
The demo of it?

368
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:02,512
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:02,892
I think I have, yeah.

370
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:05,872
I mean, not that song or anything of his just like.

371
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:07,212
He has a lot of shitty music.

372
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:07,992
It's pretty bad.

373
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:08,652
Yeah, yeah.

374
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:09,732
But if you dress it up,

375
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:12,092
if you run it through a production filter

376
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:13,992
and get some decent musicians on there.

377
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:14,272
Yeah.

378
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:15,452
I'll go ahead and say,

379
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:17,852
I don't think Charles Manson was the best guitar player

380
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:19,232
around in those days.

381
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:20,152
All right, well.

382
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,032
John Hinckley puts him to shame.

383
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:24,012
You know what?

384
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:26,192
I haven't heard Hinckley's, but I bet.

385
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:27,292
I honestly.

386
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:29,912
He just kind of sounds like singer songwriters.

387
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:32,212
It's just kind of, from what I remember,

388
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:33,292
it's like acoustic.

389
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:35,512
If he can keep a tempo, I think,

390
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:37,132
he's better than Manson.

391
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:41,812
I think he was supposed to do a show at like a smaller venue,

392
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:43,912
maybe attached to a hotel in New York.

393
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:47,112
And then there was Uproar that they booked him.

394
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:51,132
I would say Hinckley also pulled the trigger himself

395
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:53,012
as opposed to Manson having to send people.

396
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:53,492
That's true.

397
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:56,492
So there's another area where he beats Manson.

398
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,692
He needs other people to do things for him.

399
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,872
But Carl's in there, my favorite beach boy,

400
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:02,632
the heart of the band.

401
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:04,372
And the reason why any of it's listenable

402
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:06,492
in the later days, especially including Kokomo.

403
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:08,352
Then you've got Al Jardine.

404
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,152
Al Jardine, you know those alignment charts,

405
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:12,712
the Dungeons and Dragons?

406
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,092
That's what it's based on, right?

407
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,532
The character alignment.

408
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:17,732
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

409
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:18,372
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

410
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:19,112
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

411
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:19,592
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

412
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:22,232
Al Jardine, a true neutral.

413
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:24,152
The definition of true neutral.

414
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:25,872
The most just around.

415
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:29,192
It's kind of impossible to have an opinion about him.

416
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,192
He's there, don't worry about him.

417
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:34,232
And then we get into our villains,

418
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:35,832
because of all the bands in the world,

419
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:38,932
I can't think of a band that has more people

420
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:40,512
trying to get them.

421
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:43,752
They have so many boss hogs to their dukes of hazard.

422
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:47,532
One being Murray Wilson, all the Wilson boys.

423
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:50,452
Father, who is a, do you know about Murray?

424
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:53,312
Their father was a psychopath.

425
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:58,112
Oh, I miraculously don't know about Murray Wilson.

426
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:01,912
He was a songwriter too, a little bit.

427
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:03,192
Like a jingle guy.

428
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:06,612
He tried to do a song for the Colonel.

429
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:08,412
The Colonel makes finger lick.

430
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:10,512
His music is bad, it's not good.

431
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:12,532
So he was a failed musician,

432
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:15,752
so he's taken out all his rage on the boys.

433
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:19,092
And then also, he just sold all the songs

434
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:20,772
without telling them, oh by the way,

435
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,072
you don't own your music anymore, bye.

436
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:26,132
You are not set for life even remotely, so long.

437
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:30,392
Dr. Eugene Landy, who is in the film,

438
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:31,852
played by Paul Giamatti.

439
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,932
He's a psychiatrist who was brought in

440
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:38,172
to save Brian's life, but instead he takes over his life

441
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:42,152
and even starts writing all of his music with it.

442
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:44,092
He puts himself in the will.

443
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,252
And then also, hey, and we write songs together, right?

444
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:47,892
Don't we buddy?

445
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:50,432
All right, more of that to come.

446
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:53,472
But there is one villain, of course,

447
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:55,652
to the band, in the band.

448
00:16:55,952 --> 00:16:58,452
And this is who drives the entire thing.

449
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:00,232
The biggest villain to the Beach Boys.

450
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:03,772
Perhaps the biggest villain in music history in general.

451
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,432
And that is the great Michael Edward Love.

452
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:14,232
Mike Love, I mean, you hate him, but you love to hate him.

453
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,432
If there's no Mike Love, this is what I'm saying

454
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,012
with the great characters.

455
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:21,212
If there isn't that, then I think the Beach Boys

456
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:23,492
just made some good music a long time ago

457
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:24,872
and you don't think about it anymore.

458
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:29,472
But you need the heel, the Thorne and Brian side.

459
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:32,492
Who wears terrible clothes?

460
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:35,992
He's always in a hat, even though you are fully aware

461
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:38,312
he's been bald for like 50 years.

462
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,692
He dances like a doofus.

463
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:43,132
He's this like Tommy Bahama cheese ball.

464
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,512
He is a major trumper.

465
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:49,072
He is like, is there a more Trumpy musician?

466
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:52,232
I guess Kid Rocks in there, three doors down.

467
00:17:52,592 --> 00:17:54,392
Yeah, that's true.

468
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:57,132
I don't know, but if he feels like he's similar

469
00:17:57,132 --> 00:18:01,492
in age to Donald, there's something specific about it.

470
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:01,832
Kid Rock.

471
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,232
I think a lot of people just ended up like,

472
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:06,092
now it's confusing because you've got Biden

473
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:07,792
who's also in the same age range.

474
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,472
But I think a lot of people are just like,

475
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:10,992
something about the guy I like.

476
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:14,352
You mean that he is a man and he is around your age?

477
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:16,212
Ancient, yeah, yeah, yeah.

478
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:19,572
He seems lost sometimes the way I do.

479
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:21,452
That's very comforting.

480
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:23,372
But that's gonna be confusing in 2024

481
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:25,172
when you got two.

482
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:26,212
Oh, yeah.

483
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:28,172
Too very confused.

484
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:28,992
Oh my God.

485
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:31,172
Too confused guys and then just like

486
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:33,432
a overly jacked baby boom.

487
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:38,592
Like just RFK Junior and like the most really

488
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:43,492
worrisome people are just like, oh, Kennedy, Kennedy?

489
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:44,552
There's more Kennedy.

490
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,192
It's like, yeah, that's not good.

491
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,432
He's got the Bill Maher vote

492
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:49,112
and he's got the Rob Schneider vote.

493
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:50,012
So we're looking good.

494
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:51,372
We got great supporters.

495
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:52,812
Oh, jeez Louise.

496
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:55,512
I don't know, where does RFK Junior fall

497
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:56,692
on the alignment chart?

498
00:18:57,352 --> 00:19:00,492
Oh, that's a complicated question I think.

499
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:03,532
Actually, follow up question.

500
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:07,972
Has there been anyone in politics in the last 15 years

501
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:09,952
who you don't call chaotic evil?

502
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,552
That's on both sides.

503
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,352
That's getting, there's maybe a couple,

504
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:15,032
but it's closer to neutral.

505
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:17,552
The political alignment chart is nine squares

506
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:19,312
and eight of them are blank.

507
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,152
Yeah.

508
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:24,032
And then there's 10,000 names all squeezed into the one.

509
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:27,072
Just yeah, where on that chart is there just a column

510
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:29,172
that just says pure grifter?

511
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:30,072
Like.

512
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,032
Oh, that's true.

513
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:31,532
Yeah, yeah.

514
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:33,052
You gotta go to a bigger box.

515
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:34,892
That's actually where most of them.

516
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:35,952
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:36,872
That's the 10th type.

518
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,972
Like it's one of those things where you hear someone go like,

519
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,892
well, you know, they're actually, they're anti-war

520
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:44,792
and they're proof-free speech.

521
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,612
And they start saying all these things

522
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:49,272
that try to like butter you up, like butter regular people.

523
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:51,912
And you should immediately be reaching for your wallet

524
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:55,712
because someone is gonna pick your pocket right now.

525
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:56,332
I still got that, don't I?

526
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:57,932
This guy's running for office.

527
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:01,572
He's a wallet inspector, so make sure to show him yours.

528
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:02,592
Like, uh-oh.

529
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:03,632
That's good, I believe.

530
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:05,552
I think wallets do need to be inspected.

531
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:06,712
That sounds good to me.

532
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,012
This guy's reasonable.

533
00:20:09,432 --> 00:20:11,152
Yeah, that's what, you know, yeah,

534
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:14,692
Mike Love has like firmly taken the Beach Boys name into,

535
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:15,672
because if you don't know,

536
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:17,852
the people I listed in the heroes column,

537
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:20,572
two of them are dead and two of them have nothing to do

538
00:20:20,572 --> 00:20:22,372
with Mike Love and don't want to.

539
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:24,492
And when things happen like, hey,

540
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:26,432
the big catch, come catch the Beach Boys

541
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:33,672
at this big Don Jr. hunting animals rally,

542
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:38,152
like the rally to get more rhinos shot.

543
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:41,672
Come hang out and hear Barbra Ann and all your favorites.

544
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:44,652
There'll be good vibrations, man.

545
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:46,872
Yeah, there's a lot, Mike Love,

546
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:49,612
what Mike Love has done is almost turned the Beach Boys

547
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:52,492
into the chain restaurant version of the Beach Boys.

548
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:53,032
Yes.

549
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:55,952
You see it happen here and there and it's not,

550
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:59,152
Brian May didn't do it as, he kind of did it,

551
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:00,472
but it's not.

552
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:01,652
You say Brian May.

553
00:21:01,852 --> 00:21:02,532
Brian May and Queen.

554
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:02,912
Oh, sure, yeah.

555
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:05,312
Kind of did a version of it with Queen,

556
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:06,732
where it's like.

557
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:07,332
But it's less.

558
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:09,552
It's less aggressive than what Mike Love did,

559
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:13,652
which is truly the band feels like a bunch of cartoon men

560
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:15,772
with just like the most blanket,

561
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:18,932
what we do, man, is surfing and it's like,

562
00:21:18,932 --> 00:21:22,852
he's boiled it down to the fast food version.

563
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:24,712
The image from everything he wears,

564
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:26,532
the clothing exactly right.

565
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:27,712
It's all.

566
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:30,252
But it's all gotten stupider and crazier.

567
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,592
The colors have gotten worse.

568
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:34,732
It's how I've said how Trump has always been doing

569
00:21:34,732 --> 00:21:37,012
kabuki of a man.

570
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:39,932
He's like this, he is a version of a man

571
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,272
you could see from the back row of an arena,

572
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:43,752
which is what he, that's what he is.

573
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:44,212
Sure.

574
00:21:44,372 --> 00:21:47,132
And that's kind of, like Mike Love is like a,

575
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:48,852
well, if you're all the way in the back row

576
00:21:48,852 --> 00:21:50,832
of the Hollywood Bowl where they played last night

577
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:55,272
as we record this, yeah, that looks like a cool surfer dude.

578
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:57,872
And you get up close to him and oh my God,

579
00:21:57,892 --> 00:21:58,852
what's wrong with him?

580
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:02,092
And this is the craziest shirt pattern I've ever seen.

581
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:03,552
And look at his hair, oh God.

582
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,412
It is like a pro wrestling heel wearing like,

583
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:08,272
oh, they're wearing a suit,

584
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,472
but it's the gaudiest thing you've ever seen.

585
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:11,512
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

586
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:14,212
Which is what's supposed to impress you

587
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:16,312
and blind you with the opulence.

588
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:19,212
It's like if Paul McCartney touring now

589
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,792
made everyone wear the old Beetle suits.

590
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:23,052
The suits and the laptops.

591
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:24,232
Yeah, absolutely.

592
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:26,012
It's like, or yeah, and then they would come out

593
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,212
at like they were a tribute band

594
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,692
in the Sergeant Pepper outfits

595
00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:30,472
when he was playing those songs.

596
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:31,812
And everybody's gotta like,

597
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,812
everybody's gotta keep that hair dyed jet black.

598
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:35,292
Yeah.

599
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,292
You have to have the hair, first of all,

600
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:38,392
by any means necessary,

601
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:40,892
whatever crazy operation you need to have.

602
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:41,672
Yes, yes.

603
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:45,112
But I don't even wanna denigrate tribute bands

604
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:48,692
with like, I don't wanna paint them with that product

605
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:50,192
because at least like,

606
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:52,032
oh, in fear you love this.

607
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,052
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

608
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:53,732
That's a different thing.

609
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:54,352
You're passionate about this.

610
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:58,112
But like turning your own band into a tribute band

611
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,872
I think is sort of strange.

612
00:23:00,892 --> 00:23:01,572
It's a little weird, yeah.

613
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,072
And it's where there's been this schism.

614
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,712
What I was saying, like when Mike Love goes

615
00:23:05,712 --> 00:23:11,592
and performs at like the Rhino Horn collection event,

616
00:23:13,212 --> 00:23:14,832
Brian and Al have to say,

617
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,672
we, just so you know, we have nothing to do with this.

618
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:19,572
I know you know that we were in the Beach Boys,

619
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,512
but we have not been for a long time.

620
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:22,852
We don't approve of any of that.

621
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:24,432
Mike, you just asked recently,

622
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:25,492
hey, they're playing the bowl.

623
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:26,672
Are you going? Oh, yeah, yeah.

624
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:29,012
I'm not, I never go.

625
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:31,172
I do not see, I've never seen.

626
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:31,732
Really? Really?

627
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:32,652
As much as I talk about that,

628
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:35,192
I've never seen the Mike Love Beach Boys

629
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:37,872
because I am a purist and I'm after this other thing.

630
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:41,652
And I don't want this like Kabuki of the beach lifestyle

631
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:42,752
and what they're selling.

632
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:44,412
And I know exactly what it's going to be.

633
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:47,132
You could predict that concert beat for beat.

634
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,872
Brian Wilson has put on these wonderful shows

635
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:51,932
for many, many years where he does all the pet sounds.

636
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:53,312
He does all the smile.

637
00:23:53,352 --> 00:23:54,252
He does deeper cuts.

638
00:23:54,472 --> 00:23:58,832
The band performs, the musicians he curates are unbelievable.

639
00:23:58,832 --> 00:24:01,092
And they do it like a recital.

640
00:24:01,252 --> 00:24:04,472
They do it like, you know, a classical combo,

641
00:24:04,572 --> 00:24:07,312
which is like respectfully, perfectly do every little bit.

642
00:24:08,252 --> 00:24:09,552
Studiously, precisely right.

643
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:12,132
As opposed to what the Beach Boys have been for a long time,

644
00:24:12,172 --> 00:24:16,052
which is like, okay, I think we're losing everybody's energy.

645
00:24:16,252 --> 00:24:17,952
I think like nobody cares about this.

646
00:24:17,952 --> 00:24:20,612
Just add like, get a couple more guitar players in there.

647
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:24,512
Okay, if we have nine guitar players and three drummers,

648
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:26,732
like everybody, yes, everyone's listless,

649
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:28,852
but like if you get a bunch of monkeys

650
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,352
and put them in front typewriters,

651
00:24:30,832 --> 00:24:33,492
like if you get enough guys in Hawaiian shirts

652
00:24:33,492 --> 00:24:34,872
with guitars on stage,

653
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,692
all of them collectively will care enough

654
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:39,792
to make this a not unwatchable concert.

655
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,352
Three nights at the Hollywood Bowl,

656
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:44,892
how many people are on stage do you think they have now?

657
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:46,232
Like 15 members in the band?

658
00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:46,732
How many?

659
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:48,812
Well, they're there with an orchestra too.

660
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:50,152
Oh, I didn't know that.

661
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:52,252
Yeah, I don't know.

662
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:54,672
I mean, all I know is, this is me.

663
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:56,272
This is me who likes the Beach Boys enough

664
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:58,492
to talk about this and to do this episode.

665
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:01,852
I've not been able to name a Beach Boy.

666
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,292
I've not been able to name anyone on that stage

667
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:07,752
for like a decade, besides John Stamos, of course,

668
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:10,392
who does he, I don't know if he falls in the villains list.

669
00:25:10,412 --> 00:25:11,752
I don't know, he's somewhere in between,

670
00:25:11,952 --> 00:25:15,892
or he's chaotic good or neutral evil.

671
00:25:15,892 --> 00:25:17,572
He's certainly chaotic, I think.

672
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:19,332
I'm not sure.

673
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:23,812
I've seen him, Mr. Like, you know, I like Brian.

674
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:26,832
I like Mike too, you know, it's just like whatever, man.

675
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:27,752
He plays all the sides.

676
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,972
So he's just, I mean, I understand on some level

677
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:33,852
being like, I gotta stick with,

678
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:35,272
I got to play with the Beach Boys.

679
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:38,252
It's still fun for me, even at age 60.

680
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:42,232
Well, and he came in via the Mike, you know.

681
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:45,312
The way Stamos came into the band is that like,

682
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:49,132
it used to be that Mike is like the, you know, the hot,

683
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:51,672
so he's the young, like, you know,

684
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:53,852
he's their Mick Jagger, right?

685
00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:56,372
He's up on stage and doing the moves

686
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:58,272
and the girls are screaming for him,

687
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:00,212
which were like, my wife would say,

688
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:01,772
he's not like an attractive,

689
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:03,312
shush, shush, shush, close enough.

690
00:26:03,532 --> 00:26:04,412
That's what they got.

691
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:07,032
And then he ages, he becomes this like,

692
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,352
he ages so rapidly and is not the guy.

693
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:13,432
Can't be that, he's not getting screamed at,

694
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,692
at least not for, you know, attracted to reasons

695
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:17,992
for a long time.

696
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:22,632
John Stamos just shows up backstage at a show

697
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:25,652
and there are screams and he's like, what was that?

698
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,852
Oh, that's this guy from General Hospital.

699
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:28,652
He's just visiting.

700
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:31,032
He's a big, oh, you don't say.

701
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,492
What if I were to adopt him as my son?

702
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:37,332
Truly just that.

703
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:38,952
He was screamed at once,

704
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,732
which credit to Mike Love for putting money

705
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:42,552
on the right horse.

706
00:26:42,772 --> 00:26:44,252
Like his star only grew.

707
00:26:44,592 --> 00:26:48,152
He only kept having shows to put the Beach Boys on.

708
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:50,192
Before Full House, there was this other one called

709
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,872
You Again with Jack Klugman that wasted a bunch of time

710
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:55,392
with the whole Beach Boys plot.

711
00:26:56,232 --> 00:26:59,012
And Stamos certainly still around for, you know,

712
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:01,672
he doesn't feel like an over the hill celebrity.

713
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:04,012
So, you know, he did choose wisely,

714
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:06,012
but that's what it's all based on is Mike,

715
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,552
like how do I keep those girls screaming?

716
00:27:09,572 --> 00:27:12,452
Do you ever look and see what the set list was?

717
00:27:12,692 --> 00:27:14,072
Do you like, is that intriguing to you at all?

718
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:15,872
Well, I saw a couple of videos.

719
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:19,252
I know that they did, you know, Surfing USA

720
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:20,572
and Surfing Safari.

721
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:21,572
Do you have the full set list?

722
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:22,492
I have them right here, yeah.

723
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:25,212
Well, Mark McGrath was with them on July 4th,

724
00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:25,592
of course.

725
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:26,572
Well, that's what you told me.

726
00:27:27,332 --> 00:27:29,952
There was an ad on TV that specifically said,

727
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,792
Mark McGrath only there the fourth,

728
00:27:31,912 --> 00:27:33,312
but Stamos there all three nights.

729
00:27:33,392 --> 00:27:34,412
Wow, wow.

730
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:36,752
Well, this is the way the Beach Boys are

731
00:27:36,752 --> 00:27:37,732
with the fractions.

732
00:27:39,212 --> 00:27:41,052
Like Brian Wilson, not the other Beach Boys,

733
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:41,752
he's on his own.

734
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:46,572
Okay, come see Al Jardine's Beach Boys Family and Friends.

735
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:49,772
That does not have Brian and it does not have Mike.

736
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:50,972
Okay, come see the Beach Boys.

737
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:53,012
This doesn't have Brian or Al.

738
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:54,672
Maybe there'll be Stamos.

739
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:58,212
There's so many asterisks any time you see them.

740
00:27:58,852 --> 00:28:03,372
So Mark does Do It Again, Surfing Safari, Surfing USA,

741
00:28:04,112 --> 00:28:05,632
and he does California Girls.

742
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:07,052
That's the only four he does.

743
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:09,592
That's still, that's a big chunk of the big ones

744
00:28:09,592 --> 00:28:10,472
to give to...

745
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:12,472
Didn't he just like, in the last 10 years,

746
00:28:12,812 --> 00:28:16,452
Mike was like, yeah, let's get Sugar Ray's Leith Singard.

747
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:17,472
I think so.

748
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:20,172
They must have been at some, they were at like a,

749
00:28:20,172 --> 00:28:24,152
you know, a festival in Belmont Park or something,

750
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:25,912
and there was like a stage next door

751
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,472
where he heard screaming, oh, those screams.

752
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:31,172
We never get them unless Stamos is here.

753
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:34,032
Who's that young man up there?

754
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:35,432
And he's looking for them.

755
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:36,052
Yeah, yeah.

756
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:39,392
I think Mark McGrath has had more work than Mike Love.

757
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:40,132
Possibly.

758
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:42,832
That's what's insane is that he's like finding like-minded.

759
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:46,312
He like, he keeps finding like it's the new me.

760
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:47,192
And he's correct.

761
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,192
Mark McGrath is the new him completely.

762
00:28:49,692 --> 00:28:52,132
Here's the fact, I don't know if you know this, Mike.

763
00:28:52,212 --> 00:28:56,532
If you see the Beach Boys today, not at the Hollywood Bowl,

764
00:28:56,792 --> 00:29:01,112
but I saw footage from a cruise earlier this year,

765
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:02,912
and Mark McGrath has the microphone.

766
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,332
He says, hey, I'm gonna do a song real quick,

767
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:07,372
a song I wrote back in 1997.

768
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:08,532
It's called Fly.

769
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:11,652
And then the Beach Boys just play Fly.

770
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:13,672
They play Sugar Ray's Fly.

771
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,632
And you're like, and Mike Love just goes

772
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:17,992
to the back of the stage.

773
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:19,432
He just kind of stands there.

774
00:29:19,452 --> 00:29:20,432
He just listens.

775
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:22,552
He does not participate.

776
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,732
Super cat part?

777
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:26,752
He doesn't do the ref, fly off, aye, aye, aye, aye.

778
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,352
No, no.

779
00:29:28,372 --> 00:29:29,712
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow,

780
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:31,912
like he'd do in some of his like backup vocals or anything.

781
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:34,012
He might just, Mike Love just might be like peeing

782
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:35,632
into a catheter at that point.

783
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:38,332
He's peeing consistently through a whole Beach Boys show,

784
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:39,172
let's be honest.

785
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:40,392
That catheter's in.

786
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:42,572
That must be, they've been since 91.

787
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,972
That's been the situation.

788
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:44,972
Yeah.

789
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:46,952
Well, I learned- Part of my writer is-

790
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,312
I can't- A pee nurse.

791
00:29:48,312 --> 00:29:51,572
I can't take time out to stop rocking, man.

792
00:29:51,972 --> 00:29:52,912
That's how he thinks.

793
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:56,372
He's like, if I leave, they'll take it all away from me.

794
00:29:56,752 --> 00:29:59,752
That's really how, and this is how, like Mike Love,

795
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,172
he's operated out of fear all this time.

796
00:30:03,272 --> 00:30:05,052
Every move has been made out of fear.

797
00:30:05,332 --> 00:30:07,972
Because here's the Mike Love story.

798
00:30:08,132 --> 00:30:09,532
I didn't know this part of it.

799
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:11,172
That Mike, this is the circumstances

800
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:12,592
in which he joins the Beach Boys.

801
00:30:13,652 --> 00:30:15,352
He's 19 years old.

802
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:18,352
He was kind of like a track star in high school.

803
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:19,632
He was sort of popular.

804
00:30:19,712 --> 00:30:22,252
Got a lot of girls, got a lot of California girls.

805
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:25,032
Kind of a guy who peaked in high school.

806
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:26,972
And you always gotta watch it.

807
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:30,112
If you know how to do high school really well,

808
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,712
there's always the potential for the bad aftermath.

809
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:36,252
And he hit the bad aftermath so quickly.

810
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:39,212
He didn't get good grades, so he's not going to college.

811
00:30:39,492 --> 00:30:45,332
He's working at his dad's sheet metal facility by day.

812
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:46,792
He's pumping gas at night.

813
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:49,172
He's barely making enough money to support himself.

814
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:52,352
Then he fucks up and gets his girlfriend pregnant.

815
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:57,652
And they hatch a plan to go to Tijuana and take care of it.

816
00:30:57,652 --> 00:31:00,932
And then the parents find out about it.

817
00:31:00,932 --> 00:31:02,292
And they say, absolutely not.

818
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:04,472
You're getting married, you're doing the right thing.

819
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,852
And then his parents go apeshit

820
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:08,032
and they kick him out of the house.

821
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:09,852
They throw all his stuff out on the lawn.

822
00:31:10,092 --> 00:31:10,892
You are gone.

823
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:15,312
So he has to move to a crappy apartment in Baldwin Park

824
00:31:15,312 --> 00:31:18,052
where Baldwin Hills is one of the Baldwin's.

825
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:21,612
And where he is just like, he's fucked.

826
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:22,852
His life is, he's 19.

827
00:31:22,852 --> 00:31:26,032
He has a kid he didn't intend on having.

828
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:28,792
Barely making money for himself, let alone his wife.

829
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,612
Then his parents lose the sheet metal,

830
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:33,932
love sheet metal, goes belly up.

831
00:31:34,032 --> 00:31:35,392
So he doesn't have a job either.

832
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:38,892
This guy, like the gay prom king,

833
00:31:38,972 --> 00:31:42,512
everything's great for old Mike at 18, 19, it's all over.

834
00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:44,572
That head's nowhere good for this guy.

835
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:47,872
But his cousins like to harmonize.

836
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:52,172
They sit around the piano and they sound real nice.

837
00:31:52,932 --> 00:31:56,272
And he's like, hey, maybe we could make something out of it.

838
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:58,332
Hey, you know what's big right now is surfing.

839
00:31:58,512 --> 00:31:59,932
Maybe we could do something about that.

840
00:31:59,972 --> 00:32:02,052
So maybe the whole thing does not happen

841
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:03,732
without his hustle.

842
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:09,252
Which, as I say it, this guy who's just kind of like,

843
00:32:09,252 --> 00:32:12,512
fueling things with his sheer will, who will not let go,

844
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:14,372
who's propping up a little corporation

845
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:16,932
and will never take no for an answer,

846
00:32:17,112 --> 00:32:18,532
just blindly heading for it.

847
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:19,972
Is this not a guy?

848
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:22,252
Is Mike Love not a musical guy?

849
00:32:22,312 --> 00:32:23,052
Yeah, absolutely.

850
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,772
I believe so, I think so.

851
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,292
I don't say that lightly.

852
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:28,852
I don't wanna just invite everybody into the guy fold.

853
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:32,432
But I submit on this day that Mike Love is a guy.

854
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:33,492
Yeah, for sure.

855
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:38,832
I think eccentric, often eccentric with too much money

856
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,232
and a lot of power.

857
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:44,592
I think Mike Love pretty easily falls into our definition.

858
00:32:44,612 --> 00:32:46,372
Eccentric, though, seems fun to me.

859
00:32:46,572 --> 00:32:48,192
Mike Love does not seem fun.

860
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:50,152
I know it's not the definition of fun.

861
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:55,332
I think I say it as just a substitute for weirdo.

862
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:56,072
No, you're right.

863
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:57,132
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

864
00:32:57,132 --> 00:32:58,392
You're using the definition correctly.

865
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:00,512
I just said my brain eccentric always means.

866
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:02,872
There's a tilt of that that's like Richard Branson.

867
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:04,532
We're like, oh wow, he's flying around,

868
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:06,092
he's on a boat, he's going to space.

869
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:09,212
But yeah, no, Mike Love's more like Leno,

870
00:33:09,212 --> 00:33:10,732
where he's like all business.

871
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:15,112
He's so much like Leno, where we're doing 160 concerts

872
00:33:15,112 --> 00:33:17,832
a year, we're doing the same thing at all of them.

873
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:22,232
We do not, we don't mess it up, we don't take risks.

874
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:24,792
I was gonna say, is it all same set lists, probably?

875
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:26,532
I think so, I think so.

876
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:29,052
Did you know there's a competition

877
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:31,912
for Jay Leno's Garage Now on Macs

878
00:33:31,912 --> 00:33:34,872
about Robert Downey Jr. turning a bunch of his cars

879
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:36,692
into electric cars? Oh, that's right, yeah.

880
00:33:36,692 --> 00:33:37,512
What's that called?

881
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,212
Is it called just like Robert likes cars?

882
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,092
Downey's Motors or something like Downey's?

883
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:43,252
Downey's Dream Cars.

884
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:44,592
Yeah, Downey's Dream Cars.

885
00:33:44,812 --> 00:33:46,252
Yeah, I texted you about that.

886
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,732
I had only just seen the commercial race.

887
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:52,432
I feel like I read about it and now I saw the commercial.

888
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:54,252
Then what's Macs worried about?

889
00:33:54,672 --> 00:33:55,592
Yeah, Macs is saved.

890
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:58,352
Everything's looking up, everything's looking golden

891
00:33:58,352 --> 00:33:59,352
for Macs.

892
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,272
But yeah, that's the thing, because he like,

893
00:34:02,412 --> 00:34:03,652
think about where you're coming from.

894
00:34:03,732 --> 00:34:04,752
I think when you, when you're,

895
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:07,012
who was almost all over for you at 19?

896
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:09,592
And then in like, what if that was it?

897
00:34:09,592 --> 00:34:10,672
What if high school was the peak?

898
00:34:10,712 --> 00:34:13,472
Then he gets to do super high school.

899
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:15,632
He does quantum high school.

900
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:16,532
It's unbelievable.

901
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:19,372
He's like the, he's like, you know,

902
00:34:19,412 --> 00:34:22,112
he's the prom king of rock and roll.

903
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:24,512
And he's touring the, he's like, you know,

904
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:25,392
he's on top of the world.

905
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:27,652
They're having so many hits, like even some of it,

906
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,332
pre-Beatles, they might be the biggest band in the world

907
00:34:30,332 --> 00:34:32,652
out of nowhere within two years.

908
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:34,212
He's touring the country.

909
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:36,832
He's getting married so many times.

910
00:34:36,832 --> 00:34:39,332
Boy, the amount of times this guy got married

911
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:41,652
and had kid pop kids out.

912
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:45,392
So he's like, I got the ultimate second chance in the world.

913
00:34:45,412 --> 00:34:46,832
I can never let go of this.

914
00:34:47,192 --> 00:34:49,352
So when Brian Wilson starts messing around

915
00:34:49,352 --> 00:34:52,712
with his like, thinky songs and his feely songs

916
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:55,892
and his sensitive songs, he's like, Brian, be careful.

917
00:34:55,992 --> 00:34:57,892
I'm not going back to the sheet metal place.

918
00:34:57,992 --> 00:34:59,352
There is no sheet metal place.

919
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:01,072
Don't fuck with the formula.

920
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:05,552
And he basically like, he, I mean, one of many things

921
00:35:05,552 --> 00:35:09,752
that drove Brian insane, slow, like that caused this true

922
00:35:09,752 --> 00:35:11,172
big meltdown for him.

923
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:15,772
But absolutely what he did was stop the creative evolution

924
00:35:15,772 --> 00:35:18,772
of Brian and of the band because he was upset

925
00:35:18,772 --> 00:35:21,652
because we are no longer singing about surf and sand.

926
00:35:21,832 --> 00:35:23,612
And that's what it's about when you're me.

927
00:35:23,812 --> 00:35:25,032
It's surf and sand.

928
00:35:25,212 --> 00:35:27,432
And if I'm not singing about surf and sand,

929
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:30,192
170 dates a year, then there isn't,

930
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:32,892
then somebody is gonna make me go back

931
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:34,072
to the sheet metal factory.

932
00:35:34,812 --> 00:35:38,832
Yeah, he wanted to embalm the Beach Boys back then.

933
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:39,912
Yeah, absolutely.

934
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:42,132
He just was like, we need to preserve the exact thing

935
00:35:42,132 --> 00:35:44,552
this is and just do it until I die.

936
00:35:44,972 --> 00:35:46,952
Yeah, he knew, he had the plan.

937
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:50,672
And everybody having these ideas just got in the way.

938
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:51,892
And like, what do you mean?

939
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:54,652
If we're doing all these songs that involve a theremin

940
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,792
and a French horn, we can't do that when we go out live

941
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,832
and do our songs about surf and sand.

942
00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:01,392
That's gonna be too complicated.

943
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:03,592
It's gonna chase all the babes away.

944
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:05,772
The babes are gonna go run into some of the, you know,

945
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:08,372
to the Woodstock bands.

946
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:11,492
So he's been operating on it, which is why for so many years

947
00:36:11,492 --> 00:36:13,492
it's been all these songs that are about like,

948
00:36:13,812 --> 00:36:15,872
we gotta get back to what it was.

949
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:17,792
Come on, let's remember all those good,

950
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:20,312
remember when we were singing about surf and sand?

951
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,132
Yeah, yeah.

952
00:36:21,132 --> 00:36:22,752
He's done so many iterations of this,

953
00:36:22,752 --> 00:36:25,372
which I'll play a little bit here.

954
00:36:25,372 --> 00:36:26,852
And you clocked a couple years ago,

955
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:28,712
you clocked that Rivers Cuomo had written

956
00:36:28,712 --> 00:36:32,492
Back to the Shack, a song about stop trying to write

957
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:34,272
so many modern pop songs.

958
00:36:34,412 --> 00:36:35,352
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

959
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:38,432
And the fact that it's a song about us, the characters,

960
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:40,292
in the band, it's something.

961
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:42,852
He said, I'll play the lead guitar

962
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,052
and Pat will play the drums,

963
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:46,112
because he had Josh Freeze playing drums.

964
00:36:46,712 --> 00:36:51,912
So very Beach Boys and them dealing with their own mythology.

965
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:55,452
He did a song called Brian's Back

966
00:36:56,912 --> 00:37:00,052
that was about how, what are the lyrics of that?

967
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:02,032
That I know there's some like,

968
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:05,912
oh, good vibrations caused such a sensation,

969
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:08,432
not to mention old pet sounds.

970
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:10,812
Old pet sounds.

971
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:13,852
And we traveled the world, is the,

972
00:37:14,012 --> 00:37:16,332
actually here, what I'll do, there is a video where he's on,

973
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:19,052
the song's about how Brian had his troubles,

974
00:37:19,312 --> 00:37:21,552
but he got himself together and now he's back with us

975
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:24,112
and he's singing harmony with us like always.

976
00:37:24,112 --> 00:37:27,252
This was before Eugene Landy.

977
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,512
This was before he had like the,

978
00:37:29,712 --> 00:37:31,892
some of the biggest psychological troubles

979
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:35,332
of any popular artist or person, maybe,

980
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:37,812
and he's ready to clear, no, we're getting back to it,

981
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:41,212
to the harmony, because Brian's back, baby.

982
00:37:41,312 --> 00:37:43,132
And he's not even close to being back.

983
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:47,092
So years later, when he's mired in this,

984
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:49,312
like the family can't even talk to him anymore,

985
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:50,752
he's got all these like guards,

986
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:52,972
if anybody tries to get a hold of him.

987
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:55,892
Like he's so under the control of this insane psychiatrist

988
00:37:55,892 --> 00:37:59,652
that a current affair comes to talk to Mike Love.

989
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:03,932
And he says, like, I think I could sum up my feelings

990
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:05,752
in my song Brian's back.

991
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:08,432
And then he says these lyrics through tears.

992
00:38:08,512 --> 00:38:09,512
He is broken.

993
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:09,972
Oh my God.

994
00:38:10,172 --> 00:38:13,852
As he says, good vibrations caused such a sensation,

995
00:38:14,232 --> 00:38:16,052
not to mention old pet sounds.

996
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:18,432
As we, and we traveled the world,

997
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:22,632
is the banner's unfurled, and he's weeping.

998
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:24,012
Is he jet crying or like kind of forcing it?

999
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:25,632
Well, I don't know, because then it goes like this,

1000
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:27,652
is the banner's unfurled?

1001
00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:30,232
I guess you'd have to say we got around.

1002
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:31,232
Oh, that sounds fake.

1003
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:33,052
Yeah, then he got it back together.

1004
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,592
Like, and then you're watching this,

1005
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:36,972
like we're talking about one crazy beach boy

1006
00:38:36,972 --> 00:38:39,592
with maybe the crazier beach boy.

1007
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:40,172
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1008
00:38:40,172 --> 00:38:42,352
Everyone's so insane in this group.

1009
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:44,152
What year was that?

1010
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,992
Like 93, 94.

1011
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:50,092
Okay, so we've had a couple decades

1012
00:38:50,472 --> 00:38:54,712
of like rock music going through a lot of change.

1013
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:59,592
Like, I was thinking like late 60s, early 70s,

1014
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:02,112
bands start to get weird.

1015
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:06,632
Like Pink Floyd, I'm thinking Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.

1016
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:09,912
Yes, bands like make a vast fortune

1017
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:11,672
by being as weird as possible.

1018
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:12,232
Yeah.

1019
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:14,832
By playing into their own insane musical instincts.

1020
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,692
And then you even get like smaller bands,

1021
00:39:19,632 --> 00:39:22,712
like television or Big Star or something,

1022
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:24,512
also doing rock.

1023
00:39:24,592 --> 00:39:26,872
I'm saying there's a lot of flavors of rock music.

1024
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,052
Are you arguing it's Mike Love and What Do You Want?

1025
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:29,732
So this formula?

1026
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:32,392
I'm just a little, it's just such an odd,

1027
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:35,252
like we gotta get back to 30 years ago.

1028
00:39:35,452 --> 00:39:37,692
And it's like events have occurred.

1029
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:41,092
Yeah, well he hasn't noticed that also

1030
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:44,372
because never in this time do they ever stop touring.

1031
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:47,832
That just like, so you're in a,

1032
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:51,112
if you're singing the same songs 170 dates a year

1033
00:39:51,112 --> 00:39:53,892
without stopping, you don't notice that television

1034
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,272
and Big Star have happened.

1035
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:56,652
You have no idea.

1036
00:39:57,012 --> 00:39:59,732
Or that like, I think he's always thought

1037
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:02,352
like as soon as we get our fucking shit together

1038
00:40:02,352 --> 00:40:04,852
and start singing about surfing sand again,

1039
00:40:05,192 --> 00:40:06,692
we're gonna be back on top.

1040
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,872
But he still has to deal with like the other guys

1041
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:11,272
because the other guys wanna do their thinky music,

1042
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:13,032
which is the stuff I love the most,

1043
00:40:13,032 --> 00:40:14,652
the late 60s, early 70s stuff.

1044
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,092
And he's like, but it's not about surfing sand.

1045
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,752
So it's all about him like trying to like

1046
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,012
get his power back basically.

1047
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:23,792
Yeah, how does, you know how he felt

1048
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:25,612
about Pacific Ocean Blue?

1049
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:26,592
I have no idea.

1050
00:40:27,072 --> 00:40:28,292
I don't know if he's ever heard it.

1051
00:40:28,312 --> 00:40:28,852
I don't know if he's ever.

1052
00:40:28,852 --> 00:40:29,232
He's on it.

1053
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:30,112
Is he really?

1054
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:32,992
Yeah, he does back up on one, at least one of the songs.

1055
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:34,092
That's kinda crazy.

1056
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:36,412
And maybe it was Pacific Ocean Blue.

1057
00:40:36,412 --> 00:40:38,932
Pacific Ocean Blue, Dennis Wilson's solo album.

1058
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:40,372
Yes, that's, excuse me, yes, Dennis Wilson.

1059
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:41,032
Amazing.

1060
00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:42,372
That's one of my, and I.

1061
00:40:42,372 --> 00:40:43,532
Oh, you like Pacific Ocean Blue.

1062
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:44,592
I love Pacific Ocean Blue.

1063
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:46,372
It's really moody and weird.

1064
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,712
And then there's one of the more fun songs

1065
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,612
is what I believe Mike Love is on background.

1066
00:40:50,872 --> 00:40:51,912
It's doing like bow bow.

1067
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:52,812
He's like doing a classic.

1068
00:40:52,812 --> 00:40:54,332
Is that the title song, Pacific Ocean Blue?

1069
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:55,272
I think it is.

1070
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:55,872
Is that him?

1071
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:56,632
I believe.

1072
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:57,952
So I'll double check

1073
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:59,092
because I don't wanna get this wrong.

1074
00:40:59,312 --> 00:40:59,412
I don't know.

1075
00:40:59,872 --> 00:41:02,672
I guess my thing that I'm hung up on

1076
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:05,792
is like just trying to pin down its weirdness

1077
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:09,212
because like by 1990, if he has never stopped touring,

1078
00:41:09,212 --> 00:41:13,992
he has spent most of those years in arenas and airports

1079
00:41:13,992 --> 00:41:16,212
and like Hilton's.

1080
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:17,252
Like, you know.

1081
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:17,412
Yeah, yeah.

1082
00:41:17,412 --> 00:41:18,232
That's how he likes it.

1083
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:22,992
So when was the last time he even stepped foot on a beach?

1084
00:41:23,752 --> 00:41:24,312
Oh, never.

1085
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:26,492
Well, that's also, that's the whole thing about it too.

1086
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:29,332
The Beach Boys don't, none of them surfed

1087
00:41:29,332 --> 00:41:30,512
except for Dennis.

1088
00:41:30,752 --> 00:41:31,932
Except for Dennis, yeah.

1089
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:36,812
So they don't like, he has beachside property in Hawaii.

1090
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:37,652
Oh, sure, yeah.

1091
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,152
Besides some odd fun.

1092
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:41,252
Here, Mike Love has a house in Lake Tahoe,

1093
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,592
which we drove by when we were up there a couple years ago.

1094
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:45,672
It was pointed out by a family friend.

1095
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:46,752
That's where Mike Love lives.

1096
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:47,192
Oh, really?

1097
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:48,432
Yeah, Lake Tahoe.

1098
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:49,012
Wow.

1099
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:50,712
I booed it.

1100
00:41:52,672 --> 00:41:55,012
Mike Love is also a songwriter credit

1101
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,612
on Pacific Ocean Blues.

1102
00:41:57,212 --> 00:41:58,372
The song Pacific Ocean Blues

1103
00:41:58,372 --> 00:41:59,932
and the album Pacific Ocean Blue.

1104
00:42:00,232 --> 00:42:00,912
No way.

1105
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:02,632
Well, that makes me feel a little,

1106
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:04,312
you know, you also can't,

1107
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:07,052
it's not like he had no contributions to the thing

1108
00:42:07,232 --> 00:42:08,992
that he wrote lyrics that I like.

1109
00:42:09,272 --> 00:42:10,872
He sings parts that I like.

1110
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:13,232
He's like, if he, he's not such a,

1111
00:42:13,412 --> 00:42:15,872
he's not like some absolutely talentless

1112
00:42:15,872 --> 00:42:17,892
or tasteless, you know,

1113
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:22,772
but he's just always like fed into his own worst instincts.

1114
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:26,012
And everything, what you're saying also about like,

1115
00:42:26,012 --> 00:42:27,792
you know, the television of Big Star,

1116
00:42:27,832 --> 00:42:29,852
he would go like, where are the hits?

1117
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,712
When was the last time Big Star went number one?

1118
00:42:33,572 --> 00:42:36,012
Because he's like, I know, he's all about being number one

1119
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,892
and that's the only measure of success to him.

1120
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:41,172
Yeah, I will say that those,

1121
00:42:41,532 --> 00:42:44,612
it was probably harder to track those records down

1122
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:48,032
when you were mostly playing like

1123
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:51,512
the world's biggest Sam Goody or something for like,

1124
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:54,812
for you play Kokomo and then you're ushered out the back

1125
00:42:54,812 --> 00:42:56,272
and you leave, you know.

1126
00:42:56,352 --> 00:42:56,652
Yes.

1127
00:42:57,632 --> 00:42:59,392
That's by the way, can I just say this?

1128
00:42:59,392 --> 00:43:00,312
This happens all the time

1129
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:01,992
and I see this a lot in professional wrestling

1130
00:43:01,992 --> 00:43:05,312
where somebody says, oh my God, that match was amazing.

1131
00:43:05,312 --> 00:43:06,392
And then like somebody chimes in,

1132
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:08,972
how much, how many t-shirts did they sell?

1133
00:43:09,072 --> 00:43:09,932
Kevin Asch just did this.

1134
00:43:09,972 --> 00:43:11,012
I like Kevin Asch in general,

1135
00:43:11,052 --> 00:43:12,772
but he goes, how many t-shirts did this guy sell?

1136
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:14,432
And I'm like, fuck off.

1137
00:43:14,852 --> 00:43:16,592
Art is not, it's art, man.

1138
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:18,492
It's not always about selling.

1139
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,092
It doesn't necessarily mean,

1140
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:22,352
the best movie does not always make the most money.

1141
00:43:22,652 --> 00:43:25,232
Well, this is where I get driven by every like state

1142
00:43:25,232 --> 00:43:28,732
of the industry thing always makes a point of saying like,

1143
00:43:28,852 --> 00:43:31,052
you know, we feel like in our bubble,

1144
00:43:31,132 --> 00:43:33,692
we think that succession and Barry are the biggest,

1145
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:37,232
nobody watches succession and Barry.

1146
00:43:37,572 --> 00:43:38,932
And it's like, all right,

1147
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:41,672
thanks for making everybody feel like a thousand times worse.

1148
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:43,172
Like I know things are bad,

1149
00:43:43,192 --> 00:43:46,252
but also remember the numbers on succession aren't good.

1150
00:43:46,552 --> 00:43:49,072
Great, okay, well, how am I supposed to proceed

1151
00:43:49,072 --> 00:43:51,272
trying to make things or make shows?

1152
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:53,332
That happened all the time with 30 Rock too.

1153
00:43:53,412 --> 00:43:55,312
Like 30 Rock, wow, 30 Rock's actually like crazy,

1154
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:58,112
dense, funny show while nobody watches it.

1155
00:43:58,452 --> 00:43:59,472
Stop it, shut up.

1156
00:43:59,772 --> 00:44:00,332
Yeah, yeah, I don't care.

1157
00:44:00,352 --> 00:44:02,752
This cannot be the only way we judge things.

1158
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:05,732
Shinyello's done and that guy has done himself

1159
00:44:05,732 --> 00:44:09,152
a million favors by making himself persona non grata

1160
00:44:09,152 --> 00:44:12,812
in Hollywood by being extremely flippant

1161
00:44:12,812 --> 00:44:14,792
about writing in cabins.

1162
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:17,952
Well, he can write, look, I'm gonna get to watching it.

1163
00:44:18,132 --> 00:44:19,092
I haven't gotten to it yet.

1164
00:44:19,092 --> 00:44:19,952
That hasn't changed.

1165
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:20,252
Sure.

1166
00:44:20,312 --> 00:44:22,352
But he can write a full episode in about six hours

1167
00:44:22,352 --> 00:44:23,152
with no staff.

1168
00:44:23,152 --> 00:44:25,872
He doesn't even know what a crew member is.

1169
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:26,852
Let alone an actor.

1170
00:44:26,852 --> 00:44:27,512
He doesn't need to, yeah, he doesn't need to.

1171
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:29,732
I think maybe, it kind of gave me the vibe of like,

1172
00:44:29,732 --> 00:44:33,192
oh, maybe Kevin Costner was right to get the hell out

1173
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:34,912
of these projects.

1174
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:36,392
I've heard he sucks.

1175
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:40,812
I don't know, to me, I don't need a writer's room.

1176
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:43,712
Maybe if you're a feeble-minded regular writer.

1177
00:44:44,172 --> 00:44:46,372
But when you're telling the story of America

1178
00:44:46,372 --> 00:44:49,352
and you're tapped into the pulse of it,

1179
00:44:50,332 --> 00:44:53,392
you don't need people getting flies buzzing in your ear.

1180
00:44:53,432 --> 00:44:54,532
That's what I call other writers.

1181
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:56,112
You know, an epithetic character,

1182
00:44:56,252 --> 00:44:58,652
the biggest private rancher in Montana.

1183
00:44:58,652 --> 00:45:01,192
Oh, that's gonna be relatable, that's gonna be good.

1184
00:45:01,252 --> 00:45:02,592
Isn't that what he is now?

1185
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:03,992
Yeah, yeah. Probably.

1186
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:07,072
Mike, go back to you with Mike Love in a bubble.

1187
00:45:08,352 --> 00:45:11,872
To prove the point, Mark McGrath joins the Beach Boys

1188
00:45:11,872 --> 00:45:15,452
in the last decade, which means Mike Love saw him do

1189
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:17,792
every morning somewhere at a festival,

1190
00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:20,392
was like, now that's a sound I can get by.

1191
00:45:20,392 --> 00:45:22,852
Wow, I guess the kids do still have it.

1192
00:45:23,112 --> 00:45:24,252
No, he's sitting back there,

1193
00:45:24,312 --> 00:45:26,772
thinking, wow, these people must be losing their minds

1194
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:29,452
that the new hit, Fly, is being played

1195
00:45:29,452 --> 00:45:31,752
right before their eyes. 30-year-old song

1196
00:45:31,752 --> 00:45:33,692
at this point. Yeah, all these songs coming up

1197
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:36,612
on 30 years and Mike's like, oh, this is cool.

1198
00:45:37,932 --> 00:45:41,092
Although he also very well, he's probably also

1199
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:44,452
maybe standing in the back going like, this trash well,

1200
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:46,732
if it gets butts in the seats.

1201
00:45:47,592 --> 00:45:52,192
But here's what, okay, so, you know, in the 70s,

1202
00:45:52,352 --> 00:45:53,272
things are all over the map.

1203
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,912
I think the band's kind of a democracy,

1204
00:45:54,912 --> 00:45:57,232
and actually everybody kind of gets a chance to shine.

1205
00:45:57,312 --> 00:45:59,572
In the era that I love, Brian will do great songs,

1206
00:45:59,732 --> 00:46:02,692
Carl does incredible songs, Dennis, who knew Dennis

1207
00:46:02,692 --> 00:46:04,452
was just being like a pretty good drummer,

1208
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,192
but they stopped even using him on the records.

1209
00:46:06,452 --> 00:46:09,532
Then he makes the best solo album of any of them by far.

1210
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:11,472
So like, everybody's kind of getting a chance

1211
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:14,292
to shine in this era, but Mike is like,

1212
00:46:14,412 --> 00:46:17,672
how do I need to get the iron grip back?

1213
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:20,272
And he kind of does, he basically just wears them all down,

1214
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:24,112
and by the 80s, they are just, it is just like,

1215
00:46:24,112 --> 00:46:26,092
constant touring and the audiences have grown,

1216
00:46:26,272 --> 00:46:27,992
and you can bring the new generation.

1217
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:29,352
When I met him, that's what he said,

1218
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:31,472
transcends generations.

1219
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:35,712
It was a perfect, this is a wonderful Mike Love conversation.

1220
00:46:36,312 --> 00:46:37,772
I'm so happy to have it.

1221
00:46:38,692 --> 00:46:40,812
Basically, they're tremendously successful

1222
00:46:40,812 --> 00:46:45,652
through the 80s touring, but no hits.

1223
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:50,072
Hits are done, they haven't been relevant in a long time.

1224
00:46:50,192 --> 00:46:54,132
And this leads to what is a big deal for them,

1225
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:57,272
an indisputably big thing, which is them getting inducted

1226
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,032
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

1227
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:03,612
This is January 1988, and that's a big night, right?

1228
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:07,732
That's a good night, but I think Mike is there going,

1229
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,292
they all think I'm a joke, I'm just a joke to these people,

1230
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:13,692
because it's big names there, people who are

1231
00:47:13,692 --> 00:47:15,812
a little more relevant than the Beach Boys maybe.

1232
00:47:15,852 --> 00:47:18,572
That's the year that the Beatles are inducted,

1233
00:47:18,572 --> 00:47:21,052
and Bob Dylan, and the Supremes.

1234
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:23,812
This is a stacked lineup for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

1235
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:26,272
So whether or not it's true, I think he's,

1236
00:47:26,432 --> 00:47:29,252
I'm just a state fair joke to these people.

1237
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:31,492
I have to set the record straight.

1238
00:47:31,752 --> 00:47:35,172
And it leads to the ultimate Mike Love moment.

1239
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:36,692
I sense that you've seen this, Mike,

1240
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:38,012
have you, Jason, you ever seen

1241
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:39,172
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame speech?

1242
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,672
I don't think I have.

1243
00:47:41,132 --> 00:47:46,972
Okay, so this now, one of the most strangely bitter things

1244
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:50,192
that's ever happened in front of an audience.

1245
00:47:50,892 --> 00:47:54,032
We did about 180 performances last year.

1246
00:47:54,632 --> 00:47:56,752
I like to see the mop tops match that.

1247
00:48:03,024 --> 00:48:11,704
I'd like to see Mick Jagger get out on this stage and do I get around versus jumping Jack Flash any day now

1248
00:48:11,704 --> 00:48:19,144
He looks skeletal and he's already like a four now a lot of people gonna go out of this room tonight thinking that Mike

1249
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:23,884
Love is crazy. Well, they've been saying that for years

1250
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:26,524
Ain't nothing new about that

1251
00:48:26,524 --> 00:48:32,104
Make clear though. I don't think unless I'm misremembering nobody shit on them during the ceremony

1252
00:48:33,104 --> 00:48:33,664
No

1253
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:38,724
Before this was like by the way, the Beach Boys are way worse than all these other acts. No one said this

1254
00:48:38,724 --> 00:48:44,944
I don't believe so. I think this yes, this is a night to honor them one of the ultimate. Yeah honors

1255
00:48:44,944 --> 00:48:53,644
I don't know why he's taking the time and also some of these little these matchups that he's doing are not good

1256
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:57,404
matchups like this this second moment of it like

1257
00:48:57,464 --> 00:49:04,644
Mike tread lightly maybe people kick out the jams not challenge the boss to get up on stage and jam

1258
00:49:04,644 --> 00:49:13,424
This is Paul Schaefer trying to play him off. Yes. Yeah, I

1259
00:49:13,424 --> 00:49:17,884
Want to see Billy Joel see if he can still tickle ivories. Let me see

1260
00:49:17,884 --> 00:49:23,864
Still I know Mick Jagger won't be here tonight. He's gonna have to stay in

1261
00:49:23,924 --> 00:49:30,144
But I'd like to see us in the Coliseum and he and Lemley Stadium because he's always been chicken shit to get on stage

1262
00:49:30,144 --> 00:49:31,344
with the Beach Boys

1263
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:37,784
That is 1988

1264
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:44,524
First of jumping Jack Flash is a great song and Bruce Springsteen had in any number of his

1265
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:48,044
Miles ahead better live performance

1266
00:49:48,244 --> 00:49:54,804
No, and all the mud much better at that moment to see if Billy Joel can still tickle the ivory

1267
00:49:54,804 --> 00:49:56,984
He's having hits right now

1268
00:49:56,984 --> 00:50:04,744
Is a commercial zenith right now huge huge in the late 80s. What is a challenge the boss?

1269
00:50:04,884 --> 00:50:11,344
Yeah, I think he's gonna be fun challenge him to what what are you talking about? I mean if it's a beating

1270
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:16,044
Somebody if somebody's gonna beat the other we know that the boss wins

1271
00:50:16,044 --> 00:50:21,524
But if it's just like I bet he's too scared to jam with me, I don't believe so

1272
00:50:21,524 --> 00:50:27,784
I think it's just a matter of getting people into the same place at the same time incredibly insecure

1273
00:50:27,784 --> 00:50:35,604
Well, it's the fee like I've I don't I got a better lash out at these people or I gotta go back to the sheet metal

1274
00:50:35,604 --> 00:50:38,444
But it's bad love sheet metal for me

1275
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:44,084
It's really sad. It really is. Yeah. Yeah, he blames this on that he

1276
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:47,544
Like well, of course I meditate every day

1277
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:54,984
It's why I stay so peaceful his transcendental meditation and I meditate each day and that was the one day where I did not

1278
00:50:54,984 --> 00:50:56,944
funny interesting

1279
00:50:56,944 --> 00:51:00,224
Coincidence just what yeah, I guess that's what it you know

1280
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:04,584
It was kind of you know, I understood when I saw Roseanne tweet that one night

1281
00:51:04,584 --> 00:51:09,044
It was just the one it was the pills made her do it and in my case

1282
00:51:09,044 --> 00:51:14,064
One lousy day of meditation and suddenly I'm calling Mick Jagger chicken shit

1283
00:51:14,884 --> 00:51:20,204
Not really I've heard David Lynch speak a lot about transcendental meditation

1284
00:51:20,204 --> 00:51:27,444
And I can't say there's like and if you miss a session you might go fucking off

1285
00:51:27,444 --> 00:51:28,664
audience

1286
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:37,004
Do it and but not because it's nice but because you have to or you will act out like a rabid dog

1287
00:51:37,004 --> 00:51:43,344
If you miss one session prepare to bite your family. Yeah, this is a wrestling promo. He's cutting

1288
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:48,264
Yeah, yeah, it's challenges. You're right. Yeah, he's like I am we're the top dog

1289
00:51:48,264 --> 00:51:54,224
It's just it's literally just to make everyone think he's the top of the Beach Boys are the best band

1290
00:51:54,224 --> 00:51:59,984
And of course it worked. You've course it had the intended effect the very clear

1291
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:02,884
No, I see. I understand what he was asking

1292
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:08,524
He was saying he'd like to see Mick Jagger do jumping jack of flesh versus I get around

1293
00:52:08,524 --> 00:52:12,984
Yeah, okay. So Mike wanted to do a duel between song

1294
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:19,124
Well, how did that how does that work in his mind? I know that mean it's a really good question

1295
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:20,464
Are you if you could?

1296
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:24,244
If you could actually get him that day to unpack what he means

1297
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:26,704
It would be so much better than what we even could imagine

1298
00:52:26,704 --> 00:52:31,624
I think we're also thinking about like the flattening of culture by the

1299
00:52:31,624 --> 00:52:39,944
1990s well, I assure you jumping jack flash and I get around will just play back-to-back on classic rock radio

1300
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:44,924
They've landed at essentially the same place. Yeah, I don't think anybody's disparaging

1301
00:52:44,924 --> 00:52:47,064
I get around even made it over a hump

1302
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:51,564
There was a time like in Woodstock era people that people did think the Beach Boys were a joke

1303
00:52:51,564 --> 00:52:57,524
They did seem like out of it to turn and then there would been a Renaissance like people, you know with American graffiti

1304
00:52:57,524 --> 00:52:59,804
And they had this greatest hits album that was huge

1305
00:52:59,804 --> 00:53:05,404
So like you should Mike you made it people like these songs will never stop getting played

1306
00:53:05,644 --> 00:53:10,684
Are you doing this what is the point and also and then he says

1307
00:53:10,684 --> 00:53:17,544
Mick Jagger he's he's not he's gonna have to stay in England Mick Jagger was there

1308
00:53:17,544 --> 00:53:24,164
On stage to get they actually were with Bruce at the end of the show. It kind of happened

1309
00:53:24,164 --> 00:53:30,064
I don't know if Mike really contributed or anything. Yeah, so I don't I don't know what he was talking about there

1310
00:53:30,064 --> 00:53:35,164
Here's what happens this this may be a low point for the business as close as he gets to love sheet metal

1311
00:53:35,584 --> 00:53:39,604
Again, because the feeling in the room is very bad

1312
00:53:39,604 --> 00:53:47,404
Immediately after the speech Elton John gets on stage and says thank fuck he didn't mention me

1313
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:52,504
Then Bob Dylan accepts his award and also like

1314
00:53:52,504 --> 00:53:59,264
Like I'm just saying thank you this person this person and thanks Mike love for not mentioning me and then like does a little like

1315
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:05,984
He like he says like what the night should really be about so Bob Dylan has like publicly

1316
00:54:05,984 --> 00:54:09,164
Scolded you in the immediate aftermath

1317
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:16,184
Carl Wilson who's just what he's on stage for this and like he turns ghostly white. He's like, oh my god

1318
00:54:16,184 --> 00:54:21,524
It's happening the mic. We've all been afraid of is coming out. He walks by

1319
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:25,004
Paul Schaefer and says our career is over

1320
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:30,244
This is bad, this is as bad as it gets and remember this is January

1321
00:54:30,244 --> 00:54:36,664
1988 six months later something miraculous happens something called

1322
00:54:36,664 --> 00:54:42,424
Kokomo Mike's vision that he's always I swear if we just get back to surf and sand

1323
00:54:42,424 --> 00:54:45,604
It's you know, it's all gonna be going great for us again

1324
00:54:45,604 --> 00:54:52,564
That's why he's so mad here is because like nobody's let me do it and I can they all think I'm a and then it happened

1325
00:54:52,564 --> 00:54:57,804
He got everything he wanted Kokomo on the cocktail soundtrack

1326
00:54:57,804 --> 00:55:03,284
Having already produced the song. Don't worry be happy. That's a cocktail

1327
00:55:03,284 --> 00:55:10,844
Bear I didn't realize that was from that move. So people are like either what else you got cocktail soundtrack kind of anything is gonna work

1328
00:55:10,844 --> 00:55:19,184
Maybe thus Kokomo saw a new song that Brian Wilson had nothing to do with he was banned from even being there

1329
00:55:19,184 --> 00:55:25,504
So he so this finally Mike's pure perfect vision for his Beach Boys works

1330
00:55:25,504 --> 00:55:33,264
And it goes all the way to number one something they haven't done since good vibrations and it stays there for an entire

1331
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:38,584
Week and then is immediately replaced by wild wild west for the escape club

1332
00:55:38,584 --> 00:55:44,124
So it's just you know a song that's kind of a hit in 1988 but to Mike love in his bubble

1333
00:55:44,124 --> 00:55:48,944
He's like it's everything I needed. This is pure. What is the what's the political term?

1334
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:55,564
Mandate we have a mandate. I have a mandate now and it's gonna be my way or the highway forever

1335
00:55:55,564 --> 00:56:02,484
Man, so now he has a ticket to do all the bullshit. We're going on all the shows. We're on full house

1336
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:07,164
We're on home improvement. We're on Baywatch Stamos is always here now

1337
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:11,244
He's always in there assuming he's available Stamos is a Beach Boy

1338
00:56:11,244 --> 00:56:18,924
We will start wearing the worst clothing you've ever seen any human being north of 50 where we're gonna have the

1339
00:56:18,944 --> 00:56:25,904
Beach Boy cheerleaders on stage with us and then we're never gonna change the set list because that would mess up the wardrobe changes

1340
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:30,384
Oh, yeah, so now the band all the other guys Carl and Al they are beaten down

1341
00:56:30,384 --> 00:56:36,784
They're like so we can't get like the deeper cuts in the set anymore. Fuck. We're fucked Mike one

1342
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:44,644
Succession ended and Mike love was the was the winner and everything was possible for this guy including

1343
00:56:45,764 --> 00:56:48,184
Themed restaurants do we know about this?

1344
00:56:48,264 --> 00:56:52,124
Yeah, I've seen a little bit about it cuz that's cuz when I was thinking about Mike love

1345
00:56:52,124 --> 00:56:57,344
It's like it makes so much sense that he would have tried a margaritaville. He would have tried a Cabo Wabo

1346
00:56:57,344 --> 00:57:01,244
Yes, of course, and I don't remember when margaritaville started

1347
00:57:01,244 --> 00:57:08,584
It's like oh god. I should know the exact year, but it's it's far later than you'd think. Yeah. Yeah, is it 2000s even?

1348
00:57:08,984 --> 00:57:13,644
Oh god, I don't know if it's late 90s or early 2000s. Well, it's 98

1349
00:57:14,884 --> 00:57:17,184
99 and there is a free

1350
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:23,564
Area for the where a mall is being developed in Anaheim, California of all places

1351
00:57:23,564 --> 00:57:28,104
This is a place that is there that did get built. It's called the stadium promenade

1352
00:57:28,104 --> 00:57:32,864
It's right next to the Honda Center the pond as I will always call it

1353
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:38,904
Just a quick walk across of the shady river and then you're there you're at stadium bread. It's good

1354
00:57:38,904 --> 00:57:42,544
It's there now. It's got a Chili's and it's got a lazy dog and

1355
00:57:42,544 --> 00:57:49,404
The the idea before this development was built was that Mike love would build his restaurant Club Kokomo

1356
00:57:49,404 --> 00:57:52,924
And we're finally getting into that space

1357
00:57:52,924 --> 00:58:00,304
There's gonna be a Beach Boys place that you can go and he did a whole like junket and performance outside of the pond

1358
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:02,604
Stamos backing him up, of course

1359
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:07,264
And he announced his vision for Club Kokomo and I have a couple of clips from like a little

1360
00:58:07,264 --> 00:58:10,304
Interview that he did saying what it's gonna be

1361
00:58:10,304 --> 00:58:17,224
Different than some of the other celebrity driven kind of entertainment restaurants like dive and plan a Hollywood

1362
00:58:17,224 --> 00:58:18,064
We got a dive

1363
00:58:18,064 --> 00:58:28,244
One thing we have a celebrity chef Bradley Ogden who has contributed some great ideas Bradley Ogden

1364
00:58:28,244 --> 00:58:32,404
Which would be of course fine-tuning adjusting all the way

1365
00:58:32,684 --> 00:58:41,104
But instead of seeing just slice salons, you know jockstrap or something and you know, or the shorts he wore in Rocky you'll have

1366
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:46,824
Real music and of course, we'll have merchandising as well and we'll have a kids club too, which is gonna be different

1367
00:58:46,824 --> 00:58:50,624
Why is he taking so many shots? I don't know

1368
00:58:50,624 --> 00:58:53,704
Just talk about how his restaurants gonna be good

1369
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:57,824
He has to say that the he says that the food will be edible

1370
00:58:57,824 --> 00:59:02,684
He implies that which he's correct that the food is bad at all the places we talked about in celebrity

1371
00:59:02,684 --> 00:59:06,964
But I didn't realize there was this like phantom vestige of celebrity waiting here

1372
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:13,444
But he shits on those restaurants and he says Stallone's jockstrap which there was some nude Stallone's kind of wearing

1373
00:59:13,444 --> 00:59:20,664
I don't want to say I don't want to go in there and see all those demolition man tubes those things

1374
00:59:20,664 --> 00:59:25,724
That's not a future I can get by

1375
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:33,184
And then he and then what happens in that clip is that the interviewer whoever's doing this with him says, okay

1376
00:59:33,184 --> 00:59:36,704
Can you do that same answer again? But just don't say the thing about Stallone's jockstrap

1377
00:59:36,704 --> 00:59:42,864
So she's trying to help like can you just say something without being mean to other things and

1378
00:59:42,864 --> 00:59:46,864
She will find that in other questions that she asked because she asked what's hey

1379
00:59:46,864 --> 00:59:50,144
What's the music that you're gonna be able to hear in Club Kokomo?

1380
00:59:50,284 --> 00:59:54,964
Diversify we want to offer every kind of music. I want to have a series of

1381
00:59:54,964 --> 01:00:01,344
Types of music coming to Club Kokomo blues rock and roll, you know more middle-of-the-road stuff. Whatever

1382
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:08,844
Latino stuff could be anything anything short of gangster rock gangster rap. Oh, oh good

1383
01:00:08,844 --> 01:00:12,504
Mike stop it

1384
01:00:12,504 --> 01:00:14,784
Club Kokomo

1385
01:00:15,764 --> 01:00:20,404
Sans gangster rep besides that we're gonna do it. It's gonna be here in Anaheim

1386
01:00:20,404 --> 01:00:25,544
Spoiler it was not we're gonna be we're looking at locations in Orlando and Las Vegas

1387
01:00:25,544 --> 01:00:31,864
Those did not happen Myrtle Beach Sydney, Australia as with everything we covered in celeb rewary

1388
01:00:31,864 --> 01:00:36,384
They just let's start announcing everything and then have to reel it all back because not one bit of it

1389
01:00:36,384 --> 01:00:42,664
So no Club Kokomo at all. Well, we're only at Anaheim for a long time. That was the case

1390
01:00:42,664 --> 01:00:47,984
Wasn't built in Anaheim there was never a Club Kokomo until last year

1391
01:00:47,984 --> 01:00:51,684
Oh, I didn't see there was not a physical location built

1392
01:00:51,684 --> 01:00:59,604
But Mike's name finally got used for a his line of Club Kokomo canned cocktails

1393
01:00:59,604 --> 01:01:09,644
How old is this guy and I think would be born you weren't you yeah, so it at 80 he's got a new product

1394
01:01:09,644 --> 01:01:14,604
Into the murder we're bringing the the Kokomo spirit. We're bringing it to you

1395
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:18,004
It's the we're putting the beach in a can that's good

1396
01:01:18,004 --> 01:01:25,864
This has got to drive him nuts that Sammy Hagar and Jimmy Buffett have had so much success with so much other crap within

1397
01:01:25,864 --> 01:01:27,664
Tropical yes, we're exactly

1398
01:01:27,664 --> 01:01:31,244
Lane and he's been laid on so it's yeah

1399
01:01:31,244 --> 01:01:37,144
You found another thing the music thing that ship sailed he's fits been his band for a long time and all the good members

1400
01:01:37,204 --> 01:01:41,224
Left yeah, but this thing like shit. Okay. I got a new thing to be

1401
01:01:41,224 --> 01:01:47,064
I'm amazed that there's no piece of footage of him being calling taking shots at Jimmy and yeah, really

1402
01:01:47,064 --> 01:01:51,804
Yeah, that's interesting cuz I'm he might plain stories boring

1403
01:01:51,804 --> 01:01:54,024
Stop telling the story

1404
01:01:54,024 --> 01:02:00,644
Mike is a guy. I think a classic guy who has arguments with people in his head all day long

1405
01:02:00,644 --> 01:02:05,124
Yeah, yeah, and then has to like excise them when there's a microphone in front of him

1406
01:02:05,384 --> 01:02:11,184
He's rolling around like Mick Jagger's like just he's like having an argument Mick Jagger in his head for eight hours a day

1407
01:02:11,184 --> 01:02:16,584
Mike loved the like the the number one customer base for like oh

1408
01:02:16,584 --> 01:02:23,304
Twitter blue I can write longer posts and I'll get seen first. Oh sounds like a good investment

1409
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:29,544
I can finally win every argument publicly everyone will see that I'm right. This is the okay margarita

1410
01:02:29,544 --> 01:02:33,704
We haven't done the full margarita episode. Oh, no, we haven't snow but

1411
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:36,444
85 there was a retail store

1412
01:02:36,444 --> 01:02:42,484
1985 but then in 2002 is the cheeseburger and pay first cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant

1413
01:02:42,484 --> 01:02:47,804
So club Kogama would have beat it. Yes. Oh my god. So and then

1414
01:02:47,804 --> 01:02:53,024
Margaritaville, I don't unless I'm reading this wrong. There wasn't a true margaritaville until 2012

1415
01:02:53,024 --> 01:02:59,664
Wow, that is much later than you expect. Wait. No, that can't be right. I'm universal CityWalk in Orlando

1416
01:02:59,664 --> 01:03:03,184
Oh, yeah, you're right. No, you're right. Then why am I I'm miss reading this then? Hmm

1417
01:03:03,384 --> 01:03:10,204
What year was that margaritaville if I'm remembering right and it opened with the Orlando CityWalk, that's

1418
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:14,524
Earlier, right? Yeah, did it? Hmm. Are you sure we're gonna have to look at this?

1419
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:17,244
We're gonna have to find this you stole my idea

1420
01:03:17,244 --> 01:03:25,004
You you probably got the funding pulled for Club Kokemo Jimmy because you wanted to steal it because you've always been to chicken shit

1421
01:03:25,004 --> 01:03:28,724
To think of your own idea for a tropical casual restaurant

1422
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:30,824
I

1423
01:03:30,824 --> 01:03:36,744
Always been there chicken shit to rule out the genre of rap music at said establishment

1424
01:03:36,744 --> 01:03:40,184
The scariest thing in the boomers

1425
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:48,444
History, it's the USSR and it's the the phrase gangster rap music, which they don't know what that entails

1426
01:03:48,444 --> 01:03:49,764
No, no, no, he's never again

1427
01:03:49,764 --> 01:03:54,644
He's like caught it on a TV in the airport on the way to something else. That's another fun

1428
01:03:55,284 --> 01:04:00,164
Love thing years later a story that nobody had ever heard. He suddenly started saying, you know

1429
01:04:00,164 --> 01:04:03,524
I gave the Beatles the idea for back in the USSR

1430
01:04:03,524 --> 01:04:05,744
When you think about it, it's kind of a best thing

1431
01:04:05,744 --> 01:04:11,404
You should do a song about all the girls in the Ukraine girls really and and people who were around at the time

1432
01:04:11,404 --> 01:04:13,224
We're like he made that up

1433
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:17,664
Never I know the Beatles and the Beach Boys. That is not true

1434
01:04:17,664 --> 01:04:22,844
But when I was meditating with them, you see when we were with the Maharishi, I gave them that song idea

1435
01:04:23,024 --> 01:04:24,544
It's a very

1436
01:04:24,544 --> 01:04:32,224
Trumpian to just make up and like see if anyone will take you to task. He's probably not he also

1437
01:04:32,224 --> 01:04:35,184
Claims that he's levitated the song

1438
01:04:35,184 --> 01:04:37,504
Kokomo has the line

1439
01:04:37,504 --> 01:04:39,064
What is the line?

1440
01:04:40,104 --> 01:04:45,604
Defy a little gravity. He thinks that he's and an interviewer said and have you done that? Yes

1441
01:04:45,604 --> 01:04:50,804
Well through meditation you can fly and yeah, I've done it and then he kind of moved on to the next thing before

1442
01:04:51,204 --> 01:04:55,744
Questions could be asked. So yes, he thinks he wrote the Beatles song and he thinks he can fly

1443
01:04:55,744 --> 01:05:00,144
Wow, that's probably why he likes this like I like the Sugar Ray song. That is that's it

1444
01:05:00,144 --> 01:05:04,704
Flying flying up in there. This guy wants to fly I have

1445
01:05:04,704 --> 01:05:08,964
It's still a way you can look better than him this guy

1446
01:05:08,964 --> 01:05:13,944
I'll get this idiot out to look like a fool doing a song about flying without actually flying

1447
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:20,404
I wanted I very much wanted to have Club Kokomo cocktails here, but they're very hard to get

1448
01:05:21,104 --> 01:05:23,884
Like it was a big like for us. I think in San Diego

1449
01:05:23,884 --> 01:05:29,004
You could find them in a lot of stores, but harder and all the they're all named after lines from Kokomo

1450
01:05:29,004 --> 01:05:33,304
So like afternoon delight and mystique and then also

1451
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,784
excitation

1452
01:05:34,784 --> 01:05:35,964
so

1453
01:05:35,964 --> 01:05:37,924
oh and then

1454
01:05:37,924 --> 01:05:44,224
Excitation specific excited. These are all rum drinks, but then excitation is a gin and wait a gin and juice

1455
01:05:44,224 --> 01:05:47,484
And this is on the official website for Club Kokomo

1456
01:05:47,484 --> 01:05:55,124
We might be big fans of the song Kokomo, but we lean into some gin and juice on this track shout out to you know who

1457
01:05:55,124 --> 01:05:58,444
Well, how do we feel about gangster rap?

1458
01:05:59,064 --> 01:06:03,644
We've changed our tune now that there's money to be made. Yeah, really?

1459
01:06:04,224 --> 01:06:10,384
What is the point of all this? Where am I heading with all of this? And I apologize. It's been a long time, but the

1460
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:17,464
What I why it is like a fascination to me and not just a band that I like is all of these characters and and

1461
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:23,324
They've left behind this bizarre musical legacy that is two bands at once one that has made music

1462
01:06:23,324 --> 01:06:31,764
That has moved me so much or that I've just enjoyed so much and then another one that is this like canned cocktail promoter

1463
01:06:31,764 --> 01:06:39,344
You know, that's let's collabing with Mark McGrath and low cash and I'm I just always think like how could these how could this be?

1464
01:06:39,564 --> 01:06:46,184
The same people how could these people all the way like this the same group of people made some of the most beautiful music

1465
01:06:46,284 --> 01:06:53,524
And some of the weirdest most like sell out trash that doesn't sell out besides Kokomo

1466
01:06:53,524 --> 01:06:56,924
Right the only time because it certainly there are successful touring egg

1467
01:06:56,924 --> 01:07:01,504
But none of Mike's other plans have worked out that well, right like the restaurant

1468
01:07:01,504 --> 01:07:05,844
I don't think you guys haven't heard of Club Kokomo cocktails before I have not know

1469
01:07:05,844 --> 01:07:11,744
Something I should know still trying to get the track down that John Taffer brown butter

1470
01:07:11,744 --> 01:07:12,644
bourbon

1471
01:07:14,584 --> 01:07:15,144
Yeah

1472
01:07:15,144 --> 01:07:21,404
Full of states it sounds so bad. We gotta do but bar rescue will be all of our birthday. Maybe we celebrate the podcast

1473
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:26,124
Shot well, he was just on Tron at Florida

1474
01:07:26,124 --> 01:07:34,424
Cycle with John Taffer episode I just really I'd like to see the side view on that is what I want to see

1475
01:07:34,424 --> 01:07:38,984
See that strange but that t-rex body is a big man

1476
01:07:39,044 --> 01:07:46,904
Into that odd ride vehicle that's an email I could send and we could get maybe Tron light cycle with John Taffer

1477
01:07:46,904 --> 01:07:52,844
Half the audience is psyched and the other half

1478
01:07:52,844 --> 01:07:56,804
Okay guys

1479
01:07:56,804 --> 01:08:05,344
Could you blame us if you were in our position would you do it too if they look at the emails returned

1480
01:08:05,824 --> 01:08:11,524
Which I suspect it will be I don't know why I just feel like maybe that's not as tough as some of the other people

1481
01:08:11,524 --> 01:08:14,584
We discussed please give it a go. We got to give that a go

1482
01:08:14,584 --> 01:08:17,124
So here's where I've been heading with all this

1483
01:08:17,124 --> 01:08:20,464
I'm going to just really display the duality of the Beach Boys

1484
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:26,844
Which is what I love about them by playing some of the craziest songs that they ever made

1485
01:08:26,844 --> 01:08:34,024
You know varying degree they're not all necessarily like the worst songs they ever made right there definitely hall

1486
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,104
Very odd and

1487
01:08:36,104 --> 01:08:38,224
and just to

1488
01:08:38,224 --> 01:08:41,804
Provide a counter to that. I'm going to suggest a chaser

1489
01:08:41,804 --> 01:08:47,264
If you want to listen to these and these crazy songs, I have paired them all

1490
01:08:47,264 --> 01:08:53,444
Just like Club Coco mocan cocktails with one that I genuinely love and that I think is the flip side

1491
01:08:53,444 --> 01:08:57,144
Okay of the band. I'm not gonna play those. I'm just gonna suggest them

1492
01:08:57,144 --> 01:09:00,844
Because I think it's it's more fun to play the the insane ones

1493
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:03,924
And I think this will this will give you a full picture of the band and hopefully

1494
01:09:03,924 --> 01:09:07,844
Hopefully the the good songs are ones that maybe you don't know and

1495
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:12,404
I'm so curious if you guys if you Michael Jason have come across any of these, okay?

1496
01:09:12,924 --> 01:09:15,844
So when people tell me they don't like the bird

1497
01:09:15,844 --> 01:09:20,624
They want to make fun of my love of the Beach Boys Coco mo is what's always wielded against me

1498
01:09:20,624 --> 01:09:23,804
That's always the weapon that's brought out and I always think okay

1499
01:09:23,804 --> 01:09:27,764
you have brought a butter knife to a sword fight because

1500
01:09:27,824 --> 01:09:35,884
You your coca mo is what you're using you have no idea how bad it gets things get so insane in this discography

1501
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:39,144
And even within like songs for movies

1502
01:09:39,144 --> 01:09:42,284
The be the coca mo is not the worst

1503
01:09:42,284 --> 01:09:46,044
They did so this was like a way they were trying to cash grab for a little while

1504
01:09:46,044 --> 01:09:50,764
They did a song in lethal weapon 2 they did a song in troop Beverly Hills

1505
01:09:50,764 --> 01:09:56,244
There was of course John Stamos is forever used in many forms on full house and later

1506
01:09:56,244 --> 01:09:58,544
Fuller house and they're still doing it with him

1507
01:09:58,544 --> 01:10:03,964
This is the one that I want to play it is the title song to a film that we all remember from

1508
01:10:03,964 --> 01:10:07,844
1990 and I will let the song introduce itself

1509
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:31,988
So I know.

1510
01:10:50,988 --> 01:10:53,808
And that's that. Problem Child.

1511
01:10:54,528 --> 01:10:58,328
Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna play this one more line.

1512
01:11:08,548 --> 01:11:11,168
That sums up the vibe of the movie.

1513
01:11:11,748 --> 01:11:12,208
Soon he'll be a king of hearts.

1514
01:11:12,728 --> 01:11:16,508
Soon, yeah, he's a problem child now, but we all know soon he's gonna be a king of hearts.

1515
01:11:16,768 --> 01:11:17,688
What does that mean?

1516
01:11:19,268 --> 01:11:25,928
That he's, you know, he's an angry little dude, but soon he'll be dating.

1517
01:11:26,388 --> 01:11:28,348
So soon he's gonna be a handsome gentleman.

1518
01:11:28,468 --> 01:11:30,588
Wait, actually, the next line kind of explains it.

1519
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:36,268
Thank you next door, my turn into a world of lies.

1520
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:40,208
That girl next door made us up.

1521
01:11:40,348 --> 01:11:41,308
She wanted to beat us out.

1522
01:11:41,988 --> 01:11:44,888
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just wanted to provide the context.

1523
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:46,088
Yeah, Jason asked for it.

1524
01:11:46,088 --> 01:11:46,808
I did ask for it.

1525
01:11:46,808 --> 01:11:47,948
You asked for it.

1526
01:11:47,948 --> 01:11:49,128
I did ask.

1527
01:11:49,168 --> 01:11:50,668
Okay, okay.

1528
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:57,808
The cool rock and roller speculating about the future attractiveness of children.

1529
01:11:58,348 --> 01:12:05,268
Yeah, it's a song about a mischievous child in a movie and asserting that soon he will be dating.

1530
01:12:05,568 --> 01:12:05,928
A heartbreaker.

1531
01:12:05,948 --> 01:12:10,368
And getting it on with girls who will, look, they're gonna grow up.

1532
01:12:10,408 --> 01:12:12,948
Let's be clear, everybody's growing up in this scenario.

1533
01:12:12,948 --> 01:12:13,588
Sure, yeah, yeah.

1534
01:12:13,588 --> 01:12:15,808
We're gonna have a king of hearts and a work of art.

1535
01:12:15,928 --> 01:12:16,228
Yeah.

1536
01:12:16,268 --> 01:12:22,168
For a band that has a lot of great melodies, this is one of the shittiest nothing melodies.

1537
01:12:22,388 --> 01:12:27,948
And do you not like, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1538
01:12:27,988 --> 01:12:29,328
That's at least something.

1539
01:12:29,648 --> 01:12:30,768
Yeah, that I kind of get.

1540
01:12:30,768 --> 01:12:30,988
It is something.

1541
01:12:31,108 --> 01:12:36,328
It is something like the da-da-da-da-da-da, that little guitar thing that flourished at the end of a line.

1542
01:12:36,468 --> 01:12:37,108
That's something.

1543
01:12:37,128 --> 01:12:41,808
I sort of like, again, this is where I like Carl singing no matter what.

1544
01:12:41,808 --> 01:12:47,328
And so I do, even if it's something as inane as calling them the problem child, the king of hearts.

1545
01:12:47,728 --> 01:12:50,508
He's also, okay, also full content.

1546
01:12:50,588 --> 01:12:52,228
This is what the listener is not seeing.

1547
01:12:52,348 --> 01:13:03,008
I'm playing the music video for you guys in which there is a Beach Boys recording session in progress that is being mucked up by the infamous problem child,

1548
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:10,208
which is causing much grief for the Beach Boys themselves and also for the producer of the session, Gilbert Godfrey.

1549
01:13:10,308 --> 01:13:12,788
It's great. I do love that. You can't be mad at that.

1550
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:15,688
You'll see him around in this clip.

1551
01:13:15,788 --> 01:13:20,628
But here's one more. This is the bridge where things get a little, maybe see if this does it for you melodically, Mike.

1552
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:55,000
Then, due to the problem of child's hijinks, a bunch of soap blows out of Mike Love's microphone.

1553
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,280
His saxophone.

1554
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,760
His saxophone, sorry.

1555
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:03,900
He goes for his big saxophone solo, and then instead a bunch of suds come out.

1556
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,840
Yeah, but it sounds great anyway.

1557
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,040
It still works.

1558
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:10,840
The suds don't really get in the way, it just kind of makes him look less cool.

1559
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,920
This is another Mike Love myth, is that he can play the saxophone.

1560
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,460
This is not true.

1561
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,300
There was a point in the band's history where they would give him ones, he could do this solo.

1562
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:24,660
Bum bum, bum bum, bum bum.

1563
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,440
That is a two note solo.

1564
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,580
So I don't think he's playing on the problem child track.

1565
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,440
Was that also a universal tram tour?

1566
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,980
That was a universal tram at the beginning, isn't that strange?

1567
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:44,020
A limo driver hands him an ice cream cone so he can throw it at a nun's head while she's on the studio tour.

1568
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:47,520
Thank you for not forgetting to narrate that part of it.

1569
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,640
It's pretty good.

1570
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:53,480
These are the flavors you're going to get if you see problem child in theaters.

1571
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,640
Now this is post-Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.

1572
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:59,640
This is post-Cocum and now they're in demand.

1573
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,960
Movies are throwing themselves at the Beach Boys.

1574
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:06,460
Please do another timeless classic with a great melody and then they turn in.

1575
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,300
Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

1576
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:11,340
Isn't there a pink song that's like, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

1577
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,520
Why we're going to start a fight.

1578
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,360
Yeah, that's similar to that.

1579
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:26,120
My impression was always if you got in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, you were either going to coast after that or you were on your way to coasting, including making movie tie-in songs.

1580
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:31,080
But it seems like he is so insecure he needs to keep doing endeavors.

1581
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,420
Oh, absolutely.

1582
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,140
I mean, look at that.

1583
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:36,060
It's canned cocktails and restaurants and weird.

1584
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:39,980
You know, remember they put out an album that was just they've done so many things.

1585
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:44,840
They're just like rerecording the old songs and it's like the Beach Boys tribute to NASCAR.

1586
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:50,160
It's a bad picture of them, like everybody back to back with like a checkered flag.

1587
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,800
Just whatever, whatever we can do.

1588
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:53,620
Must keep move.

1589
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:54,680
Must keep promoting.

1590
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:03,200
Meanwhile, like Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan, who I would consider elder statesman, still putting out new albums, still touring pretty regularly.

1591
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:14,520
And I feel like do a lot less talking shit, like a lot more weird stuff and maybe seem like happier, maybe see more content and like they don't have just constant access to grind.

1592
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,800
Willie. Yes. Bob. Happy. I don't know.

1593
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,300
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't really determine his happiness.

1594
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,420
Different flavor of eccentric for sure.

1595
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:26,040
Sure. I just wish he had crammed something about the beach in this song.

1596
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1597
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,460
That's what I was hoping like when because I've seen this before.

1598
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:37,060
But like with problems, I just wish it was like when he can you get older, you'll put your little tiny toes in the sand.

1599
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,580
Your toes are small now, but they will be so, so big.

1600
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,460
Maybe a long board.

1601
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:52,500
Be careful. You might get bit by a crab.

1602
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:57,680
Yeah, yeah, just something to keep the brand in the song as well.

1603
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:05,180
Yeah, I like that the the the bridge is also about like, and then you're going to have a wife and children.

1604
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,380
It's all about imagining the future of the problem child.

1605
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:14,660
The movie does not make any efforts to do unlike Clifford, which is all a base narrated by an old Clifford.

1606
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,540
Yeah, I know. It's a missed the point.

1607
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:21,140
It's nice to have the full picture. I think my chaser for that one is the song Feel Flows.

1608
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,620
That's a much better use of Carl Wilson's gorgeous vocals.

1609
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:34,060
Really wonderful evocative song from which was that on surf's up, I think, and a much better soundtrack song as used in almost famous.

1610
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,260
If you can believe that it tops problem child.

1611
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:41,200
The reason why I said craziest and not worst songs is because of this one.

1612
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:46,780
I don't know if you would necessarily call it a bad song per se, but it's definitely very strange that it exists.

1613
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:50,020
And by the way, I don't want to blame Mike Love for all these songs.

1614
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,600
What you're about to hear is 100 percent Brian Wilson.

1615
01:17:52,920 --> 01:18:00,000
It's maybe from an era where he was not, you know, grappling with like the the greater themes of growing up and love.

1616
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,260
He was more like looking at something.

1617
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:07,660
But he was in the state in his bed for three years as tributed in the Barenaked Lady song.

1618
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:17,180
So he's probably getting a lot of ideas from things, you know, in the window or in the bathroom or in this case, I would say, on the TV.

1619
01:18:35,068 --> 01:18:38,028
I love to see in Jason's eyes drop on this.

1620
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,000
That's good, that gives you the gist of it.

1621
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,460
Feel free to weigh in, Jon.

1622
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:02,900
What is he saying?

1623
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,140
Johnny concert?

1624
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:05,140
Johnny Carson?

1625
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,200
Johnny Carson.

1626
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:06,960
Johnny Carson, okay.

1627
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:09,900
For a second I thought he was saying Johnny concert

1628
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,760
then I thought he was saying Johnny Cochran.

1629
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:15,240
Just cause you said it out with someone on TV.

1630
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,320
What year?

1631
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:18,120
This is 77.

1632
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,140
So yeah, I don't know.

1633
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,980
He must have been watching The Tonight Show

1634
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:24,140
and like, hey, I have an idea now.

1635
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:27,020
There's a weird, simple, plunky song

1636
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,740
about Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon comes on

1637
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:34,640
and there's a really odd posit later in the song

1638
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:39,720
where he says, the network makes him break his back.

1639
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,440
Cause he had a bad back, did he?

1640
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:42,940
I think.

1641
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,980
I mean, I view it as metaphorical as like,

1642
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,980
day in, day out, this guy's grinding out the con.

1643
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,200
Just an odd perspective.

1644
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:52,760
I think of Johnny Carson as kind of like,

1645
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:57,780
having it all, leaves it to guest hosts whenever he wants.

1646
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,920
I think of Johnny as a miserable guy

1647
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:04,060
who had a lot of issues and was angry

1648
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,640
and was on TV a lot.

1649
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,500
Maybe I'm making up the back thing,

1650
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,340
but he had some troubles.

1651
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:11,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1652
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,380
Here's what I'll say about this.

1653
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:14,800
I like the sound of this, but it is,

1654
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,180
the way in which it's being sung is unpleasant.

1655
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,300
Well, this is from an album that I love

1656
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,160
called The Beach Boys Love You.

1657
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,100
And in terms of, you know, the Beach Boys,

1658
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,300
as Mike Love said to me,

1659
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,520
the Beach Boys transcend generations.

1660
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:28,920
And here's what's happening with,

1661
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,740
I actually really like the sound of this album.

1662
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,240
It's got this, it's got this Moog base on everything

1663
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,780
that's really distinct.

1664
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:35,200
Yeah, yeah.

1665
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:35,660
That's what you're talking about?

1666
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:35,940
Yeah.

1667
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:36,880
Yeah, yeah.

1668
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,700
And that's kind of on every song.

1669
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,120
And there is a song that I never cared for too much,

1670
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:41,700
but I liked it.

1671
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:43,840
I liked it enough to put it on one day in the car,

1672
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,620
a song called Honking Down the Highway.

1673
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,880
And the song goes honk, honk, honking down the highway.

1674
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,320
And then the lyric honking down the gosh darn highway.

1675
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,360
This is again a song I like,

1676
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,980
has the lyric honking down the gosh darn highway.

1677
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:00,560
Yeah.

1678
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,140
I just was like, I feel like here in this song,

1679
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:07,120
and I look back and my son is transfixed.

1680
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:07,500
Wow.

1681
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,860
This was months ago.

1682
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,380
We have to sing and play Honking Down the Highway

1683
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:15,060
for him every day at this point.

1684
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,880
He asks if we're in the car, he asks for it.

1685
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,540
If he's having trouble sleeping,

1686
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:22,160
we come in and sing it to him.

1687
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:22,720
Okay.

1688
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:26,380
Honking Down the Highway, a not popular Beach Boys song,

1689
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,580
sung by true neutral Al Jardine.

1690
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:32,840
And we've taught my son the name Al Jardine,

1691
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,080
and he'll get a little guitar out,

1692
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,640
and he will say, I'm Al Jardine.

1693
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:40,860
Are you Al Jardine too?

1694
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:43,620
Yes, son, we're all Al Jardines.

1695
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,400
Oh wow.

1696
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,860
This has been a delight for me,

1697
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,460
but I of course am afraid of the sins of the father.

1698
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:52,540
It's gonna do the same thing,

1699
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,780
him liking the Beach Boys at an early age

1700
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,520
will do the same thing it did for me,

1701
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,820
where you were first unrelatable in elementary school,

1702
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:03,160
and then years later doing very long podcast episodes

1703
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,040
where you have to get all this out of your brain,

1704
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:08,100
because if it stays in there, you don't know what'll happen.

1705
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,900
I'll end up having to work at a sheet metal place.

1706
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,660
So that's the flip side of the,

1707
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,520
but maybe that's my flip side for this one,

1708
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,020
and it is Honkin' Down the Highway.

1709
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,780
Although what I was going to say is this song,

1710
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:20,640
do you know the song Till I Die, Mike?

1711
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:22,920
I don't know, not off the top of my head.

1712
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,600
Till I Die is also from the Surf's Up album,

1713
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,060
and okay, if this is Brian Wilson singing

1714
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,800
about something that is just on in front of him,

1715
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:34,100
years before he does the song about insignificance

1716
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,480
and impermanence and death that is so haunting,

1717
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,360
and just everything that he's great at,

1718
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:41,600
and everything that makes the Beach Boys

1719
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:42,800
not a novelty band.

1720
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,020
So I think that's a good pairing for that one,

1721
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:49,000
a song with a reference to Ed McMahon in it.

1722
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,980
And I hope you like pop culture references,

1723
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,420
because that's what we're gonna get in this next song.

1724
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,100
Mike's quest for songs about surf and sand,

1725
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,840
it eventually brought him to a point where he realized,

1726
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,140
all right, well if the band isn't gonna go my way,

1727
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:05,240
I guess I'm gonna have to go solo.

1728
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,520
And he put out his first solo album of a few,

1729
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,100
I have the vinyl of it right here,

1730
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,680
it is called Looking Back with Love.

1731
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:16,800
And here he is on a pier at sunset,

1732
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:20,640
and he's wearing a shiny jacket and an LA Dodgers hat.

1733
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:24,000
And it's again, it's all looking back,

1734
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,220
it's always about, we just gotta get back

1735
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:27,940
to things were simple once.

1736
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,860
Making things great again.

1737
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:34,740
Yeah, I just like to go around the country with my hat,

1738
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,860
and have a bunch of people all,

1739
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,740
get into an unorganized group and yell,

1740
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,080
and we can all agree that things used to be

1741
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,420
a little bit better in this country of ours.

1742
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:49,080
He is like the less funny version of that Simpson's joke

1743
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:52,100
of the 60s ended the day we sold our van,

1744
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,380
December 31st, 1969.

1745
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,700
That's a good joke.

1746
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:58,860
I don't remember that joke.

1747
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:02,280
This really, this sums up, I don't think,

1748
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:04,660
I think not just the Mike Love sensibility,

1749
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,540
but also like, I was gonna say boomer,

1750
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,900
but that's not right, because he's older.

1751
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,280
It's the greatest generation.

1752
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,940
But I think some boomerism fits into this too,

1753
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:17,540
because here is the perspective of this song.

1754
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:20,680
Boy, the past was really nuts.

1755
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:23,000
You know, the past 10 years ago.

1756
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:25,400
And I'm so glad that it's over.

1757
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,720
I'm glad that history is over,

1758
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,360
so now we can all just chill out

1759
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:33,220
and remember all the stuff that happened,

1760
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:35,420
and is done with, thank God,

1761
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:39,180
and look forward to a future with no more history in it.

1762
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,960
That is what the song, the title track,

1763
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:44,420
Looking Back With Love is.

1764
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,880
And yeah, it's just him reflecting,

1765
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,840
being the ultimate voice on the 60s,

1766
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:53,200
the perfect guy to sum up the 60s,

1767
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,800
via a total ripoff of what a fool believes

1768
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,920
four years too late.

1769
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,700
And by the way, he didn't produce the video

1770
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,640
I'm gonna play with it for you guys,

1771
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,020
but it's gonna help kinda conjure some of his,

1772
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,820
the imagery of the song, which is very potent.

1773
01:25:18,456 --> 01:25:22,836
It was the best of times, the worst of times.

1774
01:25:22,836 --> 01:25:23,856
Oh, God!

1775
01:25:24,176 --> 01:25:27,376
An age of reason with a rage for rhyme.

1776
01:25:27,896 --> 01:25:31,836
Sound and fury, sounds of silence.

1777
01:25:32,676 --> 01:25:35,776
Christ the peace amidst the violence.

1778
01:25:36,356 --> 01:25:40,316
Black and white issues and desegregation.

1779
01:25:41,176 --> 01:25:44,276
Fear and loathing in the woods, dockation.

1780
01:25:44,996 --> 01:25:47,916
Stormy seas and sunny skies above.

1781
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:51,076
And now we're looking back.

1782
01:25:51,076 --> 01:25:53,576
Looking back with love.

1783
01:25:54,096 --> 01:25:54,916
Looking back.

1784
01:25:55,276 --> 01:25:57,316
Looking back with love.

1785
01:26:01,316 --> 01:26:05,056
Good vibrations, assassinations.

1786
01:26:18,636 --> 01:26:22,956
And then JFK in a flag draped coffin.

1787
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:25,336
Oh my God.

1788
01:26:25,956 --> 01:26:27,636
Good vibrations, assassinations.

1789
01:26:27,836 --> 01:26:31,696
The next lyric is losing leaders never knowing why.

1790
01:26:32,336 --> 01:26:35,356
Nobody ever knew, we never knew why any of it happened.

1791
01:26:35,536 --> 01:26:36,716
Nobody ever looked into it.

1792
01:26:36,716 --> 01:26:38,196
It just happened and it was weird.

1793
01:26:38,216 --> 01:26:40,356
But now we're looking back with love.

1794
01:26:40,476 --> 01:26:42,216
Looking back with love? What?

1795
01:26:42,556 --> 01:26:46,716
Yes, the lyrics before included like racial strife.

1796
01:26:46,716 --> 01:26:46,776
Yeah.

1797
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:48,636
Desegregation.

1798
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:57,896
I first gasped like yelled because it was footage of people being sprayed by fire hose.

1799
01:26:58,176 --> 01:26:59,316
Again, not his fault.

1800
01:27:00,296 --> 01:27:02,736
But the person maybe making this video.

1801
01:27:02,736 --> 01:27:06,016
Yeah, and then there was numerous marches.

1802
01:27:06,116 --> 01:27:08,856
And then battle footage from Vietnam.

1803
01:27:09,216 --> 01:27:10,596
Well, now Mike's fault again.

1804
01:27:10,836 --> 01:27:12,516
Again, I should have confused it by should have.

1805
01:27:12,516 --> 01:27:15,356
But it is lyrically what he is.

1806
01:27:15,356 --> 01:27:16,056
But that's what he's talking about.

1807
01:27:16,156 --> 01:27:18,696
He's just saying like man, that was crazy.

1808
01:27:18,716 --> 01:27:19,916
That's a crazy time.

1809
01:27:20,136 --> 01:27:20,256
Why?

1810
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:22,496
Anyway, I'm looking back fondly.

1811
01:27:22,956 --> 01:27:24,436
Looking back with love.

1812
01:27:24,936 --> 01:27:31,976
And when you look at the cover, do this where he's like, he's looking at us like, hey, member, are you ready to look back with love with me?

1813
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:34,816
Lean in it, boy, things have been crazy.

1814
01:27:35,236 --> 01:27:39,416
Thank God we're in the 80s where no more, nothing will happen.

1815
01:27:39,516 --> 01:27:41,116
It's all smooth sailing.

1816
01:27:41,116 --> 01:27:46,056
Isn't the lyric in that like sunny skies above?

1817
01:27:46,476 --> 01:27:47,116
And that's it.

1818
01:27:47,116 --> 01:27:49,916
We all know we're in the sunny skies now.

1819
01:27:49,936 --> 01:27:50,676
He was right.

1820
01:27:50,716 --> 01:27:51,896
Everything's been rosy.

1821
01:27:51,996 --> 01:28:00,856
This is no more perfect example of the conservative older male mindset of like, man, you know what?

1822
01:28:00,896 --> 01:28:01,656
All that stuff.

1823
01:28:01,896 --> 01:28:03,296
Glad that was in the past.

1824
01:28:03,676 --> 01:28:05,016
Everything's perfect now.

1825
01:28:05,216 --> 01:28:10,656
I'm not going to worry about anything other than my 401k being OK from now on.

1826
01:28:10,656 --> 01:28:11,616
Things were rough.

1827
01:28:12,216 --> 01:28:15,076
We had a couple problems to solve.

1828
01:28:15,116 --> 01:28:16,656
One was desegregation.

1829
01:28:16,816 --> 01:28:21,076
We fixed racial strife and we fixed Vietnam.

1830
01:28:21,156 --> 01:28:25,676
And we also had to fix people being bored and having nothing to tap their toe to.

1831
01:28:25,996 --> 01:28:27,996
So we fixed that with good vibrations.

1832
01:28:28,376 --> 01:28:31,856
Unfortunately, there were battle stations and assassinations.

1833
01:28:32,036 --> 01:28:36,256
But ultimately, we, the white people mainly, fixed it.

1834
01:28:36,276 --> 01:28:40,076
And now we get to look back at the wonderful things we did.

1835
01:28:40,216 --> 01:28:46,276
Here's some shots of John Lennon and Bob Dylan and Simon Garfunkel and I think Harry Nielsen.

1836
01:28:46,296 --> 01:28:51,036
That's the other that he, because he loves the good vibrate.

1837
01:28:51,036 --> 01:28:56,216
He's done so many songs where he quotes good vibrations and now he's doing it with other songs.

1838
01:28:56,516 --> 01:28:58,716
We're doing the sounds of silence.

1839
01:28:59,636 --> 01:29:01,096
Let me try to find later.

1840
01:29:01,156 --> 01:29:06,076
Because then he starts just like playing other songs within this.

1841
01:29:06,076 --> 01:29:10,256
So full of sounds from the Motor City.

1842
01:29:10,536 --> 01:29:14,216
Californics burns out, you're looking pretty.

1843
01:29:15,196 --> 01:29:17,216
Two girls for it.

1844
01:29:17,956 --> 01:29:19,096
Not your song.

1845
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:20,676
Brian wrote it.

1846
01:29:21,536 --> 01:29:24,396
British invasion with a Mersey Beat.

1847
01:29:31,544 --> 01:29:37,224
He's really hung up on the phrase mop tops, which is funny, which is just like what old people-

1848
01:29:37,224 --> 01:29:38,324
Mop top merseys.

1849
01:29:39,364 --> 01:29:42,524
Old people called them that in the first few years.

1850
01:29:42,784 --> 01:29:44,264
But he's showing older Beatles.

1851
01:29:44,764 --> 01:29:46,304
He's not showing the video.

1852
01:29:46,824 --> 01:29:48,164
The video is so weird.

1853
01:29:50,104 --> 01:29:51,764
I knew I was struggling with this.

1854
01:29:51,904 --> 01:29:52,904
Should I show the video or not?

1855
01:29:52,904 --> 01:29:54,504
It's not part of that.

1856
01:29:54,504 --> 01:29:55,644
We have to keep it separate.

1857
01:29:55,924 --> 01:29:56,724
There's still many things to go over.

1858
01:29:57,484 --> 01:29:59,524
Yeah, referencing your own songs.

1859
01:30:00,184 --> 01:30:02,904
The other guy that bands songs.

1860
01:30:02,944 --> 01:30:04,024
Yes, he didn't do it.

1861
01:30:04,204 --> 01:30:05,904
I can do this one from memory.

1862
01:30:06,064 --> 01:30:07,484
Their song, Summer in Paradise.

1863
01:30:07,824 --> 01:30:13,644
Way back when, when our master plan was having fun, fun, fun as America's band.

1864
01:30:13,904 --> 01:30:21,484
Then we came out rocking with Barbara and Rhonda and Barbara and singing a surfing sand.

1865
01:30:21,564 --> 01:30:24,664
He's done so many of these tortured lyrics.

1866
01:30:24,924 --> 01:30:26,884
How can we possibly fit?

1867
01:30:27,044 --> 01:30:28,144
I should try to do more.

1868
01:30:28,524 --> 01:30:32,064
Can I fit 25 Beach Boys songs?

1869
01:30:32,244 --> 01:30:33,764
You should write one for him and submit it.

1870
01:30:33,764 --> 01:30:35,164
I should try to do a modern Beach Boys.

1871
01:30:35,324 --> 01:30:35,984
That's a good idea.

1872
01:30:36,084 --> 01:30:37,724
We've talked about writing Ringo songs.

1873
01:30:38,104 --> 01:30:41,744
Writing in the character of Mike would be great.

1874
01:30:42,344 --> 01:30:45,364
By the way, he didn't write these lyrics also on top of that.

1875
01:30:45,364 --> 01:30:49,644
He went solo and then got his manager to write the lyrics.

1876
01:30:49,864 --> 01:30:51,564
His manager wrote this.

1877
01:30:51,644 --> 01:30:52,784
That's so great.

1878
01:30:54,064 --> 01:30:57,244
It's so funny because it also speaks to,

1879
01:30:57,764 --> 01:31:04,324
he didn't write these, but he's a man who has no real life experience in the last 30 to 40 years.

1880
01:31:04,564 --> 01:31:05,864
He's on the road.

1881
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:06,864
He's in his bubble.

1882
01:31:07,624 --> 01:31:13,564
All that desegregation before the 60s start getting really crazy.

1883
01:31:13,664 --> 01:31:17,984
He's a rock star at the beginning of it and he's like 20.

1884
01:31:18,444 --> 01:31:20,464
He's not lived real life.

1885
01:31:20,784 --> 01:31:25,664
All of his experiences are trying to get back to the first few years of the Beach Boys when

1886
01:31:25,664 --> 01:31:27,624
he was closest to being a human being.

1887
01:31:28,104 --> 01:31:34,084
I am doing the in the 1980s doing like we got to get back to the fun, fun 60s.

1888
01:31:34,164 --> 01:31:37,504
God knows what state his brain is in now.

1889
01:31:38,124 --> 01:31:39,964
40 years later.

1890
01:31:40,004 --> 01:31:42,304
Well, he probably looks at, well, Trump fixed it.

1891
01:31:42,324 --> 01:31:43,144
So now we're back.

1892
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:44,204
We finally did it.

1893
01:31:44,544 --> 01:31:49,464
It's everything I was saying with looking back with love and now Trump helps us look back at love.

1894
01:31:50,464 --> 01:31:55,444
But unfortunately now I'm mad at all the, he did it all and Biden undid it

1895
01:31:55,444 --> 01:31:56,624
in the first month.

1896
01:31:57,124 --> 01:32:02,424
So now we got to, now we got to fix Biden so we can look back with love at how we.

1897
01:32:02,724 --> 01:32:02,764
Right.

1898
01:32:02,764 --> 01:32:03,564
It's totally.

1899
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:08,584
Coked up sons with doing conspiracies.

1900
01:32:08,864 --> 01:32:10,604
Coco Mo and coke up sons.

1901
01:32:11,864 --> 01:32:14,444
My mutual fund gained $2,200.

1902
01:32:16,704 --> 01:32:18,264
Mutual fund.

1903
01:32:19,404 --> 01:32:25,244
My mutual fund gained $2,200 and then it lost $1,800.

1904
01:32:25,244 --> 01:32:27,684
We gotta do something.

1905
01:32:28,184 --> 01:32:31,524
I do not care for coked up sons.

1906
01:32:31,524 --> 01:32:39,024
And then instead of Aruba, Jamaica, it's all just names of jails that Hunter could go to

1907
01:32:39,024 --> 01:32:40,004
and should go to.

1908
01:32:41,204 --> 01:32:42,284
Yeah, that's that.

1909
01:32:42,304 --> 01:32:46,664
I also want to shout out the lyric, hungry hawks and a peaceful dove.

1910
01:32:47,704 --> 01:32:49,504
So the hungry hawks were what?

1911
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:54,564
The hungry hawks were like the cops with the hoses.

1912
01:32:54,564 --> 01:32:56,744
And then a peaceful dove is him.

1913
01:32:56,744 --> 01:32:57,564
It's him now.

1914
01:32:57,564 --> 01:32:58,684
Yeah, he's a peaceful guy.

1915
01:32:58,864 --> 01:32:59,444
Offering a branch.

1916
01:32:59,664 --> 01:33:02,064
Hey everybody, we at least we're all friends now.

1917
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,164
Nothing will ever happen again.

1918
01:33:05,484 --> 01:33:11,144
If that is the worst beach boys solo song, I would ask people to listen to the best beach

1919
01:33:11,144 --> 01:33:14,224
boys solo song, Dennis Wilson's river song.

1920
01:33:14,344 --> 01:33:15,744
You know that one, Mike, if you know.

1921
01:33:16,084 --> 01:33:18,184
I fucking love river song.

1922
01:33:18,444 --> 01:33:21,424
That is like, it also, it doesn't sound like the beach boys at all.

1923
01:33:21,424 --> 01:33:22,904
That has like production.

1924
01:33:22,904 --> 01:33:23,964
Stomp.

1925
01:33:23,964 --> 01:33:28,684
It's good musicianship, big, powerful, coral groups.

1926
01:33:28,884 --> 01:33:29,984
I fucking love that song.

1927
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:36,744
Jason, I think you should blaze a big fat blunt tonight and listen to Pacific Ocean

1928
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:36,884
Blue.

1929
01:33:36,904 --> 01:33:37,824
That's one of those songs.

1930
01:33:37,864 --> 01:33:41,744
I wish I was good with weed because I go with this album.

1931
01:33:41,864 --> 01:33:43,084
I scaled back a lot, Mike.

1932
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:43,904
You did?

1933
01:33:44,304 --> 01:33:45,184
Yeah, I have.

1934
01:33:45,444 --> 01:33:46,364
Come on.

1935
01:33:46,484 --> 01:33:46,924
Sorry.

1936
01:33:47,304 --> 01:33:48,944
But that's your identity on the show.

1937
01:33:49,444 --> 01:33:50,524
People are going to be so crushed.

1938
01:33:50,844 --> 01:33:52,264
That's your sort of beach.

1939
01:33:52,304 --> 01:33:52,744
That's my gimmick.

1940
01:33:52,744 --> 01:33:53,944
That's my white wine.

1941
01:33:53,964 --> 01:33:55,264
Yeah, that's your surf and sand.

1942
01:33:55,444 --> 01:33:57,724
That's my white and nasty blue.

1943
01:33:57,724 --> 01:33:59,344
We need to get back, man.

1944
01:33:59,684 --> 01:34:00,444
We need to get back.

1945
01:34:00,444 --> 01:34:02,644
When you're blazing up a big fat blunt.

1946
01:34:02,664 --> 01:34:05,524
Remember the days when Jason smoked the blunt.

1947
01:34:05,524 --> 01:34:07,084
Yeah, that's what we need.

1948
01:34:07,584 --> 01:34:10,684
Five fuss a week he was having fun.

1949
01:34:12,084 --> 01:34:16,404
Got to get back to having blunt, blunt, blunt in the summer sun.

1950
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:17,904
Oh, man.

1951
01:34:17,984 --> 01:34:22,064
OK, well, you'll have to forge, I guess, a new identity on the show.

1952
01:34:23,584 --> 01:34:24,944
Yeah, what are we going to do?

1953
01:34:24,964 --> 01:34:25,664
I'm the cute one.

1954
01:34:26,084 --> 01:34:27,184
Oh, yeah, I guess.

1955
01:34:27,744 --> 01:34:28,244
I don't know.

1956
01:34:28,404 --> 01:34:32,744
Well, Jason's identity for a long time has been paying himself his own compliments.

1957
01:34:32,824 --> 01:34:33,444
That's true.

1958
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:34,924
So you just played into that.

1959
01:34:35,444 --> 01:34:36,504
You just did a gesture.

1960
01:34:36,904 --> 01:34:40,244
You did little circles around your cheeks.

1961
01:34:40,264 --> 01:34:40,324
I did the dimples.

1962
01:34:40,364 --> 01:34:45,524
As if you're drawing Cupie Pie, like rosies on your face.

1963
01:34:45,524 --> 01:34:47,804
Like you're a Raggedy Ann, a Raggedy Andy.

1964
01:34:48,044 --> 01:34:48,704
My favorite.

1965
01:34:48,884 --> 01:34:50,764
Yeah, we all could do to be kinder to ourselves.

1966
01:34:52,744 --> 01:34:56,924
Show yourself some self-love and dress up like Raggedy Andy today.

1967
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:58,844
Take some pictures.

1968
01:34:59,204 --> 01:35:00,764
Feel yourself.

1969
01:35:01,464 --> 01:35:04,264
I did someone posted on our Facebook group.

1970
01:35:04,504 --> 01:35:09,044
I have to make it to that Disneyland auction exhibit in Burbank.

1971
01:35:09,364 --> 01:35:15,104
There is a little sailor suit, cowboy suit kind of thing that says Jason stitched on the back.

1972
01:35:15,104 --> 01:35:15,924
It says Jason?

1973
01:35:16,284 --> 01:35:17,824
What are you talking about?

1974
01:35:17,904 --> 01:35:18,884
You got to buy this.

1975
01:35:18,884 --> 01:35:19,564
I got to bid.

1976
01:35:19,724 --> 01:35:20,504
That's crazy.

1977
01:35:20,604 --> 01:35:21,104
I got to bid.

1978
01:35:21,104 --> 01:35:24,604
I got to try to get the little outfit and get the Choco Menu.

1979
01:35:25,324 --> 01:35:27,524
You need to take it alone.

1980
01:35:28,964 --> 01:35:32,504
Moving on to Crazy Song number four.

1981
01:35:32,884 --> 01:35:35,524
Now we take you to 1992.

1982
01:35:36,524 --> 01:35:42,044
This is still within the atomic bomb blast of Kokomo.

1983
01:35:42,464 --> 01:35:43,924
Mike has full power.

1984
01:35:44,044 --> 01:35:45,864
Never has he been so powerful.

1985
01:35:46,424 --> 01:35:50,284
He is finally able to do for the first time what he's always wanted to do,

1986
01:35:50,284 --> 01:35:53,944
which is his vision of a Beach Boys album.

1987
01:35:54,204 --> 01:35:59,984
And in a post Kokomo era, that means an entire album that sounds like Kokomo,

1988
01:36:01,424 --> 01:36:05,044
which creates this album called Summer in Paradise.

1989
01:36:06,324 --> 01:36:11,564
Would you like to hear 12 songs that are all completely the flavor of Kokomo?

1990
01:36:11,684 --> 01:36:12,664
Are you ready for that?

1991
01:36:12,664 --> 01:36:14,084
And that you have no nostalgia for?

1992
01:36:14,304 --> 01:36:17,724
No, that you have not heard Kermit the Frog sing.

1993
01:36:17,724 --> 01:36:18,124
Yeah.

1994
01:36:18,184 --> 01:36:20,264
There's no weird way to route your feeling.

1995
01:36:20,264 --> 01:36:21,384
You didn't hear it as a baby.

1996
01:36:21,444 --> 01:36:23,264
If you're hearing this for the first time,

1997
01:36:24,124 --> 01:36:26,984
you potentially are in for some trouble with Summer in Paradise.

1998
01:36:28,144 --> 01:36:32,604
Weird fact about this album, it's the first album ever fully done in Pro Tools.

1999
01:36:33,164 --> 01:36:33,544
Really?

2000
01:36:33,764 --> 01:36:34,144
Yes.

2001
01:36:34,444 --> 01:36:38,564
The Beach Boys, Mike Love was an innovator in this regard.

2002
01:36:39,584 --> 01:36:42,444
However, it being probably a weird primitive Pro Tools

2003
01:36:42,444 --> 01:36:45,124
might be why this album sounds like absolute shit.

2004
01:36:46,224 --> 01:36:51,684
If you would like to hear the album, go to Spotify, type in Summer in Paradise,

2005
01:36:52,124 --> 01:36:56,644
then notice that nothing can be found and realize that you have to go to YouTube

2006
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,544
and that is the only place to experience this album.

2007
01:37:00,104 --> 01:37:01,964
Nobody has ever saved it.

2008
01:37:01,984 --> 01:37:06,504
There's a YouTube user, Todd in the Shadows, who did a review of this album that's really funny.

2009
01:37:06,804 --> 01:37:14,384
And he pointed out how you can go find every take the Beach Boys ever did of early music

2010
01:37:14,384 --> 01:37:16,464
from 1961, songs you've never heard.

2011
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,844
Here's take 15, here's take 16.

2012
01:37:19,064 --> 01:37:20,344
That's all on Spotify.

2013
01:37:20,644 --> 01:37:23,944
And yet this is an entire album that cannot be found.

2014
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:26,384
This is the album with Forever on it.

2015
01:37:26,384 --> 01:37:27,624
This is what they were pushing.

2016
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:32,984
And a poster for this album remained in the background on Full House for many years

2017
01:37:32,984 --> 01:37:39,544
when of course Joey and Jesse were the rush hour renegades.

2018
01:37:39,544 --> 01:37:47,864
When they were drive time radio DJs who mostly had 1960s celebrities on like Barry Williams.

2019
01:37:48,784 --> 01:37:55,464
Very high radio ratings in the early 90s in a post-Grunge world.

2020
01:37:56,944 --> 01:38:01,224
The cover of this album looks really like the Rainforest fundraiser t-shirts.

2021
01:38:01,504 --> 01:38:06,084
It looks a lot like the shirt you were wearing in those photos from Kings Dominion.

2022
01:38:06,664 --> 01:38:07,884
Yeah, yeah, very much so.

2023
01:38:07,884 --> 01:38:12,384
No, very like airbr- you could like, you're in Hawaii and you go to an art gallery that's

2024
01:38:12,384 --> 01:38:16,344
all stuff like that and you look around and like, oh kind of cool, how much do these cost?

2025
01:38:16,584 --> 01:38:17,444
$30,000?

2026
01:38:17,884 --> 01:38:19,404
Absolutely not.

2027
01:38:19,924 --> 01:38:25,164
And just to clarify, the Beach Boys are not like Garth Brooks where like none of their music is on

2028
01:38:25,164 --> 01:38:25,604
Spotify.

2029
01:38:25,784 --> 01:38:28,584
Most of their music is on the streaming services.

2030
01:38:28,764 --> 01:38:30,284
Every possible bit of it.

2031
01:38:30,324 --> 01:38:36,104
You talk about Smile, the not really completed Brian Wilson's masterpiece.

2032
01:38:36,344 --> 01:38:41,704
They kind of did it, the one that you had, but like really were relying on like the tapes and

2033
01:38:41,704 --> 01:38:47,024
the were just the raw takes that you can find every bit of that on Spotify and yet Summer in

2034
01:38:47,024 --> 01:38:48,744
Paradise impossible to find.

2035
01:38:49,044 --> 01:38:53,684
I'm going to I'm also going to quote this user Todd in the shadows when he breaks down the two

2036
01:38:53,684 --> 01:38:55,984
types of songs that are on this album.

2037
01:38:57,044 --> 01:39:02,824
His phrasing is you get shit covers and shit Kokomos.

2038
01:39:03,624 --> 01:39:05,044
This is exactly right.

2039
01:39:05,044 --> 01:39:08,824
There is an un-listenable cover of Under the Boardwalk.

2040
01:39:09,804 --> 01:39:11,024
Oh I've heard that I think.

2041
01:39:11,524 --> 01:39:13,304
They kind of were doing this for a little while.

2042
01:39:13,344 --> 01:39:16,784
They would do it live and it had new lyrics for no reason.

2043
01:39:17,084 --> 01:39:18,964
I think I could punch this up.

2044
01:39:19,984 --> 01:39:21,704
Run it through the love pass.

2045
01:39:22,244 --> 01:39:30,024
The nadir of the album and perhaps the entire career of the Beach Boys may be an infamous song

2046
01:39:30,024 --> 01:39:32,184
called Summer of Love.

2047
01:39:32,784 --> 01:39:33,764
You ever heard Summer of Love?

2048
01:39:33,804 --> 01:39:34,884
I think I believe I have.

2049
01:39:34,964 --> 01:39:40,984
Summer of Love is this is really something I might as well say the context the fact that I

2050
01:39:40,984 --> 01:39:48,644
know our friend Doug Jones is very fond of that as pitched as written this song was meant to be a

2051
01:39:48,644 --> 01:39:50,764
duet with Bart Simpson.

2052
01:39:52,064 --> 01:39:54,784
That is what Mike Love envisioned this to be.

2053
01:39:55,624 --> 01:40:03,184
The Simpsons in the early 90s the Simpsons said no no no this is not up to the high water mark of

2054
01:40:03,184 --> 01:40:04,224
Do the Bart Man.

2055
01:40:04,904 --> 01:40:07,924
We will not have Bart perform on Summer of Love.

2056
01:40:08,964 --> 01:40:11,024
So he was left to do it on his own.

2057
01:40:11,104 --> 01:40:16,664
I'm going to play this is not only did they put the song on the album this was the entire song the

2058
01:40:16,664 --> 01:40:23,764
full song was the cold open of an episode of Baywatch an episode in which the Beach Boys later go

2059
01:40:23,764 --> 01:40:26,944
on to act and have scenes with David Hasselhoff.

2060
01:40:26,964 --> 01:40:31,964
So you know I'm very fond of this but this is the song here it is Summer of Love.

2061
01:40:34,524 --> 01:40:39,644
I can't wait to summer cause it's gonna be a Summer of Love.

2062
01:40:40,184 --> 01:40:42,884
Hey now well it's a love thing.

2063
01:40:44,084 --> 01:40:50,684
I'm gonna stop it already Jason that was quite a reaction just to the start.

2064
01:40:51,304 --> 01:40:52,944
I'm loving your glares.

2065
01:40:52,984 --> 01:40:55,644
It sounds like a parody of the Beach Boys.

2066
01:40:55,944 --> 01:41:01,204
Yeah it sounds like a parody of the Beach Boys and also audio filters in general.

2067
01:41:02,104 --> 01:41:07,304
A parody of the idea of running anything through a filter of drum machines.

2068
01:41:07,664 --> 01:41:09,904
We got scratches we got record scratches.

2069
01:41:10,084 --> 01:41:14,764
Every trick that is available at this point in time is on this record.

2070
01:41:15,224 --> 01:41:21,564
I just feel like it seems like they got shafted they got screwed out of money a couple times here

2071
01:41:21,564 --> 01:41:26,024
and there feels like by 1992 they would have been back on short footing.

2072
01:41:26,384 --> 01:41:30,844
I think they are they absolutely are they had a big hit so the tours are making even

2073
01:41:30,844 --> 01:41:33,504
more money than they always have.

2074
01:41:34,384 --> 01:41:39,724
Mike got married and stayed with that wife from that point on so no more new alimony's

2075
01:41:39,724 --> 01:41:41,184
although he ended up with like five.

2076
01:41:41,284 --> 01:41:47,264
I mean yeah he might have a lot of alimony's that might be slightly more practical explanation.

2077
01:41:47,604 --> 01:41:55,524
I guess I just what kind of bumps for me with a lot of these is that like they are retreading

2078
01:41:55,704 --> 01:42:01,404
so many of the same top but such a narrow like somehow Jimmy Buffett has a million albums

2079
01:42:01,404 --> 01:42:08,424
but does seem to find new like oh I haven't ran Balcon shells in a while you know like finds new

2080
01:42:08,424 --> 01:42:09,064
takes.

2081
01:42:09,064 --> 01:42:12,964
It's in the same zone but you're saying it's maybe a new topic in the zone.

2082
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:19,584
Yes no no no he Mike wants to say the same five words how many times can I fit good vibrations

2083
01:42:19,804 --> 01:42:26,744
into a new song you'll hear a familiar one in a second a word that is also the name of one of the

2084
01:42:26,744 --> 01:42:33,704
club Kokomo drinks and wait did I fully clarify that this is a rap song you haven't said that

2085
01:42:33,704 --> 01:42:34,684
you haven't set that up for it.

2086
01:42:34,864 --> 01:42:35,504
Okay okay.

2087
01:42:35,824 --> 01:42:38,684
Now that you know a rap song.

2088
01:42:49,584 --> 01:42:57,844
If you're a girl appreciates her recreation why don't you let me take you on a love vacation.

2089
01:42:57,864 --> 01:43:01,964
Yeah I'll take you to the movies but I'm a fool.

2090
01:43:01,964 --> 01:43:06,664
First I'll get you on the beach or in the swimming pool.

2091
01:43:07,144 --> 01:43:10,444
Doing up to others is the golden rule.

2092
01:43:11,024 --> 01:43:14,464
But doing up with you would be so very cool.

2093
01:43:14,644 --> 01:43:19,004
Girls are always ready for a summer of love.

2094
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:23,184
Goin' out and lookin' for miles are always ready.

2095
01:43:23,804 --> 01:43:27,104
Girls are always ready for a summer of love.

2096
01:43:27,584 --> 01:43:31,004
Goin' out and lookin' for miles are always ready.

2097
01:43:31,244 --> 01:43:36,504
I can't wait to do something because it's gonna be a summer of love.

2098
01:43:36,964 --> 01:43:37,444
Hey now.

2099
01:43:37,484 --> 01:43:39,284
Well it's a love thing.

2100
01:43:41,304 --> 01:43:44,364
Alright alright much to unpack here.

2101
01:43:45,784 --> 01:43:53,004
I think anytime there's gotta be songs that use it well but I feel like it's occasionally an

2102
01:43:53,004 --> 01:43:58,904
indicator of like oh no they're in trouble if they're honing in on the word excitation.

2103
01:43:59,544 --> 01:44:01,024
Excitation well that's what again it's good.

2104
01:44:01,364 --> 01:44:07,304
Good Vibrations was at some point in time before it became the pop song that we know

2105
01:44:07,304 --> 01:44:12,884
Brian was he recorded it over the course of six months like this it was a mess they were

2106
01:44:12,884 --> 01:44:17,384
making Mike record part after part after part he freaked out it's in the movie like I can't

2107
01:44:17,384 --> 01:44:21,904
I'm sick of this I can't do it and he was like we have to bring this back to be like a good

2108
01:44:21,904 --> 01:44:26,264
listenable song with a chorus and then he thought of it and it's I'm picking up Good Vibrations

2109
01:44:26,264 --> 01:44:31,084
she's giving me excitations and that's Mike's doing and I love Good Vibrations.

2110
01:44:31,104 --> 01:44:34,644
I love Good Vibrations and it's very quick the excitation.

2111
01:44:35,204 --> 01:44:40,964
As opposed to saying excitation over and over in songs over the years and naming a

2112
01:44:40,964 --> 01:44:42,444
rum drink after it.

2113
01:44:42,744 --> 01:44:48,664
I guess I really didn't consider that oh the one guy from the Beach Boys is haunted

2114
01:44:48,664 --> 01:44:57,264
but by his own memories like he's haunted by his own success yeah and I guess I've just never

2115
01:44:57,264 --> 01:44:59,664
really processed that before.

2116
01:45:00,344 --> 01:45:06,564
Let me mention the movie Kids in the Hall Brain Candy where the cure for depression ends up being

2117
01:45:07,644 --> 01:45:13,164
your happiest moment is reliving is that you're playing it over and over again and you get stuck

2118
01:45:13,164 --> 01:45:18,604
in it but then you get too stuck in it and everybody ends up in like a weird coma forever.

2119
01:45:18,824 --> 01:45:23,484
That is Mike Love he willingly did it to except he's still popping the pills.

2120
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:35,804
I'm trying to think is there anyone else in popular music and when I say popular music I

2121
01:45:35,804 --> 01:45:40,204
think it's like he's trying to just relive the past in everything he does.

2122
01:45:40,204 --> 01:45:40,924
To this degree?

2123
01:45:41,044 --> 01:45:41,764
I don't think so.

2124
01:45:41,804 --> 01:45:45,264
I don't think so yeah there's the you know there's the Rolling Stones saying let's take

2125
01:45:45,264 --> 01:45:50,404
it back to basics and we're just gonna jam in a garage again but that is not the same as like

2126
01:45:50,404 --> 01:45:59,564
hey but like doing it with you and on the beach and he like he's 50 he is 50 years old doing this

2127
01:46:00,404 --> 01:46:04,064
Let me take you on a love vacation.

2128
01:46:04,364 --> 01:46:06,884
Who? What? Girl? What? Woman?

2129
01:46:07,524 --> 01:46:13,864
And then by the way here's the full context is that the music video which is made by the Baywatch

2130
01:46:13,864 --> 01:46:19,604
crew this is in an episode of Baywatch he's surrounded by Baywatch babes none of the ones

2131
01:46:19,604 --> 01:46:27,084
we know you're not seeing Pam or Yasmeen in there it's a bunch of generic ones in the red suits

2132
01:46:27,684 --> 01:46:32,504
and the rest of the band everybody came along for this including Brian.

2133
01:46:32,504 --> 01:46:38,604
Brian's back again he's in the video and he is wearing like everybody else is in kind of

2134
01:46:38,604 --> 01:46:44,004
beach clothes Brian is wearing black leather he is in the background of most of the shots

2135
01:46:44,004 --> 01:46:50,084
glaring like Jason when he heard the song like there is in the background there is a very angry

2136
01:46:50,084 --> 01:46:55,924
Brian Wilson doesn't understand what this is where he is why it's happening for a lot of it they hand

2137
01:46:55,924 --> 01:47:01,564
him a bass to play and then he's just he's playing a bass like a six-year-old would play a bass he

2138
01:47:01,564 --> 01:47:06,864
doesn't know what he's doing like it's like but just like we kind of like jerking it up and down

2139
01:47:06,864 --> 01:47:13,044
he is not but and he's sitting in a chair too and it's not like a they gave him a director's chair

2140
01:47:13,044 --> 01:47:16,704
like at some point in the shoot it became clear like Brian needs a chair we don't have a chair

2141
01:47:16,704 --> 01:47:21,684
just give him your chair give him your chair he's Brian Wilson wrote God only knows to some respect

2142
01:47:21,864 --> 01:47:25,804
and then of course Stamos is in there too yeah yeah doing his

2143
01:47:25,804 --> 01:47:31,464
Stamos plays the drums in a way that is like do you know that I'm playing the drums I know exactly

2144
01:47:31,464 --> 01:47:37,524
what you're talking about where he leans all the way back to most business he could ever do to play

2145
01:47:37,524 --> 01:47:43,984
the moves that your body does that probably prohibit you from playing the drums very well

2146
01:47:43,984 --> 01:47:48,604
they impede your drumming ability he's still doing it I saw a video from the Hollywood Ball

2147
01:47:48,604 --> 01:47:53,564
shows and he's still that's how we do it we have about like running all around and exploring the

2148
01:47:53,564 --> 01:47:58,184
space something that the Beach Boys can't do because they have difficulty walking because

2149
01:47:58,184 --> 01:48:05,104
they're in their 80s the Brian specifics are really one black leather top and bottom is not

2150
01:48:05,104 --> 01:48:15,144
the most comfortable at Sunrisers on the beach sunset sitting in a chair with holding a bass

2151
01:48:15,144 --> 01:48:20,764
which is usually longer than a guitar like bigger than a guitar it doesn't fit in the chair it's so

2152
01:48:20,764 --> 01:48:27,704
clunky to it's like like having a toddler on you in a plane seat oh god shit climbing on me a lot

2153
01:48:27,704 --> 01:48:34,344
of the clips you've shown us from the late 80s early 90s Mike Love seems to be trying out new hats

2154
01:48:34,344 --> 01:48:39,704
and he's really into turtlenecks which also not ideal for the beach well yeah but in this case

2155
01:48:39,704 --> 01:48:47,844
he's in a big jacket here but he's in Hasselhoff's he's in the official Baywatch bright red lifeguard

2156
01:48:47,844 --> 01:48:54,884
and he's wearing a Baywatch lifeguard hat and this all just happens and then the plot of the

2157
01:48:54,884 --> 01:48:59,784
episode starts like this is never mentioned again this was a hallucination basically there's no

2158
01:48:59,784 --> 01:49:06,744
plot meaning to this Beach Boys music video that breaks out there's also a shot where one of the

2159
01:49:06,744 --> 01:49:11,524
first album covers is all of them holding a surfboard together the five of them and all like

2160
01:49:11,524 --> 01:49:19,064
walking along so they recreate that but they are all 50 now and they are moving so slow they're

2161
01:49:19,064 --> 01:49:24,964
also 50 but 75 because of the way people aged back then yes true yeah yeah because like fifth

2162
01:49:24,964 --> 01:49:30,884
Tom Cruise I know he's an anomaly but still like well again look like people with some energy

2163
01:49:30,884 --> 01:49:37,584
there's a way that you can like sometimes it's cool people because cool people stay in shape and

2164
01:49:37,584 --> 01:49:44,584
you know pursue you know more difficult endeavor but as I said long ago the Beach Boys are not

2165
01:49:44,584 --> 01:49:51,404
cool they are 50 something dorks so of course they and a surfboard is heavy so it's like these five

2166
01:49:51,404 --> 01:49:57,924
you know what'll be cool is if these 50 year old men who have aged worse than 50 all slowly walk

2167
01:49:57,924 --> 01:50:03,984
with a surfboard Wilford Brimley and Cocoon is much more spry than the 50 year old Beach Boys

2168
01:50:03,984 --> 01:50:09,344
I'd say so he'd probably be a better rapper too for sure I that might be the gist of it but let me

2169
01:50:09,344 --> 01:50:14,024
it's hard for me to not play look do I get a lot of enjoyment out of Summer of Love

2170
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:18,144
positive there's probably great songs of theirs I've listened to less than Summer of Love

2171
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:21,224
let me just scan let me make sure I haven't missed any good creepy lines from him

2172
01:50:27,128 --> 01:50:29,928
I'm dreaming, they watching every day.

2173
01:50:30,008 --> 01:50:33,608
Just off the board in Malibu, so fit in USA.

2174
01:50:34,608 --> 01:50:38,168
Girls are always ready for a summer of love.

2175
01:50:38,748 --> 01:50:40,888
Going out and looking for love.

2176
01:50:40,888 --> 01:50:42,228
Girls are always ready.

2177
01:50:42,488 --> 01:50:46,348
Girls are always ready.

2178
01:50:46,668 --> 01:50:52,168
I mean, the way you've always been able to do a Mike Love impression is just as nasal as possible,

2179
01:50:52,168 --> 01:50:54,488
but now he sounds like he's doing an impression of himself.

2180
01:50:54,488 --> 01:50:56,228
Yeah, it sounds like a parrot, it's weird.

2181
01:50:57,028 --> 01:50:59,068
Girls are always ready.

2182
01:50:59,388 --> 01:51:01,508
Now it almost sounds like we're in a fish tank.

2183
01:51:02,128 --> 01:51:03,148
Girls are always ready.

2184
01:51:03,528 --> 01:51:07,268
He's so, I am struck by how old they seem.

2185
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:10,288
They're just so out of it.

2186
01:51:10,348 --> 01:51:12,928
This was 30 years ago.

2187
01:51:13,268 --> 01:51:16,388
Still going, they were at the Hollywood Bowl last night.

2188
01:51:17,468 --> 01:51:20,808
And then, this is truly where I'm looking at.

2189
01:51:21,488 --> 01:51:24,528
This guy embarrassing himself in a leather jacket.

2190
01:51:24,808 --> 01:51:27,928
These are the people who made God Only Knows.

2191
01:51:28,128 --> 01:51:30,288
These are the people behind Caroline No.

2192
01:51:30,608 --> 01:51:34,008
This was not, and that was less than 30 years.

2193
01:51:34,288 --> 01:51:37,708
That was a shorter amount of time than now to this.

2194
01:51:38,208 --> 01:51:42,308
Which again, then Estelle, let's get back to the way, that just happened.

2195
01:51:42,688 --> 01:51:49,068
Anyone who was around that generation, there are ebbs and flows to the quality in the career.

2196
01:51:49,108 --> 01:51:49,948
Of course.

2197
01:51:50,168 --> 01:51:58,068
But, even, I would feel like most artists when you're talking about the early 90s, late 80s, of that caliber, of like your Paul McCartney's, you go,

2198
01:51:58,188 --> 01:52:02,708
you know actually, Flowers in the Dirt's a pretty good album, if you listen to it.

2199
01:52:02,708 --> 01:52:06,988
It might not have been so critically well received at the time, but oh, here's this and this.

2200
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:11,588
The worst it gets is like Harlem Shuffle by the Rolling Stones, that's kind of an embarrassing song.

2201
01:52:11,968 --> 01:52:17,148
But it's still, or you know that Bowie Jagger dancing in the streets is very silly.

2202
01:52:17,148 --> 01:52:19,348
But it was also a hit and fun.

2203
01:52:20,028 --> 01:52:25,808
So all it would, most people, it's just like, well they've kind of lost their cool and it's not the Bowie of low and heroes.

2204
01:52:26,248 --> 01:52:31,268
But you know what, I still let, the Beach Boys, the fall is spectacular.

2205
01:52:31,368 --> 01:52:37,028
And it's the fall from what many people say still is the greatest album ever made.

2206
01:52:37,348 --> 01:52:44,328
And that's, I do find it interesting as opposed to, like of course our, your Buffett fandom and my Beach Boys fandom are close.

2207
01:52:44,328 --> 01:52:46,828
And a lot of the music they've made is close.

2208
01:52:47,128 --> 01:52:54,368
But I'm sorry, no offense, nobody has ever put a Jimmy Buffett album in the top thousand albums ever made.

2209
01:52:54,728 --> 01:52:55,448
Besides you.

2210
01:52:55,628 --> 01:52:56,688
Mm, thousand, hmm.

2211
01:52:56,868 --> 01:53:01,908
If you've, I dare you to find a top thousand albums list with a Jimmy Buffett album in it.

2212
01:53:02,068 --> 01:53:02,128
I'll take a look.

2213
01:53:02,188 --> 01:53:02,568
I'll take a look.

2214
01:53:02,568 --> 01:53:05,908
And I recognize, you might hand my ass to me.

2215
01:53:06,608 --> 01:53:10,308
Ice Board Code and Pink Crustacean has to be on someone's top thousand, I think.

2216
01:53:10,608 --> 01:53:12,528
Well, we, well, so we should define someone.

2217
01:53:12,828 --> 01:53:15,348
We should define what someone means.

2218
01:53:15,348 --> 01:53:17,528
A man of letters, a writer of some kind.

2219
01:53:17,768 --> 01:53:19,668
Perhaps an actual publication.

2220
01:53:19,968 --> 01:53:21,968
Someone had to have been paid to make the list.

2221
01:53:22,048 --> 01:53:25,348
David Frick didn't write a list of a thousand albums with a Jimmy Buffett?

2222
01:53:25,428 --> 01:53:26,028
I'm not sure.

2223
01:53:26,168 --> 01:53:28,348
And look, music critics are annoying, I understand.

2224
01:53:28,808 --> 01:53:32,368
But I'm just saying, it's not a claim you see a lot, the Jimmy Buffett.

2225
01:53:32,788 --> 01:53:36,288
Paul McCartney never said the Jimmy Buffett wrote the greatest song of all time.

2226
01:53:36,928 --> 01:53:39,808
It's like, well you know David Frick, it's like you know, 89 is Here Come The Worm Jets.

2227
01:53:40,448 --> 01:53:44,488
87 is, 88 is Beach House on the Moon by Jimmy Buffett.

2228
01:53:45,208 --> 01:53:48,368
What is the Buffett peel session like?

2229
01:53:49,188 --> 01:53:50,628
Yeah, how do you do with John Thiel?

2230
01:53:50,688 --> 01:53:51,448
Yeah, yeah.

2231
01:53:52,148 --> 01:53:52,548
Yeah.

2232
01:53:53,088 --> 01:53:59,148
But again, this is making me appreciate Jimmy more because he, just in this year, he goes like,

2233
01:53:59,328 --> 01:54:04,068
well, they're writing a lot of songs about seashells, I guess I should switch to pebbles, you know?

2234
01:54:04,488 --> 01:54:11,468
Yeah, he's, I mean, he doesn't have, it's, yeah, he hasn't run the stupid gimmick into the ground as much in a way.

2235
01:54:11,608 --> 01:54:14,208
He succeeds within his lane.

2236
01:54:14,308 --> 01:54:17,088
He stays in it and he's managed to widen the lane.

2237
01:54:17,368 --> 01:54:24,868
And what's weird about the Beach Boys is, it's 1965, 1966, Brian Wilson sees, and they're in their lane,

2238
01:54:24,928 --> 01:54:26,748
Brian Wilson sees an off-ramp.

2239
01:54:26,948 --> 01:54:30,168
He sees an off-ramp to somewhere elevated to a better place.

2240
01:54:30,228 --> 01:54:33,888
And Mike's like, no, absolutely not.

2241
01:54:33,888 --> 01:54:35,368
Back on the road.

2242
01:54:35,368 --> 01:54:37,288
Stay on the road.

2243
01:54:37,768 --> 01:54:45,148
Mike Love is taking the on-ramp to Santa Monica and then the adjacent off-ramp to get back on the on-ramp to Santa Monica.

2244
01:54:45,388 --> 01:54:50,828
To keep, I'm going, we're driving the same mile and then we're doing a U and we're doing it again.

2245
01:54:50,848 --> 01:54:53,228
And we're doing it again.

2246
01:54:54,148 --> 01:55:00,168
That is the insistence that we must stay, we cannot elevate what we're doing.

2247
01:55:00,168 --> 01:55:02,168
That is another interesting point.

2248
01:55:02,468 --> 01:55:05,988
And it's obviously it's because of Brian versus Mike's philosophy.

2249
01:55:06,068 --> 01:55:14,248
But it's almost like Mike is maybe mad that they ever had like pure, pure like artistic success like that.

2250
01:55:14,588 --> 01:55:15,488
Yeah, yeah.

2251
01:55:15,908 --> 01:55:20,668
I mean, I think there was a point where it was all happening at the same time.

2252
01:55:21,108 --> 01:55:29,248
Like this album that's referenced in this rap, Summer Days and Summer Nights, has hits, but it also has like kind of a lush, more emotional.

2253
01:55:29,248 --> 01:55:31,648
But like they were doing all of it at once.

2254
01:55:31,868 --> 01:55:32,488
Yeah, yeah, sure.

2255
01:55:32,488 --> 01:55:33,788
Hits and critics love it.

2256
01:55:33,988 --> 01:55:37,588
And to be honest, Pet Sounds did not sell very well at the time.

2257
01:55:37,588 --> 01:55:39,148
It's gone on to great acclaim.

2258
01:55:39,428 --> 01:55:41,788
But I thought it just it spooked them.

2259
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:44,168
I mentioned the song Heroes and Villains.

2260
01:55:44,248 --> 01:55:48,088
There's a live album they did in 69 where he sets it up by saying, now here's a song.

2261
01:55:48,908 --> 01:55:51,568
We're going to do a song right now that this did great on the charts.

2262
01:55:51,628 --> 01:55:53,128
Yeah, made it to number 40.

2263
01:55:53,868 --> 01:55:57,108
So get ready for a number 40 smash, everybody.

2264
01:55:57,388 --> 01:55:59,368
And then the band is to play the song.

2265
01:55:59,448 --> 01:56:00,108
And it's like, what?

2266
01:56:00,548 --> 01:56:02,708
Why are you shitting on your own?

2267
01:56:03,068 --> 01:56:04,388
Everybody's uncomfortable now.

2268
01:56:04,548 --> 01:56:06,108
No one even laughed at that joke.

2269
01:56:06,788 --> 01:56:07,748
Yeah, he's all business.

2270
01:56:07,828 --> 01:56:08,328
It's a business.

2271
01:56:08,388 --> 01:56:09,428
He's Leno. It's all about.

2272
01:56:09,648 --> 01:56:13,048
Yeah, like, yeah, I left it number one and we're going to keep it number one.

2273
01:56:13,328 --> 01:56:14,148
And then this. But again.

2274
01:56:14,328 --> 01:56:18,748
But now he's been touting for so many years being number one for one week.

2275
01:56:18,868 --> 01:56:20,428
How long ago?

2276
01:56:20,768 --> 01:56:22,708
Thirty five years ago.

2277
01:56:23,628 --> 01:56:24,408
He is still.

2278
01:56:24,568 --> 01:56:31,568
He's stuck in the five minute span of when he was on stage being handed his high school diploma

2279
01:56:31,568 --> 01:56:37,688
and the horror of like, oh, my God, after today, I'm no longer the big fish in the small pond.

2280
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:41,448
When I had the girls or all the babes are screaming for me right now.

2281
01:56:41,448 --> 01:56:45,108
But as soon as I take three steps off this stage, it's all over.

2282
01:56:45,168 --> 01:56:49,888
It's right off the stage into the the failing sheet metal business.

2283
01:56:50,488 --> 01:56:58,628
Yes, that's why we're we're going to see Mike Love hooked up to life support like and ladies and gentlemen,

2284
01:56:58,868 --> 01:56:59,768
the beach boy.

2285
01:56:59,768 --> 01:57:05,948
And then the it takes six people to move his entire mechanism out his bed.

2286
01:57:06,508 --> 01:57:10,348
They think somebody's got a remote and it tilts him up ever so slightly.

2287
01:57:10,348 --> 01:57:13,068
And then they try to dress it up.

2288
01:57:13,068 --> 01:57:15,008
They put like lays on it.

2289
01:57:15,008 --> 01:57:20,488
Maybe they roll it all out on a giant surfboard, a surfboard that can fit a hospital bed.

2290
01:57:20,808 --> 01:57:21,888
And then he will.

2291
01:57:22,268 --> 01:57:23,828
He can't sing by that point.

2292
01:57:23,828 --> 01:57:27,188
So they'll just put a microphone up to a Stephen Hawking computer.

2293
01:57:27,408 --> 01:57:28,768
Yeah, an AI.

2294
01:57:28,768 --> 01:57:33,228
And some loud braggart tries to put me down and say his school is great.

2295
01:57:33,348 --> 01:57:35,808
And it sounds a lot better than he has for the last 20 years.

2296
01:57:36,088 --> 01:57:38,728
Wow. Mike's pipes are working good.

2297
01:57:39,008 --> 01:57:42,468
You are describing Emperor Palpatine.

2298
01:57:42,468 --> 01:57:57,228
On the planet of Mexico, like one of the cooler visuals like I that sticks out from that movie is like Palpatine hooked up to like an HR Giger like contraption.

2299
01:57:57,308 --> 01:58:02,368
Somehow Brian Mike Love has returned the dead speak.

2300
01:58:02,428 --> 01:58:04,888
That's right. The Beach Boys are coming to the Hollywood Bowl.

2301
01:58:05,008 --> 01:58:07,128
Mark McGrath only on July 4th.

2302
01:58:07,188 --> 01:58:08,308
Stamos there for all nights.

2303
01:58:08,368 --> 01:58:09,168
Be there.

2304
01:58:09,328 --> 01:58:13,648
The dead speak and tonight they're covering to do Ron Ron.

2305
01:58:13,688 --> 01:58:17,488
Hey, everybody's old enough to forget we didn't do that one.

2306
01:58:17,588 --> 01:58:19,328
Right. All right. It's going in.

2307
01:58:20,528 --> 01:58:21,808
OK. That's that.

2308
01:58:21,988 --> 01:58:24,008
And there's oh and my chaser for that one.

2309
01:58:24,048 --> 01:58:29,648
If that's the worst song they ever put out, my chaser for that one is my favorite Beach Boys song, Sail on Sailor.

2310
01:58:29,848 --> 01:58:33,568
I even recommend the live version from the in concert album in 1973.

2311
01:58:34,028 --> 01:58:41,928
If there's nothing whiter than Mike Love rapping, then I recommend Sail on Sailor in which they had an actual person of color in the band.

2312
01:58:42,148 --> 01:58:50,888
Two of them. In fact, these guys, Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fetar before Mike Love got his iron grip on the band, they had the South African musicians play with them.

2313
01:58:51,768 --> 01:58:55,548
And it was the only time maybe ever that the Beach Boys were great live.

2314
01:58:55,968 --> 01:59:01,208
Like they actually like to these guys, I think made him great.

2315
01:59:01,208 --> 01:59:04,868
Like where it actually sounded like they sounded like a 70s jam band.

2316
01:59:04,868 --> 01:59:10,028
They did everything with different arrangements and especially Sail on Sailor, one of the best songs Brian ever wrote.

2317
01:59:10,048 --> 01:59:14,548
I love it. There's all these like, you know, Beatles, you go to message boards and fan sites and stuff.

2318
01:59:14,648 --> 01:59:17,928
And it's always like they'll put like all those solo Beatles songs together.

2319
01:59:17,968 --> 01:59:20,548
What if the Beatles had stayed as a group?

2320
01:59:20,548 --> 01:59:27,608
So they'll like put together like fantasy booking, fantasy track lists of solo Beatles like of the same era.

2321
01:59:27,608 --> 01:59:30,608
And they'll fantasize about what would have happened or whatever.

2322
01:59:31,148 --> 01:59:33,188
And this is a little bit more like nebulous.

2323
01:59:33,508 --> 01:59:42,948
But is there like a fan community of like what do the Beach Boys look like if Brian has had like had a little bit more of his sanity and Mike had less control?

2324
01:59:43,108 --> 01:59:45,408
Like is there any do you even think about stuff like that?

2325
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:53,088
I did hear an AI that imagined what if Brian was singing the song Looking Back with Love that I just played you guys.

2326
01:59:53,588 --> 01:59:54,568
So there's that.

2327
01:59:54,568 --> 01:59:59,688
I mean, the thing is, they still OK, Summer in Paradise killed this.

2328
01:59:59,968 --> 02:00:04,908
That album sold that I just played that song from sold less than one thousand copies.

2329
02:00:04,908 --> 02:00:07,388
That was a commercial catastrophe.

2330
02:00:07,748 --> 02:00:10,008
So we had like I'm in charge my way or the highway.

2331
02:00:10,128 --> 02:00:13,368
We're going back to number one. It's an album of all Kokomo's.

2332
02:00:13,428 --> 02:00:14,388
Fuck you, motherfuckers.

2333
02:00:14,608 --> 02:00:18,868
Then they sold one thousand copies and no one saved it for Spotify.

2334
02:00:19,108 --> 02:00:22,968
They didn't record a new album together for over 20 years.

2335
02:00:22,968 --> 02:00:25,468
But they did come back together and make the album.

2336
02:00:25,548 --> 02:00:28,268
That's why God made the radio.

2337
02:00:28,268 --> 02:00:30,528
I saw them perform live on the Jay Leno Tonight Show.

2338
02:00:30,868 --> 02:00:33,808
Oh, yeah, yeah. They did it on Jimmy Fallon, too.

2339
02:00:34,148 --> 02:00:36,808
I kind of like see in Rick Abanio back me up on this one.

2340
02:00:36,808 --> 02:00:38,328
I like some songs on this.

2341
02:00:38,368 --> 02:00:42,268
So if that album might satisfy that there's some garbage on that album for sure.

2342
02:00:42,548 --> 02:00:44,528
But there's a few that are like, well, they went out.

2343
02:00:44,568 --> 02:00:48,188
They went out on a higher note if that's presumably the last album they ever do.

2344
02:00:48,208 --> 02:00:48,908
I hope it's not.

2345
02:00:49,488 --> 02:00:51,528
I would love a little bit more.

2346
02:00:51,528 --> 02:00:54,868
And well, you know, their most recent song, which I'm not going to play,

2347
02:00:55,148 --> 02:01:00,728
they did make a new song during the pandemic called This Too Shall Pass.

2348
02:01:00,868 --> 02:01:03,868
That was like, now we got to wear a mask.

2349
02:01:04,888 --> 02:01:08,868
And then the chorus of it became, let's wrap this up.

2350
02:01:09,048 --> 02:01:16,148
Let's all social social distance so we can get back to having fun, fun, fun in the sun.

2351
02:01:17,128 --> 02:01:21,368
So that might end up being the final Beach Boys song is a song about the fucking pandemic.

2352
02:01:21,608 --> 02:01:30,088
A song about supporting doctors, which at least I Mike Love was on the right side of that issue publicly.

2353
02:01:30,088 --> 02:01:31,688
Yeah, that's behind closed doors.

2354
02:01:31,708 --> 02:01:33,148
It's probably like, boy, that fudge.

2355
02:01:33,368 --> 02:01:37,808
What if we put out a so what if we put out this to the tune of Barbara Ann?

2356
02:01:38,148 --> 02:01:40,828
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, you fudgey fuck.

2357
02:01:41,348 --> 02:01:44,828
This has got to stop. I agree.

2358
02:01:44,868 --> 02:01:49,068
I'm sure Eric will mind if we do a little cover of it.

2359
02:01:49,148 --> 02:01:51,868
Just to change it up for the hunting crowd.

2360
02:01:51,868 --> 02:01:54,548
All right, boys, your rifles still hot.

2361
02:01:54,628 --> 02:01:56,128
OK, all right.

2362
02:01:56,128 --> 02:01:58,708
Here's a song about supporting those cops.

2363
02:01:59,088 --> 02:01:59,528
OK.

2364
02:02:01,368 --> 02:02:04,188
And now to close it out, we've made it to the end.

2365
02:02:04,688 --> 02:02:09,408
And it's where this is where I with a heavy heart, I tell you, that is not the only Beach Boys rap song.

2366
02:02:09,468 --> 02:02:15,988
They had a hit song with the fat boys called Wipe Out.

2367
02:02:15,988 --> 02:02:20,068
There was like a mashup of the song Wipe Out, which was not a Beach Boys song.

2368
02:02:20,328 --> 02:02:22,148
Right. Yeah. But it kind of worked.

2369
02:02:22,308 --> 02:02:24,668
That one actually was a little bit of a hit, strangely.

2370
02:02:25,028 --> 02:02:29,568
But it's not nearly as bad as the one I'm going to play.

2371
02:02:29,648 --> 02:02:31,568
And this whole episode's been shitting on Mike Love.

2372
02:02:32,048 --> 02:02:37,968
But what I can you cannot deny the craziest Beach Boys song ever created has nothing to do with Mike Love.

2373
02:02:38,288 --> 02:02:41,808
This is pure Brian Wilson, although maybe not pure Brian Wilson,

2374
02:02:41,808 --> 02:02:47,768
because this is during the time he was under the vice grip of Dr. Eugene Landy.

2375
02:02:48,508 --> 02:02:55,348
And Eugene Landy and his girlfriend decided it would be a good idea if Brian Wilson did a rap song.

2376
02:02:55,728 --> 02:03:00,828
And at this time, I would like to play you the song Smart Girls.

2377
02:03:17,976 --> 02:03:18,076
I'm fine.

2378
02:03:23,704 --> 02:03:25,704
Wow, this low-catch is so much better than this.

2379
02:03:25,864 --> 02:03:26,504
It is, it is.

2380
02:03:30,104 --> 02:03:30,544
How are you?

2381
02:03:38,968 --> 02:03:41,048
He's put a lot of throat into it.

2382
02:03:41,048 --> 02:03:43,268
I love that one, two, three.

2383
02:03:43,848 --> 02:03:46,528
This is not a well man at this point.

2384
02:03:47,088 --> 02:03:49,348
And this is why it's a bit of a bummer to go out of

2385
02:03:49,348 --> 02:03:51,408
because he's just, look, he got away from it.

2386
02:03:51,468 --> 02:03:54,008
You could see the movie, you could see the junky sec movie.

2387
02:03:54,328 --> 02:03:58,688
He got away, but when he was still in the throes of it,

2388
02:03:58,688 --> 02:04:02,588
he did a song about how all the old songs were about dumb girls.

2389
02:04:02,668 --> 02:04:04,648
You're like, I guess. Was that the mission?

2390
02:04:04,888 --> 02:04:07,248
Is that what Help Me Ronda was about?

2391
02:04:07,648 --> 02:04:08,888
Ronda's a dummy?

2392
02:04:10,388 --> 02:04:15,448
Let me make it to one more, and apologies in advance, apologies for this.

2393
02:04:19,844 --> 02:04:23,444
Legs and breasts, but strictly on a higher plane.

2394
02:04:23,584 --> 02:04:24,244
Did everybody get that?

2395
02:04:24,344 --> 02:04:24,704
No.

2396
02:04:24,804 --> 02:04:26,324
I couldn't really understand that.

2397
02:04:26,344 --> 02:04:29,044
I like hips and legs and breasts!

2398
02:04:29,764 --> 02:04:30,144
No.

2399
02:04:30,404 --> 02:04:30,744
No.

2400
02:04:30,844 --> 02:04:32,524
That is what is said in that.

2401
02:04:33,004 --> 02:04:33,724
That's it.

2402
02:04:34,984 --> 02:04:41,364
They made an insane, absolutely breaking, many, many laws

2403
02:04:41,364 --> 02:04:45,864
psychologist quack made Brian Wilson rap about breasts.

2404
02:04:46,204 --> 02:04:48,864
They didn't even do it in a cheeky way.

2405
02:04:49,064 --> 02:04:49,364
No.

2406
02:04:49,364 --> 02:04:50,584
He said it very clinically.

2407
02:04:50,824 --> 02:04:51,224
Yeah.

2408
02:04:51,224 --> 02:04:51,684
Yeah.

2409
02:04:51,684 --> 02:04:53,804
Or like he's picking out a rotisserie chicken

2410
02:04:53,804 --> 02:04:56,004
at the grocery store.

2411
02:04:56,104 --> 02:04:59,624
I don't think you typically say that in a sexual scenario.

2412
02:05:00,144 --> 02:05:03,364
You probably still are, it's just, it does feel very

2413
02:05:03,364 --> 02:05:05,104
like the name of the body part.

2414
02:05:05,324 --> 02:05:05,644
Right.

2415
02:05:05,804 --> 02:05:06,764
I like breasts!

2416
02:05:06,844 --> 02:05:09,204
Eugene Landy was a doctor, so maybe that's

2417
02:05:09,204 --> 02:05:11,524
sort of how he would refer to things, very clinically.

2418
02:05:11,824 --> 02:05:11,984
Maybe.

2419
02:05:12,204 --> 02:05:13,604
Yeah, this is just a medical thing.

2420
02:05:13,604 --> 02:05:13,884
Yeah.

2421
02:05:14,004 --> 02:05:15,104
What's your favorite movie?

2422
02:05:15,304 --> 02:05:15,804
Norbit.

2423
02:05:16,044 --> 02:05:17,324
What's your favorite body part?

2424
02:05:17,404 --> 02:05:18,284
Breasts!

2425
02:05:18,444 --> 02:05:21,124
I mean, it sounds like a doctor in the sense

2426
02:05:21,124 --> 02:05:23,624
that Matthew Lesko with the question mark suit

2427
02:05:23,624 --> 02:05:25,124
is a financial expert.

2428
02:05:25,664 --> 02:05:29,544
I am amazed you know the name of the question mark man.

2429
02:05:29,864 --> 02:05:32,584
I love obscure facts, and I've never

2430
02:05:32,584 --> 02:05:34,624
thought to learn the name of the question mark man.

2431
02:05:34,864 --> 02:05:37,124
Matthew Lesko, I feel like towards the end,

2432
02:05:37,224 --> 02:05:41,044
and when I say the end, the end of the infomercial,

2433
02:05:41,224 --> 02:05:45,664
like boom, when Comedy Central in the 2000s

2434
02:05:45,664 --> 02:05:48,924
was still showing infomercials in the late morning,

2435
02:05:49,004 --> 02:05:52,964
you know, I feel like he was saying his name a lot more.

2436
02:05:53,224 --> 02:05:55,044
Oh, yeah, you got to keep that brand,

2437
02:05:55,284 --> 02:05:56,764
you know, people are just calling you the question mark

2438
02:05:56,764 --> 02:05:57,024
guy.

2439
02:05:57,304 --> 02:05:57,764
What?

2440
02:05:58,084 --> 02:06:00,184
I got to start saying Matthew Lesko!

2441
02:06:01,604 --> 02:06:04,844
Smart Girls is, look, I get a lot of joy from Summer of Love.

2442
02:06:04,924 --> 02:06:06,884
I don't get a lot of joy from Smart Girls.

2443
02:06:06,884 --> 02:06:10,104
But if I'm listing the five craziest Beach Boys songs,

2444
02:06:10,144 --> 02:06:11,464
that's undeniably it.

2445
02:06:11,984 --> 02:06:13,624
And as penance for that one, you have

2446
02:06:13,624 --> 02:06:15,364
to listen to all of Pet Sounds.

2447
02:06:15,704 --> 02:06:16,804
Just the entire thing.

2448
02:06:17,264 --> 02:06:18,464
Throw a smile in there, too.

2449
02:06:18,524 --> 02:06:21,484
Remember the better times when Brian Wilson was

2450
02:06:21,484 --> 02:06:24,884
vibrant and forward thinking, and before his confidence got

2451
02:06:24,884 --> 02:06:28,104
eroded by a guy who was so insecure that he's

2452
02:06:28,104 --> 02:06:30,384
going to have to go back to the sheet metal factory.

2453
02:06:32,084 --> 02:06:34,364
And that's the journey, guys.

2454
02:06:34,484 --> 02:06:36,964
I appreciate you taking it with me.

2455
02:06:37,024 --> 02:06:40,724
I know it was a long trip, but how do I sum up the Beach Boys?

2456
02:06:41,344 --> 02:06:44,604
When it's something I could do for an entire weekly podcast,

2457
02:06:44,664 --> 02:06:46,344
tried to fit it within this.

2458
02:06:46,704 --> 02:06:50,324
And I'll take it as a birthday gift,

2459
02:06:50,384 --> 02:06:53,744
getting to play all of the worst songs the Beach Boys ever made

2460
02:06:53,744 --> 02:06:55,624
for you guys and for you the listeners.

2461
02:06:55,684 --> 02:06:57,244
I still love Sloop Jon B.

2462
02:06:57,544 --> 02:06:58,624
I really like that song.

2463
02:06:58,624 --> 02:07:00,924
Well, that's right in the middle of Pet Sounds.

2464
02:07:01,244 --> 02:07:02,544
It's a fantastic one.

2465
02:07:03,724 --> 02:07:05,044
There's so many great treasures.

2466
02:07:05,804 --> 02:07:08,144
If all this is done is dissuade you from listening

2467
02:07:08,144 --> 02:07:10,344
to more Beach Boys, then I couldn't blame you.

2468
02:07:10,784 --> 02:07:13,404
Please let me say, that era of underlooked music

2469
02:07:13,404 --> 02:07:15,584
is just so magical.

2470
02:07:15,704 --> 02:07:16,844
I love the Wilson brothers.

2471
02:07:16,944 --> 02:07:19,864
I love stuff that Mike's done, too.

2472
02:07:21,004 --> 02:07:23,184
Hey, I'm glad he got him cooking.

2473
02:07:23,504 --> 02:07:27,184
I'm glad he had bills to pay, and he pushed Brian

2474
02:07:27,184 --> 02:07:30,144
to use his incredible musical abilities.

2475
02:07:30,404 --> 02:07:30,724
Yeah.

2476
02:07:31,444 --> 02:07:36,644
It's a real journey, and every band has a lot of story up

2477
02:07:37,184 --> 02:07:39,064
and downs, but man, this one.

2478
02:07:39,564 --> 02:07:42,564
Because what are you, Beach Boys top 10 bands of all time,

2479
02:07:42,564 --> 02:07:44,084
you would say, probably?

2480
02:07:44,084 --> 02:07:46,084
Well, to me, it depends on who you ask.

2481
02:07:46,084 --> 02:07:47,204
To you, to him, 20 people would put.

2482
02:07:47,204 --> 02:07:48,304
To my wife, no.

2483
02:07:48,704 --> 02:07:50,784
The big Aaron and I's biggest disagreement.

2484
02:07:51,344 --> 02:07:52,944
Because when I say, what do you like about them?

2485
02:07:53,004 --> 02:07:54,464
I love the blend.

2486
02:07:54,504 --> 02:07:55,404
I love the harmonies.

2487
02:07:55,464 --> 02:07:56,644
I just love hearing them together,

2488
02:07:56,684 --> 02:07:57,764
even if it is Kokomo.

2489
02:07:57,984 --> 02:07:58,884
I love hearing those voices.

2490
02:07:58,984 --> 02:08:01,484
And she's like, that's exactly what I hate about them.

2491
02:08:01,644 --> 02:08:03,644
I hate their dumb voices.

2492
02:08:03,804 --> 02:08:08,324
And yet we've managed to make a marriage work in spite of this.

2493
02:08:08,624 --> 02:08:09,784
James Carville and his wife.

2494
02:08:09,804 --> 02:08:10,624
What's his wife's name?

2495
02:08:10,944 --> 02:08:12,484
They're conservative, and one's a conservative.

2496
02:08:12,624 --> 02:08:16,664
Well, or it's a lot like Cheryl Hines and RFK

2497
02:08:16,664 --> 02:08:18,044
Jr., our next president.

2498
02:08:18,324 --> 02:08:19,304
That's true.

2499
02:08:19,684 --> 02:08:21,764
First Lady Cheryl Hines.

2500
02:08:21,764 --> 02:08:24,744
I mean, you've got to vote for him just to see that.

2501
02:08:24,924 --> 02:08:26,244
What, are they going to give an address,

2502
02:08:26,244 --> 02:08:28,564
and then the curb theme is going to play?

2503
02:08:28,564 --> 02:08:31,684
The new national anthem, everyone.

2504
02:08:31,844 --> 02:08:32,984
Bump, bump, bump.

2505
02:08:33,104 --> 02:08:33,724
That's it.

2506
02:08:33,764 --> 02:08:35,224
So that's why I'm voting for him.

2507
02:08:35,304 --> 02:08:35,764
Sure.

2508
02:08:36,564 --> 02:08:39,124
I have one question at this point just before we leave.

2509
02:08:39,524 --> 02:08:41,124
Mike and I have taken our birthday shots.

2510
02:08:41,584 --> 02:08:44,764
I am so curious what Jason's birthday shot is.

2511
02:08:44,884 --> 02:08:47,644
So do you have any idea, is anything percolating?

2512
02:08:48,404 --> 02:08:49,404
Yeah.

2513
02:08:49,564 --> 02:08:50,724
You don't have to spoil it.

2514
02:08:50,984 --> 02:08:51,964
I have been thinking about it.

2515
02:08:52,624 --> 02:08:55,204
I mean, I don't think scheduling would work out,

2516
02:08:55,304 --> 02:08:57,624
because Mike kept saying the phrase Jason month,

2517
02:08:57,704 --> 02:08:59,444
and I was like, oh, what chaos.

2518
02:08:59,804 --> 02:09:01,704
What chaos that would be.

2519
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:03,844
But maybe, maybe.

2520
02:09:05,064 --> 02:09:06,304
You mean maybe you'll do one?

2521
02:09:06,524 --> 02:09:08,944
No, no, maybe I have one in mind

2522
02:09:08,944 --> 02:09:10,784
in terms of a birthday shot.

2523
02:09:10,884 --> 02:09:13,044
Okay, okay, I am so, so curious.

2524
02:09:13,404 --> 02:09:14,944
Is there any way you could tease it?

2525
02:09:14,984 --> 02:09:16,564
Is there one word that's like a-

2526
02:09:16,564 --> 02:09:18,224
I mean, it'll probably be something

2527
02:09:18,224 --> 02:09:19,744
Islands of Adventure based.

2528
02:09:20,464 --> 02:09:21,704
That was what I thought.

2529
02:09:21,764 --> 02:09:24,324
I did think, we use this as an excuse

2530
02:09:24,324 --> 02:09:26,584
to go off the theme park map

2531
02:09:26,584 --> 02:09:28,084
and talk about something different,

2532
02:09:28,084 --> 02:09:29,564
and I was like, I bet Jason will be the one

2533
02:09:29,564 --> 02:09:30,964
who takes it right back to being brave.

2534
02:09:30,984 --> 02:09:32,884
I wanna go to the real heads.

2535
02:09:33,244 --> 02:09:34,724
Is yours gonna be just,

2536
02:09:34,944 --> 02:09:36,784
guys, we're doing port of entry again,

2537
02:09:37,184 --> 02:09:38,844
and you all shut the fuck up,

2538
02:09:39,004 --> 02:09:41,984
you don't make fun of this, you don't make fun of me.

2539
02:09:42,904 --> 02:09:47,064
No, I think, I have therapy for like,

2540
02:09:47,124 --> 02:09:48,764
you don't make fun of me, you don't say,

2541
02:09:49,144 --> 02:09:52,044
I mean, like I see a professional to get that anger out.

2542
02:09:52,644 --> 02:09:54,344
Wait a minute, does that mean you used to-

2543
02:09:54,344 --> 02:09:55,144
Wait. Dr. Landy Jr.

2544
02:09:56,104 --> 02:09:57,884
Oh yeah, I see Dr. Landy.

2545
02:09:58,364 --> 02:09:59,844
He dropped me off.

2546
02:10:00,784 --> 02:10:01,364
Landy Jr.

2547
02:10:02,524 --> 02:10:04,284
Wait, did you go to, did you talk,

2548
02:10:04,584 --> 02:10:06,684
I'm not allowed to know about things in therapy, I know,

2549
02:10:06,884 --> 02:10:07,964
but did you go to therapy,

2550
02:10:08,284 --> 02:10:09,804
and were you at all upset about what happened

2551
02:10:09,804 --> 02:10:10,904
in the port of entry episode?

2552
02:10:10,904 --> 02:10:12,104
Oh no, no, come on.

2553
02:10:12,104 --> 02:10:13,544
Because that's what the listeners thought.

2554
02:10:13,824 --> 02:10:14,844
They were sure of it.

2555
02:10:15,524 --> 02:10:16,964
Jason's gonna head into a dark,

2556
02:10:17,124 --> 02:10:18,764
Jason's gonna become Brian Wilson

2557
02:10:18,764 --> 02:10:20,364
and stay in bed for three years

2558
02:10:20,364 --> 02:10:21,844
after what they did to him

2559
02:10:21,844 --> 02:10:23,864
in that island in the port of entry episode.

2560
02:10:24,004 --> 02:10:26,924
I think it adds to the funniness,

2561
02:10:26,924 --> 02:10:28,944
and that adds to the appeal of the area

2562
02:10:28,944 --> 02:10:31,104
that there used to be a painting

2563
02:10:31,104 --> 02:10:34,664
of Seagram's seven-crown whiskey bottle

2564
02:10:34,664 --> 02:10:36,744
that was like as tall as I was.

2565
02:10:36,764 --> 02:10:37,644
That's what I'm saying.

2566
02:10:37,744 --> 02:10:39,664
You had fun, we had fun,

2567
02:10:39,704 --> 02:10:41,744
but people were very concerned about you.

2568
02:10:41,784 --> 02:10:44,664
People thought, this is his Brian moment.

2569
02:10:44,684 --> 02:10:47,964
I do appreciate it, but I am here to tell everyone,

2570
02:10:48,284 --> 02:10:50,804
like, oh, that shit from like the last five, 10 years

2571
02:10:50,804 --> 02:10:53,124
about comedy being important, comedy being true,

2572
02:10:53,564 --> 02:10:56,764
don't, it's not, don't take it so seriously.

2573
02:10:56,964 --> 02:10:59,524
You just jumped miles down the road.

2574
02:11:00,124 --> 02:11:03,504
I think there's so much where people now are like,

2575
02:11:03,504 --> 02:11:07,284
oh, comedy, it's so devastating, it's so, so.

2576
02:11:07,284 --> 02:11:09,644
Well, I think they were saying

2577
02:11:09,644 --> 02:11:12,984
they should have let Jason talk about the window gags more,

2578
02:11:13,284 --> 02:11:14,464
and now you've made it that.

2579
02:11:14,464 --> 02:11:14,804
Oh, I see.

2580
02:11:15,564 --> 02:11:17,584
I misunderstood, I'm sorry, I misunderstood.

2581
02:11:17,584 --> 02:11:19,244
Folks, you need to adjust your thinking

2582
02:11:19,244 --> 02:11:21,744
about what comedians are and what comedians do.

2583
02:11:21,744 --> 02:11:24,984
Very petty and bullshit is what I was saying.

2584
02:11:24,984 --> 02:11:26,904
I have more fun with it.

2585
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:30,484
But no, I didn't care about talking about that.

2586
02:11:30,504 --> 02:11:33,804
We did plenty of talking about that stuff.

2587
02:11:34,384 --> 02:11:35,084
That's what I thought.

2588
02:11:35,124 --> 02:11:36,364
Well, you've heard it here first, folks.

2589
02:11:36,524 --> 02:11:40,944
Jason is back, he's doing just as well as before.

2590
02:11:41,744 --> 02:11:46,504
Let's get back to having fun, fun, fun on the shore.

2591
02:11:46,544 --> 02:11:47,384
Oh, okay.

2592
02:11:48,304 --> 02:11:49,764
Hey, that's it, you survived.

2593
02:11:50,024 --> 02:11:52,424
Keep it tuned here up to Club 3

2594
02:11:52,424 --> 02:11:54,424
if you wanna hear the episode we were just talking about,

2595
02:11:54,424 --> 02:11:57,064
and keep it tuned to podcast The Red Second Gate

2596
02:11:57,064 --> 02:11:59,824
for Jason's birthday shot, which is when?

2597
02:12:00,644 --> 02:12:03,784
October 4th is my birthday, so somewhere around then.

2598
02:12:03,804 --> 02:12:05,104
Hey, it's spooky month, though.

2599
02:12:05,244 --> 02:12:06,364
Maybe I'll try to tie it in.

2600
02:12:06,564 --> 02:12:07,624
You could take it spooky.
