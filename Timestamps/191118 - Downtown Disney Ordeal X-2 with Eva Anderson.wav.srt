1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
One, two, ready.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There was darkness on the street, Ralph Brennan, he had won.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He summoned the power of his jazz, and the podcast boys were done.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now we're in the underworld, and I can't lie we're scared.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Ghosts of stores are all around, like the ruins of a builder bear.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The downtown Disney ordeal, a shuttered hog and does how must Jason feel?

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The downtown Disney ordeal, what ghastly secrets does the house of blues conceal?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is podcast the ride, the second gate, the downtown Disney ordeal, level X, stage two.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're staying strong, we're surviving, I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson's here, Jason Sheridan hasn't quit yet.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Still in the underworld.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We're still in the underworld, things got pretty hairy yesterday as you heard.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, I did not do any dip with Nick Mundy.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I wanted to, and I texted him later, I would have done the dip with you afterward, and he said I know.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And then I tried to get him to go to a Steve Miller band concert with me in Vegas.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Like that day?

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, like in a few days, and he goes, any other weekend.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Which I still don't believe, but still it was a nice thought.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That would have been a hell of a place to dip.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He has a baby, but he called me then he goes, I was looking at ticket prices for a Steve Miller band.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's no other way you could see Steve Miller, but the rarely seen in public Steve Miller band.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, so anyway, we're surviving, I'm thriving in a way, I guess.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, and I guess we just got to see what's in store for this.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's the thing with these episodes, we don't know where exactly we're going yet.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We were surprised to see Mundy, and I guess it's a question of who we'll run into next down here.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Boys, boys.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Wait, was that the Sector Keeper?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Wait, that was familiar.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't think it was though.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, okay, let's follow the voice.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wait, behind all these destroyed RC cars.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Behind this stack of custom RC cars, move them out of the way.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh my God, it's Eva.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Guys, it's me.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Eva Anderson.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh my God, I've been down here.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We've been so worried about you.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You just disappeared at the end of level one stage three.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I got kidnapped by Nick Valenti.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's what we thought, we knew it.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh my God, yeah, well, that was absolutely crazy.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We did battle with him right after that.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh my God.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I think he's not going to be a problem anymore.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think we can set you free.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But he banished you.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Right?

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is where he sent you.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He sent me down here.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I've been in the basement of the ghost of the Norton Simon Museum restaurant.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He's been feeding me thousand calorie gratins.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh no.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Trying to fatten me up.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is it gratin?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Was I saying it wrong?

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Jeffrey Epstein is here.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh no.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What?

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We thought this was the Underwhirl.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He took me out.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is the Underwhirl, I guess.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He made me go on the Lolita Express, the Ghost Lolita Express, and so it's true about me

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
now.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh no.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He made the story of the QAnon story real.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh no.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Jesus.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Underground Lolita Express, the trained version.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh no.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And on the other one.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh my God.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
One S. Eva's been on there.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If I go back to the planet Earth, then it'll be true.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
QAnon will be right about me.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh my God.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Then you'll owe that lady an apology on Twitter.

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The worst thing you could have to do, apologize to a QAnon member.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There must be a way we can reverse this though.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There must be.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There's got to be, and get you back up there so you can make that apology as soon as possible.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She deserves an apology.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
She really does.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
My father was a warlock.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes, well that was never in question.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The time you hadn't been on the Lolita Express, but now you, how was it?

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Did you have a good time?

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh yeah, they have like a, it's actually catered by Patina.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, wonderful.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The food was fantastic.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
As many gold lip bars as you want.

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And then my granny gave me a foot rub.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, okay.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's upside down the Lolita Express.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Turn about his fair play here in the underworld.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh yeah, you're holding a drawing you did of your favorite characters, Homer and Bart.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, those are my favorite characters.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He signed it.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He said, thanks for letting me touch your beautiful feet, he said.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm going to go to Gelada and distract the wait staff so no one else can be served.

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's what he said to me.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Give them a photo of Homer and Bart too, their favorite characters.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, well there's got to be a way we can bust you out of here.

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And if I had to guess, it probably involves something that the Sector Keeper knows.

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Probably continuing to talk about the Fallen Brothers.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think thoroughly discussing and reviewing the Fallen Brothers will get you free.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The Fallen Brothers, you mean all these closed shops?

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It must be.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It must be.

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, let's find out to what end and how many. Sector Keeper, where are we going today?

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Boys, boys, today's stage contains Ride Makers, Build-A-Bear, D Street, Disney Vault 28,

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Fossil, Star Abilias, Club Libby Lou, Studio Disney 365, Anna and Elsa's Boutique,

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Basin, Compass Books, Islands Charters, Kits and Kids, Haagen-Dazs, Blink by Wet Seal,

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Little Mismatched, Apricot Lane Boutique, and Anne Geddes. Good luck, boys!

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Jesus Christ. That went on and on.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Guys, it's too many.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's a lot.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's staggering.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Fuck, the last one was only like four and we ignored most of them.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Normally I'd say we could skip some of them, but we have to rescue Eva and find the Level Keeper.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's going to be longer than Dogpatch.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, it could be. There's definitely a risk of that, but I had a feeling that down here we were going to encounter an extremely long time.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I knew that we were going to face some weight and some rambling, so I thought there's got to be a way to keep us in line.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So on the way down to the Underworld, I downloaded a special alarm app. We don't have to stick with it exactly,

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
but it will let us know when we've been talking about something for five minutes.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm not going to have a hard cut off, but I think it'll be good that it reminds us that five minutes is a long time.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If we truly did more than five minutes about all of these topics, we would be here forever.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The reason I downloaded this specific app is because you can put a custom sound on it.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I was trying to do this off of a podcast episode, but it wasn't clean enough.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
There is a sound that I've been obsessed with since it occurred, and I want a clean version of it.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The sound is from our recent Castle Cake episode. Jason was talking about gnawing,

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and I was hoping you could recreate the sound that I enjoyed so much, the sound of gnawing.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Would you be willing to make this the alarm? So when we hear the gnawing, then we know that it's time to move on.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So here we go. Hopefully this will record fairly cleanly.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay, here we go. And three, two, one.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Wait, I missed it. Okay, here we go.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, how does that sound?

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay, great. So that will let us know after five minutes.

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now, how do we turn the rules here? Say we were supposed to be talking about the Disney Vault 28,

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and we went off on a five-minute Kevin Spacey tangent, and we haven't even discussed Disney Vault 28.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Does that count as the Disney Vault time?

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Uh-oh, I hadn't accounted for tangents. I don't think this app has any information.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You've got to save it for the Patreon guys.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I appreciate keeping us on track, but whatever it takes.

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Whatever it takes to get us out of this underworld.

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, and if tangents are the way.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, I don't know. I think it does. I think as soon as the store is said, it will be on me to start the...

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And again, we don't have to stop. I don't want to cut off good coverage.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I just want the sound of gnawing to let us know we've been talking about something for an ungodly moment.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I like it.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay, so thanks for recreating the gnaw. Let's kick into it right now with Ride Makers.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Ride Makers, okay. Timer started.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Ride Makers was sort of like Build-A-Bear, but for RC cars.

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And Build-A-Bear is kind of like Ride Makers, but for Teddy Bears.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Does that make sense?

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Did you guys know?

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, I got it. Yes.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That since they closed at Downtown Disney, that the only existing locations for rides are in Pigeon Forge, Branson, Myrtle Beach, and Destin, Florida.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
God's country.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So they're all like spinning distance, a very interesting, some Christian...

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
All theme park, all weird, the home of Hard Rock Park.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You could take your rides to the Yakov Smirnov What A Country breakfast show at Branson.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, we haven't done that.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The magnetic trays that stick to your table.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, does it have that?

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Your seat has like a lecture hall, a college lecture hall, it's a swing out...

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Have you been to Branson?

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No, I haven't. I've just seen video where he talks about the magnetic tray.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I want to go.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I want to go. I want to see. I don't know. He might not be doing it anymore, but I want to see Barry Williams is like hits of the 70s show.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, man. Let's go to Branson and then we go to Dollywood.

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay. I mean, yeah, we have not cracked how to do Dollywood.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Dollywood is a frequently talked about topic, but we got I think we have to go there.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I almost went there by myself over New Year's, but I couldn't figure out how to do it.

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's complicated.

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah, it's hard to get there.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Pigeon Forge isn't exactly...

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Do we have enough listeners around there to get them to do like come to a live show around Pigeon Forge?

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's a good excuse.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Maybe that's it. Or Branson. Is there a theater in Branson? Are we too dirty for Branson?

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We might have to clean it up. Yeah.

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Honestly, we could clean it up easily.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You could review stuff in Branson and then...

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah.

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, that'd be so fun.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's definitely fun. And then we and of course, we can visit one of the remaining ride makers because I didn't get to do this.

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You didn't get to. I chose not to do this when it was there.

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Even though I was here. What was it? You build your own remote control car.

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, you built a car and for an extra 20 bucks, you could make it remote control.

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So you just wanted a car and they had licensing. So you could build like there was Marvel in DC, Disney's cars, of course.

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But then apparently they had agreements with Dodge and Ford and GM. So like, I guess you can make a Mustang sort of thing.

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Do you guys like remote controlled things?

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, Rex is remote controlled over there.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I used to do this thing where I'd drive around a parking lot, controlling a remote control car from our real big car.

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's fun.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That was a lot of fun. I forget why, but we called the little car Ruben's Speed and the name of the game was Ruben's Speed.

198
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's like try to not run over your own car.

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, yeah, which we did not. We never because you can never play again if you if you run over it.

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, that's really fun. It was a blast. Yeah, extremely. You need a really open space.

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think we did like take it onto a regular road once and almost get in some trouble.

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There are some neighbors who were glaring at us.

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
These are some questions that are from the FAQ.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Right. What is Ride Makers?

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
TM. Ride Makers is a fun car customizing experience where kids with a Z from four to one oh four create cool one of a kind rides.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Who owns Ride Makers? Ride Makers is privately held by a group of investors.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Sweet. Whoa, that's radical.

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And then I didn't understand this one.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Will Ride Makers accept Build-A-Bear Workshop coupons, gift cards or points?

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Build-A-Bear Workshop stuff for stuff club reward certificates may not be redeemed at Ride Makers shops, locations or Ride Makers dot com.

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You may not earn stuff for stuff club points for my purchases.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Build-A-Bear Workshop coupons and or gift cards cannot be redeemed at Ride Makers.

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Like are people trying to do this all the time?

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Because it doesn't seem like the same people own both things.

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Even though we should explain the Ride Makers at Denon Disney was on the bottom floor of and Build-A-Bear was on top.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So I guess I didn't even realize they were affiliated companies.

217
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
They were sick of people trying to use their Build-A-Bear stuff first stuff points to get rides.

218
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Having enough like write an FAQ and I assume everyone.

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just put it on the website.

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, everyone read the FAQs before coming in the store. Guaranteed.

221
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
People got confused because the signs were so close to each other they'd wander into the wrong one and try to use a gift card they got.

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You make toys. My kid wants to make a toy, custom toy.

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And they would like build it the whole thing first and then get to the register and put down the wrong card.

224
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The Build-A-Bear card?

225
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Could you put a Ride Makers motor in a Build-A-Bear bear?

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And just have it roll around on the ground?

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah, sure.

228
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Just flop around like a fish.

229
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Drive a bear around.

230
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Like it's having a seizure?

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah.

232
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Probably.

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This is one of the only things that I wish I kind of had made a rides when I was reading about it.

234
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was like, oh, that'd be fun to have a rides.

235
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You didn't want to make a rides.

236
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I thought about it for about 10.

237
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There was a rrrr.

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We got it.

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Again, doesn't mean we have to move on.

240
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's just letting us know the.

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you have anything else you want to say about rides?

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I also wish I had made a rides.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It does look like fun.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Honestly, I don't even know that I ever went in.

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I went into Build-A-Bear a decent amount of times and never built anything.

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But I feel like I never went in the ride maker.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
When you go in and not.

248
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, I wanted to see what new outfits they had for the bears.

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
As you know, I have.

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There's a whole controversy because Duffy, some people put Duffy in Build-A-Bear clothes.

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh, that's weird.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And for a while when they were pushing Duffy in the park, Build-A-Bear was active.

253
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So you had your choice of customizable bear options.

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, and it was controversial.

255
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
A lot of people didn't agree with it.

256
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I didn't do it, by the way.

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I just was interested.

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's like, that's an affront to God.

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's trying to mate a dog and a cat.

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes, yes, it's playing God.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
To put your Duffy.

262
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes, to play to place your Duffy in Build-A-Bear clothes was against the Duffy message board.

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
A lot of the people really had strong feelings about it.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But he fits, they fit each other?

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They were around the same size.

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And also, I think Disney was trying to get in on the Build-A-Bear action with Duffy.

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, as well with all the outfits and stuff.

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The Duffy message board seems super chill.

269
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Just like a rad place to hang.

270
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It is about 30 of the angriest people.

271
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Really? Is it on Reddit? Is it subreddit? Where is it?

272
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll send you the link.

273
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay, I want it.

274
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's so micro-focused that I don't even want to say where it is.

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
How active? Still active?

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Still pretty active.

277
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
There was one central figure who was, I read a little bit of his work on the Duffy episode.

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The gaudy of the worst stuff.

279
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The gaudy of the, and he is, honestly, he is less active recently.

280
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So I wonder if he's fallen out of love with it.

281
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But he was the one who was getting on everyone's ass for not spreading the gospel of Duffy.

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We are not doing enough work.

283
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Did you ever do a thing where you like search just generally for whatever his screen name is and see if he's on any other boards on other topics?

284
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes, but he had Duffy in his name.

285
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So I think he had a Duffy-specific name.

286
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay. And you never got his first Christian name?

287
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Clarence Dufferman.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I need to know everything about this guy.

289
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't believe so. I went really deep on the message boards though.

290
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And I really got some of his backstory.

291
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And it really like, it did, you know, it was like Magneto in X-Men.

292
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's like a tragic upbringing.

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And I started feeling bad about it.

294
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I started getting a full picture of him and his...

295
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Might have made him a Duffy tyrant.

296
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah. And it was a simple, he was a sympathetic villain.

297
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's Todd Phillips's next movie.

298
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh man. He's a... He's a pill Duffy man.

299
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes.

300
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
By the way, did any of that count as the start of the timer for...

301
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
For Build-A-Bear?

302
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I think we should start it.

303
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Alright, let's start it now.

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Start Build-A-Bear now.

305
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Great.

306
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm going to put it in my shirt pocket so the audience can hear the rubber.

307
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's good.

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Build-A-Bear again. I never bought anything in Build-A-Bear.

309
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But the idea of it is really good.

310
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's a really good idea.

311
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The only thing that's a little morbid is that you are actually stuffing your bear.

312
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Which I find odd.

313
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Taking its skin, putting it on a tube.

314
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes. You would literally go get loose skin from your bear and stuff it.

315
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You could decide how stuffed you want it to be.

316
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yes, you could make him extra stuffed.

317
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Like if you want to make him a bladder bear or a stuffy bear.

318
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Could you just keep the skin loose?

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Well...

320
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Like a bear rug?

321
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's a good question.

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why so?

323
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Would they just sell you a loose skin of a bear?

324
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Too weird.

325
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No way.

326
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You could just have like ten of them and just put them out like the little rugs around.

327
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Or they could be rugs for your other characters, your other stuffed animals.

328
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Like your stuffed animals, your Duffy sits on a Build-A-Bear's flesh.

329
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's like the flesh of his enemy.

330
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's like he killed and disemboweled his enemy.

331
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Then you could stuff it with like anything.

332
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, a newspaper.

333
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We did this thing in college.

334
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
We bought a pinata and then we went to the 32nd Street Market by USC and just bought all this organ meat.

335
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It was an Elmo pinata and we just filled it with meat.

336
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Then we convinced a birthday guy who was drunk to break it open.

337
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh no.

338
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It was full of meat.

339
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Literally like tubes?

340
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah, like hearts and livers and stuff.

341
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But it was funny too because we couldn't hang him up because he was all damp and heavy.

342
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So he just like was sitting under a street light out on the street, like under a pool of light.

343
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Then we gave the guy, our friend, a bat and we're like, do it.

344
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Go to town.

345
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Then the meat came out.

346
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's something you could do with a loose Build-A-Bear's skin is put meat in it.

347
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Again, your college experience, very different.

348
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You could drive around throwing Build-A-Bears full of meat at people.

349
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, that's a fucked up thing to do.

350
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Have you ever written meat pinata into a script?

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, and I don't know why.

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I've got to put that in something.

353
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Prior patch season two, meat pinata.

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
They had Ninja Turtle Build-A-Bears, which I was very excited to see.

355
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Can you still order those?

356
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, they still have Build-A-Bears.

357
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So it's a good question if they're still on the website or they're still in the stores.

358
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Did you guys know about in 2018, Build-A-Bear held an event in the United States and Canada

359
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
where patrons could pay their child's age for a bear?

360
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't know.

361
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This attracted massive numbers of people, overwhelming the franchise stores.

362
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Shopping malls where Build-A-Bear franchises were located.

363
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is from the Wikipedia.

364
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The event prompted a surge in public awareness of the Build-A-Bear brand, according to a subsequent poll,

365
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
nearly all of which was negative.

366
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That happened last year.

367
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh my God.

368
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Also, did you guys know this, that Build-A-Bear is starting an in-house production entity this year?

369
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I did not know that.

370
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Build-A-Bear entertainment.

371
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
From Chicken Soup for the Soul.

372
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh, guys.

373
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So Build-A-Bear entertainment.

374
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The first planned movie is to be called the Honey Girls movie.

375
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Everyone get your packets ready.

376
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There's two movies in development for the Hallmark Channel.

377
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yikes.

378
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Wow, of course.

379
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
A movie where built bears hang out.

380
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's interesting.

381
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I think they definitely had a split from Disney because I can't find any of the Marvel characters that they used to have.

382
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The bears would be able to dress up as Marvel and now it's DC on Build-A-Bear website.

383
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And you can get Joker Bear.

384
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What?

385
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes, here, let me show you.

386
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But where?

387
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Here he is, Joker Bear.

388
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh, he's a little pal.

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He's a little pal.

390
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
He's pretty cute.

391
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
He has green hair and he has ha ha ha written on his face.

392
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So he's kind of like the Jared Leto.

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
He's got a tattoo.

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Do you want to know how I got these stuffings?

395
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And a condom full of stuffings to his friend.

396
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
On eBay it's $180 for one for a Build-A-Bear Joker.

397
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Wow.

398
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And then there's a bear and I don't know if I'm wrong about this.

399
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There's a bear that's just wearing glasses and he has a jeans and a t-shirt.

400
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And I just looked at him and I immediately thought, oh, it's Jim Gaffigan.

401
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh, yeah.

402
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.

403
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah.

404
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
He's kind of an emo bear.

405
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Pleasant, well doughy.

406
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I've never been inside a Build-A-Bear, but now I kind of want to go.

407
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I haven't either.

408
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I mean, I appreciate how it was a little Chuck E. Cheese-ish and as a kid I would have really.

409
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Uh-oh.

410
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Uh-oh.

411
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Again, it doesn't mean we need to stop.

412
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Sorry.

413
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If it fucks up the flow.

414
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No, no, that's okay.

415
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's okay.

416
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I just want to hear it better.

417
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I just keep thinking something's wrong.

418
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Maybe I just need to keep it held up to the.

419
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, you can just turn the volume up and leave it there.

420
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If it's just a little in the background, it might be.

421
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,280
Do you know that the stores also carry something called barofinalia, which sounds like drugs

422
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
or sex.

423
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
Yeah.

424
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,800
And it's just candy, greeting cards, jewelry, stationery, stickers and t-shirts.

425
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,480
I like that they made up a word, but it is a creepy word.

426
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Barofinalia.

427
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,560
Yes, for a place where you stuff dead skins.

428
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,160
They have, I see on the website, they have their honey girl section.

429
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,080
So this is what honey, honey girls honestly look like.

430
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,000
They have the same color palette as brats.

431
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Okay.

432
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh yeah.

433
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So this is like what it's going to be.

434
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's, what are their names?

435
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Well, of course, like we've, we've talked a lot about IP here.

436
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Store IP.

437
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
More friends.

438
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah.

439
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,600
Honey girls, Tegan, honey girls, Risa, honey girls, Viv.

440
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm also creeped out by the term, the name honey girls.

441
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Like, isn't it?

442
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Cause isn't there a word similar?

443
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
Like, I don't know.

444
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,200
Like if you're a honey trap or something, what's the.

445
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Honey trap is a.

446
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
No, honey.

447
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Honey.

448
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Yeah.

449
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Honey pot.

450
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Honey pot, honey trap.

451
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Same.

452
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Yeah.

453
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Honey girls.

454
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Sugar babies.

455
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
They're like sugar babies that get paid for sex.

456
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Yeah.

457
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
It's a creepy term.

458
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
I know.

459
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,400
I think that's probably what the, it's about them posing as, you know, prostitutes to lure

460
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,600
other stuffed animals into different.

461
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Yeah.

462
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,320
This is all Tinker, Taylor, soldier, spy shit.

463
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
They're all.

464
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
Guys, Epstein's around.

465
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Be quiet.

466
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Don't let's not give him any ideas.

467
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,600
He's going to go back to earth, get these bears and prostitute him.

468
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Honey girls.

469
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Jesus Christ.

470
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,400
I made it candidate Epstein is down here with you.

471
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Yeah, you did.

472
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,200
It was to tell her if we meet another guest, that's going to be unfortunate news to break

473
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
to them.

474
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
So welcome.

475
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,360
And by the way, Jeffrey Epstein's here.

476
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
The honey girls.

477
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
Okay.

478
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
So you told me he committed suicide.

479
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Oh, you.

480
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
It was a copper field.

481
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
It wasn't.

482
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,360
It was just a big misunderstanding.

483
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Oh, okay.

484
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
He had plenty to be sad about.

485
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Yeah.

486
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,360
He's a razor, I guess.

487
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Yeah.

488
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
So.

489
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,120
I can't find any honey girls movie on IMDb.

490
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,680
I don't think it's happening.

491
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,400
I want to see who the casting was, but.

492
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,000
Do you think maybe they're they were deciding to go with some of their other IP, like the

493
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,480
Berry Fairy Friends?

494
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,920
Oh, they're cute.

495
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
They're cute.

496
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,120
Pink Unicorn Fairy Friend, Pastel Bear Fairy Friend.

497
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,520
They don't have any names.

498
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,360
They're just describing them.

499
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:33,200
The other IP I like, the Horses and Hearts Riding Club, which is all just outfits for

500
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
your bear.

501
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,880
If your bear wants to ride a horse.

502
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
If your bear wants to ride a horse.

503
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
If your bear wants to do dressage.

504
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Yeah.

505
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
That's an affront to God as well.

506
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:48,360
Honestly, these are on sale right now and maybe I should buy Duffy little riding pants

507
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,520
and little riding boots.

508
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
But not from Build-A-Bear.

509
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Are you crazy?

510
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Don't do it.

511
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,600
I worked at this in college.

512
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,960
Jason, I worked at this really weird, creepy, like souvenir store on the Santa Monica Promenade.

513
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,600
And one of the things that we sold, it's called Blue Wave, was WWF shirts for children with

514
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,360
Tasmanian devils, like screen printed onto them after the fact.

515
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Whoa.

516
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
Also wrestlers?

517
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Yeah.

518
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
It was like it started with a wrestler shirt for like an infant and then it would either

519
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,760
be Taz or like Tweety Bird just kind of in front of the wrestler.

520
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,280
And it cost like $27.

521
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Wow.

522
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,920
That's what I feel like putting Build-A-Bear on a Duffy is.

523
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,560
Cause it's not a wrestler shirt.

524
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,440
It's not a Taz shirt.

525
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,000
It's like a, it's cheap.

526
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
They don't belong together.

527
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,400
The kid gets made fun of when he goes out in it cause he knows it's, everyone knows

528
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
it's not a real shirt.

529
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,160
I think it's a good value for the kid.

530
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,400
I mean you got Tweety Bird and Mark Henry, the world's strongest man.

531
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
You know?

532
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,960
There's one that had the Undertaker and Taz on it and it was for like a one year old.

533
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,560
I was like, I don't like this at all.

534
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
Oh my God.

535
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:04,720
You know, we got, honey, we got you a shirt where Taz is being taken to the grave.

536
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,240
Taz getting choked slammed.

537
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,120
You'll spin no more.

538
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,220
Let me look up the return policy and like, maybe I can just like try the clothes on Duffy

539
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,000
and see if they look good and if not, I'll just return them if it's a generous policy.

540
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,280
I also have to retract.

541
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,720
They do have, they have a very small Marvel section and it's just bears with A's on their

542
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,720
stomach and then one Thor bear, but that's it.

543
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,880
The pick is a slim.

544
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
No Spider-Man.

545
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,240
No, they don't have much more DC stuff.

546
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,240
I don't like Build-A-Bear.

547
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,440
It's ugly.

548
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Did you see?

549
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
I don't, you know what I don't like?

550
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,000
I, both ride makers and Build-A-Bear, I'm glad they're out of downtown Disney just because

551
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,160
their signs were ugly and their logos are ugly.

552
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,000
And part of the recent beautification, beautification sort of, it's a little more appealing of a

553
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,240
place to me because there aren't so many horrible logos all crashing, clashing, including a

554
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,640
logo for a little girl's makeover boutique that we'll get to in a little bit.

555
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,400
I just have one quick other thing I want to bring up about Build-A-Bear.

556
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,120
Their affiliation with the Girl Scouts of America and they have a whole line and Jason,

557
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,800
you're going to be very interested in this.

558
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,400
So keep those ears open.

559
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,880
Let me read some of the different bears you can get.

560
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,840
Is that?

561
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
No.

562
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,960
Yeah, go on.

563
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
Thin Mints Cookie Bear Doodle Print Gift Set.

564
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,620
Thin Mints Cookie Bear Junior Gift Set.

565
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,520
Thin Mint Cookie Bear Cadet Senior Ambassador Gift Set.

566
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,680
Thin Mint Cookie Bear Daisy Doodle Gift Set.

567
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,840
Thin Mints Cookie Bear Brownie Gift Set.

568
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,120
Does the mint, does it smell like mint?

569
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
I hope it does.

570
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,480
Ooh, tell the sector keeper.

571
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,280
It's his favorite kind of jewel.

572
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,880
And just Thin Mint Cookie Bear.

573
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,560
So these are the Girl Scout bears.

574
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,440
God, they're like electric blue.

575
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,440
They look like a mint lifesaver color.

576
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,200
They look like they were incorrectly dyed or something.

577
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,440
Like they went and they got in the wrong washing machine.

578
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
Yes.

579
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,800
If I got that toy as a child, I'd be so angry.

580
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,200
You had my curiosity, but now you have my attention.

581
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,840
It's like we're going to hear the nom nom nom and it's not going to be the alarm.

582
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Yeah.

583
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
It's got thin.

584
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,760
You know how Duffy has the Mickey on his little paw or his little foot.

585
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,880
It says thin mints and it's the picture of a cookie's on his paw.

586
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,840
Is that, am I like just imagining this as the bear like thinner than a normal bear?

587
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
Like a little malnourished.

588
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
It's like lean.

589
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
It's been leaning out.

590
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,840
It hasn't had protein, just sugar.

591
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Yeah.

592
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,480
It's like that starving polar bear we all had to look at that one day.

593
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:56,840
I can confirm that you can add fun extras like thin mints cookie scent and plush thin

594
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,160
mints cookies.

595
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,840
So you can smell a cookie or you can just get like a cookie doll?

596
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
A doll of a cookie?

597
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,040
Yes, I think you can get like a little cookies for him to pretend to eat and then it's $4

598
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,480
to add the scent.

599
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,680
So a box of Girl Scout cookies worth.

600
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,560
Can I get that now?

601
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,760
Can I order that now?

602
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,520
Could we just get the scent?

603
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,640
I want the scent on another thing.

604
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
On a ride maker?

605
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,080
Yeah, I want a car that smells like a cookie.

606
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,160
Here's what the cookie, the fake cookies look like.

607
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,400
You can wrap him around his little paw to make sure he holds onto the cookie, which

608
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,880
it's just going to look like he has like a little handbag or something.

609
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
Or like a little turd.

610
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,320
He's a shin in his hand.

611
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
A little turd handbag.

612
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
What are the other varieties?

613
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,040
What are the Lord of the Dunes?

614
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,280
What are the Caramel Delights?

615
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
This is the website.

616
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,680
I wish I had more variety for you, but it's all.

617
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
I hate this toy.

618
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,160
If you want me to read the six, I'll read the six again.

619
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
No, please never.

620
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
I don't want to get out of here.

621
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,160
I don't want to get in there anymore.

622
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
No, stop it.

623
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Get him out of here.

624
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,000
We have Epstein's around the corner.

625
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
He's going to get us.

626
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Monday's not here to unplug my mic this time.

627
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
No, I wish.

628
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,400
Frank, can he come back magically?

629
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,240
Let's stay in Carlson country though.

630
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,800
Tell us about D Street.

631
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
And let me start the timer.

632
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
All right.

633
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,560
D Street was definitely them thinking like they imagined in their head a consumer that

634
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,160
looked very much like me was of my age at the time and they're like, what does this

635
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,680
dickhead want?

636
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,820
And it was like vinyl toys and Marvel and Star Wars t-shirts.

637
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,040
And they thought that they should make the store a little darker, you know, like literally

638
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,760
like visually darker, I think.

639
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
Cause you know, it's cool.

640
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,360
This is for the, this is for your millennial.

641
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,920
I'm still a millennial by the way.

642
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,600
So it's like a hot topic.

643
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,240
It was, it wasn't that aggressive, but it was closer or like kid robot.

644
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,640
Yeah, kid robot.

645
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,960
It was Marvel toy.

646
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,880
It was like for your like Disney fan who like likes the obscure characters, but also might

647
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,920
like the action adventures as the things they bought.

648
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,440
So I would go in there and buy vinyl figures generally and a shirt once in a while.

649
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,840
What's the best thing you bought there?

650
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,400
That's probably a park star.

651
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,560
They sold, I think they sold them in there.

652
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
I think so.

653
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,000
And then I, for a while I did have some Marvel vinylmations that I would buy.

654
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,920
But then I did sell them cause I have too many toys.

655
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
Yeah.

656
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,280
So I would buy, I would buy those in there.

657
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
They weren't great.

658
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,040
You, you got really into buying the full park star set.

659
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Yes.

660
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,920
And I would just, I like to chase.

661
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,400
I would buy the individual box.

662
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,520
But at a certain point, if you want all of them, it made more sense for me just to buy

663
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,640
a box of whatever 16 or 12.

664
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
So I would get each one.

665
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,600
I think all of them is so many.

666
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
It is.

667
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Oh my God.

668
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Yeah.

669
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
I have them, the shelf is crammed upstairs of all of them.

670
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,880
Google park stars, it just tells you how to go to Joshua tree and look at the sky.

671
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,160
That's the first thing that comes up.

672
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Who cares?

673
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
That sounds dumb.

674
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,480
And was he a toy?

675
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Show me your rides.

676
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Yeah.

677
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,440
Z, did you use a Z?

678
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
I found them.

679
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Okay.

680
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,440
They look pretty fun.

681
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,440
Yeah.

682
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
I bought them on eBay for pretty cheap.

683
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
It all depends.

684
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,000
That orange bird I have is still, is still expensive.

685
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I could sell that for.

686
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
These are cool.

687
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Under bucks.

688
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah.

689
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I only have Rex.

690
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I have a baby type.

691
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah.

692
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,320
It's, it's very cost effective to only like one character.

693
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Yes.

694
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,520
Um, keep his expenses down.

695
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Yeah.

696
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,920
But when that character is Betty boob, she's on everything.

697
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:38,520
Jason, you, here's your favorite characters, Betty boo.

698
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,960
Jason and Simon.

699
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Cannon.

700
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:50,200
Just when things were starting to get cheap with Jessica rabbit, she's on nothing nowadays.

701
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,280
You're not buying nothing but little tin lunch boxes, mounting them near walls.

702
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
It's not enough lunch.

703
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,560
I went to something at the new Bevan.

704
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,800
They showed a Betty boob cartoon before it and it was super funny.

705
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,640
Like old Betty boob cartoons are trippy and cool.

706
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,400
They're, they're like from that really early.

707
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
The Fleischer company.

708
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Yeah.

709
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
They're fun.

710
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,000
Why were we just talking about Betty boop?

711
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,640
Was it for something that hasn't come out yet or for so many of these?

712
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
I heard you guys talk about it.

713
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,640
Just about.

714
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
She's so highly sexualized.

715
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
Yeah, sure.

716
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
You may come up.

717
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Were we offended by her?

718
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
I think you were.

719
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
Yeah, that sounds good.

720
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Yeah, that sounds right.

721
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:32,560
But no one should be offended by her who so solemnly paid tribute to the heroes of September

722
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
11th.

723
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Did everyone see that on Twitter?

724
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Was that recently?

725
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Yeah.

726
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,640
Like the, with the corporate Betty boob brand said, never forget in a photo of the freedom

727
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,280
tamper or like maybe, or the two lights, I think that replaced the.

728
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,120
I was trying to find the picture of Mr. Met like doing the nine 11 thing, but he's smiling

729
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,160
on the, like the head is smiling.

730
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,240
So it looks like he's happy about it.

731
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
My plan.

732
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Someone showed me this.

733
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
He's like, it worked.

734
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,440
New York city, still best city on earth.

735
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,200
Can't help but smile.

736
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,560
What more D street or can we?

737
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,840
I mean, there's not a ton of D street, honestly.

738
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,040
I, you know, I did some window shopping.

739
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
Yeah.

740
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,480
I would, I browsed a lot in there, but also they'd still never get as I, as I've said

741
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:28,120
before, they've, they've still not catering to the hyper obsessive niche retro nerd retro

742
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,960
market out there.

743
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,840
Like you can buy stuff online sometimes, but they're still, you have to go to D 23 to buy

744
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
that stuff.

745
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Not even D 23.

746
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,440
Like they were doing a whole series of shirts that were really obscure that we bought a

747
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,320
couple of and then they stopped it because obviously like the, maybe the market's not

748
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,640
there for that.

749
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,680
I think they realized if they go a little obscure, they can still mass sell it and get

750
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:57,680
it on Instagram as opposed to going like hyper obscure and 50 maniacs buy it.

751
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
Yeah.

752
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,600
You gotta go to, you gotta go to like Etsy or you gotta go to like a T-pub, like people

753
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
legally making these shirts now.

754
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,480
A lot of good bootleg stuff out there.

755
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Nice.

756
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,600
Oh well.

757
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,860
Do we beat the timer?

758
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,860
I think we did.

759
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
Whoa.

760
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,860
Yeah.

761
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
I wish it was easy.

762
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
Yeah, we did 17 seconds to go.

763
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,860
I wish it was easier to do like rollover minutes.

764
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,800
Like, oh, we're actually seconds, 17 seconds for this next topic.

765
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
I guess.

766
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Okay.

767
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Disney vault 23.

768
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Let's start it.

769
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Disney vault 20.

770
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
I never went in here really.

771
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,800
And looking at pictures, it's like, you can buy a lot of floppy hats.

772
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,400
You can buy a lot of like, like straw hats, home goods, home.

773
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Yeah.

774
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,480
Home goods, but also some t-shirts and also just like flannel shirts, like not Disney specific

775
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,960
flannel shirts.

776
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,620
I just like this Yelp review.

777
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,320
Shopping or not, you gotta enjoy these beautiful places.

778
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,980
I love the look of these places.

779
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,000
Shopping is not the most important thing.

780
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,540
Looking around at the amazing decor and finding the hidden gems around.

781
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:01,180
Just enjoy the love that is put into these places and realize it goes further than just

782
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,680
a place to spend money.

783
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,240
What does that mean?

784
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
Buildings, rooms?

785
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:14,640
That really sums up like so many of these closed shops, like because a lot of them do

786
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,480
make you go, how many people bought something here?

787
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,060
Or we're just browsing around for the three years it was open.

788
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:26,400
It reminds me of like all those places in city walk, like what's that woman's name?

789
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,000
Francesca's or whatever.

790
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Yeah.

791
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yeah.

792
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,720
It's just like, it's just a.

793
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Yeah.

794
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Also the name Disney Vault 28, every time I would walk by there, I would have to remember

795
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,760
that it's clothing.

796
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Not a cool thing.

797
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,900
Because Disney Vault is of course the mythical place where they put their movies when they

798
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,320
don't want to sell it to you or they want to withhold the movies from you.

799
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
Yeah.

800
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,400
It's not where you couldn't walk in there and find the original print of Song of the

801
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
South.

802
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Right, which is what it sounded like.

803
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Yeah.

804
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,440
So like the idea, and it feels like the door was a big vault.

805
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Yeah.

806
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Was it ever cool?

807
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,760
Doesn't seem like it.

808
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
I don't think so.

809
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,760
You could go in and buy a flannel shirt and that's it.

810
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,360
But you got to enjoy these beautiful places.

811
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360
Look.

812
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Shopping or not.

813
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
The number one thing is.

814
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,360
The beautiful door.

815
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
They really made it.

816
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
It really is there.

817
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
You have to enjoy this.

818
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,560
You have to enjoy these beautiful places.

819
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
You love to see it.

820
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,120
Folks, we love to see it.

821
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,840
You love to see these beautiful places.

822
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
All right.

823
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
I'm going to reset it.

824
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,920
We're going to go to Fossil.

825
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,920
Fossil.

826
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,880
We better not use the five minutes on Fossil.

827
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Fuck this shit.

828
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
It's a Fossil.

829
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
It's a Fossil.

830
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
It sucks.

831
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
It's gone now.

832
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
It's gone.

833
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
What am I mad about?

834
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
It was one of the City Walk cousins.

835
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
It was one of the, you know.

836
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
What would you buy there?

837
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Sunglasses?

838
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Is that where you go to get some sunglasses?

839
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Wallets.

840
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Wallets.

841
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Wallets.

842
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Wallets.

843
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Watches.

844
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
Big watches.

845
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
Big boys.

846
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
What's the biggest watch you have?

847
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
I just have a couple basic Timex face watches.

848
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
Hmm.

849
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Hmm.

850
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Hmm.

851
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Have we done?

852
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
I got a really small wrist, so I can't go too big.

853
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
So do I, friend.

854
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Yeah.

855
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Oh, you do, don't you?

856
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
Yeah.

857
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
Oh, man.

858
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
Wait a minute.

859
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,880
How, who's, is my wrist big?

860
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
I think it is, comparatively.

861
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Yeah, comparatively.

862
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,880
I used to be able to wear a children's watch.

863
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Huh.

864
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
The children's little.

865
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
Let me see your wrist, Jason.

866
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Sorry.

867
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
I'm just really fascinated.

868
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
Like, think about my proportions.

869
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Like, yeah, let me see your.

870
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
I guess you're right.

871
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
Yeah.

872
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
I just never noticed you had an incredibly narrow wrist.

873
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Let me see your hands, Jason.

874
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Please.

875
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Bring them this way.

876
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
I'm far away from the couch.

877
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
I didn't even know.

878
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
I got one that I just.

879
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,880
I always thought I had a skin, skinny wrist.

880
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
I mean, wrists are skinny in general.

881
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Yeah.

882
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,640
I think if you had a fat wrist, it wouldn't even mean that they're like, the rest of you

883
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,640
was, had a problem.

884
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
It's a bone structure.

885
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
Yeah.

886
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
It's all bone, yeah.

887
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,720
I think it's, you might have like a specific, like maybe your wrist is sick.

888
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,560
See, I have, I have small wrists, but I have much, I have smaller fingers, I have short

889
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
fingers.

890
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Interesting.

891
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,200
Do you ever find, do you guys find these, these little issues ever that come up or actually

892
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,880
bother, are you bothered by short fingers?

893
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,400
Has it ever been a problem in any particular way?

894
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,120
It's a weird, like I have friends who are pianists or whatever.

895
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,560
Oh, that would be a problem.

896
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,720
Sometimes their fingers are twice as long as my fingers and that's creepy to me.

897
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
Whoa.

898
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
Oh, yeah, twice.

899
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,960
You ever have a typing issue?

900
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,200
Do you ever not be able to reach or go from shift to.

901
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Not that bad.

902
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
I know I don't think so.

903
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,080
I can type on a standard, I can type quite fast.

904
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,280
I can type pretty fast, but I can tell when the typing lessons end it, like when that

905
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,480
class end it, cause when it starts to get to the shift number categories, I gotta look

906
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
down.

907
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,320
I, when I was learning how to play the guitar and I was testing out different tabs, I saw

908
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,380
it, there was a Dave Matthews band song I was trying to play and I could do this crazy

909
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,080
chord that he plays like with his, and I was like, Oh, my fingers, I guess are long.

910
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,160
Cause some people said they couldn't do it.

911
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,160
What was the chord?

912
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,360
I can't remember what note it was.

913
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,560
I can't do closeup magic.

914
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,120
Oh no.

915
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Yeah.

916
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,400
But I don't want to.

917
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Oh, good.

918
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,320
Cause you're not a warlock.

919
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,320
I'm not a warlock.

920
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,320
Like anyone who does closeup magic would be called deemed a warlock.

921
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
And admitted warlock.

922
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
He said it.

923
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,520
Look, he admitted it to everyone.

924
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,760
Warlock is to which, right?

925
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Yes.

926
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
It's just witch and warlock.

927
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,880
Weirdly though, also, when I was a kid, the national inquirer published a story about

928
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,720
how my mom was a witch and they included a spell that they said she had done.

929
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,400
She'd done a spell.

930
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,680
Is that where they were getting it from?

931
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,840
Or is that just a coincidence?

932
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
My mom was a Wiccan.

933
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,080
Oh, so a witch then.

934
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,000
But they also said she'd cured someone's cancer with a spell and then they published

935
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,560
the spell and none of that wasn't true.

936
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
So anyway.

937
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
Wow.

938
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
So you say.

939
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
I know.

940
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
That we know it wasn't yours.

941
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
But I mean, don't let the QAnon's find this out.

942
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,560
Well, this is, we're behind the paywall, so they won't know.

943
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,280
This could be a lot of our audience could be QAnon.

944
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:52,760
People willing to pay for a theme park, Patreon, paywall.

945
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Let's be real.

946
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,920
A lot of the Q&A stuff is crazy, but the EPC and stuff, I don't know.

947
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,120
Some of that.

948
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
He's listening.

949
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
Oh, God.

950
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,120
He's always a few stops ahead.

951
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
Peeking around the corner.

952
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,840
I feel like he got out easy that he's not in hell.

953
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:18,280
He's in the underworld of he's in like some weird parallel theme park mall, which is inherently

954
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
more fun than hell.

955
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,880
And it has a club Libby Lou in it.

956
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,880
It has a club Libby Lou.

957
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Is that where we're heading?

958
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,520
No, I think we're heading to.

959
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Starabelias.

960
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Starabelias.

961
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,200
OK, let's be proper with the order.

962
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,200
This is another thing that sounds like a sex act or like a sexual like.

963
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Kind of like a starabelias.

964
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:44,520
Or just like you say, like fecafelia starabelia, like it's just like I can only fuck big movie

965
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,520
stars.

966
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,720
Oh, my life.

967
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:53,240
This is a perfect example of the don't even worry about buying anything.

968
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,880
Just look at these beautiful places.

969
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,880
Yeah, because I feel like these kinds of movie memorabilia stores that were so big in the

970
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,640
90s and in this case, the early aughts, I never saw anyone at the register going like,

971
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:13,200
yeah, I want this Scarface signed Scarface thing where this here, this is autographs

972
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,280
of all the James Bond's.

973
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,600
OK, they're all signed ace playing cards.

974
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,400
OK, and they're mounted.

975
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,360
How much does that cost?

976
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,880
I couldn't really find a price, but I'm sure expensive.

977
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:32,560
If this a review from 2007 says that an autographed eight by 10 of Lindsay Lohan is six hundred

978
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,560
dollars.

979
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
Wow.

980
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
Madden Framed.

981
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:42,160
Yeah, the starabelia that was in the downtown Disney, now Disney Springs in Orlando, got

982
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,280
caught up in a scandal for supposedly selling a five dollar bill signed by Babe Ruth that

983
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,200
was not authenticated correctly.

984
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,040
Oh, likely would have been a fake.

985
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,480
Because there's all this fighting in these articles about like, well, this and this authenticator

986
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,400
hadn't been certified like they should have used this a different authenticator.

987
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,040
It's a very, can you like a very weird world?

988
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,040
Yeah.

989
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,640
Member signed memorabilia world is strange.

990
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Yeah.

991
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,360
Autographs are weird also, and they're certainly not what I desire anymore.

992
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:22,320
But it made me think, do you guys have autographs in some form that means that mean a lot to

993
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
you?

994
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
No, mean a lot to me?

995
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
No.

996
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Or do you just think it's cool?

997
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,680
You weren't even there for it seems so strange to me being like, yes, I have someone got

998
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,680
this signed.

999
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,400
Trying to think the autographs I realize.

1000
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,040
I mean, I have some signed comics.

1001
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,760
I have somewhere we got Mark Grace, Chicago Cub, Mark Grace to sign something.

1002
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,440
I have the last time I had somebody autograph something it was at Comic Con.

1003
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:53,240
I had Jim Steranko, who is a very fascinating character who we should probably do an episode

1004
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:59,240
about who was like a Houdini ask magician in addition to being a writer and artist.

1005
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
Cool.

1006
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,000
In addition to being like the guy who did all the art, like the Indiana Jones concept

1007
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,040
art, Blade Runner 2.

1008
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,840
This guy sounds cool.

1009
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:14,000
He's a mad man who like claims that there's people that are like he's he carries a gun

1010
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,280
on him in the hills of Tennessee because there's people that want him dead.

1011
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,280
Cool.

1012
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,000
And like he slapped Batman creator Bob Kane for disrespecting him.

1013
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,520
Which is great because everyone hated Bob Kane.

1014
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,880
It was at a Comic Con where like Bob Kane disrespected him and he came up to him and

1015
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,840
like pulled like a glove out and like snapped like.

1016
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,840
Yeah, yeah.

1017
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,760
And he did like a little like rich guy slap and the next day Steranko saw him and like

1018
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,440
stopped an elevator and like hit him full on.

1019
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,000
Anyway, I have I have a picture of him like Houdini like a young man because now he's very

1020
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
old.

1021
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,960
He's like Houdini and he signed it.

1022
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,920
And I love that.

1023
00:44:52,920 --> 00:45:01,520
I the only time I ever did that was I was working on a shoot for a Comedy Central show

1024
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:07,280
that was like promoting the movie, former Dickie something, former child star, Dickie

1025
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,280
Roberts.

1026
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,280
Oh, yeah.

1027
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,240
So we had all these different former child stars that we're bringing in for like a it

1028
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,200
was a really weird shoot day.

1029
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:23,520
OK, so side note, there was this convention for I had to drive around Emmanuel Lewis and

1030
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,680
I had to pick him up at his hotel and drive him to set and then drive him back.

1031
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,720
And he was he was like a 9-11 conspiracy theorist.

1032
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,400
He was very strange.

1033
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,680
And when we got to set and there were all these other child stars there, everyone was

1034
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,920
like, are you guys going to the are you guys coming to the from the TV land convention?

1035
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,800
Because I guess there was a TV land convention at a nearby airport.

1036
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,440
And it became clear that Emmanuel Lewis had not been invited to the convention and everyone

1037
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,440
else had.

1038
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,440
Man.

1039
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,200
But he didn't but he didn't care.

1040
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,880
And then also at one point, he like called me into his trailer.

1041
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,320
He's like, do you have a second?

1042
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
And I was like, yeah.

1043
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,440
And he like then he just like pulled up this paper and he's like, welcome family to our

1044
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,440
reunion.

1045
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,840
I hope you have a great weekend.

1046
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,400
He read me like the intro letter he'd written to his family for his family reunion and asked

1047
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,240
for notes on it.

1048
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,240
You're a writer.

1049
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,680
So then also so at the end of the day, I was supposed to drive him back to the hotel and

1050
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,920
he's like, we're driving and he's something like, you know what, I think I'm going to

1051
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
rent a car.

1052
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,880
And I was like, oh, well, okay.

1053
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,520
And he's like, pull over around here.

1054
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,340
I I'm going to rent a car and I'm just going to be mobile or whatever.

1055
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,840
And I was like, well, I'm supposed to take you to your hotel.

1056
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,700
I kind of got those instructions like just just do it.

1057
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,700
Just do it.

1058
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,000
So I dropped him off and he like ran into this hotel and then I realized it was the

1059
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,760
Nick at Night Hotel and he was just like, he was just going to the TV land convention.

1060
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,960
He just was going without being invited and he just like ran into the convention and lied

1061
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
to me.

1062
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,960
What he was crashing.

1063
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,960
He was crashing the convention and he knows they'll let him in.

1064
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,960
It's me.

1065
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,960
So he tries me Webster.

1066
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,960
Yeah.

1067
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,560
So then the other thing that happened was that I had Barry Williams was there.

1068
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Oh, Brady.

1069
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,400
That came up on the last episode.

1070
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,840
And I had a DVD of the Brady Bunch Variety Hour, which is it's my favorite thing ever.

1071
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,840
Oh, we've never talked.

1072
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,800
And I oh, we should do a whole you should do a whole episode on that.

1073
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,520
And I got him to sign it, but I turned the cover inside out and I didn't show him what

1074
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,520
it was.

1075
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,520
Oh, and Casey.

1076
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,520
And he signed it.

1077
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,520
And then he asked me what it was.

1078
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,520
And I showed him and he went, fuck you.

1079
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,520
Really?

1080
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,520
Yeah.

1081
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,200
And so now you're doing something on it.

1082
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,880
I was being a dick and I was at my job.

1083
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,720
It was like a shitty thing to do all around.

1084
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,200
But what do you have not signed it?

1085
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,200
He hated.

1086
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,200
He hates it.

1087
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
Yeah.

1088
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,200
But he's still like us like a singing court like it's so embarrassing.

1089
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,840
Now come to my 70s songs of the 70s show and show.

1090
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,440
So that's the only thing I got autographed.

1091
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,920
Well, all right.

1092
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,320
I have two quick autograph things.

1093
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,080
Once I won tickets to an advanced screening of Frost Nixon.

1094
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:07,600
And at the end of it, there was a Q&A with Ron Howard and everyone stormed the front

1095
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,160
of the theater to get Ron Howard's autograph.

1096
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,920
And I was like, well, I guess I'm getting Ron Howard's autograph.

1097
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,920
Like I just followed the crowd.

1098
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,520
So I have an autographed Arclight ticket stub.

1099
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,840
You're not not going to get his autograph.

1100
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,160
I'm not going to not get it because he was very gracious.

1101
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,640
I mean, he wasn't really rushing out of there and everything.

1102
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,920
So then we were like I went to the bathroom and he was in the same bathroom and some guy

1103
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,880
was just like, great job, Ron.

1104
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,720
And he's like, oh, thank you.

1105
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,440
And then just like walked out.

1106
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,440
Weird.

1107
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,240
Yeah, weird in the bathroom.

1108
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,240
Great job, Ron.

1109
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,240
You really peed.

1110
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:47,280
The other weird autograph thing is that Mike and I worked a horrible gig once like 10 years

1111
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,800
ago or I guess only like eight or nine years ago.

1112
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,000
And they didn't pay us, but they gave us a bag of swag at the end, which included an

1113
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,040
autographed OK, go city.

1114
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,360
You got paid by that.

1115
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,920
We got paid by that.

1116
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,120
It was only Ashton Kutcher and HP, the printer company.

1117
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,880
They didn't have any money.

1118
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,200
They couldn't swing a hundred dollars.

1119
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,280
A band that's not known for its CDs.

1120
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,280
Yeah.

1121
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,280
Right.

1122
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,280
Yeah.

1123
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,280
Right.

1124
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,880
Or known for its members, pretty frankly.

1125
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:25,520
Oh, also a giant book about the way the future will go from the head of HP.

1126
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,160
Definitely will crack into this one.

1127
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,800
Guys, this is great.

1128
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,320
We rushed the table to get a picture with Robert Evans.

1129
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,880
Oh, yes, we did.

1130
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,880
That's cool.

1131
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,880
We have a picture of us with Robert Evans.

1132
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,520
We have his book signed, but he had pre-signed it and they said no pictures before.

1133
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:45,760
And then everyone rushed this old man and took a picture with him and we did too.

1134
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,760
That's cool.

1135
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,760
You got that?

1136
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,760
Yes.

1137
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:54,160
I have an autograph from Emmanuel Lewis's friend, Michael Jackson, which my friend David

1138
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,160
gave to me.

1139
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:03,720
He was working out of Beverly Hills office where he was going for doctor visits so frequently

1140
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:09,000
that my friend got bored getting autographs for himself and got an off the wall autograph

1141
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
for me.

1142
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
He gave it to me.

1143
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,160
I was very moved by it.

1144
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,760
Oh my God, you're kidding.

1145
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,760
That's insane.

1146
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,600
I appreciate this so much and boy, I love off the wall of Michael and then he died the

1147
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
next day.

1148
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,600
Whoa.

1149
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,680
I have something that he touched in his last week alive.

1150
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,400
That autograph is canceled and that story is canceled.

1151
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Conrad Murray.

1152
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,600
He may have been looking back.

1153
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,400
Maybe he was going to see Conrad Murray.

1154
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,400
Conrad Murray.

1155
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,400
Yeah.

1156
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,400
Yeah.

1157
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,400
Yeah.

1158
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,400
Those may have been the visits that.

1159
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
Jesus Christ.

1160
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Yeah.

1161
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,680
And then he like flimply touched his album cover.

1162
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:51,160
I wonder why Dr. Murray had been giving me such a great deal on visits.

1163
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,160
I went to Michael Jackson's funeral.

1164
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,160
You did?

1165
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,160
Yeah.

1166
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,160
I won the raffle and I got tickets.

1167
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,160
What?

1168
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,160
The Staples Center one?

1169
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,160
Yeah.

1170
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,160
Wow.

1171
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,840
I just entered the online raffle and then I got two tickets.

1172
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,160
You saw John Mayer play human nature in a eulogy way.

1173
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,160
Yeah.

1174
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,840
What was insane at that?

1175
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,600
I don't remember.

1176
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
Magic and Kobe spoke.

1177
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
People were just eating McDonald's at the funeral.

1178
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,600
What?

1179
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,600
In the stands.

1180
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,600
So that was weird.

1181
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,600
Wow.

1182
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,600
Holy shit.

1183
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,600
Oh yeah.

1184
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Because I guess the McDonald's at the Staples Center.

1185
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,600
Yeah.

1186
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,600
Oh yeah.

1187
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,600
It's still open.

1188
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,600
Yeah.

1189
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,600
Sure.

1190
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,440
The Phelps, Fred Phelps people were picketing it.

1191
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,440
That was crazy.

1192
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,440
God.

1193
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,440
Jesus.

1194
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,440
Anyway.

1195
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,440
Okay.

1196
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,760
So that all counted as part of Starbillias and more.

1197
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,080
Did we hear the gnawing noise?

1198
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,080
It did go off.

1199
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,080
I just missed it.

1200
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,080
No, it was, yeah.

1201
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,120
I guess it's far away from, I don't know if the listener heard it.

1202
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,120
I'm not sure.

1203
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,120
I have my headphones on.

1204
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,120
I'll just, I'll do one myself too.

1205
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:53,440
Anyway, you could buy a Texaco gas pump there or a Ty Cobb autographed baseball for $10,000.

1206
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,240
Why don't you do that?

1207
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,240
Don't do that.

1208
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,000
Ah, the history's most racist man, Ty Cobb.

1209
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I don't think I know.

1210
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:09,480
Oh, I once, someone in the stands yelled at him and he climbed into the stands and beat

1211
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,440
the man to a pulp and they, yeah, like stop beating him.

1212
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,440
He's handicapped.

1213
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,440
Like, oh my God.

1214
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,440
Yeah.

1215
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,440
That's fun.

1216
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,440
Wait, just now or before?

1217
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,440
Because I know he is now, but.

1218
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,440
Yeah.

1219
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,440
Jesus Christ.

1220
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,440
Still in a war named after heaven.

1221
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,440
Yeah.

1222
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,440
Oh my God.

1223
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,440
Yikes.

1224
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Okay.

1225
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:35,640
So I know now we are, this, now it's going to be hard to obey the time even more so as

1226
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,640
we enter Club Libby Lou.

1227
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,840
A children's fashion retail environment that encouraged celebrating being a girly girl.

1228
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,600
And experience at Club Libby Lou always began with a wish.

1229
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,280
At the front door of every, at the front of every door were fairies, which would grant

1230
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,480
your, their wishes of people of all ages by sprinkling fairy dust onto guests as they

1231
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,020
walked into the store.

1232
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:01,080
On a beautiful day, girls of all ages sat in front of a pink colored heart shaped mirrors

1233
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:07,720
listening to pop music and they becoming rock stars, princesses and favorite celebrities,

1234
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,640
including Miley Cyrus and Ashley Tisdale.

1235
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,840
A makeover cost between 25 and $60, depending on the package of choice, included a full

1236
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,840
hair updo, nail polish and makeup.

1237
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:21,400
In addition to playing dress up for the day, Club Libby Lou VIPs, very important princesses,

1238
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,120
were guided by their club counselors over to various stations, including a potion bar

1239
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,440
where a VIP could make their own lotion, perfume, fairy dust or lip gloss and a pooch

1240
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,520
parlor where the guests could own stuffed animals of their choice.

1241
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,160
At the end of every experience, each VIP was encouraged to join the free club and was given

1242
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,520
a friendship bracelet.

1243
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,920
In early 10th of November, 2008, parent company, Saks incorporated announced that due to the

1244
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,520
dismal state of the economy, they would be closing all 98 locations.

1245
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,520
Dismal.

1246
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,520
It's nothing to do with us.

1247
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,480
We're this model is sound.

1248
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,360
Hard Rock Park and Club Libby Lou victims of the recession just died.

1249
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,360
Oh, awful.

1250
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,520
As I said before, horrible logo.

1251
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,960
Disgusting, but just made the entire area look like trash.

1252
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
Uvabar fonts.

1253
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,960
Yeah.

1254
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,640
I pine for Uvabar compared to this one.

1255
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,640
That's so gross.

1256
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,960
Girls, like I looked up some Libby Lou makeovers and there's just like slutty, slutty little

1257
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,960
girls.

1258
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,840
What I read was that like what they showed you in the look book wasn't nearly as slutty

1259
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,080
looking as what they came out with.

1260
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,640
Because I think you probably have like less talented makeup artists day to day than the

1261
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,000
people providing the samples.

1262
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,680
So it's just broad strokes.

1263
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,680
Bright lipstick.

1264
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,680
Here you go.

1265
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,640
The girls looked insane.

1266
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:44,920
It is the potion, the potion bar and the pooch parlor are very fun, but when you Google them,

1267
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,760
they're not quite as magical as you might.

1268
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,680
You'd hope they would be.

1269
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:56,120
It's sort of just like as if you're getting like soap, different soaps out of.

1270
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,120
Oh, there's pumps.

1271
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:03,400
There's like pumps for like body glitter or they call this body shimmer, which I think

1272
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
is body glitter.

1273
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
Am I wrong?

1274
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Thank you for clarifying.

1275
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,000
8.50 each, which is just like, what do you get?

1276
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,360
A cup of body shimmer?

1277
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,240
I want to make my shimmer.

1278
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,240
Get it.

1279
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,240
I haven't finished my shimmer.

1280
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,680
Get out of here, mom.

1281
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,680
Yeah.

1282
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:25,160
So it's like, it really is sort of like a, maybe it's like a Terry Gilliam style, like

1283
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,800
nightmare in a weird way.

1284
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,720
Like there would be in Brazil or something.

1285
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:35,760
Oh, like these designs in the way, the way things are literally not shaped.

1286
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,360
It just feels like perverse.

1287
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:42,760
The whole thing is like, would be in a parody of this where it's like, see what we're doing

1288
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,240
to these kids.

1289
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:49,080
It's in the opening tirade of studio 60 or the newsroom would include, we're making up

1290
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,360
girls to look like little whores.

1291
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,360
Club Liddywood.

1292
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,200
You know what it reminds me of is Lindsay, who just walked through, would know what I'm

1293
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
talking about.

1294
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,200
Hi Lindsay.

1295
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,200
Barbizon.

1296
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Oh.

1297
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,200
Yeah.

1298
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,840
So there's this modeling school that advertised in all the teen magazines and there was like,

1299
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:10,120
they had them in every town in America in the eighties and it was like their model was

1300
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,960
trained to be a model or just look like one.

1301
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,320
And so you take classes there where they teach you how to be hot and then you get like a

1302
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,800
modeling portfolio at the end, which you wouldn't be able to use for anything.

1303
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,800
Yeah.

1304
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,240
All the gens in my middle school got their own.

1305
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,240
Oh, Lindsay, by the way, you just entered the underworld briefly.

1306
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,240
We found Eva.

1307
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,240
That's where she was.

1308
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,600
She was in the underworld all the time, but watch out cause Jeffrey Epstein's here.

1309
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,600
Definitely.

1310
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,600
Oh yeah, get out.

1311
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,600
Bye.

1312
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,560
She's well, she just walked out the door.

1313
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,120
Why do we have to, how can we have to rescue Eva with store after store?

1314
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,160
I like being here.

1315
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,920
I wanted to be caught.

1316
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,920
Classic warlock.

1317
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,080
Yeah, this is horrible.

1318
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,520
There's like a really nasty blog about it that's titled, where do you take your ugly

1319
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,560
daughter so she can be fixed up?

1320
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,560
Club Libby Lou.

1321
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,560
Oh my God.

1322
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,840
You know, it's sarcastic, but it's just like, that's what this is selling to all these girls

1323
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,680
that they're too ugly to be in the mall.

1324
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,760
They need a makeover.

1325
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,720
It's very funny that it's owned by, it was owned by Saks.

1326
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,720
Yeah.

1327
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,720
They bought it.

1328
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,760
They like bought it and over franchised it.

1329
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,080
I think it, yeah.

1330
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:31,520
This isn't the last thing for women that was added to Disney, which was founded by like

1331
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,520
misogynists.

1332
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,520
You'll see, you'll see it's coming down.

1333
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:39,120
No, kind of progressive in terms of like boy store, girl store, boy store, girl store.

1334
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
Racers.

1335
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,120
Club Libby Lou.

1336
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,400
This also isn't, I mean, not to spoil it, but this isn't the last place for makeovers

1337
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,320
for little girls in this sector.

1338
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,000
Well, they were all in this location.

1339
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Sectors are for city walls.

1340
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Sorry.

1341
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,560
I think the alarm, we can like ignore a little bit because these all bleed into each other

1342
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,560
a little bit.

1343
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:06,000
So, but before we move on from Club Libby Lou, I think you also found the crazy story

1344
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,760
on the Wikipedia of what happened in a Club Libby Lou contest.

1345
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,760
Unless we're looking at the same thing.

1346
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,760
No.

1347
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,760
You tell me.

1348
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,760
Oh, nevermind.

1349
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:22,400
So, in order to win a Hannah Montana contest where you got a makeover and four VIP tickets

1350
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,640
to see a Hannah Montana concert, there was a, I don't know, there was just something

1351
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,120
where you said why you deserved it and a six year old girl talked about how her father

1352
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,840
died in Iraq and then she won.

1353
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,840
Yes, I saw this.

1354
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,360
She was in the middle of getting the makeover when somebody came up to her mom and said,

1355
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,560
you know, we looked up your husband's name.

1356
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,200
We checked your husband's name with the military and no one has ever served with that name.

1357
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:53,200
So, this mother forced her six year old to tell a fake story of stolen valor to get Hannah

1358
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,200
Montana.

1359
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,200
Libby Lou's stolen valor.

1360
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,000
This truly is the underworld.

1361
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,520
It's only getting grimmer.

1362
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,400
With this specific, he died via a roadside bomb.

1363
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,440
They tell him, honey, tell him it was a roadside bomb.

1364
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,080
I looked up video of a wreck.

1365
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,680
That seems like the kind of thing that's there.

1366
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,600
Tell him it was a roadside bomb.

1367
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,320
Oh my God.

1368
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,460
Outside Mosul.

1369
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:23,960
And it blew up his whole body, his whole skeleton and any identification that he had on his

1370
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,960
person.

1371
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,840
You look like a hamburger helper.

1372
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,160
Looked like a bunch of organs came out of a pinata.

1373
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,360
The E was decimated.

1374
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,200
So horrible shit here.

1375
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,640
Disney, I think, seemingly decided they wanted to have something like this, but not do business

1376
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,880
with this company or maybe they just fell apart entirely.

1377
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:51,240
So the same space got converted into something called Studio Disney 365, which is similarly

1378
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,240
ugly.

1379
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,080
But Mike, you're going somewhere with this.

1380
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,040
Not one of these beautiful places.

1381
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,040
Hold on.

1382
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,360
It's not a beautiful place.

1383
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,400
It's not, don't appreciate it.

1384
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,640
What are you heading for?

1385
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,400
Did you come across Sweet and Sassy?

1386
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,400
No.

1387
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,400
No, what's that?

1388
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,560
Which is another company that I'm trying to figure out now if it was fully.

1389
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,600
So Sweet and Sassy is a little kid's spa.

1390
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,640
It seems like it's the sequel to this.

1391
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,320
But it's for pampering the little girls.

1392
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,320
It's a little bit, yeah.

1393
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,560
So it's not quite as gaudy maybe or tacky.

1394
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,480
These are some uncoordinated shows we're watching.

1395
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,520
But there's still some, like, she's being injected with something.

1396
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,280
I know it's her ear pierced.

1397
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,680
They're getting their hair, it's a salon, so they get blowouts or they get their hair

1398
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,680
cut.

1399
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,680
Something like that.

1400
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,240
So I'm looking at the website and it says, this is her story, the Sweet and Sassy story.

1401
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,840
While researching national competitors, she found the woman who found a retail and party

1402
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,840
store for tween girls called Club Libby Lou.

1403
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,960
The handful of stores that were started by a Chicago businesswoman were later purchased

1404
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,640
by Saks Fifth Avenue.

1405
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:00,280
Dixie who started Sweet and Sassy saw how the unique tween items such as room decor,

1406
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,280
bath items and accessories were selling at Libby Lou.

1407
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,760
This reinforced her idea that the retail party concept for this segment of the market was

1408
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,360
already successful.

1409
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,880
Although the Libby Lou parties were good, they were not great and customer service was

1410
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,880
lacking.

1411
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:19,320
These parties took place in a cramped 30 square, they're trashing Club Libby Lou in their facts,

1412
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,720
in their origin story.

1413
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:27,000
You know, we read ads on our podcast and sometimes it'll say, don't refer to competitors because

1414
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,600
we want to say we're better than the other products, but we get these little notes that

1415
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,480
we don't read to you, the audience, saying, but don't like trash another thing.

1416
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,480
This is like just pure trash.

1417
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,480
Does Sweet and Sassy still exist?

1418
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,480
Yeah, yeah.

1419
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,760
Sweet and Sassy, I think is thriving.

1420
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,600
So Dixie saw the opportunity to provide a better experience and then they go another

1421
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,080
mile, like an extra mile here and says, in parentheses, Saks closed Libby Lou due to

1422
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,160
branding issues related to girls growing up too fast.

1423
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:55,800
Sweet and Sassy learned from this and made adjustments in its early years to keep make

1424
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,320
crazy, to keep makeup light and glittery and to keep girls little.

1425
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:06,960
He injected a drug to all girls and to provide costumes that do not show tummies or anything

1426
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,480
that shouldn't be seen.

1427
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,940
Oh, it's Christian.

1428
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:13,160
So they were like offended by this.

1429
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,120
Yes, I am Dixie.

1430
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:22,040
Another woman known as Dixie who's founded Sweet and Sassy, the chain for little girls.

1431
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:26,880
If I walk into a Sweet and Sassy and just like slam down $200, they got to do my hair,

1432
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,880
right?

1433
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,880
Yeah, I think so.

1434
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,880
Give me a makeover.

1435
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,880
As long as you don't want your tummy to show.

1436
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,880
No tummies.

1437
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,160
My money's as good as these fucking girls.

1438
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,480
Nothing that shouldn't be shown.

1439
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,240
Make my party great.

1440
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,040
There is, I'm trying to find, there are no Sweet and Sassy's.

1441
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,760
I want my choice of lotion scent.

1442
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,480
Here are all the Sweet and Sassy's countrywide.

1443
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,080
They're all on the right side of the country.

1444
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,160
They're all on the right side.

1445
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,720
Let me, uh, Branson.

1446
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,800
Starting at Texas and moving east from there.

1447
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,800
Where does Dixie live?

1448
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,800
Dixie, are you listening?

1449
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,800
She is listening.

1450
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,800
Where are you?

1451
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:07,960
Sweet and Sassy of St. Louis, Sweet and Sassy, let's see here, Branson.

1452
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,400
I probably should have put the timer on the topic that isn't in downtown Disney.

1453
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:18,120
That really nasty ugly girl's blog was about the St. Louis location of Libby Lou.

1454
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,120
Okay.

1455
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,120
Wow.

1456
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,600
Not there, which I'm sure the Disney one was classy all the way.

1457
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,960
Dixie saw the same thing that woman saw.

1458
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,960
Yes, she did.

1459
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,640
There is one in Branson.

1460
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,680
See, everything's in Branson.

1461
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,520
Or wait, it's, you know, it's actually closer to St. Louis, but that's.

1462
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,440
You can get your ears pierced at Sweet and Sassy.

1463
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,440
That's kind of crazy.

1464
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,440
Yeah.

1465
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,440
That's where we move.

1466
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,160
It's closer to St. Louis, but still it's not far.

1467
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,880
So where, what now?

1468
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,360
Cause I, there are two paths.

1469
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,320
Well I, what I think, I've made a change the grouping of what you're looking at, but it

1470
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:57,240
seems to me to make sense to move over to what replaced Studio Disney 365, which is

1471
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,120
Anna and Elsa's boutique.

1472
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:04,880
So they, they may, they changed it from a generic Disney makeover place to a Frozen

1473
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,080
specific makeover place.

1474
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:11,120
You could choose from many different hairstyles that were Frozen inspired.

1475
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:17,080
It mostly involved a tiara, hair extensions and hair glitter.

1476
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,280
You could pick your own hair glitter.

1477
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,400
If you were a boy, you're not locked out of the fun.

1478
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,080
You get to be an Olaf.

1479
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,320
I saw, I saw a picture of an Olaf.

1480
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,320
I don't know that I would know that it was an Olaf if he was walking around.

1481
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,320
I'm going to pull it out.

1482
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,160
Cause they didn't just paint the kids white.

1483
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,440
They didn't just like douse them in white paint.

1484
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,640
It's that you had spiked hair with quote snow flurry tips.

1485
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,600
What does that, so you look like Smash Mouth guy basically.

1486
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,760
That's what you look like.

1487
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,760
That's true.

1488
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,320
Who does kind of look like a living Olaf.

1489
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,880
He does Steve Harv, what is it?

1490
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:52,880
Harwell?

1491
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,880
Not Harvey.

1492
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,880
Harvey.

1493
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,880
Yeah.

1494
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,880
No.

1495
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,880
There, oh, look at that little Olaf.

1496
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,880
Yeah, it's an Olaf.

1497
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,440
Yeah, it looks like a real Olaf.

1498
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,920
Oh yeah, that kid is Olaf.

1499
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,920
He's having fun.

1500
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,920
He's a little, he's my seed.

1501
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,920
Look at my little Olaf.

1502
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,600
He's my seed.

1503
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,760
Look at my spiky hair.

1504
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,080
Okay, so you can be an Olaf here, which means spiked hair.

1505
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:18,800
I don't know, like you were saying, it's one of those like, let's jam frozen into the every

1506
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,240
like any vacant spot in the parks, let's get frozen in there.

1507
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,760
Yeah, they did not know it was going to be a hit like this.

1508
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,760
Totally.

1509
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,760
Why did it close?

1510
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,000
So many singalongs and was it just to get some other store in there?

1511
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I'm discombobulated.

1512
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,560
I don't know what this time I didn't look up what retail location all these places were.

1513
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,560
I don't know where we are.

1514
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,040
This one was right next to the entrance, the hotel entrance.

1515
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,040
Okay.

1516
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,560
Now that area is kind of sprinkles in the void.

1517
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,560
Is that right?

1518
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,560
Yeah.

1519
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,560
Yeah.

1520
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,560
Yeah.

1521
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,560
Okay.

1522
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,480
Hey, I think we got there and we can move on to on my list.

1523
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:59,720
It is Basin, which is a bath bombs kind of place before.

1524
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,980
Still going strong at Disney Springs.

1525
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:07,720
We got and we got another bath bombs place coming up, but there's a Mickey Mouse inside

1526
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,800
that was carved from a 250 pound block of soap.

1527
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,800
That's cool.

1528
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,800
That is cool.

1529
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,800
Yes.

1530
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,000
I don't think I ever stepped foot in Basin.

1531
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,400
No, I didn't either.

1532
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,860
There was an oversized sink where as many as eight guests could simultaneously try out

1533
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,600
all the natural body scrubs.

1534
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,280
They have this up at the city walk too though.

1535
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,320
They had a big sink and they encouraged you.

1536
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,720
They would say like, what do you want?

1537
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,800
Like try out one of our soaps and like.

1538
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,400
Get in our big old sink.

1539
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,800
Get in there and mix it up.

1540
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,560
They should just get a big tub and have you get in.

1541
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,560
Oh, if only.

1542
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:43,200
I have a thing in front of me that says, it's weird little soap balls with Mickey ears in

1543
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:48,100
it and it says, soak and relax in this fresh scented bath and watch the Mickey shapes confetti

1544
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,840
dance in the tub.

1545
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,840
No.

1546
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,840
Wait, what?

1547
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:56,160
Like you would drop the bomb and then all of the Mickey confettis would be swimming

1548
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,160
around you.

1549
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,160
I don't like that.

1550
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,040
It feels like he's watching me take a bath.

1551
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,800
These there's many little Mickey's.

1552
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,800
I see you.

1553
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,800
Made entirely of parabens.

1554
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,800
We're bathing together.

1555
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:09,160
I'm big with the bath with you.

1556
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,160
Little Mickey sperm.

1557
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:15,600
But also yeah, like what is this like on the, on the city walk saga, I was concerned with

1558
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,960
my bath bomb cause it had like glitter in it.

1559
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,960
Confetti seems terrible.

1560
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,760
Confetti seems, I guess it's bigger.

1561
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,720
It'll just mess up your drain, right?

1562
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,720
Yeah.

1563
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,560
Is it true confetti or was it actually like something that would just degrade in there?

1564
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,560
They're thicker.

1565
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,560
I'm sure it goes down.

1566
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,000
I'm sure it's just plastic.

1567
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,480
Like the scrubs, like all the like body wash scrubs, there's little beads were just those

1568
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,000
microbeads are like killing coral reefs all over the place.

1569
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah.

1570
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Very bad.

1571
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,280
It's all animals are choking on Mickey confetti.

1572
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,760
Basin is now Sanuk.

1573
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,040
Oh, right.

1574
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,120
Basin is now Sanuk.

1575
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:54,120
Basin is now Sanuk.

1576
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:58,360
Basin is now Sanuk.

1577
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,960
We're all saying it right?

1578
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,000
Basin is now Sanuk.

1579
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,960
Basin is now Sanuk.

1580
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,960
That's how we get you out of here.

1581
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,960
We repeat that mantra.

1582
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,960
Let's remember that.

1583
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:08,960
Everyone remember our mantra.

1584
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,960
All right.

1585
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:10,960
I'm ending it.

1586
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,960
That's it.

1587
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,960
That's Basin.

1588
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,960
All right.

1589
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,960
Compass books.

1590
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:15,960
Oh, I loved Compass books.

1591
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,960
This seems like a legitimately cool place.

1592
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,960
Yeah.

1593
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,560
I actually was reading about on Yesterland because they had a great affection for it.

1594
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,480
I love a bookstore cafe.

1595
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:30,740
It's funny because paper book sales are now up.

1596
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:36,980
There was a dip, I think, as e-books were catching on, but now as people are so glued

1597
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:41,960
into their devices and stuff, there has been a swing back to like people want physical

1598
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,960
books.

1599
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,960
Yeah.

1600
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:44,960
But there's so few bookstores now.

1601
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,120
There's so few bookstores and these little like outdoor malls, there always used to be

1602
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,120
a bookstore cafe.

1603
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,720
I mean, there's still a Barnes and Noble at the Grove and the Americana.

1604
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,200
And this closed 2012.

1605
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,200
Yeah.

1606
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,200
So it stuck around for a while.

1607
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,200
For a little while.

1608
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,400
I got another store I don't think I ever went in.

1609
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,560
How was the coffee shop, Jason?

1610
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,200
I think it was fine.

1611
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,040
I don't think I had much of a palette for coffee back then.

1612
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,400
But when my parents, my family, visited, we would stay down there.

1613
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,280
I would usually like walk through, read out some books.

1614
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:17,920
I remember there was, they did have a rack and I saw this in the Yesterland pictures.

1615
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,680
There was a rack of like behind the scenes at Disney, including I remember one book called

1616
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,680
Tragic Kingdom.

1617
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,680
Oh.

1618
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:29,160
It was a body cast member stories, including one that was like the college program students

1619
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,520
all live in apartments together and they hook up.

1620
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,520
Oh no.

1621
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,920
Yeah, they're college students like in one building together.

1622
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,920
They're not married.

1623
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,640
Yeah, they're not married.

1624
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,520
They did not remember going to a presentation about like come do the college program when

1625
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,520
I was in college.

1626
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:50,100
And I feel like there was some sort of offhand remark about like curfew or something.

1627
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,960
Why didn't you do it?

1628
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,160
Because for most schools, it ran a full semester plus two more weeks.

1629
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:01,360
So you had to give up half a break or part of a break and a full semester.

1630
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,720
So I couldn't like do whatever winter break or summer break.

1631
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,520
I would have had to give up a semester and part of a break.

1632
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,560
Would you have taken classes as well?

1633
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:13,600
There's like you take a couple of classes and then you work in the parks or somewhere.

1634
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,720
Do you make money?

1635
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,720
You do get paid.

1636
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,720
Yeah, it is paid.

1637
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,480
You would have just given up a, is really the issue here that you would have given up

1638
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,760
a break.

1639
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,260
Well and a full semester too.

1640
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,240
Like as I was going to do, I did a semester in LA.

1641
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:32,020
I couldn't do a second semester out and complete in four years.

1642
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:36,040
Would you have, if you could go do it again, would you have not done LA and done Disney?

1643
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:41,720
I don't, people I know who've done it said it was, they liked it, that it was nice, but

1644
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,200
I don't think I ever got a rousing endorsement.

1645
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,960
I think the people who really like it go into corporate or like stay with the company for

1646
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:49,960
years and years.

1647
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,480
I just dropped out and just hung out at Pleasure Island all of college.

1648
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,760
That was my, that's my fan.

1649
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,240
Every day is just posting to their Facebook group.

1650
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,980
Just going like, man tonight would have been a great night.

1651
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:04,880
There's a Pleasure Island Facebook group and they're all people that work there and party

1652
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,880
there.

1653
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,520
And there's this one guy who every few months will just be like, tonight would have been

1654
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,280
a good night at Pleasure Island.

1655
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,280
Weather's perfect.

1656
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:19,280
He's just sitting in his house with his children, looking at them, going on the Pleasure Island

1657
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,280
Facebook group.

1658
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,920
I wish you were all nightclubs instead of kids.

1659
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,200
I wish you were mannequins.

1660
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,200
I am on the mannequins.

1661
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,200
She had roller skates on.

1662
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:33,360
I'm also on a mannequin specific fan page where people remember mannequins.

1663
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:40,760
And recently a lot of people have been dying from Pleasure Island.

1664
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,040
Well people are, yeah, if they were working there at this, yeah, they're getting older.

1665
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,080
It's like the deaths of despair they talk about.

1666
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,080
Yeah, yeah.

1667
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:53,800
A little more Americans are dying, deaths of despair, which is like suicide, opiate

1668
01:11:53,800 --> 01:12:00,680
addiction, loss of mannequins, mannequins nightclub, sex plane ring being found out

1669
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:01,680
about.

1670
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,680
Yeah.

1671
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,680
Yeah.

1672
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,680
Jeffrey Epstein died a death of despair.

1673
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,680
Yeah.

1674
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,680
We're sorry, Jeffrey.

1675
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:12,080
Your message was love and we didn't listen.

1676
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,680
The message was love.

1677
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,280
Love, Jeffrey.

1678
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,280
Love.

1679
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,280
Love.

1680
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,280
Love.

1681
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,280
Love.

1682
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,280
Anything else on Compass?

1683
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,280
Well, it was very big.

1684
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,560
It took up like that whole stretch.

1685
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,680
That's our love sandwich now is a big footprint.

1686
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,400
Well, yesterday landed the caption wide store.

1687
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,920
It also wide store big boy.

1688
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,440
It also had like a very early California adventure.

1689
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,440
Sun man.

1690
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,440
Yeah.

1691
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,440
How does sun man compass?

1692
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,440
Very angry.

1693
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,440
I don't like him.

1694
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,440
Yeah.

1695
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,280
Piracy kind of cranky sun man with a mustache.

1696
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,400
Even though he looks like my favorite actor, Keenan Wynn a little bit.

1697
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,400
Oh, he does look like Keenan Wynn.

1698
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,400
He's Keenan Wynn.

1699
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:57,720
He's like a grouchy guy who was in the beginning of Super Train and a movie called Laser Blast.

1700
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,720
What Disney?

1701
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,720
He's in like the love bug movies.

1702
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,720
He's Ed Wynn's son.

1703
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,720
Oh, okay.

1704
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,720
Ed Wynn's son.

1705
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,720
Great.

1706
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,720
Yeah.

1707
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,400
And then they start on a Playhouse 90 together about themselves.

1708
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,400
Wow.

1709
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,960
A story that's about their relationship.

1710
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,960
Whoa.

1711
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:10,960
A play?

1712
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,040
Yeah, there was like some story about like Ed Wynn getting cast in a movie that Keenan

1713
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,560
Wynn was in and he wasn't right for the part and he was struggling and then they made,

1714
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,560
they played themselves.

1715
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,560
You did that.

1716
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,560
No, I did.

1717
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,560
You touched that in the middle of my Ed Wynn story.

1718
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,560
I have no way to do that.

1719
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,560
You're talking about Keenan Wynn who I love.

1720
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,560
That's true.

1721
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,560
I wouldn't purposefully.

1722
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,560
Anyway.

1723
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,600
I have to start enforcing these because I have dinner to go to.

1724
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,600
Beyond the metaphysical plane.

1725
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,600
Right.

1726
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,160
You have to get out of here and come back into the underworld.

1727
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,160
I'll be back tomorrow.

1728
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,160
Yeah.

1729
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,160
Island Charters.

1730
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,160
That's where I saw Epstein.

1731
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,160
Oh yeah.

1732
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,160
He's hanging out in there.

1733
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,160
Oh my God.

1734
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,160
Yeah.

1735
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,160
The greatest island charter of them all.

1736
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,360
Models and authentic leather flight jackets, right?

1737
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,560
A lot of Hawaiian island stuff.

1738
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:55,760
When I looked at it, I found the four square page four and the only picture was this man.

1739
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,160
That's an unflattering photo of a man.

1740
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,280
It's the guy in like a fedora and sunglasses.

1741
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,560
It seems like they have boat reproductions.

1742
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,560
Yeah.

1743
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,720
Handcrafted mahogany airplanes from the Red Baron to the stealth bomber.

1744
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,760
He could buy replica planes at downtown Disney.

1745
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,280
This is a store for dad.

1746
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,280
Yeah.

1747
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,280
Right?

1748
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,280
Island stuff, leather jackets.

1749
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,720
Just thinking about a leather jacket he can't buy, but you know.

1750
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,880
And a plane he can't buy, but he can buy a replica.

1751
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,880
Or not.

1752
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:24,880
He can't buy that either.

1753
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,880
No, you can't buy that either.

1754
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,880
Okay.

1755
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,320
Let's go.

1756
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,320
Another big footprint.

1757
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,000
It's now the Wonder Ground Gallery.

1758
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,600
You can buy any number of different size prints of hipster Mickey.

1759
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,600
There are a lot of.

1760
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,600
We'll get to.

1761
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,600
Yeah, they are.

1762
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,600
We talked about it.

1763
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,600
You're right.

1764
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,600
I'm so sorry.

1765
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,600
I forgot where we were.

1766
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,600
Yeah, they are.

1767
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,600
We've talked about it.

1768
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,600
We've talked about hipster Mickey and all the different.

1769
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,600
The guys, Alice in Wonderland.

1770
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,600
The J. Scott Campbell.

1771
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,600
J. Scott Campbell princess.

1772
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,600
Sexy snow white drawings.

1773
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,600
We know.

1774
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,600
We talked about it already.

1775
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,600
We talked about it.

1776
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,600
We did it already.

1777
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,600
Let's keep moving.

1778
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,600
Here we go.

1779
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,600
Kits and kids.

1780
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,600
Of course.

1781
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,880
It's supposedly a celebrity sighting spot.

1782
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,760
Well the main one, the Beverly Hills one was, is what I'm seeing.

1783
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,760
But I think some people came to this one.

1784
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,400
Some people came to this one expecting to see celebrities on Yelp and then they didn't.

1785
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,400
There was a narrative about Kitson.

1786
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:17,120
When I moved out to Los Angeles a little over 10 years or 11 years ago, I recall my mom

1787
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:21,520
when she visited for the first time being like, should we go to Kitson to see the celebrities?

1788
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,420
So there was some general feeling of like the celebrities go to Kitson.

1789
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:29,080
So maybe that transferred to the downtown Disney location.

1790
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:33,280
Just their reputation of being like, as if you were going to, you know, the Brown Derby

1791
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,520
in 1965 or something.

1792
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,520
Kitson.

1793
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,520
Kitson.

1794
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,520
Kitson kids.

1795
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,520
Celebrity children.

1796
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,520
Right.

1797
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,520
So this is what, 10 years ago?

1798
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,640
So what celebrity kids were big then?

1799
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,880
10 years ago.

1800
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,880
You could see.

1801
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,160
Ally and AJ.

1802
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,160
Mm hmm.

1803
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,160
That's good.

1804
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,160
Right.

1805
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,240
The girl from Whale Rider.

1806
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,240
Uh huh.

1807
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,240
Yes.

1808
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,240
That's good.

1809
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,240
Aqua Marine.

1810
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,360
I think it's all more than 10 years ago.

1811
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,520
I don't even know.

1812
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,000
What year is it?

1813
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
What year?

1814
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,600
It's from Leah Obama and Sasha as well.

1815
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,600
Of course.

1816
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,600
Yes.

1817
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,600
Hayley Young.

1818
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,600
True grit.

1819
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,600
Hayley Steinfeld.

1820
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,600
Yeah.

1821
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,600
Quinjane Wally.

1822
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,600
Uh huh.

1823
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,600
Yeah.

1824
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,600
And that's it.

1825
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,600
That's it.

1826
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,600
And that's just about it.

1827
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,640
The ladies and gentlemen, the five famous kids.

1828
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,800
That you would see at Kitson Kids.

1829
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,800
The younger siblings from Wintersbone.

1830
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,800
Lemonade mouth.

1831
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,800
Oh yeah.

1832
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,280
The cast of Lemonade Mouth.

1833
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,280
They were always there.

1834
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,280
Kitson Kids.

1835
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,280
Yeah.

1836
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,280
All right.

1837
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,280
Moving on.

1838
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,280
Haagen-Dazs.

1839
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,280
Oh yeah.

1840
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,280
Haagen-Dazs.

1841
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:49,520
I found this really sad story when they opened a Haagen-Dazs in India.

1842
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,320
They had this promotion where you could only shop there if you had a foreign passport.

1843
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,880
So they weren't allowing Indian people into the Haagen-Dazs.

1844
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,880
No.

1845
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:58,880
What?

1846
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,940
And then it mimics like this British colonial thing where they'd have signs being like no

1847
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,960
dogs and Indians.

1848
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:09,280
And so Haagen-Dazs had to apologize to the country of India for their not thought out

1849
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,200
promotion trying to get foreigners to come in.

1850
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,200
Oh no.

1851
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:18,040
There was a, I just typed Haagen-Dazs scandal into Google and that's what came up.

1852
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,040
Oh my god.

1853
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,040
Good strategy.

1854
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,040
That's really good.

1855
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,640
You should have typed that scan.

1856
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,640
Did you do that for everything?

1857
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,640
I should have.

1858
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,640
I didn't think about it until right at the end.

1859
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,640
Like Build-A-Bear scandal.

1860
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,640
Build-A-Bear scandal.

1861
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,640
I'm going to type it in.

1862
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:33,280
Well, I don't want to speak positively.

1863
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:38,680
I think Haagen-Dazs is usually simple flavors, simple ingredients, always very expensive.

1864
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:44,800
Every now and then I get it on sale, but a little rich for my blood and like not crazy,

1865
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,160
not satisfying enough.

1866
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,160
Mike's excited.

1867
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,160
What's up?

1868
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:52,080
July 13th, 20 to 2018.

1869
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,600
Build-A-Bear CEO apologizes for pay your age disaster.

1870
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,440
That's the closest it is.

1871
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,200
So I'm just excited that that came up for scandal.

1872
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,800
How about kids at a Build-A-Bear party were forced to give their creations to the birthday

1873
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,800
girl.

1874
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,800
Yeah, I see that too.

1875
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:08,800
Wrong.

1876
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,800
Terrible.

1877
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:10,800
Yeah.

1878
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,560
So that's, I'm just excited that this, there's so many scandal things.

1879
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,320
People were really mad about that.

1880
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:19,040
There's a scandal in the next one, but I don't want to interrupt any Haagen-Dazs.

1881
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:24,080
Has anyone here ever gotten Haagen-Dazs like from a, from a not at home, like a walk-up

1882
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,080
location?

1883
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,080
Never.

1884
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,080
I have never done that either.

1885
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:31,680
And they're in most malls, but I'm like, I can't imagine getting a scoop of Haagen-Dazs

1886
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,280
on a cone is alien to me.

1887
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,000
And it's, and I just go all the way.

1888
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,320
I'd rather do like the Rite Aid ice cream and go all the way, go cheaper.

1889
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,320
Yeah.

1890
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,320
I'm a thrifty man.

1891
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,320
Yeah.

1892
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,320
That's good ice cream.

1893
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,320
So sorry to do this.

1894
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:48,480
Outraged parent blasts mother who hosted a Build-A-Bear party for her child and then

1895
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:52,480
made all eight kids who attended give the toys they made to her daughter.

1896
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,520
So the girl got all the pairs.

1897
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,520
All right.

1898
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,520
Anyway, her dad died in Iraq.

1899
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:06,040
Childhood sympathy scandal as twin boys make Jack Ruby bear who takes out Lee Harvey Oswald

1900
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,040
bear.

1901
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,040
Okay.

1902
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:17,280
I'm sorry to say that there is racial profiling involved in the next one, which is blink by

1903
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,280
wet seal.

1904
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:22,400
This is a, that's in, well, I don't know.

1905
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,880
I might've added it later.

1906
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,680
There was in the stones later, keeping the goodies.

1907
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,680
Sorry.

1908
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,440
They were blink might've been the list, but I didn't have a wet seal wasn't anyway.

1909
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,160
It's less blink seems fine.

1910
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:38,560
It's just some boring store where you could buy like a, like a very, we haven't gotten

1911
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,560
there yet.

1912
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:44,800
A sugar boot esque, uh, the sack that says infinite swag over and over.

1913
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,560
So interesting that all of these, like every, so you have to have the same different 10

1914
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,120
rest, like restaurants and we don't want to have our like,

1915
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,720
Cloth inspirational spot.

1916
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:54,720
Yeah.

1917
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,280
So yeah, like they needed that.

1918
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:59,680
And then, but like then you, it is interesting that like a build a bear is in there because

1919
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:03,600
that is sort of an anomaly that comes around and it's maybe more of a fad, but then your

1920
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:11,840
soap store and your sayings store and your glasses store or like those have to be in

1921
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,040
every outdoor mall.

1922
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,520
And then there'll be your fads that'll come and go.

1923
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,600
Makeovers of your children in different slutty ways.

1924
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:24,040
And then of course we'll come in waves, it'll be slutty for five years and then it'll be

1925
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,040
princesses for the next.

1926
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,040
It'll be Olaf.

1927
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,040
Yeah.

1928
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,040
Yeah.

1929
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:36,920
Um, wet seal, the name came from the founder and his wife going to a runway show and the

1930
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:41,360
founder's wife saying about a model, she looks like a wet seal.

1931
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,960
So the name is like an insult.

1932
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,480
And then I think this, it's only retail now.

1933
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:52,040
It all went away and one of the nails in the wet seal empire was that they reached a $7.5

1934
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,520
million settlement with minority plaintiffs who charged the company directed managers

1935
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:01,400
to fire African-American employees who thought they didn't fit the company's brand image,

1936
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,880
which is the Armani look, white blonde hair and blue eyes.

1937
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,880
The Armani look.

1938
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:06,880
Can they call that huh?

1939
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:07,880
There's no other name for that.

1940
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,880
I know when that starts with an A and then an R and then a Y.

1941
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:20,200
And an A and an N.

1942
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,200
Yeah.

1943
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,200
Easy to get them confused.

1944
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,200
Okay.

1945
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,040
So he's just shopped there at the Glendale Galleria in college.

1946
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,040
Wow.

1947
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,040
Your college was so interesting.

1948
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,120
What that part wasn't so much.

1949
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,120
Did wet seal go under?

1950
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,120
Yeah, they're gone.

1951
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,120
They're retail.

1952
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,120
I'm sorry.

1953
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,120
They're, did I say retail?

1954
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,120
They're online only now.

1955
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,120
Good riddance.

1956
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,160
Little mismatched.

1957
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,240
Three socks that don't match.

1958
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,240
I hate it.

1959
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,240
I hate it.

1960
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,240
It's driving me insane.

1961
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,240
It's some shark tank shit.

1962
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,240
I like this review.

1963
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:51,360
I've got quite a few of these socks.

1964
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,600
They speak to my inner child and make me laugh.

1965
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:57,360
I always want to hold onto that youthful feeling even though I'm just now turning 30.

1966
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,360
Again, LOL.

1967
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:05,360
By buying little socks, you hold onto your youthful feeling?

1968
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,360
Yeah.

1969
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:09,080
She just explains that they come in three mismatched socks.

1970
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:13,960
When I'm feeling, quote, kicky, I'll put on two from my favorite set, Fabulous 292 pink

1971
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:17,960
and then match it with another Fabulous 293 mauve or Fabulous 294 green.

1972
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,240
Yes, they have names on them.

1973
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,240
I'm quirky like that, LOL.

1974
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:25,760
You will always find the reviews that read like they're about to segue into I've killed

1975
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,760
before and I've killed again.

1976
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:32,080
Find me Mr. Police.

1977
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:36,160
Which ones I choose depends on how playful I'm feeling.

1978
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,280
You brought a lot of humanity to that performance.

1979
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,120
You could have gotten like sort of like dumber ditzy here, but you're really, I don't know.

1980
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,640
You made her seem thoughtful.

1981
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,600
Socks don't match, but they have reverse color coordinations which kind of match.

1982
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:53,000
If they were like two socks and one of dots and one of stripes, okay, that's fun.

1983
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,720
But the three socks is driving me insane.

1984
01:22:55,720 --> 01:23:02,320
Like I can't, I would just buy two packs of three so I could have three complete socks.

1985
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,320
This guy's this reviews eight paragraphs long.

1986
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,320
Oh my God.

1987
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:10,360
I also see the quote somewhere.

1988
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:15,440
Little mismatched has expanded to include all elements of a girl's life from PJs to pencil

1989
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:19,040
pouches, books to backpacks and wallets to water bottles.

1990
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,300
Do they not match each other?

1991
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,280
Three water bottles, three wallets.

1992
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:28,120
And those are all the elements of a girl's life from pencil pouches to water bottles.

1993
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,120
And that is a life.

1994
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,600
That's that does a life make.

1995
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,600
That is a life.

1996
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,600
That and the Bible.

1997
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,920
Learn to accept death now sooner than later.

1998
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,920
Do not fornicate.

1999
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,280
I, all right.

2000
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,280
Is there anything left?

2001
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:47,280
Well, yeah, wait, I have apricot lane boutique.

2002
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,000
Oh, fuck it.

2003
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,880
It's got a studded peace sign and it says simply become who you are.

2004
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:54,880
Okay.

2005
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,880
I did it.

2006
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:56,880
Yeah.

2007
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:57,880
Ten seconds.

2008
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,880
Can't be mad at that message.

2009
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:07,920
And here we go, the final going out with a bang and get ease and get a signature shop.

2010
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:08,920
Yeah.

2011
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:09,920
Flagship store.

2012
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,920
This was her flagship store.

2013
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,800
This was her flagship store.

2014
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,120
Has she is she in prison?

2015
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,240
Did she ever hear?

2016
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,840
Did she pay for her crimes?

2017
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,040
She was.

2018
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:24,440
I don't think she's ever been disgraced like Thomas Kinkade was.

2019
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,440
Yeah.

2020
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,440
Yeah.

2021
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:30,600
I've been to Thomas Kinkade stores and seeing like a painting of a NASCAR for like $60,000.

2022
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,600
Yeah.

2023
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,600
Why?

2024
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,600
Yeah.

2025
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,440
It was inexpensive and like lush Hawaii settings and how can he afford?

2026
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,800
Mill Valley or whatever.

2027
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,800
Yeah.

2028
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,800
He's dead.

2029
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,520
He is dead, but the company lives on.

2030
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,520
Yeah.

2031
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:47,720
And here in the underworld, all the paint, it's all his paintings, all his new works.

2032
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:52,400
I was in Carmel by the sea and I went into, I saw whenever I see when I got to go in and

2033
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,120
the lady was like, this was his studio.

2034
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,680
Like I was in his actual studio.

2035
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,320
Oh, where he would paint and then Korean around the neighborhood drunk.

2036
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,320
Sure.

2037
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,320
He got a restaurant in Scottsdale.

2038
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,320
Oh, yeah.

2039
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:08,440
He got a restaurant in Scottsdale for drunk driving before he died.

2040
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,440
Jesus.

2041
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:13,600
Well, if you went into Ann Getty's studio, you might think it was a crime scene.

2042
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:20,560
Look at this, like photos is in the store, a bunch of like sleeping baby dolls in East

2043
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,560
Inn.

2044
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,560
They're dolls.

2045
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,200
They're dolls and they're all in little rabbit costumes, alternating yellow and white.

2046
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:31,800
And they're all sitting in half shells, like kind of a creepier relative of the Osa Pia,

2047
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,160
my favorite characters from Tokyo Disney.

2048
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:35,160
Oh yeah.

2049
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,160
Yeah.

2050
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:39,560
This is much more disturbing because it's a bunch of doll faces.

2051
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:42,360
What is the Ann Getty's type of person?

2052
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:47,220
It's like this was, it's like Ann Getty's exists to be a reference or to be like somebody's

2053
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:49,920
job in like a baby mama kind of movie.

2054
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,800
It's like you're not, it's like, I feel like the Ann Getty's type of person is someone

2055
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:57,000
who's not allowed near a normal baby.

2056
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,480
So they can just look at the picture of the baby and the pineapple or whatever.

2057
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,760
And be like, oh, that's what it looks like.

2058
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,360
Very distant aunt.

2059
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:12,360
Is it like sort of how, you know, somebody who really likes to drink beer gets very into

2060
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:17,840
craft beer and knowing about the hops and they have like different types of beer around

2061
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,800
them all the time, where it's like somebody like just wants to always have a baby.

2062
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,880
They have the baby dressed up in different costumes.

2063
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:27,580
You sort of dress up some bizarre obsession that you have in your head.

2064
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:31,240
Why do you think beer people are as creepy as baby costume?

2065
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:34,680
Well, I'm just, I'm trying to draw a parallel between the thinking.

2066
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:40,080
Making your own beer can be a weird thing, but yeah, people brewing their own beer, putting

2067
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:47,640
a baby into a shell, drugging the baby so it doesn't move or just finding a baby.

2068
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,200
And then it's perished.

2069
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:54,240
And before the cops get there, you put them into like a ear of corn costume and then put

2070
01:26:54,240 --> 01:27:00,000
a little corn around it and then take it all away and be like, oh no, this baby is sick.

2071
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
911.

2072
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,040
Then start leaving a beautiful corpse.

2073
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:10,840
You just have to, I think Aunt Geddes was born with this like nefarious superpower of

2074
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,800
knowing where, when a baby has died.

2075
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,400
It's almost like having a police scanner, but it's like a internal and psychic.

2076
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,400
So she can race to the scene, climb through the window, do the little photo shoot, then

2077
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,200
escape and take the costume with her.

2078
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,980
And if you're the parent, you wander into that shop.

2079
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:32,520
She also puts a spell on you so you don't recognize your own child in the photo.

2080
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,000
So this shop is exhibit a, what you're saying.

2081
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,840
It's a through beautiful photos.

2082
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:38,840
The baby's sleeping.

2083
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:39,840
Yes.

2084
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:40,840
Forever.

2085
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,280
Not a bad horror movie.

2086
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,280
Yeah.

2087
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,280
Honestly, not.

2088
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:45,840
Luckily this is by the paywall.

2089
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,880
So not too many people can steal it from you.

2090
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,560
She has to take photos of the babies or else they'll come for her.

2091
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,560
Like they'll, yeah.

2092
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,560
Yeah.

2093
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,480
So it's the only way she can stave off like her dark curse.

2094
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:58,340
This shop had such a central location.

2095
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:00,240
It's now the main Starbucks.

2096
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:05,240
Oh, this shop also only lasted five years.

2097
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,240
That's so weird.

2098
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,640
Like they got it open and they went, oh no, what have we done?

2099
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:11,400
When does the lease run out?

2100
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,440
Like do not let her renew the lease.

2101
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,240
This truly is the scariest photo.

2102
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,240
It really is.

2103
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,240
What are they in?

2104
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:21,240
That's like an FX twin music video.

2105
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,240
Oh yes.

2106
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:27,240
They're like, it says like the photographer who put babies in flower pots, but it looks

2107
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,440
like they're hatching from like egg sacs.

2108
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,440
Yeah.

2109
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:31,520
Like they're xenomorphs.

2110
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,880
Like Baron Harkonnen from the David Lynch's Dune.

2111
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:35,880
Yeah.

2112
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:36,880
She's Australian.

2113
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,880
Yeah.

2114
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,240
And she's married to Kel Geddes.

2115
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,920
Her husband's name is Kel, which sounds Kryptonian.

2116
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,080
I hope to God he doesn't have a tequila brand.

2117
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:51,520
I'm honestly, I've been trying to Google it right now to find out if he has a tequila.

2118
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:52,520
Kel Geddes.

2119
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,520
I don't see a lot.

2120
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,520
Formerly Kel Mitchell.

2121
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:57,520
He took her last.

2122
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,040
Kel Geddes.

2123
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,720
Oh boy.

2124
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:06,560
People make fun of Stedman and like the ultimate, like, you know, lesser than the wife husband,

2125
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,240
but boy to be Kel Geddes.

2126
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,920
I think I'm very jealous of Stedman.

2127
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:14,880
I found Kel Geddes on Instagram, but his account is private.

2128
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,880
He is a branding and media specialist from a 30 year commercial television career and

2129
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,600
he's a Vietnam veteran.

2130
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,600
Kel Geddes.

2131
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,960
I can't make fun of him anymore.

2132
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:24,960
No, you can't.

2133
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:25,960
This is interesting.

2134
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:30,200
Geddes does not audition babies for use as models because she believes all babies are

2135
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,200
beautiful.

2136
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,200
Okay.

2137
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,200
Okay.

2138
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:37,080
And instead she keeps in touch with multiple birth and twin clubs.

2139
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,080
What?

2140
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,080
Twin clubs.

2141
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:42,800
Do you know anything about that?

2142
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,640
And has thousands of photographs on file that parents have sent her.

2143
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,640
Okay.

2144
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,640
Oh no.

2145
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,640
No.

2146
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,640
What?

2147
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,640
No, no.

2148
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,640
No, don't stop sending the photos.

2149
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,680
Send your, send the videos to America's funniest home videos where they belong.

2150
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,480
I found another horrifying one.

2151
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,080
No, no, no, no, no.

2152
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:06,280
Oh, it's like they're rats.

2153
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:08,800
They're rats in nests.

2154
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,000
They're going to eat each other.

2155
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,360
Oh, rat king.

2156
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,400
It's a rat king for babies.

2157
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,760
Whichever one eats the other will be the baby rat king.

2158
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:18,760
Oh, these photos.

2159
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:19,760
Oh, what a monster she is.

2160
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:20,760
Why are you doing this?

2161
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:26,480
Did anyone ever buy, and this is another store where it's like, did anyone, did it go under

2162
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,480
because no one ever bought an item in here?

2163
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:34,080
Like my roommates did have the calendar, the book that she did with Celine Dion where Celine

2164
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,080
Dion is posing with all the babies.

2165
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,080
No.

2166
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,080
What?

2167
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,280
I mean, as a joke, we had it around.

2168
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,280
It was great.

2169
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,280
Oh man.

2170
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:45,280
There's a Celine and Kitty's collab.

2171
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,280
Yeah.

2172
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:49,680
It's like a baby in a flower pot and Celine Dion is there.

2173
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:53,520
I know you have to leave Scott, but I just found the Anne Geddes dolls on eBay.

2174
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,240
I really got to leave.

2175
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:59,240
Like look at this.

2176
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:02,240
Oh boy.

2177
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:03,840
Anne Geddes dolls.

2178
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,080
I don't know if they're making them now.

2179
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:06,680
This is only $33 though.

2180
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:12,880
When you look her up on Wikipedia, it says Anne Geddes MNZM, which if you click, what's

2181
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:13,880
that you click on it.

2182
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:18,800
It's New Zealand order of merit, but just the capital letters jammed together seem like

2183
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,320
Nixxiom, the, the Ballyss and Mack cult.

2184
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:27,480
She's got Alex Mack's name branded on her vagina.

2185
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:31,280
Every baby, if you get them out of the shell, they're all branded.

2186
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,840
Alice and Mack, not Alex Mack.

2187
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:33,840
Not Alex.

2188
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:34,840
She has powers.

2189
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:42,120
I saw her in a, I saw Alice and Mack in hair in the, in Burbank when she was in high school.

2190
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,120
I just found out.

2191
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:48,320
She was in it in the, I saw my friend in it and then he was like, Alice Mack was the lead

2192
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,640
in that hair that you saw.

2193
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:56,880
I just saw her on a one of the worst failed pilots in the, in existence, which is it's

2194
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,680
called Shangri-La Plaza.

2195
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,480
And it is a show all about a strip mall, not too far from where we are right now, like

2196
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,600
in North Hollywood.

2197
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:10,160
And it's so it's like all the, like the tire store guys and the donut shop people and everybody

2198
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,600
in the strip mall hangs out and it's she's in it.

2199
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,680
Melora Harden is in it.

2200
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,640
And it is all a musical.

2201
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,640
It's a music.

2202
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,880
They only made one.

2203
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:26,400
It's see it's very, I wonder if one killed the other or something, but grotesque, horrible

2204
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,400
and the worst things I've ever seen.

2205
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,400
And I looked up who did the music.

2206
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,880
I was so disappointed to find out the guy who did the DuckTales theme.

2207
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:36,200
One of the greatest songs of the century, a show about a mall that's a musical and all

2208
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,760
the songs are about the guy who did DuckTales.

2209
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,760
It's so awful.

2210
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,760
It's awful.

2211
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,760
It's awful.

2212
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,760
And Alice Mack is part of it.

2213
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:43,760
So evil.

2214
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:48,800
How about these dolls where babies are the flower pots and get these dolls.

2215
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,240
You are about to witness a great becoming.

2216
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:58,760
I want, I always thought it'd be funny to do like an adult flower pot photo shoot, like

2217
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:01,160
shirtless, we'll do it.

2218
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,160
We'll do it.

2219
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,160
Get it together.

2220
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,160
Just get the costumes.

2221
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,160
We'll be there.

2222
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,560
We got nothing better to do.

2223
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:11,320
I'm worried that in we're like 10 months away from Mike going, you know what?

2224
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:16,080
I kind of like the and get these photos full of and get these dolls.

2225
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:18,880
You get a doll's doll meets a friend.

2226
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,320
The dolls are more likely for them than the photographs, I think, because I'm going through

2227
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:27,080
and I'm going, well, some of these I could, I could like, there's this one, like a butterfly

2228
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:28,240
that looks good.

2229
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:31,440
Show me that and then tell me again that it is good.

2230
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,440
Hold.

2231
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,440
I didn't say it was good.

2232
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:36,980
I'm saying like, I could see if I could work my way into thinking it was good.

2233
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:39,320
This is not going to help me this picture.

2234
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,320
He's touching a finger.

2235
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,720
No, it's like realistic wings and antenna.

2236
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:45,720
That's not good.

2237
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:46,720
I don't know.

2238
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:51,800
I'm not saying I like it yet, but you're maybe we're not far.

2239
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,440
We're born of booty sauce.

2240
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,000
Um, sick, awful.

2241
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,740
So the store went away.

2242
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:05,640
The story is the store went away because Geddes is now concentrating more on photos inspired

2243
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,360
by nature and pregnant women.

2244
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:09,400
That's what they say.

2245
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,640
And they were insistent that the store is doing very well.

2246
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:16,260
It is not on a, we're not kicking her out.

2247
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:20,720
She has chosen to go right because she's doing different photography.

2248
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:24,800
It seemed a little insistent to stay, to say all that in a press release.

2249
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,800
Bad.

2250
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,800
Yeah.

2251
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,080
Definitely not that only seven photographs were ever purchased.

2252
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:33,440
I'm trying to find Anne Geddes scandal, but nothing's coming up.

2253
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,160
It's all you got to be in New Zealand.

2254
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:41,640
It's all, uh, uh, again, night islands where nightmares occur.

2255
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,960
Does Anne Geddes have an island?

2256
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,640
It's called New Zealand.

2257
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:45,640
She rules it.

2258
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:46,640
She's royalty there.

2259
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:50,560
She's got the merit prize, which is worse than Nixxiom.

2260
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:56,640
Some, uh, oh, so I'm on Anne Geddes website and it says 7 30 2019.

2261
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,640
Hi all.

2262
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,720
Some exciting news regarding Anne and her body of work.

2263
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,720
Hi Kel.

2264
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,080
Husband, of course, Kel Geddes.

2265
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:07,600
Last weekend, Geddes LLC has gone on to be successful in this year's greater London enterprise

2266
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,600
awards.

2267
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:13,000
I am delighted to confirm that Anne Geddes LLC has been awarded the following most innovative

2268
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
children's photographer 2019.

2269
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Ooh.

2270
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
So she's still winning awards.

2271
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,880
Is she putting them in new things like Minecraft towers?

2272
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:22,880
I don't know.

2273
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,880
The jewel sticks.

2274
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:32,320
Uh, this is awful.

2275
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:33,360
What?

2276
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,720
We need to get out of the underworld as fast as possible.

2277
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,240
Oh, there's an Anne Geddes credit card.

2278
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:42,880
You can get the, now that's my way in.

2279
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:47,720
What kind of rewards can I get for this?

2280
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:53,000
I'm going to go to Japan on my Anne Geddes points.

2281
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,880
You're not going to be allowed back in the country.

2282
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,440
Anyone who gets this card is put on a list.

2283
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:04,760
A childless man in his thirties carrying around an Anne Geddes credit card.

2284
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,760
Sorry, you cannot come in the country.

2285
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,720
These babies in the cabbage, uh, like in a cabbage patch.

2286
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,720
I want it right now.

2287
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,000
Welcome to Cabbage Patch Cuties.

2288
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:20,360
The podcast hosted by one childless man in his thirties with an Anne Geddes credit card.

2289
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,240
And I talk to myself too.

2290
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:26,520
You still say I'm my girls and Jason Sheridan is not here.

2291
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,520
I was there.

2292
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,520
I was out here.

2293
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,520
I left long ago.

2294
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,520
But we're here father.

2295
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,520
You must be perfectly still from the photo.

2296
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,640
Take us out of the wallet.

2297
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,640
No.

2298
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:40,360
You'll never go, will you?

2299
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:43,240
There are so many different designs.

2300
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,000
I need a new credit card.

2301
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Oh my God.

2302
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,320
And then there's a philanthropic trust cards.

2303
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,800
We're watching Mike's turn.

2304
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,800
It's happening.

2305
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,840
It's going to happen way faster than 10 months.

2306
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,360
Yeah, no, I didn't know.

2307
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:57,360
I was high balling it.

2308
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,080
Look at all of these cards.

2309
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,080
Great.

2310
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,880
It's just the visas.

2311
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,880
Burn them all.

2312
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:03,880
Yeah.

2313
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,880
That is a lot.

2314
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:05,880
And then there's black and white.

2315
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:06,880
Black and white.

2316
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,800
Those are the philanthropic ones where you like rewards go to charitable situations.

2317
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,760
Yeah, and get his fucking bank account.

2318
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:15,760
All right.

2319
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:16,760
Let's get that.

2320
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:17,760
We don't get to leave.

2321
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,760
All we have to do is say goodbye to you.

2322
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,760
I get to leave.

2323
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:22,760
Oh.

2324
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:23,760
So.

2325
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,760
Are you sending me back to earth?

2326
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:27,760
Yeah.

2327
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:28,760
I think you have passed the test.

2328
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:29,760
I think you get to go back there.

2329
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,920
Two hours of talk culminating in creepy baby photos.

2330
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,760
Now I can actually say, Eva Anderson, you survived podcast the ride.

2331
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,760
I did.

2332
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,760
The first.

2333
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:42,760
Thank you for saving me.

2334
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:52,120
We're so glad we made it feel like a more virtuous quest to talk about three sock stores.

2335
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:56,040
And yeah, thank you for being.

2336
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,040
Now you wait.

2337
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,800
Now you can exit the underworld through the gift shop.

2338
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,800
Hold on.

2339
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,920
And Eddie's has her own line of costumes you can buy for the children as well.

2340
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:03,920
I knew that.

2341
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:04,920
That's the end of it.

2342
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:05,920
That seems like a given, Mike.

2343
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:06,920
Buy that.

2344
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:07,920
Guys, you'll never believe it.

2345
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:08,920
Put Duffy in the closet.

2346
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:09,920
You'll never believe it.

2347
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:10,920
Put Duffy in that.

2348
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:13,480
Oh, that's a good idea.

2349
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,000
We need to tip Lindsay.

2350
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Keep tabs on.

2351
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,960
If you have the credit card login and you see the words and get ease with the with the

2352
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:23,840
two hundred seventy dollars of spending Duffy in the mermaid costume.

2353
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:24,840
Yeah.

2354
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,760
That's a it's an orange mermaid.

2355
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,960
That's with that's an awful costume.

2356
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:30,400
Give me the business card.

2357
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,400
You're not allowed to have it now.

2358
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,400
Oh, God.

2359
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,520
Put Duffy in a ear of corn.

2360
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,520
All right.

2361
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,520
Fair enough.

2362
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,520
Anyway.

2363
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:41,560
I'm glad you interrupted the item is appearing.

2364
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,560
Oh, yeah.

2365
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,560
Well, we have exit.

2366
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,560
Wait.

2367
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,560
Well, I don't know.

2368
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,560
We can do them both.

2369
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,560
Let's do them both.

2370
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:50,160
Are you seeing the same one as me?

2371
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:54,560
I'm seeing a thin mint cookie bear.

2372
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,640
Full of organs.

2373
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,800
Yeah, I'm seeing it, too.

2374
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:01,800
Wow.

2375
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:02,800
It's wonderful.

2376
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:07,720
So we can use either the organs or the costume or the.

2377
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:10,200
It's oh, it's scented, too.

2378
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,120
Maybe we can use a we can.

2379
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,120
Somebody spent the four dollars.

2380
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,920
Yeah, I guess the sector keeper did.

2381
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:16,920
Thanks, sector keeper.

2382
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:22,640
He upgraded on he's holding a little and he's holding two little cloth turds.

2383
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,280
So this is a lot of gifts and one we can see.

2384
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,600
I'm sure we'll be able to use this against a future boss.

2385
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,720
But Eva, you won't be here to see it.

2386
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,280
We're going to send you on your way.

2387
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:35,200
As I was saying before, we found out about a baby mermaid costume.

2388
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,520
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2389
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,480
Do they do makeovers?

2390
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,480
All right.

2391
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:43,360
Wait, we have to send it.

2392
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:47,280
We'll send you back upwards with the mantra.

2393
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:50,640
Basin is now.

2394
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:54,480
Basin is now.

2395
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:59,360
And she's like that.

2396
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,360
And she's gone.

2397
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:06,480
We're still stuck here till tomorrow when we face the final boss in the under

2398
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,160
worlds.

2399
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,160
Keep following us.

2400
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:16,160
Hashtag DDO, hashtag Save the Level Keeper, hashtag Sector Keeper, Cricket Wireless Severance.

2401
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:22,960
And we'll see you back here in the underworld where you have very intelligently chosen to

2402
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,000
pay the money to make sure that we're safe.

2403
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,480
Tell all your friends who didn't come to the underworld to do the same.

2404
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,039
We'll see you back here tomorrow.
