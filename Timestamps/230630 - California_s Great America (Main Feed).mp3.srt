1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:15,160
Warning, the following podcast contains musicless carousels, Survivor, The Ride, late period

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,400
Stan Lee characters, and the empty promise of meeting an old prospector.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,880
All this plus Scott's trip to California's great America.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:49,080
On today's podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,240
Welcome to podcast The Ride where we know you can't spell make America great again without

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
great America.

9
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm Scott Gerger, I'm shown by my Carlson.

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,400
I wish I could say you're wrong, but you're not.

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
It's just true.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not making any assertions politically.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,400
Either way, Jason Sheridan.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,920
Folks, there's two.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,680
There's one in Santa Clara, there's one in Gurney, Illinois.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,080
It doesn't make any sense.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,780
I don't get it.

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,780
But I do now.

19
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,780
I do now.

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,960
Sloppy branding, sloppy branding folks.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,960
The Marriott Company drops the ball again.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Messy Marriott.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,600
Messy Marriott.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
This did answer my question.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,200
I was like, how do we end up with two great Americas?

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
I never knew.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I know.

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Really confusing.

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,440
I mean, we could talk about this for a second here.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,880
Today we are talking about California's great America, which I didn't realize was the official

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,920
name.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,240
It's gone through different owners being that first word in the name, but California's

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,200
great America, technically the name.

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,360
This is one of those things because I always have trouble sorting out the great such and

35
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,120
such parks because there's a lot of those at Six Flags.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:07,040
It's great escape and great adventure and then great America too.

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,720
I thought, what is up with that?

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,800
This is not Six Flags great America, but there is a Six Flags great America.

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,560
I didn't know why, but it's because they both started at the same time.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,280
That was the brand name was great America.

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,120
Because they were both started by Marriott.

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Isn't that a weird thing in general that Marriott had theme parks?

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Yes.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,760
Also, it's funny how quickly they're like, we don't want this anymore.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,960
Pretty fast.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,000
It's late 70s.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,160
They're putting these up by early 80s.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
No thank you.

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,800
What surprised you about it?

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,320
That other than it was not just an easy print of money or did you just realize we are hotels

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,720
and that is what we are?

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, it's a good question.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,640
It makes sense that a hotel company would say, hey, let's add some rides.

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
I suppose so.

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,280
It makes sense in that way.

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,640
They build places, they build buildings which you need in theme parks.

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,560
That said, the Marriott brand is pretty sterile I would say.

58
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,840
I have no particular associations with Marriott.

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Red letters.

60
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,400
The letters are a little bit like Disneyland.

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,320
Kind of medieval looking.

62
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,720
That's probably why they thought of it.

63
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,140
They're looking at their own logo and they're thinking, wait, you could put a silly kid's

64
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,040
word in this font.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
There was a Marriott hotel.

66
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,000
I mean obviously there's Marriott's everywhere.

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,840
There's a Marriott hotel by the airport that we would sometimes go and buy like a pool

68
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,800
day pass and just go swim in the pool.

69
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,560
I don't know why we did this actually in hindsight.

70
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
You can do that.

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,600
There's apps now to get day passes.

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Oh yeah.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
To tell you where you can go.

74
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,200
In preparation for Vegas, I found an app too to get on guest lists for different pool parties

75
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,800
and club events.

76
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,840
You can filter it by decibel level.

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
There is a loud.

78
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,400
If it's blittingly loud, you can dial in exactly the number.

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,280
I think there's a Sunday night late, like loud pool party that I'm the most excited

80
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
about.

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,160
I believe it's a Sunday night.

82
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,260
So I'm trying to get a, I think I had signed up for the guest list by now.

83
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,040
So yeah, I'm on, I've seen those apps and I'm on a different app.

84
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
I'm looking at all the apps.

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,280
Why are you the most excited about it?

86
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
I don't know.

87
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,840
It just is, I like, as I've said, I like being in a pool with a lot of loud music.

88
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,640
You have a couple of drinks and I don't know, I like being in the water.

89
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,560
I like it when it's very, I like it when it's really warm, like being in the water.

90
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,760
And you still like this in a, in a more germ conscious era and post COVID.

91
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Outside.

92
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm not going in like the middle of like a massive humanity somewhere, but like.

93
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,720
But at some point there's a bro peeing on your knee.

94
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,320
Well if that's, I'm getting out of the pool.

95
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
I see something.

96
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,280
Well if you see it, but you're never going to see it.

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
That's how it gets you.

98
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,000
That's the tax you pay to get like a super soaker of like well vodka shot in your mouth.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Cause there's kids peeing.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,320
You got to insert some bro pee.

102
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,480
There's kids peeing in the family pool.

103
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
No I agree.

104
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Yeah.

105
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
That's always a concern with pools in general.

106
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
You're in pee.

107
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,680
It's no, there's no, there's no debating it.

108
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
What's happening when you were.

109
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,400
It's just a matter of is there like drugs in the pee?

110
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,800
And at the party I'm talking about, there will be pee full of drugs.

111
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,080
Are you worried that it's going to get into your pee mixed with your pee and let's say

112
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,160
you suddenly have a job interview that requires a drug test.

113
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
I know that.

114
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,200
I know that happens to you all the time.

115
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Commercial auditioning.

116
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,840
Don't they very often give you a drug test to make sure you can be in the commercial?

117
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
That's true.

118
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,600
And because of my filthy drug users and ads of any kind.

119
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,440
Because I'm in my thirties, my urethra has widened too, which will let in more pee.

120
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Or is going to water it in.

121
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Yeah.

122
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,040
Oh, you're leaving yourself wide open.

123
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,360
Vegas pee will enter my urethra.

124
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,200
So yeah, that is now that you say that that's a concern.

125
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,960
So I could just like sit in sort of like a bench or something and enjoy from afar.

126
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,280
So it's up to you.

127
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,080
I'm not going to tell you your life.

128
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
I'm just, again, I'm approaching with confusion because I still struggle to understand.

129
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm just curious why this one was there like a photo?

130
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,800
Is there a particular DJ like Marvin, Marvin Globe?

131
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,280
DJ Marvin Globe is spinning at this one.

132
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,400
I would be excited to see DJ Marvin Globe, but no, I'm actually the novelty for this

133
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,200
one for me is that it's at night.

134
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,060
Oh, that's the reason.

135
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,060
For me.

136
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,060
Yeah.

137
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,060
Generally these are during the day.

138
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,040
So that's what is exciting to me is like, well, what is it like at night?

139
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,760
Is this one on a roof?

140
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
I don't know.

141
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Oh, okay.

142
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
That's a good question.

143
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
I'll look into it further.

144
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
We'll click again on the app.

145
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Roof, not roof.

146
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Make sure that's clicked.

147
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Yes.

148
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,800
I want the roof.

149
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
The roof is more fun.

150
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Yeah.

151
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Whereas I prefer pool with like free water and music at a very reasonable octave.

152
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
I do too.

153
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Yes.

154
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
I like that too.

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
But I mean, it takes all kinds.

156
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
It takes all kinds.

157
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
It takes all kinds.

158
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm so excited to discover Vegas that is readily available as an option.

159
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
What is?

160
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Pool.

161
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,520
It's like, oh, you can get water so you don't get dehydrated.

162
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,920
The music is very low.

163
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,840
You're shocked by the presence of pools in a city of hotels?

164
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,880
No, no, like chill pool.

165
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,240
I think I had mostly been hearing him.

166
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Were you ever surprised that there are chill pools in a city that's nothing but hotels?

167
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,320
No, I guess that's not what I was saying.

168
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,720
I was afraid that I would end up like, oh, this hotel is pretty nice.

169
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,000
Is the pool going to be annoying?

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,640
And it wasn't.

171
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Which is it?

172
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Which one are you talking about?

173
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
A specific hotel?

174
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,000
Park MGM is mostly where I stay.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Gotcha.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,400
I don't think Park MGM has a douchey pool party.

178
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,880
They have a high, they have a different like club that is a pool club that's like closed

179
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,160
right now where they would have like the DJs DJ.

180
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
But that one is-

181
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Is that at Nomad?

182
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
DJs DJ.

183
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
As opposed to Jersey Shore cast members.

184
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Right.

185
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,320
I mean, the pool was all open so early.

186
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:23,200
So in the morning they're playing very low light jazz and then as the hotel wakes up,

187
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,600
then they play clubbier music, but it's not overwhelming like Mike likes.

188
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Yeah.

189
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Well, but I'm saying this, the place they had the Nomad, whatever, that's actually,

190
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
the music is louder, but it's much more chill.

191
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,040
It's not like, okay, it's not an annoying wave.

192
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,960
That's the hotel within a hotel.

193
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
But you want annoying.

194
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,520
Annoying is the box that you're checking.

195
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
No, I understand that.

196
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,880
I'm telling Jason for future if it was open.

197
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
I do like the annoying thing.

198
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
I like both.

199
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm a man who I contain multitudes.

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,320
Come see us in Vegas though.

201
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Yes.

202
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Oh, please.

203
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,080
Vegas Rides Big Vegas Groove Blender, which at the moment does not have a water component,

204
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280
but we are open to it.

205
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
If there is demand-

206
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
I'm open, yeah.

207
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,480
We can discuss with the venue the possibility of flooding the venue.

208
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah.

209
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
I would be for it.

210
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,740
It might be in their best interest.

211
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,720
They might want the Space LV where you can buy your tickets.

212
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,960
The spacelv.com might want to become a water venue.

213
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,420
July 22nd.

214
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,320
If they know what's best for them.

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, July 22nd.

216
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,040
But that's a trip that's in our future.

217
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,680
I am excited to talk about a trip that is a little bit in my past because not only are

218
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,800
we talking about California's Great America and talking about some very interesting shifts

219
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
of ownership.

220
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,200
If you're a fan of shifts of ownership info, oh, this one.

221
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,180
What park has ever had more shifts?

222
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:44,120
But also it is a bit of a trip report episode because I went up to California's Great

223
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,080
America a couple of weeks ago, a family vacation, which was very delightful.

224
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,240
The most ambitious family vacation that I have tried, the longest trip that I've taken

225
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
in a little bit.

226
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,160
It's the first in a long time that I've had to get out the big suitcase.

227
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,040
All of my trips have been small enough for the small suitcase and I got out the big suitcase

228
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,120
and in cleaning it out, I found a receipt for the Schomburg Bahama Breeze.

229
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,720
Oh, can you remember?

230
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
We were different.

231
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,120
Man, there were so many less children in the picture.

232
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,360
So many less bouts with COVID-19.

233
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,040
Zero at that time.

234
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,000
Multiple now in this group and for the world.

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,240
So I harken back to a more innocent time, but with a kid in tow.

236
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,640
This was very exciting for me.

237
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,840
His first flight, that was a big thing about this, which went really well.

238
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,440
He's been talking about planes ever since, planes that pass by, which you might hear

239
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,400
in the recording of this episode with an open garage door.

240
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,800
Try to not mind it if you hear a plane.

241
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,040
Instead of about my son's excitement, who every single plane he's seen since then, he

242
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,160
has said, that's my airplane.

243
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Oh, wow.

244
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
He's taking ownership.

245
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Yeah.

246
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Knows the planes.

247
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
He knows which plane he was on.

248
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,080
He knows the Southwest colors.

249
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,160
A huge experience in his life.

250
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,720
So I'm coming from that one.

251
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,760
He gives rave reviews to the general experience of riding on an airplane.

252
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,600
So that's a big landmark taken care of.

253
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:27,200
In general, this trip was done partially because, let me take you back to the land of last summer.

254
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,240
Anyone who subscribes to Club 3, our VIP Patron-on-tier, if you saw the video that I put together on

255
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,160
Twitter, you know that my wife, Erin, and I last year took a day trip there and back

256
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:48,720
in the same day to San Jose, California, where we went to rent a car, take it through a carwash,

257
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,440
which looked like an old riverboat in Campbell, California, which is one of the adjoining

258
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
cities.

259
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,280
San Jose, Campbell, Santa Clara, and then a bunch kind of in the same district.

260
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,640
Legitimately one of the best days of the marriage of our lives.

261
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,480
It was so great up there.

262
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,400
And we noticed a myriad of family entertainment while up there as well.

263
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,220
So the gears were turning.

264
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,560
This might be great to do with the boy.

265
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,840
Could be great to do as just as a very easy, unambitious flight because you got to love

266
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,400
that much like Las Vegas, one of those like you're in the air and then you're down within

267
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
the hour.

268
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,720
Good for a kid who's skittish about flying.

269
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,840
And also like a great area where the airport is not in the bizarre place really far away

270
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,200
where airports always have to be in big cities.

271
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,320
A bummer about traveling in general, right?

272
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Doesn't that always that's a real kick in the morale.

273
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,000
I feel like when you're excited to get to the city and then like, oh, God, where is

274
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
this airport?

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,720
Yeah, it's never as close as you want it to be.

276
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
No, but rarely.

277
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Yes, yes.

278
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,400
And in San Jose, it is I don't know what it just this area has a hold on us for some

279
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,200
reason, especially after two really pleasant trips.

280
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,320
And in the lead up to it, a lot of people were definitely asking why, though?

281
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,880
People from there were asking, why are you going to San Jose for four nights?

282
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,680
And some of that was the lack of ambition that it's just, well, it'll be a little mellow.

283
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,940
And we had we had some family up there who we got to visit, but also a ton of family

284
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,340
friendly stuff in the area, as discussed in the previous episode, the world's largest

285
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,980
Chuck E. Cheese, where we got to take him.

286
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,900
And I'm going to put a pin in that and talk about that in a future thing.

287
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,100
I'm also going to put a pin in Gilroy Gardens.

288
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,980
You guys heard of Gilroy Gardens before?

289
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,300
Is that that's unfamiliar?

290
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Yes.

291
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,380
It was new to me, but I watched some videos about Great America and one or two of the

292
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,420
mentions Gilroy Gardens because the Cedar Fair connection.

293
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,020
And the previous Cedar Fair Connect.

294
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
Yes.

295
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,020
Cedar Fair used to own them.

296
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,620
It's a park way south.

297
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:05,060
Basically, I always it was always framed to me as a garlic themed theme park.

298
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,940
I now have been there and that's that's not exactly right.

299
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,940
That's not the whole picture.

300
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,300
I'm going to put a pin in that and talk about that down the road to the city of Gilroy,

301
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
California.

302
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,980
Is is there big marketing is that it's garlic capital?

303
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,980
Yes.

304
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,980
Yeah.

305
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,220
Sometimes of the year, I think you drive by and even just in passing by.

306
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
It smells.

307
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,220
Reeks of garlic.

308
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Yeah.

309
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
Not so much when I was up there.

310
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,220
So it might maybe it's not all year round.

311
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,220
But again, I got more Gilroy Gardens thoughts.

312
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,620
I'll get into that later.

313
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,740
Also really close to Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, where we got to go only 45 minutes away.

314
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,380
We had to go on a day where there were no rides open.

315
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,300
So I have nothing to say about those dark rides.

316
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
That sounded really great.

317
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,820
I love talking about those a while back.

318
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:57,660
But you remember how that place had like the those they were built to be like like speaking.

319
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:04,940
Speak of the devil, like a big dirty pools for 1920s people to just kind of like big

320
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,020
baths, basically the height of entertainment back then.

321
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,900
You had to stand around in a big bad.

322
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
I don't know.

323
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,140
They hadn't invented the word douchey.

324
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,300
And I don't think they were calling it a pool party.

325
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
But you might have.

326
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,060
I Mike, you might have liked being around back then.

327
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,020
I bet I would have with like your loud decibel, decibel splitting ragtime.

328
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
Ragtime.

329
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,020
Now, Jason can get into something like that.

330
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,100
Some piano, some loud piano where he's partying like raging.

331
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,500
Sure. In that case, they just have to like blast that through the biggest horn in the world.

332
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,100
That's like how little can we funnel that thing into the piano?

333
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,260
And how do we have to build it like a hundred times bigger than any tuba?

334
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,020
Just blast that through the hole.

335
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,300
That's not what it is anymore.

336
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,700
There is a pirate themed mini golf that might be the best mini golf I have ever done.

337
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,580
So I find that like animatronics climbing up a rope.

338
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:04,820
There's a really that goes up and down like Disney caliber climb cycle.

339
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,420
If even a Disney.

340
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,060
Hey, you know what? Indiana Jones stays in one place.

341
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,860
He doesn't climb. So this thing climbed many, many feet.

342
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,780
Wow.

343
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,300
So I was impressed by that projections.

344
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,380
Whole thing. So cool.

345
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,420
So that's that's just all, you know, some of the background of of being up here.

346
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,860
Well, one more thing I want to mention, I got to spend some time at a mall called Valley Fair,

347
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,980
a gigantic mall up there that is a super fancy mall.

348
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,620
First of all, Italy got an Italy there.

349
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,060
This is like the opposite of some malls die and just descend into.

350
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,620
There's only three things open and one is the army and one is the Navy.

351
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:53,460
But some some just get gifted by the earth, like all the like fanciest restaurants.

352
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:03,740
So this mall thriving packed huge, so big, in fact, that it is on the exact border of San Jose and Santa Clara.

353
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,020
And it splits down the middle.

354
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,820
Like, so there's entire districts of the mall in one city and then another,

355
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,860
which I don't think ever had much bearing on anything until in 2014.

356
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:23,660
And NPR did a story about this. San Jose elected to up the minimum wage.

357
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,100
And Santa Clara stayed at what it was.

358
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,380
I think that was eight and the other was ten great amounts of money.

359
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,580
But two dollar minimum wage on San Jose side.

360
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,860
So if you worked on the San Jose side of the mall doing essentially the same job,

361
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,100
and it's literally down to like shoe store over here, shoe store over here.

362
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,340
One is eight dollars an hour. One is ten dollars an hour.

363
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,620
In one case, there was a gap that was split.

364
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,700
It was right on the line that was split down the middle.

365
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,060
And the gap had to call one of the cities in question and say, what do we do here?

366
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,660
And they said, well, you got a couple of options.

367
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,220
One, you could log employees time on either half of the store.

368
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,940
Like, all right, how much are they on San Jose?

369
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,340
How much are they in Santa Clara?

370
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,540
Is men's in San Jose or is kids in Santa Clara?

371
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,140
How do you log that?

372
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:22,060
Which I mean, they ended up choosing the option of just raising the wage for everybody.

373
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,540
Thankfully, the gap made the correct decision.

374
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,460
However, I do really I wish that they had had to operate for a while

375
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,820
with the logic of like that you could be folding a sweater on the exact line

376
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,020
and you have to calculate the effort and time that it takes to get each sleeve.

377
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,460
Or do you just fudge it?

378
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,340
Do you like always do you do any work that you got to do on the San Jose side?

379
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,620
Yeah, I think that worked to your benefit.

380
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,100
Yeah, you would have to fudge it.

381
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,060
You would try to do everything you could on the more.

382
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,540
Yeah. The higher paid.

383
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,460
Well, I guess it's like if an employee or if a customer needs help, like, excuse me.

384
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,140
And then you got to go like, yeah, yeah, I gotcha.

385
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,220
Over here, please.

386
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,660
Yeah, on this side.

387
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,380
Yeah, no, but I'm looking at some shirts over.

388
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,860
Yeah, no. Bring them over here, though.

389
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
Yeah.

390
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,580
Or you go and like move the whole rag, just drag the rack into the other side and go,

391
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,260
yeah, so here we go.

392
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,020
That's a good move.

393
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,900
That's a good like employee revolts.

394
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,580
Assuming the managers would not stop is just like get everything.

395
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,540
Oh, yeah. Over there.

396
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,820
Yeah. Maybe it's just like one kind of like dumb stooge employee

397
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,380
who doesn't realize what's going on.

398
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,340
Yeah. And you leave him to like,

399
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,460
I think it needs more sweeping over there in Santa Clara.

400
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,700
I see some dust bunnies.

401
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,340
OK, yeah, whatever you need, skip.

402
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,100
Poor guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

403
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,860
Sweet Santa Clara dummy.

404
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,220
So funny. Anyway, that's just that's some of the oddity

405
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,380
that I got to like like truly great for days.

406
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,220
Recommend the area in general.

407
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,900
But great America, the main reason to go and also

408
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,340
something we haven't talked about with in getting to great America,

409
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,740
there is a ticking clock.

410
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,500
We don't know how ticking it is.

411
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,580
We don't know how fast it's ticking. Yeah.

412
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,620
But a bizarre announcement was made that the land has been purchased.

413
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:22,180
They are going this park will be no more in two years, in five years,

414
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,620
at least 10 years, unless it all goes away,

415
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,100
unless they decide this plan isn't happening or there's a big economic hit

416
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,140
or something. I'm not sure.

417
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,860
But a we a Jay Leno tonight show level bizarre

418
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,540
too ahead of time announcement that great America will be retiring.

419
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,660
All right. Prologis, it's yours, buddy. Yeah.

420
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,780
Hey, you make it make it number one, just like I did in five years.

421
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,260
It's going away and rather go out on top.

422
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,980
This park, we have to say, is no Johnny Carson.

423
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,980
So Cedar Fair sold the land to Prologis, Prologis,

424
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,740
a sinister sounding real estate concern.

425
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,140
You know? Yeah.

426
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,140
If they have a lot of real estate in Silicon Valley and everywhere,

427
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,940
then that's who? Yeah, probably not.

428
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,260
Yeah, shady. I bet.

429
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
But who knows?

430
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,860
And so I'm interested in this kind of conflict at how weird it is

431
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,380
where it's like Cedar Fair owns the park, Prologis owns the land.

432
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,540
This had been kind of the case in the past where like Santa Clara,

433
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,540
the city of Santa Clara, owed the land and then so and so around the park,

434
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,180
you know? Mm hmm.

435
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,260
But yeah, they've been in this situation before when Marriott,

436
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,980
when yeah, cowards Marriott got cold feet and bailed on the whole thing.

437
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,780
I'm never staying at a Marriott.

438
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,300
I do. You can't trust them.

439
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,140
You can't bail on me staying there.

440
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,780
Yeah. They showed me out the window.

441
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,500
They're quitters. They're quitters.

442
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Yeah. You work in Marriott.

443
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,940
You work in Marriott corporate.

444
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,940
We're on to you.

445
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,260
There's a couple of things at play.

446
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,700
One, this is the way they talked about Six Flags Magic Mountain

447
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:11,220
back around 2008 or so that that land was going to be turned into condos.

448
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,260
Oh, OK.

449
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,700
It just never happened, which could potentially Great America

450
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,580
could be saved because the city of Santa Clara, I think, has said like

451
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,420
that land is only, you know, zoned for theme parks.

452
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,700
Oh, but well, but they couldn't have like that.

453
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,940
They I feel like there's already discussion of other things will be there,

454
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,980
of offices or whatever. Yeah.

455
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,620
I imagine there's there's possibility they're not going to build another theme park.

456
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,420
Surely. But one of the other hurdles they've had to deal with over the years

457
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,620
is the overflow lot for the theme park is the parking lot for the stadium

458
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,220
where the 49ers play. Yeah.

459
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,580
Levi's Levi's Stadium.

460
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,940
Yes. Which you see when you park there.

461
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,300
But it's right up to it.

462
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,780
Well, which is maybe a good thing for

463
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,500
offices or residences, right?

464
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,300
To be where the action is.

465
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,580
Yeah. To potentially 49ers.

466
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,140
I mean, because then you can get one of those like, what's that thing in Anaheim?

467
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,860
They're building, they're building like, I mean, it's we're going to get some new

468
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,460
shop or attainment district.

469
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,580
Yeah. Like I forget what it's called outside of the pond,

470
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,820
which is not the pond for many years, but it's got the dumbest name I've ever heard.

471
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,380
Yeah, we did an episode on this.

472
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,060
We talked about it came up.

473
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,940
Yeah, it was definitely part.

474
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,780
We haven't done a whole episode about the forthcoming Anaheim

475
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,820
entertainment district.

476
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,300
What's the name? It's so silly.

477
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,540
I mean, I'll try to find it.

478
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,100
Yeah, because there already is something down there.

479
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,020
Like there's a Golden Road Brewery and there's a lot of apartment buildings

480
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,340
right next to the Angels Stadium,

481
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,460
which has multi-use parking lots for the convention center for theme parks.

482
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,060
You can build the world's largest Golden Road if you demolish Great America.

483
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,140
Oh, that's true.

484
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,900
Yeah. The entire.

485
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,020
Yeah. The whole thing.

486
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,380
Brewery. Yeah.

487
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,100
One video I watched said that on the days when there are games,

488
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,140
they cannot open Great America.

489
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,540
Oh, really? Yeah.

490
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,180
Oh, I've been to Levi's Stadium for WrestleMania 31.

491
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,860
Oh, sure. Oh, really?

492
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,260
Yeah. Ah, so I've been there for.

493
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,540
How was the venue?

494
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,060
It was very new at the time, so it was it was cool.

495
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,980
So it was high tech, like pretty high end stadium.

496
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,540
Yeah, I think it was a big pain in the ass.

497
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,140
Like it felt like they hadn't gotten there, like

498
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,380
letting people in protocols down.

499
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,740
Because we're like outside for like hours, would felt like.

500
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,820
But then it was fine when we were in there.

501
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:52,100
That what I was looking up is called OC lowercase vibe, all uppercase.

502
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,940
And but not an eye and exclamation point.

503
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,380
That is what the mark our words.

504
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,820
There will be so much analysis of OC vibe when OC vibe is open.

505
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,140
Yeah, it's going to it's going to be a whole year.

506
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,500
And one thing for sure, OC vibe, it's definitely going to open

507
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,340
and it's definitely going to open like in that initial pitch in concept arts.

508
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,620
Yeah, yeah. These projects always come to fruition.

509
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,260
Exactly how they say they.

510
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,060
Uh huh. Yeah.

511
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,980
Look better than they did in the concept art.

512
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,500
Every business runs fantastically.

513
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,540
Jason, yeah, you don't want to run afoul of the same

514
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,460
Toontown grass people that are going to be mad at you for judging a place

515
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,300
based on blue sky concept art.

516
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,380
Oh, that's true.

517
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,460
So there's going to be people defending that strip mall.

518
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,580
I just want to warn you.

519
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,220
Well, due to the due to recent

520
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,340
mergers and finagling events, the those people are the

521
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,980
saw the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia bringing you OC vibe.

522
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,060
No, that's not true.

523
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,980
OK, I don't know.

524
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,060
It could could be possibly.

525
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,540
So you're saying it is going to open exactly like it looks.

526
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,180
They're going to get the PGA tour.

527
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,580
They're going to get OC vibe.

528
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,940
Oh, yeah. All the prize assets.

529
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,620
By the way, I was in Toontown a couple of weeks ago

530
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,060
because I wanted to make sure I finally saw the whole thing.

531
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,340
There were still walls up by part of the grass.

532
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,500
What?

533
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,540
I think they've come down like days later, but I went there.

534
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,180
You still haven't seen all the grass.

535
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,100
I saw some new grass, but I don't want to derail us here.

536
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,300
Well, again, we'll put a pin in that.

537
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,260
But then I was like, but there's walls up for this other grass.

538
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,740
Yeah, it's like late May.

539
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,980
What's going on with this grass?

540
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,900
I also I don't want to derail either, but this is was part of my day.

541
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,180
I part of my day at Great America was solo so that I could do grown up stuff

542
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,060
while the kiddo napped and then mom and kid joined.

543
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,540
And and we did kid stuff.

544
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,500
And what I will say, the most lit up he was the entire time

545
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,700
there was when we found the simple pleasures of a plot of grass.

546
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:03,940
And it was the same grad, the most artificial in the planet Snoopy area.

547
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,900
And he was going nuts and a lot of kids were going nuts.

548
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,860
And it was not lost on me that it is the grass making him go nuts.

549
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:20,820
But again, then I would go, OK, so these Disney diehards are getting militant.

550
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,900
They are canceling me slash us because we aren't super on board

551
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,100
with something that Great America planet Snoopy has had

552
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,260
for probably 17 years or so.

553
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,340
This is Disney's innovation.

554
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,460
You know where they have a big plot of grass?

555
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,780
The Empire Center, the big outlet by where we live.

556
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,380
There's the and that.

557
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,700
Yes. Well, yes. A big chess set, which my son loves.

558
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,700
But you know what?

559
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,260
Yeah, you know what it is? OK.

560
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,020
Grass and a big chess set.

561
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,300
You know what Disneyland had the one that had open?

562
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,140
I haven't seen the new grass, but the one that was in question at the time.

563
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,260
You know what it had grass and no big chess set and nothing to do.

564
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:06,060
And yet people all the grass, I will die for the grass.

565
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,460
And it didn't even it wasn't even up to the caliber of what the

566
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,260
boring Empire Center's had for probably over a decade. Yeah.

567
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,500
And where are these?

568
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,420
Why don't these people have like their dis Twitter?

569
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,140
But why aren't they imp Twitter?

570
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,220
Well, we should be.

571
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,780
We're at a better.

572
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,460
That's up to us to be.

573
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,660
Yeah. Yeah.

574
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,380
And Disneyland is out of the excuse that Great America has, which is

575
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,020
appears to be, you know, I've only seen it in photos and videos.

576
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,940
Long stretches of asphalt.

577
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,180
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

578
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,420
It's not all the most charm.

579
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,140
It is in a very charming area, I will say.

580
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,740
And if you were on any ride with elevation, then there are,

581
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,900
you know, nice lush hills to look at and parts of the park feel pretty nice.

582
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,740
But other parts are very like,

583
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,220
you know, state fair, like just big open tract.

584
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,140
I'll I'll talk about my experience a little bit.

585
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,380
Do we want to get some things out about the history of this place

586
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,540
beyond the history that is that is doomed?

587
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,340
And then we will discuss whether or not the doom is justified.

588
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,020
If we need to save this thing, if we need to rally against prologists

589
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,380
and blow up the headquarters like cyber nine, do we need to do?

590
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,260
We need to save this blessed plot of land.

591
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,780
But but first, history, anything we're excited to talk about

592
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,580
or that you learned about the history of this place?

593
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,300
Well, the the Carousel Columbia.

594
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,540
Is that what it's called? Yeah.

595
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,540
It's a two story carousel.

596
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,860
If you've probably seen it and not realized you've seen it,

597
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,140
it's been in lots of TVs and movie.

598
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,260
Lots of TVs and movie TV shows and movies.

599
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:59,180
I think that's very charming entryway, like a nice fountain and trees and stuff.

600
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,500
Like that always looks pretty good.

601
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,300
Kind of an interesting counterpoint to a lot of those former paramount parks

602
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,500
have the kind of Wonderland, which we just talked about, has the big mountain.

603
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,860
Others have the are the, you know, Eiffel Tower replica.

604
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,180
Yeah, yeah.

605
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:21,060
But similar in that there's a big like kind of reflecting pool kind of thing.

606
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,820
That's the big, you know,

607
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,700
whatever landscaping to draw your eye and the logo kind of

608
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,500
like in the bushes and the topiary form.

609
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,020
And then, yeah, I agree.

610
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,340
This carousel is really nice looking and a really great entryway.

611
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,380
And so they have the same thing at the Six Flags one.

612
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,060
Do you see you recall this?

613
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,900
You went there somewhat, right?

614
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,620
A couple of times.

615
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,180
OK, not as many as I should, because I was scared of most of the rides.

616
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,940
But yeah, I went a couple of times.

617
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,540
I did the tune stuff.

618
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,260
But yeah, yeah, this is basically the same.

619
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,220
OK, that's my memory of it.

620
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,060
Very confused about that.

621
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,780
You know, we we copy and paste this same history.

622
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,660
We just did it with Canada's Wonderland, any of the King's Parks,

623
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,420
King's Island, King's Dominion.

624
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,580
There's been so much recapping of it was Taft broadcasting.

625
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,820
And then it was

626
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,220
and then there was a Hanna-Barbera deal.

627
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,220
And then it became paramount.

628
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,420
And then and Cedar Fair took it over.

629
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,260
So it's some of the same steps of all that.

630
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,180
But with the confusing thing that it was instead Marriott at the beginning.

631
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,820
And then there was a divorce like the parent trap.

632
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,300
Yeah, one child went with.

633
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,580
Wait, wait, what was it first?

634
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,060
One child went with Kings and the other child went with Six Flags.

635
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,060
Right. And they weren't allowed to see each other.

636
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,540
And I hope that they can get together some day and other adults

637
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,740
bring their parents, but the Marriott Corporation back together.

638
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,220
Yeah, that would be nice.

639
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,420
Wouldn't it be nice if Marriott could buy them back?

640
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,340
Yeah. Yeah.

641
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,020
Bring it all back.

642
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,020
Full circle. It's really gnawing at me that they're that it's

643
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,460
it's just not as it was supposed to be. Right.

644
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,340
These are in their in their blood.

645
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,260
These are Marriott parks and it drives me crazy that they don't get to.

646
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,420
Keeps you up at night.

647
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,020
I can't speak to the Six Flags one, but I will say, having been like,

648
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,220
you know, a regular Kings Dominion goer when I was a kid.

649
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,820
I think the different it it just seems like there's a little more care

650
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,620
put into the design in Kings Dominion and Kings.

651
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,260
Like you can kind of see just looking at pictures and videos that like,

652
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,580
oh, someone else built California's Great America.

653
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,460
Like, it's just a little less thoughtfully planned out.

654
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,580
It's a little less themed.

655
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,460
You know, you can kind of tell it's had a lot of owners

656
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,460
because like a lot of stuff has changed or been updated.

657
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,980
You know, that is accurate on the ground.

658
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,540
I will say I was wondering that.

659
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,940
I mean, we can go back and forth between history and and my story.

660
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,940
And I what you just said, Jason, about like that entry way

661
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,580
and you're going to pull and you get that two story carousel, which is very like

662
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,300
that's a good theme park icon.

663
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,580
They couldn't do a castle.

664
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,940
They couldn't do anything really showstopping, but it's a really nicely kept up.

665
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,980
It feels like, you know, that that nice big building on Catalina or something.

666
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,820
Just kind of like, oh, yeah, you know, kind of classic or historic,

667
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,820
even though it was only built in 76.

668
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,380
This is a 76 park, I believe, bicentennial mania.

669
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,420
I think is why it is great America.

670
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,100
Yeah, 76. I'm fairly certain.

671
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,620
But you go in and that looks really nice and it looks really nice in photographs.

672
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,420
And it's what they stress on the website.

673
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,620
And you see it in films like Beverly Hills, Cop 3.

674
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,940
They use that.

675
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,140
This is the park where that was filmed or all the exterior stuff at least.

676
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:53,100
And then as soon as you get past that, once you get around that carousel,

677
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,580
you're like, oh, no, it's a six flag.

678
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,020
Oh, shit.

679
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,260
It's like that is a facade, like that is a wall for a minute,

680
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,300
keeping you away from what's behind it and keeping you in the state of like,

681
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,580
this is maybe a nice little Northern California gym.

682
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,420
And I can't wait for my son to join me and see all of the wonder and charm.

683
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,540
Oh, no, shit, shit, shit, shit.

684
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,500
This is trash.

685
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,300
There are 40 competing signs.

686
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,900
All the music doesn't make any sense.

687
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,460
It's like a left. I feel like for a lot of it, there was just a loud

688
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,660
midi of Europe grand old flag.

689
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,500
Oh, so annoying.

690
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,940
Booked a ticket up there, though.

691
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,420
He loves the cool party music.

692
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,700
I'm a big patriotic.

693
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,860
I love I love that song.

694
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,980
I'm a big Mass Effect guy.

695
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,820
I know.

696
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,460
Like, oh, they were putting pins and things as the theme.

697
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,900
We're just regular.

698
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,460
So many things like we're voodoo conspiracy theorists.

699
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,500
It's like this episode is a voodoo doll.

700
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,180
But yeah, truly, I like it is a really disappointing thing

701
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,300
because you're around the car and like I here's I have the sense

702
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,700
that this was a charming place at various times.

703
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,620
I think when it was kind of a relatively non-corporate park

704
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:15,300
in the 70s and in bicentennial era, I bet it was really nice.

705
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,780
I got a shade of that when, you know, it was really nice to do

706
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,740
was a skyway type ride.

707
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,500
They had like a gondola sky buckets kind of ride.

708
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,620
Eagles flight, I think it was a patriotic name or as I think it has

709
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,460
a different name depending on where you board.

710
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,180
But I was really looking forward to that.

711
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,700
I'd really like to do one of those because those those barely exist

712
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,540
anywhere. They don't have them at Disneyland.

713
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,540
And the building that I boarded from had a really nice wood carved eagle

714
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,660
that felt very American adventure or even like critter country or something.

715
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,780
I was like, well, this little corner and there's some forest back there.

716
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,540
Like like this corner of the park feels a little Disney to me.

717
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,700
And so I think if whatever you found in the late 70s

718
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,140
probably was very charming.

719
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,540
My mother in law, Dan, I think really enjoyed this place as a teenager growing up.

720
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,860
I bet there was charm in the 90s Paramount era.

721
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,500
I know you like you like those parks. Oh, yeah.

722
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
And like there's something fun about this.

723
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,660
We're just talking, you know, the the chance that a cling on could be

724
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,620
on the coaster next to you.

725
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,860
I think they like pumped a little bit of life into all those parks

726
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,660
and seemingly this one, too.

727
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,260
So I think there's been eras of this place. Yeah.

728
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,420
But I don't think this on death row era

729
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,580
is necessarily one of them.

730
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,740
It's very funny that so many of them, it's like you got to ride

731
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,860
the suspended coaster flight deck.

732
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,300
And it's like branding looks really familiar.

733
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,380
And you look it up, it's like, oh, it used to be Top Gun.

734
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,180
Yes, it's another one of those.

735
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,660
I forget how many of these there are in this world.

736
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,900
But another where it was a Top Gun ride and now it is called Flight Deck,

737
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,020
which seemed very good.

738
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,140
But I did not go on this coaster.

739
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,580
I did not go on a lot of coasters and it was not for lack of trying.

740
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,780
I to my credit, I know you might put me in the WIMP category

741
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,700
as you would have any right to do given my history.

742
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,500
However, I tried. I definitely tried.

743
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
Did you go on anything resembling a coaster?

744
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,860
I did. I went on Patriot.

745
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,580
In course, and with the thing I had to prove that I am one. Right.

746
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,500
And appropriately, I was in line next to a guy

747
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:33,060
with a T-shirt with drawings of you might think I'm going MAGA with this,

748
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,020
but in fact, I'm going T-shirt with Joe Rogan and Crystal Leah.

749
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,260
Well, why are they like everybody in that podcast?

750
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,860
Yeah, anybody? Everybody in the Avengers of the I'm just asking questions.

751
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,300
I'm not sure. It was more the comedy side.

752
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,860
There could have been a Theo Vaughn.

753
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,940
I didn't know.

754
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,060
Oh, sure. Really hard to I did not stare at this man's chest.

755
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,460
I think he is a person who would not have been comfortable to see this shirt.

756
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,140
I bet it exists.

757
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,060
I bet the right Googling would, you know,

758
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:10,260
Rogan, Delia, all stars of comedy and thought and wow,

759
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,180
I'm going to find them and not not having your mind in a cage, man.

760
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,380
That's what you Google.

761
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,980
Patriot, though, I liked a lot.

762
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,180
Brave for me, I would say there's loops and there's corkscrews.

763
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,780
And it was a five on the famous

764
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,260
Cedar Fair one through five. Oh, OK.

765
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,540
Fear rank or thrill ranking scale.

766
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,140
So I did a five.

767
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,020
I would like some high fives.

768
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,100
OK, yeah. Is that the scariest coaster you've ever done?

769
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:43,940
I wouldn't say so.

770
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,740
It was not as intense as that the one at

771
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,540
not that I was suddenly brave enough to do.

772
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,860
I bet one's probably the most and it's no it's no rock and roll or anything.

773
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,140
It's like fairly.

774
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,060
I hope that flight deck is probably a little more ambitious.

775
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,620
And some of the other ones.

776
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,100
Did you see the there's a single rail coaster there

777
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,980
open in 2018 called Railblazer?

778
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,540
It has a red track that looks really insane.

779
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:19,460
Yeah, the way it moves, like even just on video, it's like, oh, wow.

780
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,820
That looks odd.

781
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,300
I got to I that maybe had to book a flight because it's just like,

782
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,500
I haven't even only done one or two of those single rail coasters.

783
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,860
Yeah, I've had trouble getting my head around what those are and how they work.

784
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,100
And but it's yeah, it's it's wild.

785
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,940
I mean, it feels very it feels like it's 3D printed or something.

786
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,540
It just seems so fluid and precise and and, you know,

787
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,620
bendy, twisty in a way.

788
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,180
You've never really seen a coaster be.

789
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,700
It moves so fast in such a way where you're like, is it out of control?

790
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,020
Are those people in trouble?

791
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,540
Yeah, that was not a candidate for me.

792
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,740
I was not going to do that one.

793
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,980
I really wish I had done a ride called Gold Stryker.

794
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,100
And I was even attempting to do it.

795
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,900
It's right at the entrance.

796
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,340
And it seems kind of in the family of Ghost Rider.

797
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:19,300
It's it's wooden, but pretty like hefty and crazy.

798
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,180
It's not a seaside kind of wooden coaster.

799
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,620
It's it's it's a big boy.

800
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,100
We're talking about a big boy here

801
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,460
where it goes really fast, 53 miles an hour, I think,

802
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,140
which is almost in credit coasters, top speed.

803
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:38,300
And I got into the line for it even where the first drop really thunders past you.

804
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,900
It's wild, like the sound you're hearing over and over again is intense and scary.

805
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,460
But I wanted to do it.

806
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,780
I swear I wanted to do it.

807
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,340
This just became a case where, OK, one of the one of the like pleasantries

808
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:59,300
of other parks that this place is lacking are accurate signs of wait times.

809
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,820
Nor is there like an app, I don't think that's really telling you anything.

810
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,940
So you're just trying to eyeball it.

811
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,740
And I even passed by this right at the entrance.

812
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,740
And I saw a sign that said, wait from this point, two hours.

813
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,860
Like, no, I'm not going to do two hours,

814
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,700
because this is also the kind of place where the you are not exactly

815
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,660
getting top tier queue entertainment.

816
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,820
We can debate about skippable queues.

817
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:29,060
I would say I would I would love it to see the defense of most of the queues

818
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,460
at a place like this or in fact, a six.

819
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,460
It's not what they do.

820
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,620
It's not what they're in the game for.

821
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,660
That's not their bread and butter. No, no.

822
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,940
In fact, in the I did stick with it for a while.

823
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,940
I was in the line for a while.

824
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,460
I tried to take in some of the queue entertainment,

825
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,860
which the only one I remember was the music video for that song.

826
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,380
It's a quarter after one.

827
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,580
I'm a little drunk and I need you now.

828
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,340
Who does that?

829
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,260
Yeah. I don't know.

830
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,100
I don't know. It's out there.

831
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,740
It's on all the time, but I don't know. Yeah.

832
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,540
I didn't feel like watching the music video and I scarcely see

833
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,140
how it is relevant for a ride. Lady A. I was right.

834
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,140
Oh, that's a lady. Yeah, I see.

835
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,500
Is that now is that from post a or was it when there was a pre a when it was the pre a?

836
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,060
I think Antebellum was your old name.

837
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,060
Don't say it.

838
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,500
Oh, it's not the solo artist who was already called Lady A.

839
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,740
All right. They took Lady A. Yeah.

840
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,700
Yeah. There was no other way they could have.

841
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,020
They should just they can't just gone a lady.

842
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,980
We're a lady. A plus lady.

843
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,380
Yeah, that would be good.

844
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,300
I like the name of that.

845
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,140
That's like the name of a like a covers band that would perform on a riverboat.

846
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,380
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A plus lady.

847
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,300
Anyway, I wanted to do this, but was there a front of the line pass option?

848
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,820
This occurred to me when I was deep into my park visit.

849
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,740
I was too deep. I went and asked.

850
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,300
It was one hundred dollars.

851
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,580
A little steep, I think.

852
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,140
I think I could have done that for much less.

853
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,940
Really good triple A deals for this place also.

854
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,580
So that's a little probably sent a podcast to ride press email.

855
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,700
Yeah, like I'm a little that angle. Yeah.

856
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,980
Yeah, I know a story about the it's called the dying days of great America.

857
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,580
We want to come see how shitty it's got.

858
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,900
They love that kind of coverage.

859
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,580
Go any presses, good press, you know, 100 percent.

860
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,660
That's true.

861
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,660
Hunt Ghost Rider is 56 miles per hour at knots.

862
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,100
Wow. Wow.

863
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,140
Because I guess it's scary.

864
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,300
It's really scary.

865
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,700
Oh, that was an I think the more I shaking, I think, is the thing

866
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,460
that still freaks me out on.

867
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,100
I don't like the rickety.

868
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,860
Yeah. Yeah.

869
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,020
When Jason and I went on Ghost Rider the first time, it was like the speed

870
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,020
kept increasing and kept increasing and the whole thing is vibrating.

871
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,300
Which doesn't feel good.

872
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,820
Yeah. Yeah. It's a good it's a fun ride, but it's scary.

873
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,340
There's there's also the the Cedar Fair trend.

874
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,740
And maybe I'm just a worry word on this, but like

875
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,780
you put your bag in this little cubby hole, this Ikea furniture

876
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:21,660
cubby hole and the thrill of will it be there when I get back?

877
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,380
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

878
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,860
I do this so seldom that I forgot the D.

879
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,260
I had a visor with me.

880
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,660
What am I to do on my with my visor on a patriot?

881
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,500
I already forgot the name.

882
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,620
I yeah, but I thankfully there was no visor.

883
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,620
Sure. Oh, OK.

884
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,700
I was that was when I tried it down the pants.

885
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,500
There was a moment where I before I realized there were cubbies,

886
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,740
I was trying to shove the visor down my pants and loop the visor velcro

887
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,980
and through my belt loop.

888
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,700
Belt loop. Yeah, belt loop.

889
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,700
That was usually safe.

890
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,860
I used to do that when I was younger.

891
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,860
Big fanny pack.

892
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,660
I mean, I would have had to exit the line.

893
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,580
Yeah. Then try to maybe ask Mr.

894
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,860
Rogan D'Alia to loan hold my spot.

895
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,900
Oh, I thought he had a fanny pack on as well.

896
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,860
And that maybe he would give it to you.

897
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,700
Yeah, yeah.

898
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,260
He's probably plenty generous.

899
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,460
If I'd explained, I was a podcaster, too.

900
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,540
Oh, yeah.

901
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,540
You know, you might say I'm kind of in the same scene with those guys.

902
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,980
Yeah, you are.

903
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,820
Yeah, we use microphones, too.

904
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,380
We've been meaning to.

905
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,100
We've been meaning to have D'Alia on.

906
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,420
We really kind of it's like we always think about it.

907
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,380
And then like, I hear he's a big parks guy.

908
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,900
Like, yeah, those guys are controversial.

909
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,220
But a couple of weeks ago, we said that we didn't really care

910
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,380
about the jungle cruise at Disneyland.

911
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,020
So it's sort of a similar situation.

912
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,740
Well, we're saying things that like the public doesn't even want to utter.

913
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,940
Yeah, we said we said an episode was about Canada's wonderland.

914
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,820
And then we mostly talked about Deloitte's.

915
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,300
That's the kind of shit we'll do.

916
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,500
That's the crazy.

917
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,420
That's I'm curious.

918
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:06,140
I am curious if we if we missed anything about Canada's wonderland that was crucial.

919
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,380
There's got to be some there has to be some juncture in this show that is like

920
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,140
a like a it's not the sieve.

921
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,540
What catches thing a bucket beneath the it's like a bedpan.

922
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,380
Yeah, the podcast, the ride bedpan is what we'll call the episode

923
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,220
where we catch all of the loose droppings from topics that we

924
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,500
doesn't that sound pleasant to do?

925
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,180
I think it should be.

926
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:31,620
Look, I've been advocating for doing all the episodes we've done already.

927
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,340
Do it again before we get to things like Space Mountain.

928
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,900
I've been saying this for years now, and I think you just stumbled on a perfect

929
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,860
framing device for it.

930
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:44,100
Oh, yeah. So the drop to like like a fight, like big fight.

931
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,980
Well, no, but the bedpams saying Scott just came up with a good branding.

932
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,860
It's like what did you say?

933
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,500
Don't act like the two is a new idea.

934
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,180
You just thought you guys are begging for twos.

935
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,820
You're playing.

936
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,780
We love it.

937
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,500
But I like your waste metaphor to your waste.

938
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,580
When you can't get out of bed, I call it too.

939
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,100
When you could call it a bedpan.

940
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,500
Yeah. Call the mind someone who's better at extra droppings.

941
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,820
Yeah. P.T. It's P.T.R.

942
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,380
Leavings. Yeah.

943
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,420
Look what else plopped out of this topic.

944
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,980
Great. Indiana Jones.

945
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,420
Buckets full parentheses are

946
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,260
semi colon.

947
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,380
And then, yeah, the Leavings podcast, the right Indiana Jones

948
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,700
pocket, sorry, presents Indiana Jones, the ride

949
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,140
lawn clippings on clip.

950
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,500
The ride is in there, even though it's that is the right in there

951
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,100
because it's in our title or we're recalling it suddenly.

952
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,700
Indiana Jones, the ride.

953
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,460
You know, that's the great thing about blue sky.

954
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,900
And there's no bad idea.

955
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,100
And you know what that shows that we haven't talked about Indiana Jones

956
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,740
in so long. I forgot what the name of it is.

957
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,300
I have to go back over it back before we do a bunch of other stuff

958
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,540
that is essential to cover on this show.

959
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,940
Mm hmm. Yes. That's what it proved.

960
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,660
I thought it just topic number one.

961
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,780
What is the ride's name?

962
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,300
This episode cannot move forward until we get clarity on that.

963
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,940
Yeah, we didn't probably talk about it enough on that first episode.

964
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,300
We don't we just blast past to the names.

965
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,740
We kind of say them and then we move on. Big mistake.

966
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,100
But we should we it's possible we could spend a good

967
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,500
half an hour of every episode just saying the name.

968
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,660
Yeah. And pitching other names. Sure.

969
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,700
Yeah. Blue Sky, it leaving money on the table.

970
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,940
Yes, we are. OK.

971
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,820
But basically what happened here was I just like there.

972
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,860
I was meeting back up with the family again.

973
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,180
And it was it seemed clear to me from the imprecise signs.

974
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,220
I had not yet reached the sign.

975
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,060
Then who knows if I could trust it, the sign that said there is 60 minutes.

976
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,260
I passed by the 90, but I had not passed by the 60.

977
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,780
Kids going to be here soon.

978
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,340
I don't want to be like daddy's got Coaster and to do

979
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,020
was that worth it to me?

980
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,220
I wanted to go hit the grass with him.

981
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,300
So I had to bail on Goldstriker.

982
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:03,620
But I and and I had put a lot of eggs into the basket of another ride.

983
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,700
Again, heading for it.

984
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,980
The closer. Oh, possibly.

985
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,420
Can I say real quick, Goldstriker has like an old prospector

986
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,420
on like the logo for it, which I really like.

987
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,500
That is enticing, of course.

988
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,420
I like that. But why are they playing Lady A videos?

989
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,460
I know that's the case.

990
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,020
No, it should be like, you know, like that should be what the vibe is.

991
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,940
It would be the easiest.

992
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,700
We could take a day and all of us take turns.

993
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,940
We only buy one pair of overalls, one beard.

994
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,260
We don't need a shirt because we would only wear the overalls. Right.

995
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:40,540
We just the three of us just looped through different prospector

996
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,860
themed pre ride videos. Yeah.

997
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,340
You know, bucket of props, a bunch of gold coins,

998
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,620
maybe a lightweight mine cart pickaxe, whatever it is.

999
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,020
We would knock out 10 in a day and distribute them.

1000
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,300
I would do it for free.

1001
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,540
I do it out of the kindness of my heart. Yeah.

1002
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,020
And I feel like I we would have to do it for free,

1003
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,180
knowing the going rates for theme park entertainment and videos.

1004
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,900
But it seems it's inexcusable that you have a prospector in your logo

1005
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,780
and not a prospector in a video.

1006
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,700
100 percent.

1007
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,020
How could they should be responsible for this should be the Cedar Fair.

1008
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,740
People should be more ashamed than the Marriott cowards. Of course.

1009
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,900
This is this is this is shameful.

1010
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,900
And we could fix all of this within a week or two. Yes.

1011
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,580
Oh, yeah, we can turn this place around.

1012
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,660
Maybe that's what we have to make.

1013
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,340
We got to put our any six flags.

1014
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,140
We could do it, too, by the way. Yeah.

1015
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,180
Because we've said this before.

1016
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,340
This is not some like classist thing.

1017
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,300
This is just like a major corporation with millions of dollars

1018
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,460
decides to let things rot.

1019
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,220
And then it's seeming as inconsistent and incoherent.

1020
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,780
The money's going elsewhere.

1021
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,940
It's going to weird roller coaster haircut

1022
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,100
of ventures and to clearing up lawsuits and stuff.

1023
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,300
You get a little bit safer.

1024
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,100
Yeah. Lift that morale a little bit.

1025
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,460
And what's going to lift the morale more than a lot of great videos?

1026
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,380
Reprogramming of music.

1027
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,580
Mike, I know you want to get in there around in Riddler's zone

1028
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,220
and make sure that Batman Forever soundtrack is blasting.

1029
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,900
Meet and greet with Chase Meridian caught out.

1030
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,260
Mean with Chase Meridian for sure.

1031
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,700
I'll probably have to record sound delights for the songs

1032
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,260
because we probably get sued if we they don't want to pay for Kiss from a Rose.

1033
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:23,100
So well, that's well, I, you know, I was going to say Lady A is playing.

1034
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,140
Well, that's true. That's a real.

1035
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,220
But that's that's some licensing. Yeah, you're right.

1036
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,260
That's true. Possibly.

1037
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,260
So maybe it would be fine.

1038
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,380
This is through, by the way, was through

1039
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,300
whatever in-house entertainment provider was

1040
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,540
is getting the chance to do the right videos, which is called Fun TV.

1041
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:45,260
So Cedar Fair made a deal with Fun TV, who made a deal with Lady A. Right.

1042
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,220
But I don't know what Magic Mountain's doing.

1043
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,540
I don't know if they have a deal with a fun with a fun TV competitor.

1044
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,820
Oh, man, that's a good question.

1045
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,100
We got to figure out if they do, because, yeah, if they if they have fun,

1046
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:59,100
TV has a deal with the flaming lips to do,

1047
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,700
put bad days from the Batman or the offspring for Smash It Up.

1048
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,140
I don't know. Is there an offspring song on there to smash it up?

1049
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,820
I believe. Yeah.

1050
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,460
To smash it up, factor into the film.

1051
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,620
The song is in the movie.

1052
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:18,260
I believe when Robin takes the Batmobile for a joyride.

1053
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,820
Oh, briefly hear it as he like pulls up or something.

1054
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,100
But it's not a big featured thing.

1055
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,460
Wow. So you could you might call it Smash It Up.

1056
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,780
Robin's theme. Yeah, you should call it that.

1057
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,900
Robin's Rebellion.

1058
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,660
The The Flaming Lips song is in the is in Riddler's Hideout,

1059
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,700
which is really a fun. That's very prominently.

1060
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,700
Yeah. Yes.

1061
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,540
I remember when the flaming lips were getting more popular and like,

1062
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,540
do I know this band? Sure you do.

1063
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,660
They're in the Riddler scene. Of course.

1064
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,980
Certainly, you know this.

1065
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,980
OK, I feel like I missed something.

1066
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:56,100
I mean, I started getting into my day and I'm about to land at where the

1067
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,340
where my boy arrived.

1068
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,100
But I want to make sure we don't miss a couple of things history.

1069
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,220
Yeah. Why? Oh, well, I got a not late enough one.

1070
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,100
Yeah. At least in terms for us. Yes.

1071
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,100
So one of the companies that

1072
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,980
Marriott splits into eventually becomes that airport

1073
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:22,660
company, HMS host, and an early iteration of it was the same.

1074
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,460
Was the one running those cheers bars that we talked about.

1075
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,740
Oh, that's why we know HMS host. Yeah.

1076
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:34,740
I will for sure remember that in 30 minutes this time.

1077
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,180
You're still getting to make some room in my brain.

1078
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:42,180
Marriott Services Corporation is very confusing.

1079
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,260
There is so many Marriott

1080
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,180
Marriott companies at one point or another.

1081
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,140
This is I don't want to derail, but you're more of a Sheridan than Marriott.

1082
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,100
Family. Yes.

1083
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,500
Uh, sure. I feel like we're more of a Hilton family.

1084
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,460
It's a little on the nose for us to say.

1085
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,340
No, boo. Just say you're a Sheridan family.

1086
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,980
It's where we're sharing. OK, great.

1087
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,540
Yeah, you're Jason Sheridan.

1088
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,900
That's what people want to hear the other part. Yeah, great.

1089
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,740
That's all right. Now everybody's excited.

1090
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:13,100
Hampton Inn Holiday Inn Express give you free breakfast and, you know,

1091
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,100
I mean, a great breakfast, too, I bet.

1092
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,700
Oh, and it's good. The wettest eggs you've ever had.

1093
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,260
I'm out of breakfast.

1094
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:25,780
You used to just be like pastries and cereal and coffee and juice.

1095
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,500
And then at some point it expended out to like

1096
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,820
they don't have a kitchen back there.

1097
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:34,180
So I don't know how they're making these eggs and bacon trays.

1098
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1099
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,500
You know, a complimentary breakfast where we stayed,

1100
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,700
there was in the Hilton family like Hampton Inn,

1101
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,420
was it an embassy suites? Possibly. OK.

1102
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,620
It might have been omelet bar in the free.

1103
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,140
Oh, are you kidding?

1104
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:52,740
When do you find that? Now that's living that now.

1105
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,140
Yeah, that's that's great.

1106
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,580
Evening reception, free glass of terrible wine.

1107
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,740
So happy.

1108
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,900
Well, yes, kiss.

1109
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,180
Yeah. Oh, I have to say this.

1110
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,780
And it's another it's another sidestep, but that's OK.

1111
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,700
There's a big article about the reopening of Casa Benita.

1112
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,180
Oh, good. Yeah.

1113
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,300
Couple days ago.

1114
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,500
And there's so many things about because they spent like 40 million dollars

1115
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,300
renovating it. Wow.

1116
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,220
Insane amount that they didn't expect.

1117
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,700
Geez. And one part of it was at the kitchen.

1118
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,900
There were no stoves because they steamed everything for decades.

1119
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:30,020
So they install the install actual like stove, stoves and stovetops

1120
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,500
so they could cook things.

1121
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,980
I guess it speaks to how much people were fond of the place

1122
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:39,020
and the theming that they tolerated steamed beans.

1123
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,420
Yeah, I guess. What do you mean?

1124
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,260
I can't I get so hard for me to picture all that food

1125
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,700
being made with. I know.

1126
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,340
I but then I love more than a nice steamed carne asada.

1127
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,660
They brought yet.

1128
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,100
But the whole articles, I think it was New York Times, the article

1129
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,380
they brought in like a top chef to come in and like do the new menu.

1130
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,700
And she's got like her own like like liquor brand or something to it.

1131
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,420
Forget. But it's very exciting if you read about it,

1132
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,300
because it's the dumbest,

1133
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:12,940
greatest place that's now been restored by some millionaires.

1134
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,500
This is so by some by some of the richest people on earth

1135
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,420
who aren't using money for evil, as far as I can tell.

1136
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:24,060
This and like Quentin Tarantino with the Vista and the New Beverly.

1137
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,980
He bought both of these great theaters and have restored.

1138
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,420
These are at least versions of very rich people

1139
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:34,380
keeping things open that aren't like financially viable

1140
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,860
necessarily just for the fun of it.

1141
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,900
This isn't keeping it open, but Drew Carey.

1142
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:44,740
Yeah, all the writers meals at Bob's Big Boy,

1143
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:50,660
a restaurant that at one point was in the corporate family of Marriott.

1144
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,220
Yeah, look at that.

1145
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:54,660
50K a week, I read. That's insane.

1146
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,500
A true big drew. Thank you.

1147
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,540
Yeah, he helped my wife win on prices, right?

1148
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,420
Yeah, he's helping the writers win this terrible

1149
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,060
to help to make their their price right in this fight. Sure.

1150
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,980
I needed to make that rhyme. Of course.

1151
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,540
Um, I have a little I got a little history thing.

1152
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,100
Yeah, the pair, the Paramount era.

1153
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,820
Actually, well, Paramount's not really part of this Beverly Hills, Cop 3.

1154
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,700
We've discussed this.

1155
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:25,300
The park Wonderworld has come up in the fake theme park Final Four

1156
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,620
as a movie.

1157
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:31,140
This is a boring movie that I've watched too many times.

1158
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,220
It is like an action film for grandpas.

1159
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,020
I don't get them too excited.

1160
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,340
But as a theme park tribute, it's great.

1161
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,500
I like seeing now that I've been there, I like sort of being able to spot.

1162
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,300
OK, now I know the display of the land.

1163
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,020
I know where this is. Oh, that's something they added. That's not there.

1164
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:54,100
I actually appreciate the way they were able to take it from something

1165
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,180
that's more of a regional six flags and like make it feel elevated like Disney.

1166
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,580
I feel like they understood that difference that to make it pop on film

1167
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,260
and be more of a magic park, we got to add this and characters and

1168
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,860
theming and such.

1169
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,580
I didn't know that. Oh, sorry.

1170
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,860
I also I forgot the ride is gone.

1171
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:20,100
I was so sad to discover the ride is gone where George Lucas did his cameo.

1172
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,700
Yeah. Where Axel pushes him out of the way and he says, hey, hey.

1173
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:28,300
So I did. I really wanted to recreate the hey.

1174
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,980
I would agree with the exact right background.

1175
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,860
But that ride is is gone.

1176
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,940
That's where, honestly, a lot of the big set pieces there on some

1177
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,540
like swinging buckets kind of thing.

1178
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:37,820
It's all gone.

1179
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:40,500
Should have been a historic site for what George did, but it's not

1180
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:46,380
not too far from Skywalker Ranch, I believe, at least in the same part of the state.

1181
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,900
God be why they got him, right?

1182
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,780
Yeah. Pretty easy commute for George.

1183
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:52,940
Yeah. OK. I now

1184
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,780
want to click on some things to send to you guys.

1185
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,620
As I mentioned this, as I mentioned, another film

1186
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,620
that shot up there right around the same time, potentially the same year.

1187
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,060
This is a film called Getting Even with Dad.

1188
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,300
Of course.

1189
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,780
This was a movie with Macaulay Culkin and Ted Danson.

1190
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:16,300
I recall it as a movie.

1191
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,860
One of the movies that gave me that formative early thought in your

1192
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,580
in any child's life when they realize, oh, movies can be bad.

1193
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,940
Like one of those for sure.

1194
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,900
That's like, wait a minute.

1195
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,980
But I liked Home Alone.

1196
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,940
How could this be bad? Yeah. Yeah.

1197
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,940
How could a movie be bad?

1198
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,580
I OK.

1199
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,420
Oh, man, this this texting might not work out so good.

1200
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,300
Well, let me get off the Wi-Fi, because there's something that's important

1201
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:48,460
to send you this movie.

1202
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,220
The use of the park in the movie is basically

1203
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:57,180
let's kill a bunch of time and send the kid on the kids into the ride

1204
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,380
and the dad and his friends are not.

1205
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:02,340
And they don't like going on all the big roller coasters.

1206
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:07,460
So they are, you know, everybody is like, they can't handle the speed

1207
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:09,980
and they're stumbling around after and they're queasy.

1208
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,100
It's pretty typical stuff.

1209
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,980
But there's something that I almost missed.

1210
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,820
It's like a blink and you miss it, where you think it's just

1211
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,180
Macaulay and Danson on rides.

1212
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:28,740
And but when you feel look at some point, I was looking like,

1213
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,380
wait a minute, what's going on with their faces?

1214
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,860
And they're trying to do the thing where it works better in cartoons, right?

1215
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:39,780
Where the thing is so fast, the ride or the centrifuge is so fast

1216
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,900
that your face is getting blown back.

1217
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,500
Your cheeks are shaking. Yeah.

1218
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:49,260
They attempt a different way of conveying this.

1219
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,140
And it's oh, it's coming.

1220
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:53,300
It's I'm so sorry.

1221
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,620
It's going so slow here, but we could just cut it out.

1222
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,940
Let's pick it up when you guys see the stills

1223
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,620
from this ride that are being sent to you right now from the scene rather.

1224
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:07,180
Oh, oh, oh, there you go.

1225
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:13,140
Mike got him. Jason, any sign like, oh, man, what is this makeup?

1226
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,300
I yes, they use prosthetics. Oh, my God.

1227
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:20,140
Do it at first. I was like, do they put in like lip pieces to make their lips

1228
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,460
really wide, like something you'd have to wear at the dentist?

1229
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,980
But no, they did like squishy.

1230
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,300
They're given like almost like the bottom half of animal face.

1231
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,540
They look like rat creatures.

1232
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,340
It looks like a rat version of Macaulay Culkin.

1233
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,700
Macaulay Culkin looks like Steven Tyler in one of these shots, too.

1234
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,540
He does. You're right.

1235
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,020
Now we know Steven Tyler looks exactly like Macaulay Culkin

1236
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,740
with extensional extensive facial prosthetics.

1237
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,980
My God, this is awful. This is like Brazil or some.

1238
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,820
This is some. Yes, it's I think it's like Dr.

1239
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,300
Moreau, a little bit more.

1240
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,780
Yeah, these if you didn't know that this was supposed to be Ted

1241
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:00,220
Danson and Macaulay Culkin riding a roller coaster, if these creatures

1242
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:04,300
just emerged from shadow in a scene, you'd expect them to just be

1243
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,060
screeching in horror.

1244
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,580
The key. Maybe they go eat from a bucket of gruel.

1245
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,140
It's like Joe.

1246
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,100
They got hit with Joker gas or something.

1247
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,220
Oh, yes. They got the permanent smile.

1248
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,420
Oh, it's like doesn't the Joker do that to Jerry Hall and the fur?

1249
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,620
Like, well, I fixed her up good.

1250
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,180
Yeah, she has a smile. He kills Jerry Hall.

1251
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:24,980
Oh, he kills Jerry. OK, OK.

1252
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:29,180
But she has a smile, too, I think, because that's something the Joker would do.

1253
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,060
I know. Yeah, he does that to the newscasters in the movie.

1254
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,940
We're talking about the first movie. Yeah.

1255
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,540
Well, yeah, it's pretty jokery.

1256
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,620
Also, just combined with the like with the

1257
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,660
it looks like Macaulay's eyes are completely black.

1258
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:47,860
Like it looks like he is he's like consuming to some plague.

1259
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,660
Yeah, I mean, it looks like he's midway between

1260
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,660
in like a werewolf transformation.

1261
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:59,260
Yeah, there's that's the most like Brazil skin stretch scene.

1262
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,900
Or I'm trying to think of another movie, more modern movie.

1263
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:08,020
I was going to say Star Trek Insurrection, but that's not as universal, is it?

1264
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,940
Well, I was going to say it's right around the same time.

1265
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:14,740
But Beetlejuice, when they realize they can like when they're ghosts

1266
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:18,420
and they can like fuck with their faces and. Oh, yeah.

1267
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,500
Alec Baldwin makes his head real long. Yeah.

1268
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,660
Yeah, those are all good comparisons.

1269
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:27,300
Why did this need to happen? This shot is five seconds long.

1270
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,580
That was my question.

1271
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,900
They put them in prosthetics and then make Nick this.

1272
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:35,020
You made this child go on a roller coaster wearing this shit on his face,

1273
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,380
making him look like a rat boy.

1274
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,700
They thought it was funny, I guess. Yeah.

1275
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,500
They were funny.

1276
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,700
Let's make this kid like a fucking rat, a little rat boy.

1277
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,020
This kid thinks he's so big.

1278
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,180
He thinks he's got more money than we do.

1279
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:52,100
This is the hottest box office drawing of the decade.

1280
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,220
Let's see how he feels when he's a little rat boy.

1281
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:56,700
You could see what he can buy with rat.

1282
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,780
Oh, they won't sell anything to a rat boy.

1283
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,740
No one takes rat box.

1284
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,780
Oh, you're a hideous abomination.

1285
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:05,900
Sorry, rat boy.

1286
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:06,740
You could take high.

1287
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:10,260
If you can get some high res photos of this, you can mock up a movie poster

1288
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,140
of this and be like Macaulay Culkin is rat boy.

1289
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,300
Make it look like a 90s and people go, well, that is him.

1290
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,420
What is his front?

1291
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,540
Like they'll know it's fake, but they'll be like Sam things.

1292
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,140
Does anybody remember Macaulay

1293
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,420
when Macaulay Culkin made a rat boy movie?

1294
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,340
Is this a I maybe this is a I got it.

1295
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,980
He's the best AI I've ever seen.

1296
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,540
They did AI that looks like terrible prosthetics.

1297
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,140
Yeah, he really knows.

1298
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,860
Yeah, particularities.

1299
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:37,500
Well, try it.

1300
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,500
Prank your friends.

1301
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,940
Try to make your friends think there was a rat boy movie.

1302
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,860
Um, that's that.

1303
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,700
I also.

1304
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,220
This is I can't believe how much there is, but I can't not bring it up.

1305
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:54,700
Did you guys come across a ride in the history of this?

1306
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:55,540
I had to move.

1307
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:59,420
I have more stories from this trip, and I moved them to the second gate

1308
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:03,460
mentally because, like, oh, we need some space for this.

1309
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,020
Like, I'm not going to I'm just going to say it.

1310
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:05,540
Say, yeah.

1311
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,940
Survivor, the ride.

1312
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1313
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,500
Did you come across this now?

1314
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,060
Did you? Yeah, when I was looking through.

1315
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:13,460
Yeah, yeah.

1316
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,100
Barely barely caught it.

1317
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,540
Survivor, the ride.

1318
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:17,620
Yeah. Huh?

1319
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,700
Not the band, right?

1320
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,140
Which although I have the tiger was a pretty good basic roller coaster music.

1321
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:24,460
Yeah.

1322
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,660
That's licensed to anything.

1323
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:27,660
Parking at that license.

1324
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:31,580
No, this is an official CBS licensed ride.

1325
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:37,460
This was the ride based on sensation TV series Survivor.

1326
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,220
Yeah.

1327
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,900
Huh? 2000.

1328
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,700
Yeah. What do you say? Six?

1329
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,340
I think so. Yeah.

1330
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,900
Um, so that.

1331
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:46,740
All right.

1332
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,980
Well, just imagine what Survivor, the ride could be.

1333
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,540
Just try to.

1334
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:57,380
Yeah. You know, because you're it's like, you know, it's perilous situations

1335
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:59,020
and you're on an island.

1336
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:02,380
Yeah. And is it a maybe it's a rafting ride.

1337
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,220
It could be that strong water.

1338
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:06,220
I've never watched the show too much.

1339
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:09,340
So I can't pull any big specific, but it's certainly a vibe.

1340
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,180
You could see why it would be a ride.

1341
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,380
Yeah, of course.

1342
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:17,100
There's plenty of the location would be good for some sort of themed entertainment.

1343
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,380
It's got all the like, you know, dad likes palm trees.

1344
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:24,820
So the right is palm trees and like it checks a lot of boxes.

1345
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:28,900
There's a water park being the Survivor theme water park.

1346
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:32,180
You know, something in that family.

1347
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:34,700
No, this is this was a spinner.

1348
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,780
This was like a big it's like a big roulette wheel looking thing

1349
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:42,980
that on a little roller coaster track that goes up and down in a hump and up and down.

1350
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,380
So it's like it's not, you know, it's like an elevated.

1351
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,100
I don't want to just say off the shelf.

1352
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,780
It looks like probably be a fine ride to have.

1353
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,300
The ride is there now.

1354
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,100
Still, I passed by the ride.

1355
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,780
It's called Tiki Twirl.

1356
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,220
Oh, yeah. I saw that.

1357
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,260
Right. It is closed now that I've said that.

1358
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:01,740
I'm not sure.

1359
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:04,100
But, you know, so just a ride that you would.

1360
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,220
So how do you turn something that now is just generically Tiki Twirl

1361
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:11,180
into Survivor the ride?

1362
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:15,460
And to do this, seemingly.

1363
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,900
All right. You guys will know this name when I bring it up.

1364
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,700
Dave Cobb is the name.

1365
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,220
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1366
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,580
Like on Twitter seems like a very friendly guy.

1367
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:29,940
Works in Universal and Warner Brothers Dubai Park and the Men in Black Ride.

1368
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:33,980
And it's and I think the main way this survivor ride is remembered

1369
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:39,060
is via his YouTube channel, where he himself has posted the pre ride video.

1370
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,940
And I will say for his like they clearly thought, OK, we can't just do this

1371
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,380
with our limited resources and our fun TV.

1372
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,860
We need to get somebody who knows how to take a property and put it.

1373
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:53,500
And I remember, oh, I think I've heard him talk about this on something

1374
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,780
on season pass or some other podcast. I'm not sure.

1375
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:00,380
Where so I commend him for the work he did to like.

1376
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,900
All right. Limited budget.

1377
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:04,340
We're going to make the best that we can out of it.

1378
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:06,460
And I could see why he put on his YouTube channel. Great.

1379
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:11,420
That said, this is the most confluent pre ride video here.

1380
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:17,340
OK, so this hose, the hosts of this are Ethan Zahn and Jenna Marasca.

1381
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:22,860
Based survivor heads will know that they are from the show.

1382
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:25,420
From it as far as I can go.

1383
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:31,620
Here is them explaining what you need to do to get on Survivor the ride.

1384
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,100
Do you have what it takes to be a survivor?

1385
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,700
Here's your first challenge.

1386
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,180
Just up the pathway, you'll be assigned into a survivor tribe.

1387
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:43,260
When you reach the challenge platform further down the path,

1388
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:48,500
your tribe will be divided into four groups, orange, blue, purple and green.

1389
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,420
Once assigned to your color, enter the challenge platform

1390
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,580
and take your place on the color you are assigned.

1391
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:57,460
Your challenge is for your tribe to make as much noise as it can.

1392
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:01,420
You see, the louder you are, the wetter the other tribe on the ride will get.

1393
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,340
Anyone care to?

1394
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,460
Did you process any of what you just heard?

1395
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:11,380
I heard orange and they said tribes and they're going to put

1396
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,940
they're going to put you into different teams.

1397
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:18,380
Yeah, you got to get four different colors and you got to make the most noise.

1398
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,980
So that way the other team gets most wet.

1399
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,540
Jason got it. Jason got it.

1400
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:28,020
Jason goes, you got to follow your tribe, make noise, get the other, get them wet.

1401
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:28,900
Right.

1402
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:33,540
And then what this means is that there are sensors under you and you.

1403
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:37,740
So like you're in the line, but then you're into in a little like pre show part

1404
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:42,260
where you get another video where these same hosts

1405
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:48,860
teach you like a clapping and stomping pattern and they record your noise.

1406
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:53,140
And off of that, they determine who made the most noise and there

1407
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:54,820
and who made the least noise.

1408
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,460
And the tribe that got the made

1409
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:00,300
the tribe that made the least noise will get the most wet.

1410
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,940
So when once they're on the ride, they get sprayed with a bunch of water

1411
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,460
from a Tiki face. Right. Got it.

1412
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,820
Yeah. OK. Now let's learn the rhythm.

1413
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,420
Stop your feet in time with the drop.

1414
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,620
Next, you'll add hand claps.

1415
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,140
I've got a cloud cloud.

1416
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:25,900
Can I try to do this?

1417
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,420
Can Jason try to do this real quick?

1418
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,580
Oh, you go back to the start.

1419
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,940
OK, well, it keeps looping. Just try it from here.

1420
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:38,220
Finally, you'll have a chance.

1421
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,060
My original tribe name was Jabiru.

1422
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:40,860
They're ready.

1423
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,100
My original tribe name was Baran.

1424
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,900
You mean boring.

1425
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,180
I'll say Jabiru.

1426
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,300
Then I'll say Baran.

1427
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,340
Then you answer.

1428
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,100
Ready? Jabiru.

1429
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,380
For it.

1430
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,780
It's like advanced drumming or something.

1431
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,980
Oh,

1432
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,660
huh.

1433
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,740
Jabiru boring.

1434
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:01,540
Huh.

1435
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:04,420
Boy Jabiru boring.

1436
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,700
Jabiru boring.

1437
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,780
Huh.

1438
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,740
Jabiru boring.

1439
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:12,540
All right. Well, OK, listener, who made the most noise?

1440
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:15,780
Team Mike or Team Jason vote with your

1441
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:19,300
but shout to the person next to you.

1442
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:24,220
Shout like Jason's name to the person next to you and see how loud they spit on you.

1443
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,260
Yeah.

1444
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,860
It's the at home version.

1445
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:27,300
Yeah.

1446
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,900
How loud they spit on you.

1447
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,940
My words don't make sense anymore.

1448
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:32,100
I got lost in that.

1449
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,540
I don't know if I'm coming out of it.

1450
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:34,300
Yeah, you might not.

1451
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:39,820
I mean, I admire they're trying to do something here because you can't.

1452
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,180
What I'm like a survivor.

1453
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,620
I'm not a big survivor guy.

1454
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:47,740
I've watched maybe two full episodes in its 20 year history.

1455
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:51,580
I've mentioned a friend of mine, John, was on one season.

1456
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:54,540
So I saw some of those.

1457
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:57,620
But these aren't things you can do in a line for a ride.

1458
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,180
These are well, yeah.

1459
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,340
And look, challenges.

1460
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:06,540
They show a bunch of people all like happy smiling, doing the chance together.

1461
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:13,060
I contrast this with who I saw as the main audience at this park,

1462
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:18,660
which I would describe as teenagers practicing their public swearing.

1463
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:22,380
Teenagers getting used to how does this work?

1464
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,100
Yeah. How loud do I yell?

1465
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:27,340
Fuck. And does shit work in every setting?

1466
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:30,420
And then it's kind of a minor to that major, I would say,

1467
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,420
public punching of their friends in the arm.

1468
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:37,140
Yeah, that is mainly what people are concerned with doing in this park.

1469
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:41,900
So it's hard to imagine those same teens going job are a boring.

1470
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,220
But again, this is not Dave Cobb's responsibility.

1471
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:49,060
The whole thing with these, you put it in and then you're not responsible

1472
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:53,140
for what the audience does or in most cases doesn't do.

1473
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:57,220
That's still a blue sky to think that that's going to

1474
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,580
the audience is really interested in doing that.

1475
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,420
All right, everyone, get ready to stomp and clap.

1476
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,380
Do you remember your tribe name?

1477
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:10,460
I mean, they're all similar rhythms, but three rhythms you have to do simultaneously.

1478
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,580
It's hard for us.

1479
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:16,700
Yeah, it's like the hands, hands scanning, putting hands in the air.

1480
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,060
I think now we're at like 50 percent.

1481
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,580
I feel like people put their hands in the air on the Guardians, right?

1482
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,060
And that's much simpler than that.

1483
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,300
And that's all you need.

1484
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,220
I don't need everybody.

1485
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:29,180
If only one of your mugs does it, that's fine.

1486
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:34,340
Oh, OK. Put your put your hands in the air and clap like this.

1487
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:36,060
Clap, clap.

1488
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,540
All right. Let's learn the chant, everybody.

1489
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:43,220
I'm going to say job a row and then Groot's going to say group.

1490
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:47,100
OK. And then you go.

1491
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:50,580
Are you familiar with a four on the floor rhythm

1492
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,900
that a disco drummer might play?

1493
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,220
That's what we're going to be doing here.

1494
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,460
Just watch this basic drum tutorial.

1495
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,220
You know, it'll work at home, too.

1496
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,100
Maybe you could pick up the sticks when you get back to your house.

1497
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,500
This is Casey in the sunshine pant.

1498
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:09,180
I want you to copy the drum pattern identically.

1499
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,860
OK, and we're going to sit here until you learn it.

1500
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,860
If not, we ain't getting on this ride.

1501
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,980
You know, you could perform CPR by doing the rhythm of staying alive.

1502
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,700
Keep that in mind, too, if any of your friends get too shocked

1503
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,220
when we're getting into the gantry lift.

1504
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:28,580
Yeah. Dave Cobb's YouTube channel, a lot of great theme park stuff on.

1505
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:31,140
They're also notable for.

1506
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:36,300
A few years ago, uploading the most thorough video record

1507
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:40,220
of the Islands of Adventure preview center at Universal Studios.

1508
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:41,860
Oh, yeah. Your favorite.

1509
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:44,660
I mean, everyone was thinking of the sacred text.

1510
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:45,860
Your favorite show.

1511
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:48,940
Everyone besides Jason was thinking sacred Jedi text.

1512
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,500
Shaker Jedi video video text.

1513
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,420
Um, the people in that video also, God bless them.

1514
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,220
But like, OK, now's the time.

1515
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,340
My tribe was named this.

1516
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:01,580
It's a boring, similar sounds like more like boring.

1517
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:06,260
These are not the most like that's not they didn't read teleprompters on the show.

1518
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:11,180
But they are a little stiff and their chemistry is nil,

1519
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:14,980
which is why I was surprised to learn at the time of this recording, they were dating.

1520
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:19,140
They look like they'd only just met each other.

1521
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:24,460
It's the chemistry of Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton and Twister.

1522
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:28,900
And yet they were filmed together and they were together.

1523
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:33,380
So that's Survivor, the ride and ambitious.

1524
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,900
Is that the right word? Yeah.

1525
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,420
Yeah, I wonder what is your end to them for trying?

1526
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:42,460
What's your dream survivor ride?

1527
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,140
I mean, I don't know if I have jungle cruise.

1528
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,300
I guess so. Yeah.

1529
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,220
As a boat, they kind of take sure there's two boats at the same time

1530
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,380
when you're competing against the other one.

1531
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,540
OK, OK. Yeah.

1532
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,980
Challenge boats. OK.

1533
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,660
Yeah. Jungle cruise boat with tribal challenge.

1534
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:58,900
Yeah. And Jeff Probst is the host of the pre ride video.

1535
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,860
Really? Yeah.

1536
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,300
And a really realistic Jeff Probst robot.

1537
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,580
Oh, yeah. Like the Shaman of Song at the end of it.

1538
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,700
Yeah. Yeah. It's the most advanced animatronic.

1539
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,580
No, no naked kiss.

1540
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,020
Remember the naked guy?

1541
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,420
Richard Hatch. Richard Hatch.

1542
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:14,220
That was his name. Mm hmm.

1543
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:16,740
Is he in prison?

1544
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:19,660
One of them was money laundering or something.

1545
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,780
Yeah, one of them went for financial crimes.

1546
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,780
Never saw it, but I know that man's name.

1547
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,860
I'm sure it's Richard Hatch because he's got the same.

1548
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,340
Right. This is I knew this.

1549
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:31,780
Richard Hatch was a gigantic sperm donor.

1550
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,940
He thinks that he thinks he has fathered 200 children.

1551
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:41,140
Wow. Because he donated his sperm hundreds of times at the cryo bank

1552
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,580
in Fairfax, Virginia.

1553
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:44,700
Post survivor. 30 bucks a pop.

1554
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,180
No, before. Oh, pre survivor.

1555
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:48,460
No, this is college. Yeah.

1556
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:51,220
So he he has hundreds of children.

1557
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,580
Wow. Yeah.

1558
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:55,740
I thought I was like, let me make let me make sure there is a Google footprint

1559
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,620
of this. And in fact, it's him saying it.

1560
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:58,940
Yeah, I did it.

1561
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,660
I got 200 sperm babies. Wow.

1562
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:05,620
That's why you would think you would go for a lot more after Survivor, too.

1563
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,420
So he should got back in the game. Got back.

1564
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,260
Hello, old friends.

1565
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:13,780
Richard, can I just confirm?

1566
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:17,980
Did you say that Survivor ride opened in 2006?

1567
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,820
Yeah, that's another good point.

1568
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:25,420
So they like that was when they were wrapping up the Viacom tie in.

1569
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:27,140
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, I know.

1570
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,140
Kind of weird to do a new one around then.

1571
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:32,900
Yeah, something new that deep, that far past in 1892.

1572
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,340
The only time they ever did anything new, really.

1573
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,500
Well, you did have Italian jobs, stunt coaster.

1574
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:42,300
I've always forget which which you can also learn about on Dave Cobb's YouTube

1575
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,380
channel. I think he was part of that as well.

1576
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:47,620
I don't remember which parks had Italian jobs, stunt coaster.

1577
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,700
Canada's Wonderland. I don't know.

1578
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,500
Well, I did. I let us know for the droppings episode.

1579
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:57,820
I remember the detail about this because it was at Carowinds and King's Dominion.

1580
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:01,060
And I've always talked about like there was a motion simulator theater

1581
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:06,420
1993 theme to the Tom Cruise movie Days of Thunder.

1582
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,260
Yes. And it was very exciting.

1583
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:13,260
And I loved it. And then a few years later, the theater that it was in

1584
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:17,740
at those parks renamed it to the Paramount Action FX theater.

1585
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:23,380
And it debuted with a ride called Jane's Bond 007, licensed to thrill.

1586
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,860
And then after that, another guy.

1587
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,540
Now we got to cover all of these. Yeah.

1588
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:31,300
Yeah. I think some of them are online.

1589
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:35,060
There's some generic ones called Dino Island, 3D Meteor Attack.

1590
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:40,140
But then a ride based on Stan Lee's seventh portal.

1591
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:45,580
The web comics company he established in the late 90s, early 2000s,

1592
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,860
that very quickly declared bankruptcy.

1593
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:51,580
There's a deep dive on like Stan Lee's other superheroes.

1594
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:53,500
The last 25 years of Stan Lee's career.

1595
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:56,860
Non-Marvel characters, including those.

1596
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:00,020
The character Strip-O-Rella, who did have a TV show.

1597
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:03,060
Yeah. And many others, like many others.

1598
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:06,820
There was a massive push at DC.

1599
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:11,100
There was a run of specials of what you'd call a one shot

1600
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:15,300
called Stan Lee creates the DC universe.

1601
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:20,220
So it's all the DC characters, but Stan Lee redoes their origins.

1602
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:22,860
Like, well, what would Stan Lee's Batman looks like?

1603
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,900
You know, I've never read those.

1604
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,420
I didn't either. You guys haven't read them.

1605
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:28,460
They didn't look great.

1606
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:31,380
I was a kid. That wasn't so interesting to me.

1607
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:35,460
At that point, we had seen so many Stan Lee's blank.

1608
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:40,580
Yeah. So anyway, because that could like, could you imagine if Stan...

1609
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:44,460
Scott, have you ever thought about if Stan Lee thought of Batman?

1610
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:46,900
Why no? Would you like to think about it?

1611
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,500
Absolutely not. Go away, sir.

1612
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,980
Can I push you off a platform or into a lake?

1613
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:57,140
What if Batman just sounded like Stan Lee?

1614
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,060
Well, all right, that I'm on board with.

1615
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,340
Yeah. He should have let him.

1616
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:02,900
He was a very old man.

1617
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:05,940
Pow boom.

1618
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:11,580
I make the difference between me and the other Batman's as I make the sounds.

1619
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:14,540
There was a good series of pictures.

1620
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:16,500
I forget who posted this on Twitter.

1621
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:20,700
Someone was like, has anyone have you ever looked at the pictures of Stan Lee

1622
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:24,060
before he chose to become a cartoon character?

1623
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:27,460
And he is just a bald man in a dress shirt.

1624
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,460
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1625
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:30,460
He didn't have the look.

1626
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,940
He didn't have the... Yeah.

1627
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:34,980
Pretty quickly after that, I think he went to the glasses.

1628
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:35,980
The naked Stan Lee picture?

1629
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:36,980
Huh?

1630
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:39,580
There's a naked Stan Lee picture.

1631
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,420
That he took on the Marvel couches.

1632
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,420
Yeah.

1633
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,420
Full front?

1634
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:44,420
I think it's in front of his penis.

1635
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:45,420
He's got a pillow.

1636
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,420
I think he's got like a whole pillow in front of it.

1637
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:48,420
If you look up naked Stan Lee, it's probably...

1638
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,420
It's cast to be the one.

1639
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:52,020
Sir, I'm leaving this one to you.

1640
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,740
Just do it quick. Just look up...

1641
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,340
Oh, it's already in your history.

1642
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:58,340
It's in your most recent.

1643
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,420
There he is.

1644
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:01,420
He's naked with a comic in front of him.

1645
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:02,420
Oh, it's a comic.

1646
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:03,420
Yeah.

1647
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:04,420
Well, that's good.

1648
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:05,420
It's real skinny.

1649
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,420
Stan, you'd expect no less.

1650
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,420
He's probably 55 here.

1651
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:10,020
And it's 1970.

1652
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:14,900
The Action Theater now presenting an up close look at Stan Lee naked.

1653
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:18,900
Action Theater presents Stan Lee full frontal.

1654
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:24,100
Well, the James Bond one too, it's a flip of a coin.

1655
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,820
Either it's like, oh, it was a big deal because they got Pierce Brosnan

1656
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:33,300
or more likely it's James Bond shot from a distance or in a hazy profile

1657
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,300
and they did not get Pierce Brosnan.

1658
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,300
One or the other.

1659
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:40,300
It has something to do with Pierce Brosnan or not.

1660
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:44,300
Well, you've led me to my final destination.

1661
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,300
Not my final destination of my trip.

1662
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,300
I mean, what happened after...

1663
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,300
You know, the rest of my day was going on kids things.

1664
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,300
He liked the grass.

1665
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,300
We went on...

1666
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,300
All he wanted to do was carousel.

1667
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,780
So we went on carousels and none of the carousels had music.

1668
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:01,780
Oh, no.

1669
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:04,780
So that nice beautiful carousel we were praising at the beginning,

1670
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:06,780
you get on and it's silent.

1671
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:07,780
Really?

1672
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:08,780
Yeah.

1673
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:09,780
So that's great.

1674
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,780
And then another one, then like a Snoopy one and there's not even the

1675
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,780
Peanuts theme, just silent carousels.

1676
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,780
Was there ambient Snoopy or Charlie Brown music?

1677
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:21,780
Very general, I think.

1678
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:22,780
I don't know.

1679
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:24,780
There wasn't the famous Peanuts theme?

1680
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,260
It might have been or it was still...

1681
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:29,260
And I need you now.

1682
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,260
I think it's just that point park wide.

1683
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:32,260
Again and again.

1684
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:34,260
Nothing but.

1685
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,260
It wouldn't surprise me.

1686
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:40,260
So, you know, little disappointments throughout.

1687
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:43,260
Actually, one to one, really quick.

1688
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:46,260
I remember during the pandemic, we did an episode about Snoopy theme

1689
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,260
parks and stuff.

1690
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:52,260
And in that episode, I was pining for a ride called Camp Bus.

1691
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,740
It was a boring, bad pandemic time.

1692
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:57,740
And I was like, we're going to be out of this someday and I'm going to get my

1693
01:22:57,740 --> 01:23:00,740
kid on Camp Bus and it's going to be glorious.

1694
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:02,740
And we're going to share a father son moment together.

1695
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:05,740
And that's that's not to Berry Farm is what I'm talking about.

1696
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:07,740
And I haven't talked about this in the show, have I?

1697
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,740
I don't think so.

1698
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:10,740
We went on Camp Bus.

1699
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:13,740
It was exactly what I pictured and more.

1700
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:14,740
It could not have been better.

1701
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,740
We were in the front row.

1702
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:20,740
I have pictures of he and I just like shaking our heads around like

1703
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:24,220
maniacs. The ride went up in the air and it gives you a little thrill.

1704
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:27,220
There's like a little whoosh, like just enough for a kid, a little bit of

1705
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,220
butterflies in the tummy.

1706
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:33,220
And he looked at me like he could not believe what it just did.

1707
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:37,220
Not scared, just like, whoa, things can do that.

1708
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,220
And I'm like, yes, they can, son.

1709
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,220
I have much to show you.

1710
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:44,220
This was a victory of all victories.

1711
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:46,220
I never got to say this.

1712
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:50,220
Camp Bus was such it's so funny that I pegged it on the show and I was

1713
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,700
like, oh, it was everything I wanted.

1714
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:53,700
Camp Bus.

1715
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,700
I will love these words for the rest of my life.

1716
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:01,700
So we get to Planet Snoopy at Great America where they have the same

1717
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,700
thing. It's the same ride mechanism.

1718
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:04,700
It's just a vehicle.

1719
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,700
It's on big pendulum arms and it swings up and down.

1720
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:13,700
And this one is called Flying Ace and it's the same except it's creaky and

1721
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,700
loud and doesn't give you a thrill of any kind.

1722
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,700
It's much slower.

1723
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:21,180
He didn't care as much.

1724
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:25,180
So just comparing the two, it's the exact same ride and yet just enough.

1725
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:27,180
Not good maintenance.

1726
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:29,180
Just a little.

1727
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,180
It was no Camp Bus.

1728
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:35,180
So I have some negative things to say about things in this park.

1729
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:41,180
But that gets us to this point, which is this actually, I'm going to go all the

1730
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,180
way back.

1731
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:47,180
This became the first thing that I did of the day after making one and a half

1732
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:49,660
rides.

1733
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:53,660
I was at the park trying to find a coaster that did not seem to have an

1734
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:55,660
insanely long unthemed line.

1735
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:59,660
But I had my eye on this anyway just from the website.

1736
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:03,660
And Jason, you brought it up and it's in the place you were just talking about

1737
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,660
the former Action Theater.

1738
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:09,660
This is the only park that still has the Action Theater.

1739
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:11,660
It's the exact same layout as Kings Island.

1740
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,660
I remember seeing it in 2005.

1741
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:15,660
The same building.

1742
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,140
And this is a coaster park.

1743
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:22,140
If you like this park, I think it's probably on the strength of the coasters.

1744
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,140
It is not a dark ride park at all.

1745
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:26,140
Nor is this a dark ride.

1746
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:30,140
But I lit up at it because wait a minute, this might be the one thing with

1747
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:32,140
theming and a story.

1748
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:36,140
And I bet it's a little janky, but maybe that's a little bit fun to talk about.

1749
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,140
Mass Effect.

1750
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:44,140
I don't know one thing about this very successful video game series.

1751
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,620
Are you guys players of Mass Effect?

1752
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,620
What do we know about Mass Effect?

1753
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:50,620
Never played it.

1754
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:54,620
Vaguely familiar with what it's about and photos of it and little videos of it.

1755
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:58,620
So I'm vaguely familiar, which is I think I know where this is headed.

1756
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,620
I have watched my brother play it.

1757
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:04,620
It's like a sci-fi RPG kind of game.

1758
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:08,620
I don't know any specifics about the worlds or the beat.

1759
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:10,620
I think you can customize some avatars.

1760
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,620
I think that's part of it.

1761
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:15,100
So you mean like most video games?

1762
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,100
I'm just naming features that I know.

1763
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,100
He's just saying what he knows.

1764
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,100
Yeah, I'm just saying what I know.

1765
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:23,100
I know the story.

1766
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,100
I'm sure there's online elements.

1767
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,100
Yeah.

1768
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,100
So, well, this is where I'm at.

1769
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,100
You know more than me.

1770
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,100
I don't know a thing.

1771
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:35,100
But isn't that where you want to be?

1772
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:39,100
Does this not take me back to going on star tours and I've never seen the Star Wars movies?

1773
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:41,100
It's kind of perfect if you think about it.

1774
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,580
This is what you want.

1775
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,580
This is a chance to experience.

1776
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:47,580
Yes, an IP with fresh air.

1777
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,580
So, ride, I leave it to you.

1778
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,580
Bring me into the universe.

1779
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,580
Tell me what I need to know.

1780
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,580
And at this point I am desperate because again, it's a big park.

1781
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,580
I've done one and a half loops.

1782
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,580
I am pretty tired.

1783
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,580
It's hotter than I expected.

1784
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:03,580
And I just want to get on something.

1785
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,580
So it is 1.45.

1786
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:09,580
And I walk up to the ride which has a sign.

1787
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:16,060
Strangely, which has specific times like it's the Waterworld stunt show or something.

1788
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,060
I think this is a simulator that's just going all day.

1789
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:24,060
But instead it says showings at 11, 1, 2, 3, whatever.

1790
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,060
That's odd, I think.

1791
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:28,060
But this time's out just about right.

1792
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,060
It's 1.45.

1793
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:34,060
Maybe I get in for the two o'clock show of Mass Effect New Earth.

1794
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:42,540
The first thing I pass is some big black plaques that are in memoriams to people who died in space.

1795
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:44,540
That's scary.

1796
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,540
That implies some peril.

1797
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:52,540
I wish I could say more except in the photo I took the plaques are extremely dusty and scratched up and impossible to read.

1798
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,540
And that's not Imagineer dust.

1799
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:58,540
No, that is not carefully placed Haunted Mansion dust.

1800
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:02,540
I think, I'm pretty sure that those are the elements.

1801
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:09,020
I move to the next part of the queue where I am next to some trees and I am watching some screens again playing fun TV.

1802
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:15,020
Fun TV in this juncture is stills of rock and roll artists.

1803
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:21,020
Informing me of things like Dave Matthews band released their tenth album Walk Around the Moon on Friday.

1804
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:23,020
That is fun.

1805
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:25,020
Thanks for telling me.

1806
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:27,020
What else you got?

1807
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:31,020
Compilation of Willie Nelson's 90th birthday concerts last month are getting a limited theatrical release.

1808
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:35,500
I don't love that tense.

1809
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,500
I think you messed up a verb in there or something.

1810
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,500
But I'll take it.

1811
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,500
What a fun fact.

1812
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,500
Thanks Fun TV.

1813
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,500
Then they play the full trailer of Disney's Little Mermaid.

1814
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,500
Then about to release.

1815
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,500
I don't understand why that's playing here.

1816
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,500
But all right.

1817
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
It's better than looking at nothing.

1818
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:57,500
Also side note, my phone is dying and I need to get ahold of Aaron soon.

1819
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:01,980
So an option for me is not looking at my phone or being entertained by anything on my phone.

1820
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,980
So I leave it to Mass Effect to entertain me.

1821
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:17,980
The next part of the queue I encounter is a 16 year old in a bright red polo like they'd make you wear at an AMC theater.

1822
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:21,980
And he's been out in the sun.

1823
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:25,980
His face is as red as the shirt and he is dripping with sweat.

1824
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,460
I see his name tag.

1825
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:30,460
I don't want to say his real name.

1826
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:32,460
But it was a very put upon name like Erwin.

1827
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:36,460
He was in that family where you're like, oh Erwin.

1828
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,460
Everything okay Erwin?

1829
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,460
So let's say Erwin.

1830
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:46,460
I walk up to Erwin and he calls me forward and he says, I know it says 2 but it's going to be 2.30.

1831
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,460
Are you okay with that?

1832
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:50,460
Yep.

1833
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,460
I'm going to have to be.

1834
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,460
I'm tired of walking.

1835
01:29:54,940 --> 01:30:02,940
So Erwin looks up at the tiered waiting areas.

1836
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:04,940
Five of them.

1837
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:10,940
Not like bleachers but big concrete that step up stadiums for a theater that's going to come.

1838
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:14,940
So when the doors open you can go straight ahead into the row.

1839
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,940
Yeah, exactly.

1840
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:20,940
So he looks up at the tiered waiting area and he goes, okay.

1841
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:27,420
Two, four, six, eight, twelve, fifteen.

1842
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:33,420
He's counting every person in the entire waiting area before he can let me up there and determine, okay.

1843
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:35,420
You can go into row five.

1844
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:37,420
And I go up into row five.

1845
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:39,420
Row five is Bedlam.

1846
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:43,420
There are just a bunch of people meandering around.

1847
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:47,900
It's like a 3D movie.

1848
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,900
People aren't organized yet.

1849
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:53,900
Nobody is standing on circles and there are no circles or numbers.

1850
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:57,900
There is no particular way to organize the people.

1851
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,900
And that's okay.

1852
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:05,900
Except that it really seems like Erwin down there needs people to be on some numbers so that he can count them.

1853
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,900
And figure out how many people went into every area.

1854
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,900
Because I start staring at Erwin.

1855
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,900
And every four people in the area are going to be on some numbers.

1856
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:18,380
And every 45 seconds he does another round of like, two, four, six, eight, five, six, seven, eight.

1857
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:20,380
Like counting everybody in the entire.

1858
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:22,380
I watch this reset so many times.

1859
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:26,380
And I'm looking at my row and it's mostly teens and they're all milling around.

1860
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,380
And some of them are behind the others.

1861
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:32,380
And then they shift around and start punching each other in a new way.

1862
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,380
So Erwin's previous count cannot be his new count.

1863
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:36,380
He's got to do it again.

1864
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:40,380
So, oh, making it all the more stressful is this.

1865
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,860
And I discovered this before I went around the corner.

1866
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:46,860
There's like big plumes of smoke bursting out too.

1867
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:48,860
Of this area.

1868
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:50,860
Seemingly getting in Erwin's face.

1869
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:52,860
And this seems to bother him.

1870
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:54,860
And that's adding to the stress of Erwin.

1871
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,860
And then I get up into the waiting area.

1872
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:58,860
And the smoke is still coming.

1873
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,860
And I'm like, is somebody vaping around here?

1874
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:02,860
Is some asshole making it harder for Erwin?

1875
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:04,860
And just doing big billows of smoke over and over again?

1876
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:06,860
That's disrespectful.

1877
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:09,340
Then I realize it's coming out of the ride itself.

1878
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:11,340
There's some vent next to a big future cyborg guy.

1879
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:13,340
I don't know.

1880
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:15,340
And smoke keeps emitting.

1881
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,340
And it makes Erwin jump every time.

1882
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:19,340
Just adds to it.

1883
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:21,340
Presumably.

1884
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:23,340
Look, he had the energy of first day.

1885
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:25,340
It could have been his first day.

1886
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:27,340
But also it could have been, I don't know, his third month.

1887
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:29,340
I cannot.

1888
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:31,340
I didn't sense that this person was great at it.

1889
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:33,340
But I'm like, I'm going to do it.

1890
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,340
I'm going to do it.

1891
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:37,820
I didn't sense that this person was great at handling stress.

1892
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:39,820
I'm not sure.

1893
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:43,820
So, again, phone's almost dead.

1894
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:45,820
I can't look at the phone.

1895
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:47,820
So I have to use what's around me to entertain myself.

1896
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:49,820
I turn to the TV sets.

1897
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:51,820
The TVs are playing nothing.

1898
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:53,820
So that's not going to do anything for me.

1899
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:55,820
Not going to bring me into the world of Mass Effect.

1900
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,820
I look above me at the filthiest light I've ever seen.

1901
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:59,820
I look down at my 3D glasses.

1902
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,820
Which are scratched to the point of non-visibility.

1903
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:03,820
That's the point of non-visibility.

1904
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,300
They are so scuffed up and stained.

1905
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,300
As if somebody has just breathed fog onto them.

1906
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,300
Right then and there.

1907
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,300
Interesting.

1908
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,300
Then I realize my main entertainment here is going to have to be poor Irwin.

1909
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,300
And I look down and he is counting and counting.

1910
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:18,300
And then every once in a while, people will come up.

1911
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,300
And he seems to have a handle on the situation.

1912
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:22,300
And he seems to be leading them up to a particular place.

1913
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,300
But then they will hand him a pink piece of paper.

1914
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,300
And the pink piece of paper destroys Irwin's world.

1915
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,300
And then he's like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1916
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,300
And he's like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1917
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,300
And he's like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1918
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:34,780
And he has to take the piece of paper.

1919
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,780
Go to the nearest podium.

1920
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:38,780
And by podium I mean trash can.

1921
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,780
He has to roll the pink piece of paper out on a trash can.

1922
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:42,780
Look at it very carefully.

1923
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:44,780
Look at the fine print.

1924
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,780
Whatever it teaches him shows him that these people have a right to be in here right now.

1925
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,780
And he's got to fit them in.

1926
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,780
Even though there's a lot of other people and he doesn't know how to count them.

1927
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:52,780
So after every pink piece of paper, another round.

1928
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:54,780
Two foots.

1929
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:56,780
And he's like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1930
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,780
And he's like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1931
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:00,780
And he's like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1932
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,260
Two foots.

1933
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:05,260
He's getting so so stressed.

1934
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:09,260
Adding to all this, here's another nice

1935
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:11,260
thing about this park.

1936
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:13,260
They don't have updated signs to tell you how long

1937
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:15,260
the weights are.

1938
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:17,260
And they also don't have signs that say you must be this tall to ride.

1939
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:19,260
What they have are poles.

1940
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:21,260
Poles that are not mounted.

1941
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:23,260
And that don't have a bottom.

1942
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:25,260
Poles that just have their color coded.

1943
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,260
And the color coding tells you if

1944
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:29,260
you put it up to a person.

1945
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:31,740
Or tall enough to ride or not.

1946
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:33,740
So as all this is happening, as he's counting people

1947
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:35,740
and looking at a piece of paper and smoke is going off.

1948
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:37,740
Then he'll like stumble a little bit

1949
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:39,740
and fall back into the pole.

1950
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,740
And the pole will go flying.

1951
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,740
The pole keeps falling.

1952
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:45,740
Just put a sign up there.

1953
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:47,740
Can this park not afford nails?

1954
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:51,740
How hard is it to just put an

1955
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:53,740
arrow once?

1956
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:55,740
And then Erwin doesn't have to fumble with a sign.

1957
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:57,740
How is he going to help the humans

1958
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,220
defeat the aliens at this rate?

1959
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:02,220
I do not have a good feeling about

1960
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:04,220
our trip to this new earth.

1961
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:06,220
Nor do I know what it is or why I'm going there.

1962
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:08,220
If things are finally

1963
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:10,220
coming to a head with him.

1964
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:12,220
At some point I watch him mouth just the big word

1965
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,220
SHIT!

1966
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:16,220
It's so clearly shit.

1967
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:18,220
And then he gets a phone call

1968
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:20,220
but the phone that he has to answer

1969
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,220
is on a little table and he has to get

1970
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:24,220
down on his knees to answer the phone call.

1971
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,220
And he's in like clean nice

1972
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:28,700
khakis because it's a movie theater uniform

1973
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:30,700
and he's on and like uh huh uh huh

1974
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:32,700
uh huh. And then he gets off

1975
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:34,700
and I see him start to mouth an F.

1976
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:36,700
He's going for a bit

1977
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,700
and he winds up as if he's going to yell to the heavens

1978
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,700
FUUUUUUUU but then

1979
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,700
a cute girl passes by him

1980
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,700
who's his co-worker and then he

1981
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:46,700
plays it cool. He stops the FUUU

1982
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,700
right in the middle like

1983
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,700
everything's fine with me Erwin.

1984
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,700
He's really

1985
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,700
trying to like because maybe

1986
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:57,180
I could date her if I show my management skills

1987
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:59,180
are good enough.

1988
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:01,180
So then he forms a new plan

1989
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:03,180
and the new plan is to

1990
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:05,180
yell to the person next to me all the way

1991
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:07,180
in the back. Hey can you count how many people

1992
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:09,180
in your row?

1993
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,180
But he's deploying the

1994
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:13,180
guests now?

1995
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:15,180
Again, Great America

1996
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:17,180
I say

1997
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:19,180
it just puts some splotches

1998
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:21,180
on the ground. It doesn't have to be anything

1999
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:23,180
you don't have to design like a special mass effect

2000
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:25,660
shape. No one knows what it is.

2001
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:27,660
Just like dump random

2002
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:29,660
splotches of paint on the ground and tell people

2003
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:31,660
to stand on those and now Erwin

2004
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:33,660
can do his job. He can get the

2005
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:35,660
girl and he doesn't have to make us the

2006
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:37,660
guests do the work for

2007
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:39,660
and the guy who he points to just goes

2008
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,660
me? Really loud and then Erwin

2009
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:43,660
realizes what he said like wait yeah

2010
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:45,660
that doesn't make any sense. I can't make

2011
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:47,660
you do it. It's my job.

2012
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:49,660
And eventually things are finally

2013
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:51,660
the spotlight is taken

2014
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:53,660
off of Erwin because the

2015
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,660
pre-show video starts and

2016
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:57,660
I'm so excited because I can finally understand

2017
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:59,660
what is going on with this new

2018
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:01,660
earth. Will there be some sort of effect

2019
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:03,660
on my mass? What do I need

2020
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,660
to prepare for with this

2021
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:07,660
ride? So the video

2022
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,660
starts and then it stops

2023
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,660
and then it starts again and then it says

2024
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:13,660
HDMI signal lost and

2025
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:15,660
there's a big pause and then the video

2026
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:17,660
starts again and the video is very

2027
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,660
quiet and all of the teens

2028
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:21,660
swearing at each other are very loud

2029
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:23,660
and luckily I'm the closest to it but if you're

2030
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:25,660
all the way in the back you're not here in one

2031
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:27,660
portion of this video.

2032
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,660
Luckily I'm in prime position.

2033
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:31,660
I filmed some of it. There's a logo that tells

2034
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,660
you that you are getting on mass relay

2035
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:35,660
getaways. Okay

2036
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:37,660
so it's like a star tour. They're going to take

2037
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:39,660
me to the stars and then this thing

2038
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:41,660
happens. It's like a very pleasant travelog.

2039
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:43,660
Okay I understand this.

2040
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:45,660
This is going to be one of those rides where you think

2041
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,660
it's a nice trip somewhere but then things go

2042
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:49,660
horribly wrong. I understand this.

2043
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:51,660
It's still so quiet

2044
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:53,660
and when it starts there's people

2045
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:55,660
who they introduce their

2046
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:57,660
names and they're too quiet to hear.

2047
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:59,660
What I heard was like, hi I'm

2048
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:01,660
Richard Comet and I'm

2049
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:03,660
Sarah Pluto

2050
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:05,660
and we're going to take you to all

2051
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:07,660
the way to Oktus and beyond.

2052
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:09,660
Did your names

2053
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:11,660
have like Comet and Pluto in them?

2054
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:13,660
I didn't hear them well enough to know

2055
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:15,660
is it Oktus did you say?

2056
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:17,660
Why is this so quiet?

2057
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:19,660
Just turn up the volume.

2058
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,660
It gets a little louder as

2059
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:23,660
I am taught that you are

2060
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:25,660
going to Terra Nova.

2061
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:27,660
That must be the new earth that's

2062
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:29,660
in question and they start telling me

2063
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:31,660
about the great things that Terra Nova.

2064
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,660
Amenities may include hover cabanas,

2065
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:35,660
anti-gravity massage,

2066
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,660
then,

2067
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:39,660
I'm sorry I'm going to take my best guest,

2068
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,660
four star gourmet

2069
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:43,660
ion fish for dad.

2070
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:45,660
I'm not positive

2071
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:47,660
about ion but it was something like

2072
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:49,660
that it was a science word.

2073
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:51,660
I couldn't tell you.

2074
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:53,660
So dad's going to

2075
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:55,660
only dad and not mom or kids are

2076
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:57,660
going to like the ion fish.

2077
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:59,660
I like the way they're presenting this so far I'll be honest with you.

2078
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:01,660
I mean I'm in at this point. This is mythology.

2079
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:03,660
Ion fish,

2080
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:05,660
do you play mass effects? Can you confirm

2081
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:07,660
our ion fish?

2082
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:09,660
Is that your health? Like you get your health meter back up if you eat those?

2083
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:11,660
It's your Popeye's spinach. Make sure you

2084
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:13,660
catch enough. Yeah, tired dads

2085
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:15,660
love ion fish.

2086
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:17,660
The main difference between

2087
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,660
earth and new earth is

2088
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:21,660
on earth you have fish, on new earth you

2089
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:23,660
have ion fish.

2090
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:25,660
So remember you got to get your blaster

2091
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:27,660
out but also be fishing at all times.

2092
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:29,660
Make sure you catch enough fish.

2093
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:31,660
And then it's interrupted

2094
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,660
and then a different two soft voiced

2095
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:35,660
news reporter comes on.

2096
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:37,660
Hello, it's Neil

2097
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:39,660
Phonak reporting.

2098
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:41,660
Neil Phonak, is that it?

2099
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:43,660
I don't know. Anyway, he says

2100
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:45,660
that things are not good on Terra Nova.

2101
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:47,660
It's that kind of thing. Uh oh,

2102
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:49,660
I'm scared. What am I going to do?

2103
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:51,660
By now it's been 45 minutes

2104
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:53,660
from the time I stepped into the skew

2105
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:55,660
to this point so I am ready

2106
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:57,660
to find out. So I get

2107
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,660
inside and there is a big screen and

2108
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,660
a bunch of, look it's 40x chairs.

2109
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:03,660
It doesn't look super fancy

2110
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:05,660
but I'll take it. I'll take whatever I

2111
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:07,660
can get. Happy to be inside. I want

2112
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:09,660
to get my eye on fish. I'm so excited.

2113
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:11,660
There's also

2114
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:13,660
the production value of a little

2115
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:15,660
like bridge platform

2116
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,660
in the center of the screen and there is a

2117
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:19,660
performer out there.

2118
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:21,660
This is like a T2 3D.

2119
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:23,660
I get to see a guy. Yeah, they got an actor.

2120
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:25,660
There is an actor in the, I mean

2121
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,660
that's beyond what I expected

2122
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:29,660
out of this simulator thing.

2123
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,660
And he's talking to us. He's got

2124
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:33,660
a spangled star captain's

2125
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,660
uniform on.

2126
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:37,660
He seems a little nervous.

2127
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:39,660
You know, like an Erwin of the skies

2128
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:41,660
basically. But he's going to get us

2129
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:43,660
through it. I was really waiting to see

2130
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:45,660
if Erwin would then also be

2131
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:47,660
the actor.

2132
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:49,660
Like the Popeye Village situation.

2133
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:51,660
I watched a ride

2134
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,660
through this and I was like, oh my god

2135
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:55,660
is Erwin the captain?

2136
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:57,660
Oh no. I am sorry to say

2137
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:59,660
we left, we leave

2138
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:01,660
Erwin outside at this point. I wish there was more

2139
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:03,660
to the Erwin story. I just, I wish him

2140
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:05,660
well and I mostly wish him circles on the ground

2141
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:07,660
so he doesn't have to count over and over.

2142
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:09,660
Tough job. Not his fault.

2143
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:11,660
Great America, get your act together.

2144
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:13,660
No, different guy

2145
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:15,660
who is a little bit comfortable with

2146
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:17,660
an audience and he's telling us like

2147
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:19,660
boy, you guys are in for a treat to head to

2148
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:21,660
Terra Nova and hey, you might even meet

2149
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:23,660
Commander Conrad Reynolds.

2150
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:25,660
I hope so. Boy, I look

2151
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:27,660
up to that guy a lot. Alright, well

2152
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:29,660
and then suddenly

2153
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:31,660
we are off. We

2154
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:33,660
are on a high speed

2155
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:35,660
mission to Terra Nova. We're going

2156
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:37,660
through like a big loading dock area

2157
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:39,660
and we almost missed something and there's like a hologram

2158
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:41,660
lady there and

2159
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:43,660
it's full of danger and music

2160
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:45,660
and loud sounds and excitement and then

2161
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:47,660
eight seconds later the ride stops.

2162
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:49,660
It goes

2163
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:51,660
black. It goes totally black.

2164
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:53,660
For a second I thought maybe we hit something

2165
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:55,660
and that was something in the ride.

2166
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:57,660
But no, clearly it becomes, this is

2167
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:59,660
just gone. So now

2168
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:01,660
Erwin too, the more comfortable

2169
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:03,660
Erwin has to

2170
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,660
stall, improvise

2171
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:07,660
something that I had to do as a universal

2172
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:09,660
tour guide but I didn't have

2173
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:11,660
to do it in universe of Mass Effect.

2174
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,660
So all he has

2175
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:15,660
at his disposal are the boring

2176
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:17,660
things that I've been telling you the listener about

2177
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:19,660
for the last ten minutes. He has to say

2178
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:21,660
like, well, what are you guys

2179
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:23,660
going to do when you get to Terra Nova?

2180
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:25,660
I think, you know,

2181
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:27,660
this guy looks like he's excited

2182
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:29,660
for Daddier, looks excited for that Ion

2183
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:31,660
Fish.

2184
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:33,660
It came back. Wow.

2185
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:35,660
I was so glad I clocked

2186
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:37,660
it before. But you, you're

2187
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:39,660
going to like it. This guy right here,

2188
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:41,660
he's going to be maybe having

2189
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:43,660
extra portions of Ion Fish.

2190
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:45,660
Hey, do any of you folks know

2191
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:47,660
how to plug and

2192
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:49,660
what is it called, an HDMI cable

2193
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:51,660
in?

2194
01:42:51,660 --> 01:42:53,660
Unfortunately we are still on

2195
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:55,660
regular Earth. Not

2196
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:57,660
Terra Nova, Terra Oldva.

2197
01:42:57,660 --> 01:42:59,660
And here we are still at the

2198
01:42:59,660 --> 01:43:01,660
hands of cables that we get from

2199
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:03,660
Best Buy. So if you know anything about, if anybody

2200
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:05,660
any former Geek Squad members here, you might

2201
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:07,660
help us out.

2202
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:09,660
So he also then, he

2203
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:11,660
just, part of the stall

2204
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:13,660
is that he gets really wistful about like

2205
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:15,660
I gotta say though

2206
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:17,660
Commander Conrad Reynolds.

2207
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:19,660
This guy, he

2208
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,660
I just really

2209
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:23,660
admire him. He's so

2210
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:25,660
Commander, they really

2211
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:27,660
are a great commander, aren't they?

2212
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:29,660
He says.

2213
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:31,660
I don't know if that was a, yes, is that

2214
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,660
like a forward thinking language?

2215
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:35,660
Pronan wise or is,

2216
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:37,660
does he just talk weird?

2217
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:39,660
I'm not sure, no way to know.

2218
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:41,660
But he gets really emotional about Conrad.

2219
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:43,660
It makes me even more excited to meet Conrad

2220
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:45,660
Reynolds. So I'm

2221
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:47,660
very excited when the ride starts again

2222
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:49,660
for one frame,

2223
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:51,660
then eerie

2224
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:53,660
silence, then a new voice,

2225
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:55,660
someone less charismatic than Erwin

2226
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:57,660
or new Erwin gets on and

2227
01:43:57,660 --> 01:43:59,660
says, oh, unfortunately at this

2228
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:01,660
time, do some

2229
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:03,660
difficulties, we're going to,

2230
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:05,660
you gotta, you gotta go.

2231
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:07,660
You gotta, you gotta, wow, you have to leave.

2232
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:09,660
And that is

2233
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,660
the end of that experience for

2234
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:13,660
me. There was no ride.

2235
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:15,660
There were no eye on fish.

2236
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:17,660
There was no Conrad Reynolds.

2237
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:19,660
I watched a

2238
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:21,660
little girl burst into tears

2239
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:23,660
at this situation.

2240
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:25,660
More nicer, I'm sorry,

2241
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:27,660
more charismatic Erwin as to like,

2242
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:29,660
I really,

2243
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,660
we didn't want this to happen.

2244
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:33,660
We wanted to go. But it's,

2245
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:35,660
safety is important, you know.

2246
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:37,660
I'm so sorry.

2247
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:39,660
I just hope, I hope the rest of your day goes better.

2248
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:41,660
And then we all file out

2249
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:43,660
our offer, nothing. We don't

2250
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:45,660
get pink pieces of paper like

2251
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:47,660
Erwin was being handed

2252
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:49,660
by other, we get nothing. We get

2253
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:51,660
for what now has been an hour of my

2254
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:53,660
time. I'm not compensated

2255
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:55,660
in any way. The families

2256
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:57,660
get nothing. My reward is

2257
01:44:57,660 --> 01:44:59,660
exiting quietly through a dark

2258
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,660
hallway with occasional cutouts

2259
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,660
of characters I did not get to meet

2260
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:05,660
in Mass Effect New Earth.

2261
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:07,660
I don't know why there's a big lizard

2262
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:09,660
captain. I'd love to know.

2263
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:11,660
I still haven't watched a video

2264
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:13,660
of it. You shouldn't. I don't, yeah.

2265
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:15,660
In a way I don't want it. Jason, you did. What

2266
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:17,660
did I miss? There's

2267
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:19,660
bad guys. The screen

2268
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:21,660
has your cannons show

2269
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:23,660
up. The ship starts blasting.

2270
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:25,660
Guys, you're flying all

2271
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:27,660
over the place. Do you

2272
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:29,660
remember anything about, did you meet Conrad Reynolds

2273
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:31,660
and was he as valorous

2274
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:33,660
as lore has told?

2275
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:35,660
Okay, see, I

2276
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:37,660
think I met a friend of his and I thought

2277
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:39,660
he called us Conrad Reynolds.

2278
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:41,660
But

2279
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:43,660
I could have misunderstood

2280
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:45,660
exactly what was going on because

2281
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:47,660
video of 3D screens

2282
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:49,660
not in 3D, you're

2283
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:51,660
catching 50% of it. That's interesting because I was

2284
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:53,660
going to say maybe Conrad Reynolds was like a performer

2285
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:55,660
and they could just change gender so you

2286
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:57,660
would say they're just because you could

2287
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:59,660
depending on who it was.

2288
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:01,660
But if it's also the audience, that's interesting.

2289
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:03,660
We shouldn't investigate this.

2290
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:05,660
They might have been mistaken

2291
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,660
in calling you that. I don't know. This is a shame too

2292
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:09,660
because this is apparently

2293
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:11,660
the last operating action

2294
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,660
theater. Yeah, they're all gone.

2295
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:15,660
With a long line,

2296
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:17,660
briefly had the Fantastic

2297
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:19,660
World of Hanna-Barbera when that left

2298
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:21,660
Universal. I forgot.

2299
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:23,660
Briefly got to have another

2300
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:25,660
ride's droppings.

2301
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:27,660
Yeah.

2302
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,660
Here, you take this. Take this shit we

2303
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:31,660
don't want anymore.

2304
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:33,660
Wow.

2305
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,660
I guess it's at Six Flags but it's similar to

2306
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:37,660
that Justice League story I have.

2307
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:39,660
We actually got to go on the ride but

2308
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:41,660
we had another situation where we walked into the single rider

2309
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:43,660
and the guy was like, oh,

2310
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:45,660
single rider?

2311
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:47,660
Single rider? And we were like, yeah.

2312
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:49,660
And then there's a full line of people and he goes, oh,

2313
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:51,660
right this way. And he just slashed your GEO and I

2314
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:53,660
onto the ride without

2315
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:55,660
the glasses.

2316
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:57,660
How do I make this go away?

2317
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,660
What's the fastest way

2318
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:01,660
to make this? Everyone is

2319
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:03,660
taller than me and madder than me

2320
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:05,660
and hotter than me

2321
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,660
temperature wise.

2322
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:09,660
Someone will clock me in the face

2323
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:11,660
if I don't wrap this up quickly.

2324
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:13,660
This is

2325
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:15,660
so for a while, I'm like,

2326
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:17,660
that was my day. I don't know if I have

2327
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:19,660
time to get on anything else.

2328
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:21,660
Luckily I did but that's essentially

2329
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:23,660
I missed what is probably a really

2330
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:25,660
good wooden roller coaster. Yeah, you could have waited.

2331
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:27,660
Yeah. Because I had

2332
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:29,660
so much greed for lapping up

2333
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:31,660
eye on fish that

2334
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:33,660
it blinded me to the potential

2335
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:35,660
problems of my journey.

2336
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:37,660
I never made it there and I'm stuck

2337
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,660
here on shitty old Earth. It made

2338
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:41,660
you appreciate your wife and child

2339
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:43,660
more. I took them for granted

2340
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:45,660
thinking about that. Big

2341
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:47,660
play to eye on fish.

2342
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:51,660
Here I was thinking so much

2343
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:53,660
about my love and admiration

2344
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:55,660
for Conrad Reynolds. I didn't

2345
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:57,660
stop to think that A, Conrad Reynolds

2346
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:59,660
might be me and 80 other people

2347
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:01,660
depending on Erwin's

2348
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:03,660
count. And B,

2349
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:05,660
I have a wife who is

2350
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:07,660
every bit as valorous as Conrad

2351
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:09,660
Reynolds could ever be. You know what they

2352
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:11,660
say? They say

2353
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:13,660
give a man an eye on fish.

2354
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:15,660
He'll eat for a day

2355
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,660
and teach a man

2356
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:19,660
to eye on fish and he'll eat for a lifetime.

2357
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:23,660
So what does that mean for me?

2358
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:25,660
I guess. It means you

2359
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:27,660
have to find your own. It's what you just said.

2360
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:29,660
Your own Conrad Reynolds and your own

2361
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:31,660
life is more important than

2362
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:33,660
someone else's journey to meet

2363
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:35,660
Conrad Reynolds. The eye on fish are

2364
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:37,660
the rewards that I

2365
01:48:37,660 --> 01:48:39,660
reap when I, or once I've

2366
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,660
sowed them. Which do I do first? Yes.

2367
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:43,660
What do you do when it's fish?

2368
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:45,660
There's gotta be, there's a lot in the

2369
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,660
Bible about fish so it's probably

2370
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:49,660
I could clear up a lot about

2371
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:51,660
this I think if I,

2372
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,660
I need to go to church

2373
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:55,660
clearly. It's what I'm learning.

2374
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:57,660
Future church. Well

2375
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:59,660
that's that. So if you can imagine

2376
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:01,660
by the end of all this I had some not so

2377
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:03,660
great feelings about Great America.

2378
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:05,660
It also came to pass that at the

2379
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:07,660
end of the day I was like I cannot

2380
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:09,660
wait to not have dinner here.

2381
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:11,660
Oh the joy of

2382
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:13,660
not standing in a crowded subway

2383
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:15,660
line that's twice as expensive

2384
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:17,660
as, so I

2385
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:19,660
we got out of there and went to Italy

2386
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:21,660
and it was glorious especially in

2387
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:23,660
the wake of all that.

2388
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:25,660
And I

2389
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:27,660
don't know. I

2390
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:29,660
at this point I

2391
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:31,660
Jason you were

2392
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:33,660
saying maybe you want to

2393
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:35,660
go. Maybe you gotta try that new coaster.

2394
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:37,660
How do you feel after everything I told you?

2395
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:39,660
I don't know you know it is

2396
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:41,660
kind of a morbid

2397
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:43,660
interest in the way

2398
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:45,660
very much of like

2399
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:47,660
there's like one or two

2400
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:49,660
charming things, there's one or two like

2401
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:51,660
really new things and

2402
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:53,660
the rest is very similar to a

2403
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:55,660
dying mall. Yeah. Yeah.

2404
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:57,660
And not a fancy mall. It straddles

2405
01:49:57,660 --> 01:49:59,660
two city lines and it's two different

2406
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:01,660
pay grades. One of those old shitty ones.

2407
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:03,660
No Italy. There definitely is no Italy.

2408
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:05,660
There's a big Michelada station

2409
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:07,660
and

2410
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:09,660
a very chaotic

2411
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:11,660
Starbucks. I'm starting to

2412
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:13,660
think that I don't know

2413
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:15,660
my final

2414
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:17,660
statement on all this. I've complained a lot

2415
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:19,660
about this place. I had

2416
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:21,660
some fun. It was nice to watch Erwin

2417
01:50:21,660 --> 01:50:23,660
and I guess Erwin you really made it the day

2418
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:25,660
special. At the end

2419
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,660
of the day, even after all that, what I

2420
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:29,660
would say

2421
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:31,660
I would still recommend, get up

2422
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:33,660
to Santa Clara, go to NorCal,

2423
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:35,660
get up there, take your family

2424
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:37,660
up there. Then turn around,

2425
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:39,660
go way south and get to

2426
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:41,660
Gilroy Gardens, a

2427
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:43,660
vastly superior theme park.

2428
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:45,660
Wow. Incredibly superior theme park.

2429
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:47,660
What a tease. No mere garlic

2430
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:49,660
theme park is this. It's

2431
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:51,660
wonderful. It's great at Gilroy

2432
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:53,660
Gardens. If you could only pick one,

2433
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:55,660
of course go to Gilroy Gardens.

2434
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:57,660
And you know what? The only way to make

2435
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:59,660
it better, somebody from

2436
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:01,660
Gilroy Gardens offer poorer Erwin a job.

2437
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:03,660
I know that's not his real name, but figure out a name

2438
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:05,660
that's close. Get him down there.

2439
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:07,660
It's the only way to make the Gilroy Gardens

2440
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:09,660
experience better. Get the best entertainer

2441
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:11,660
they have.

2442
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:13,660
What a great tease for the future.

2443
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:15,660
So that's that. Gilroy Gardens,

2444
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:17,660
incredibly charming place.

2445
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:19,660
We'll talk about it on the second gate. This

2446
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:21,660
place, I might have to say,

2447
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:23,660
do what you're doing. Burn it to the ground

2448
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:25,660
for insurance money. Wow.

2449
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:27,660
If you grew up there and you have nice

2450
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:29,660
memories, I hope that... Go fuck yourself.

2451
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:31,660
Sorry. You had a dumb

2452
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:33,660
childhood and you were

2453
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:35,660
wrong. And we are right.

2454
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:37,660
Scott doesn't want to save Barney Old

2455
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:39,660
Field's Redwood Rally.

2456
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:41,660
Is that even there?

2457
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:43,660
That is an attraction that used to

2458
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:45,660
be called Barney Old Field Speedway.

2459
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:47,660
Barney Old Field?

2460
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:49,660
Yeah, I don't know. I think this is like

2461
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:51,660
their old time

2462
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:53,660
cars.

2463
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:55,660
Also, one of the lands in

2464
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:57,660
that has since changed names, the

2465
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,660
land names.

2466
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:01,660
This was very funny to me.

2467
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:03,660
One of the lands used to be called

2468
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:05,660
the Great Midwest Livestock

2469
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:07,660
Exposition and County Fair.

2470
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:09,660
That is

2471
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:11,660
too many words for a theme park

2472
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:13,660
land. I think it's now just NorCal

2473
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:15,660
County Fair. Barney Old Field,

2474
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:17,660
a real guy, a real racer.

2475
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:19,660
How about that?

2476
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:21,660
I hate to say it.

2477
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:23,660
I don't think it's enough to tip

2478
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:25,660
my opinion. I am

2479
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:27,660
going to have to pass at this

2480
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:29,660
time. Am I glad I went up there? Hey, it

2481
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:31,660
helped fuel this trip, which was a wonderful trip.

2482
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:33,660
But so much for the wonder. Gilroy Gardens.

2483
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:35,660
That's going to be on the second gate. As for

2484
01:52:35,660 --> 01:52:37,660
this You Survived podcast,

2485
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:39,660
The Ride, thank you for listening.

2486
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:41,660
We walked right into it.

2487
01:52:41,660 --> 01:52:43,660
This is Great America. I think this is

2488
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:45,660
we're putting this out, I believe, on 4th of July

2489
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:47,660
weekend, where next

2490
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:49,660
week we'll be off on the main feed.

2491
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,660
But in the middle, wet your

2492
01:52:51,660 --> 01:52:53,660
appetite with a little

2493
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:55,660
bit of garlic and a little bit of

2494
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:57,660
talking about Gilroy Gardens. And more from

2495
01:52:57,660 --> 01:52:59,660
the trip that I had to cut from this,

2496
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:01,660
notably lacking in Chuck E. Cheese

2497
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:03,660
thoughts. Always a bad thing

2498
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:05,660
to not. So if you want

2499
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:07,660
your chuck, you're going to have to go to the second

2500
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:09,660
gate, pal. You're paying for that.

2501
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:11,660
Open them wallets.

2502
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:13,660
These horrible voices we've accumulated.

2503
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:15,660
Mickey Mouse, Chuck E. Cheese.

2504
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:19,660
It does get worse and worse.

2505
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:21,660
Harjo after Harjo. Hey, I'm

2506
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:23,660
chet to like, ehhh.

2507
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:25,660
Yeah. Enjoy

2508
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:27,660
my voice. I sound

2509
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,660
like what McKally Coulkin, the Rad Boy,

2510
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:31,660
looks like.

2511
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:33,660

thing for the car wash.

That's on Club 3. Gilroy

2519

Gardens coming to Club

2520
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:51,660
2, second gate. You've never

2521
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:53,660
called it till right now. But again,

2522
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:55,660
my brain's breaking from Rat Boys

2523
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:57,660
and Survivor

2524
01:53:57,660 --> 01:53:59,660
Stomps. So, better wrap it up here.

2525
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,660
