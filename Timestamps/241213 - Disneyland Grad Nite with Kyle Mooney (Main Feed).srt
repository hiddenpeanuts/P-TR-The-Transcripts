1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Warning, the following podcast may contain a pointless boat,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
sleepy cave songs,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
adorably disguised liquor bottles,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the unbridled energy of freshly graduated grads.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Kyle Mooney returns to reminisce about Disneyland grad night

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
on today's podcast, The Ride.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast hosted by three men who are so hip and youthful,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
you'd be shocked to learn that they graduated high school 20 years ago.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My name is Mike Carlson and just saying that makes me hurt, makes my stomach hurt.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jason Sheridan joining me as always.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, I'm just a little guy. I'm so youthful.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like, I'm just a little, I've got my big lolly for my recording.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Are you equating your size to how old you are?

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My sailor's too high?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm going to jump on you.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh my god, who's that?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, okay, well hang on. We'll put a pin in that.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But just so you're, so if you're short, but you're 80 years old,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that's almost the same as being in high school?

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, sure.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
All right, fine. Okay, now go back.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I just wanted to clarify, and that's actually a good way for me to come back,

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
is with clarifying a Jason statement, but now let's do it as planned.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And daddy's home, Scott Gerdner is back.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hey, get back, get back.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The Jay Leno, the night show promo.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You caught the reference that it's not get back, it's that I'm,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
it's me and I'm in a convertible and I'm driving in the back and there's a sticker that says director

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and it just peeled off and now it says podcaster underneath.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The stickers fix themselves.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Can you go out and shoot that by the time this episode comes out?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, maybe, or I can kind of, hey, I can ask AI to put my face onto.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But it seems disrespectful to Jay, who's going through a tough time lately.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, tell me about it.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't want to do that until the face bruise is healed.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But yeah, I'm back, I'm back baby.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Wow.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Scott free, no more, Scott full.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Playtime's over, as they say.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're getting down to business, all right?

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The show is so different for six weeks.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And now it's going to be so different going forward.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes, so markedly.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, the thing is, I've, what I've learned about myself that I didn't even know until I started listening to the show without me and reading comments is that I hate tangents.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't realize that until you and the listeners said it.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But now, I guess now that I know that about myself, no more of those tangents.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That shit's over.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Jason and I invented tangents in the last six weeks.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Podcasting, you never had it before.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We perfected it, we perfected it.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No, and something I have certainly on the record is never having done.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You'll listen to seven years worth of episodes, you will hear me staying micro-focused on topic every single second of every single one, as it will be from now on.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And to that end, now there's various business of me returning to the show, which we can deal with at a later time.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You were, you know, working on something.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now you've come back with a face bruise on the other side as Jay.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You have the other side of bruise and an eye patch.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And you have not explained that either.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's just, boy, that's what a shoot will do to you.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Boy, you get banged up.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Right for Hollywood, am I right?

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is he like, what's the Star Wars, is it a dyad?

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What is it?

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Were there two halves like Rey and Kylo are two halves of the same thing?

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's like Scott and Jay both got hurt at the same time?

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Of course it's a dyad.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's a dyad, right?

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, well Scott and Jay Leno are part of a dyad, basically, is what you're saying.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, at least we were with everything we've been through through the month of November, but now we're back.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The triad is back, but actually it's going to be a quiad.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I wanted to, why I wanted to save any business of me coming back is that there is a much more important return to podcast the ride that is in progress right now over there in the fourth chair.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't believe he's not been with us in three years.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I think that was the last one.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Is that true?

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I believe so.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can you believe that?

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Three years really flies.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It probably especially flies for this guy who used that time to direct his feature film directorial debut, which he also wrote along with Evan Winter.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a great movie called Y2K, which you can see right now.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've seen this film.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is a great film.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Highly encourage you to see it.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But first we're going to talk about a bunch of bullshit with the great Kyle Mooney.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hello, man.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Welcome back.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Damn.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It feels good.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I told you it would.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I've been talking you and talking you into it for weeks, trying to get you off the ledge.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And now that you're in it, doesn't it feel great?

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've been on the ledge and I do want to apologize for constantly being on the ledge.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So the last time we recorded would have been around November 2021.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Is that right?

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think so.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think it was Zoom because you were back in New York.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yep.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It was last season on SNL maybe?

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Last season we were about to put out Smash.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Morning All-Stars.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I do.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And I don't know if I've ever told any of you this.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sure we've talked about this to some degree.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But that was, of course, our step-by-step episode, TGIF episode.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, there's a lot of...

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We tried to pack in three of the shows.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And I think the feeling before was like, I think we maybe all asked, is that too many?

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And the answer was yes.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We kept you for a long time on a fucking Zoom.

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It was good.

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I had a lot of fun, but I remember feeling like, Jesus, we have really...

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I was participating and I didn't...

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You guys did nothing wrong.

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But I will say that in that appearance, I got sort of...

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You know, I kind of...

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was confused and I thought that maybe the butt master wasn't...

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I thought that the writers of step-by-step were creating some sort of fake product.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, right. That's what happened.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Because I knew that the Thigh Master existed.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The Thigh Master, which was Susan Summers' product, who was on step-by-step,

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
who's passed away since we recorded that, I believe.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And then they made a reference to something else, the Butt Master,

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and you thought that was a fictional product.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I thought it was funny.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It sounded like such a 90s joke almost, you know what I mean?

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Like, yeah, I guess you got to get your butt master.

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And anyway, I felt so bad when I feel like you revealed that.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think I...

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, that's a thing.

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I um-actually'd you, I think.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Another thing, that's what...

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
My podcast aren't about tangents.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
They're about um-actually.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They're about correcting people constantly.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It was fully fair, and I'm thankful that you did, because like...

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Anyway, then I would say the next day, maybe two days...

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I think it was the very next day.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I had to get some dental surgery, and they put me on nitrous oxide.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And for some people, this is like an enjoyable occurrence.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I have a friend who like, she says like she like listens to like fish concerts

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
while she's on nitrous at the dentist.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
For me, I got fully high.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I felt like I was like I was in the dentist's chair,

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and it was like sort of folding into the floor below me.

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And the only thing I could think about is how I fucked up the butt master thing.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And it was like the worst high of my life.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh God.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So you're hearing about nitrous as chill, man.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You can have a hell of a music hits harder instead.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm like, they're going to cancel me.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
They're coming after me.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh my God.

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is that us? Is that the listeners?

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know.

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You don't want to be inside my brain, Scott.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You know what's funny is I had a plan.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I was like, you know what might be funny at the top of the show

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
is to reference the butt master thing and bring it up in a way of like,

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
now Kyle, I want to put you at ease and let you know

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
we've not been thinking about the butt master for three years.

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's water under the bridge.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It has not been something constantly on our brains for three straight years.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And then I was like, is that like a bothersome joke to do at the time?

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Then you go right into, you were beating yourself up much harder.

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So you actually have been thinking about it for three years.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, no, I was thinking about bringing it up as if it's a thing that we cared about or thought about.

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's been such a long time since we've had you, Kyle.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And by the way, the butt master thing was fine.

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I understand the confusion.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Everybody does.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There were never flame wars in our Facebook or Reddit entirely about how flame wars.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's a retro phrase.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Y2K, you see?

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, smart.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No, I feel like you also maybe mentioned it.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I know you at least texted about it after too.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And if you want to cut all the butt master stuff, feel free, I think.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I felt bad.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I do remember now that I felt bad that you felt bad.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't know how long it lasted.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I unfortunately just suffer from neuroses and anxiety and all of that.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So like, yeah, I just get obsessive about stuff.

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We put out two episodes a week and I can't go to bed until the episode posts generally.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I have anxiety every single time.

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And what is the main thought that is?

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That either there's something technical I've screwed up, something's wrong with it,

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
or that just something I've said in the episode is wrong or somebody's going to get annoyed by it.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And it's fine.

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If it makes you feel any better, I also stay up usually.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I have a terrible time getting to bed before midnight.

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So I usually stay awake and check on Wednesdays and Fridays as well.

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, I think it's what a lot of listeners do too because they can't wait for the newest podcast The Ride and Drop.

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Has there ever been an experience where those thoughts have turned out to be true or as bad as you imagine them?

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Rarely for anything I'm saying.

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Once in a while, though, I posted for the wrong time or once in a while I'll do something technically is wrong.

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's rare, but once in a while.

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So that keeps you going.

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That keeps your brain going when it happens twice a year, once a year, whatever it is.

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There's also once or twice a year where like, oh, there's a hosting outage, the hosting or iTunes or whatever.

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And it's like we can't do anything.

213
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I get what you're saying.

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There was a weird thing recently.

215
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I think it happened while I was gone.

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know if this is a mistake, but you put out an episode that was entirely about your credit card points.

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That must have been like that was like an error.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That was just something we recorded that in private.

219
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And I accidentally posted that instead of an episode.

220
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's what I thought when I listened to it.

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This is what they would have been talking about.

222
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm going to post a real episode, which is about Goofy's barnstormer.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But it was accidentally about credit card points.

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, I want to say something as a representative of the audience for you, Mike.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And that's that we're cool with whatever we get.

226
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you.

227
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You don't need to be losing sleep over it.

228
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And if there's a mistake, that's fine.

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And that makes you human.

230
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Thank you very much.

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I do appreciate it.

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's a really beautiful.

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That is a nice thing to hear.

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Wow.

235
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wow.

236
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You know, I feel like we got to look out for each other.

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah.

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

239
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah.

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah.

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's the us and the audience.

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Thank you for standing up for the whole audience and and saying I don't listen to the show.

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You're saying a nice thing, but I get it.

244
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I understand.

245
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I still accept it and enjoy that.

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That makes me feel good.

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's beautiful.

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's really nice to and I'm glad that I'm back here to Kyle's back here so that we can all like, you know,

249
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
you know, because I think there's a history of you on the show.

250
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I feel like you like you helped us get some nice like connective moments.

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, that's true.

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah.

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Go in that one where we were all drinking and we went to Buffalo Wild Wings after.

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That was the first.

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't want to let to put you on the spot with personal things that we all we talked about it the whole episode.

257
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Then let's let's go to Buffalo Wild Wings.

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's go to Buffalo.

259
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And then we went there and that was the first that you opened up that you were maybe going to pop the question to your now wife, Kate, I think.

260
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, yeah.

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's right.

262
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But you were like workshopping the idea.

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That was probably the first you told anybody, right?

264
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You hadn't even thought about doing it until you stepped foot into the Buffalo Wild Wings.

265
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah. Yeah.

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Something about their wings.

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And the buffaloes.

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What about that buffalo?

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Or something about hanging out with three dorks at the Burbank Buffalo Wild Wings.

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're like, I got to lock my relationship down.

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't do this shit anymore.

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What have I?

273
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What has my life turned into?

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The wise counsel of John Jameson's product, you know, helped you push you over the edge.

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No, but I think.

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I forgot about that.

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thanks for that reminder.

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No, that was that was a nice thing.

280
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Let's keep it up.

281
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And it's working.

282
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And it's working out.

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We got a baby.

284
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah.

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's happened since you've since you've been on the show.

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Congrats on that.

287
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I have not told you, I don't think in a year and a half.

288
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Congrats.

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
There's nothing like microphones to put the pressure on.

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
All good, brother.

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I know that you've been busy.

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, you're right.

293
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But it's one word.

294
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
At the end of the day, it's one word.

295
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You can always make time for one word.

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, sorry.

297
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I haven't been there for you.

299
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't think we need to cover anything else today.

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I feel like good about it.

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Our personal business is square.

302
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, no, we're all we're all set.

303
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You said the audience is good with anything we do.

304
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Sure.

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So just a 10 minute episode where we say nice stuff.

306
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
They like you.

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you're earnest.

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
If you're coming out there being like, this is something I care about.

309
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I think that they're going to appreciate that.

310
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hey, Kyle, it makes you feel any better when the but master first came up.

311
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I had a split second in the row season.

312
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I went, Oh God, which of the four of us was the but master?

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And then it all came flooding back.

314
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You thought somebody was a character?

315
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, I thought it was an insult.

316
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And then we said step by step and it just unlocked.

317
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Like I could picture where I was when we were doing this.

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You literally don't remember any of this.

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So that's good.

320
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So I remember entirely now.

321
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I remember feeling so bad that he felt bad.

322
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But I thought like for a split second, I went like you.

323
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
OK, here's what I think actually.

324
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah.

325
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Is that you were like, oh shit.

326
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There was an episode where everybody named me the but master because of something I said.

327
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And now I'm freaking out because I don't remember any of the inside jokes.

328
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I think if I had been Chris and the but master, it would have come up every episode.

329
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We should vote.

330
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Who is the but master?

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Jason.

332
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I painted back myself into a corner.

333
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah, you did pretty much ask for it.

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And what makes him the but master?

335
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, you know.

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Just give him a look here.

337
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You see him.

338
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He's the but master.

339
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He's Jason.

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Speaks for itself.

341
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We did learn a lot about various sexual things that Jason knows a lot about while I was gone.

342
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's right.

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I feel like that's going to get revisited a lot.

344
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That'll get revisited soon.

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let's flip hard the other way because we talked about we talked about your daughter.

346
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Look, OK, let's just hard separate.

347
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
OK, before we started recording, you were talking about just yesterday.

348
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Just yesterday, you were at Disneyland.

349
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You started the process.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You're taking your kid to Disneyland, a beautiful thing.

351
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We love hearing about this when guests switch into that mode and you had something you were starting to say.

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I forget if it was about Mickey's house or you had an observation.

353
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's right.

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
OK, yes.

355
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So we went to my movie came out.

356
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Our movie came out.

357
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There's a lot of people that make a movie happen.

358
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I'm just not trying to take personally singular ownership over it by any means.

359
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But the movie came out yesterday and I kind of wanted to get away.

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Get away from the scene a bit and just sort of do my own thing.

361
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So the noise was sort of off, so to speak.

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And so my wife and my daughter, we all went down to Disneyland and she's one and a half.

363
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So she's like not fully aware and engaging with that sort of universe.

364
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You know what I mean?

365
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
She knows who Mickey is.

366
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But like, you know, we took her on Small World probably like a few months ago.

367
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And I think I don't know that she really gets what's happening.

368
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Sure, sure.

369
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's a little bit in the rain.

370
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I forgot.

371
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You started telling me right around this time.

372
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Around that time.

373
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, we took her on Small World and she like clapped.

374
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah.

375
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Something.

376
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah.

377
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But she likes Mickey Mouse.

378
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
She has a Mickey Mouse doll.

379
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
We have Mickey Mouse t-shirts.

380
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And you say like, oh, where's Mickey?

381
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
She like points to her no matter what shirt she is.

382
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
When you say Mickey, she points to her shirt because she knows that Mickey's on her shirt sometimes.

383
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Any of this.

384
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
All to say that I had never gone to Mickey's home in Toontown.

385
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And so we did that and we were sort of, I don't know, I was really curious as to what her response would be to meeting Mickey.

386
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because I feel like it could be full just silence, awkwardness.

387
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It could be fear.

388
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It could be anything.

389
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And we waited in line.

390
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And I'm going to get to my note in a moment.

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But I just wanted to say that like when you're in a line, you watch a movie and then they open a door and then you're like right outside of Mickey's, I guess what, is it a cabin?

392
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Is it a dressing room?

393
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
He's shooting his movie barn.

394
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
His movie barn.

395
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He makes movies in his barn.

396
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes.

397
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Much like Walt Disney with the Alice comedies, if you will.

398
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes.

399
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He knows his history.

400
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Smart.

401
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And when the door to the barn opened and like we saw that there was like Mickey Mouse in there and she recognized him, she was like, oh shit, pretty psyched.

402
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And when we finally got up to him, she was so excited and laughing and touching his nose.

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And it was really, really touching.

404
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And I think when we left his house and like we were back in Toontown and we walked past Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin, she's like pointing at it and laughing.

405
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It almost felt like, oh, now this whole universe makes sense.

406
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This is like a weird, wacky place where people are having fun.

407
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Wow.

408
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Like she figured it out by going through the, by like meeting Mickey made her understand what this is.

409
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's what I'm projecting.

410
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That could be incorrect.

411
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Okay.

412
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Here is my issue.

413
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And I'm curious where you guys fall on this.

414
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So the Mickey we met was classic Mickey and it almost, I think he was wearing like, he was kind of like the Fantasia Mickey.

415
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know that he had on the wizard cap, but he had like a red robe.

416
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah.

417
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh, yeah.

418
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But they still do the thing where it's like recreating scenes and he's like on set, quote unquote.

419
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Because we saw Mickey a couple of weeks ago and he was wearing a Steamboat Willie outfit.

420
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay.

421
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So they do strip on rings.

422
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's not my issue.

423
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I liked, I liked that it was iconic Mickey.

424
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:17,000
My issue is that the movie we're watching is one of those like new movies, a la the like Mickey Railroad.

425
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh.

426
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That like the Mickey.

427
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Stylistically is so different than the Mickey Mouse you're about to interact with.

428
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Right.

429
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I almost feel like my daughter was like confused, like doesn't, didn't know that was Mickey Mouse that we're watching on the screen

430
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
because she knows round face classic Mickey.

431
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Basic Mickey.

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I feel like there's a contradiction to have those two in the, in the exact same place.

433
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes.

434
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's interesting.

435
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll say this about my daughter who's a few months older than your daughter.

436
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah.

437
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
We, she has now watched every different version of Pooh Bear.

438
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And I think that taught her, like she now accepts, you just go that's Pooh and she goes great.

439
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Like she didn't say great, but I almost feel like eventually you just get, the kid gets used to the fact that there's a hundred versions.

440
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
They look different sometimes.

441
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But because of Runaway Railway, which is that style of Mickey, I do, there is a weird contrast now.

442
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And especially because they've ended the shorts, the shorts now are over.

443
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So I don't even know if they're going to abandon that style completely.

444
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So there may be a time when we have like three or four verges, like styles of Mickey in Toontown.

445
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So I got, I hear what you're saying, but I feel like it's going to get even more chaotic from here.

446
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I think, I think get out those shorts.

447
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Really?

448
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't take them out.

449
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh really?

450
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I've not been on that ride though.

451
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I've heard it's great.

452
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's a, it's a very good ride.

453
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah.

454
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Could be a scary one for, for a little kid freaking out.

455
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But we haven't done that yet.

456
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why not just show like plain crazy or something like that?

457
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah.

458
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Didn't they used to?

459
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I mean, this is news to me that it is the new style.

460
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Maybe that was a move to make everything consistent with Runaway Railway.

461
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But I think probably that is weird.

462
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If you're going to show that Mickey and then you want to meet that Mickey.

463
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hmm.

464
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But it would also look weird if they had made a suit out of the new Mickey, that new Mickey.

465
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
He would look strange and he would, he would scare kids.

466
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yes.

467
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Cause he's unnerving.

468
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And there's the animatronic in the ride of the new Mickey and it is very weird to see three dimensional Mickey and Minnie.

469
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The proportions are strange.

470
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah.

471
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
In person.

472
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Here's my knee jerk though to that.

473
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean, I don't like if it caused confusion for your daughter, but it makes me flash to the Chuck E.

474
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Cheese conundrum that we all dealt with growing up where Chuck E.

475
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Cheese on stage is different than Chuck on screen.

476
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Right.

477
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
He might be animated and a puppet and a robot on the stage and a suit in the room.

478
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And they're all visible all at the same time.

479
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah.

480
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Which has only gotten crazier because now some, then you might also see the bad CGI one voiced by the guy from the band bowling for soup.

481
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Right.

482
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And did I get the band right?

483
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yep.

484
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Great, great.

485
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And then there's a whole other one.

486
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Right.

487
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I think maybe it's, you know, I don't mean to do that kind of like generational thing of, well, you know, she's got to deal with it.

488
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
She's got to like, you know, I dealt with it.

489
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But I think maybe I like that it like if you're challenged by inconsistent brands to have to like overcome and process that there's four completely different renderings of the same character in one room.

490
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Well, this is a thing I feel like, Mike, maybe you're the same way that I learned very early on in the 90s comic book boom because everyone drew the X-Men differently.

491
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Everyone drew Batman differently.

492
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And I was just like, oh, there's different, different artists for these things.

493
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's true.

494
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But you didn't do that when you were one.

495
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Right.

496
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And it wasn't.

497
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I was like eight or nine.

498
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Like I was, I was gaining media literacy.

499
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I would think the plus I would understand, like I'm sure they probably just put those shorts though in that line because the whole thing is very 90s Mickey.

500
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The whole house is 90s Mickey.

501
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's a thing.

502
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The video feels.

503
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Video Michael Eisner just soaked in the walls as far as like 90s because Toontown, that's when they built it or that's when it opened or whatever.

504
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But they probably just put it in for synergy.

505
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And I could see now that they're not doing those shorts anymore.

506
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I could see somebody go, well, let's put the old stuff back in that line because we have the new stuff in a full ride.

507
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Exactly. They can be two isolated things.

508
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah.

509
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That's the thing.

510
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
How do you keep them separate?

511
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You go into that one right.

512
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You're going to see that Mickey.

513
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You go into this house.

514
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That would be my for sure.

515
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Have you shown your daughter Mickey Mouse Clubhouse or any of those versions?

516
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
We just watched for the first time, like truly a couple days ago.

517
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It looks worse than Reboot from the 90s.

518
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Really?

519
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The CGI on it is dog shit.

520
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I will say, yeah, I agree.

521
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah.

522
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But it was making me laugh because like it feels like I'm watching a video game.

523
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah, it's a cut scene from a video game, like a PlayStation one video game.

524
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Do they have no gravity?

525
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Does everybody just kind of fly around a little bit?

526
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

527
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Sure.

528
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And there's a couple like fun, like they might be giant songs that like the theme in the

529
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
end.

530
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yeah.

531
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And those play in Toontown now.

532
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And my daughter loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

533
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

534
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Clubhouse.

535
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And they got like music.

536
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Come inside.

537
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's fun inside.

538
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You know what I haven't said on the show?

539
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
There's a music version of that playing and like goofy movie.

540
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But if you go to the very back of Toontown under the cave, there's like sleepy versions

541
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
of all those songs.

542
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
There's like a dark part back that my daughter loves to run around and pick up leaves.

543
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
They keep it calm over there?

544
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But there's like calm versions of the exact same soundtrack.

545
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So if you move out of that area, you get the more high energy version.

546
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But the slow, like the sleepy version.

547
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I haven't seen anybody mention.

548
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I just noticed it the last time we went.

549
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
That's really nice.

550
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah.

551
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But the show is unbelievably bad looking.

552
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
What is the name of the one where they're, it's two dimensions.

553
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
They're like racing or something?

554
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
No, no.

555
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The one where they're all in like a nightclub?

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Uh oh.

557
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That's, that's older.

558
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
House of Mouse.

559
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
House of Mouse.

560
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah, that's older.

561
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That's even older.

562
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But that's where it looks better because 2D animation each is better.

563
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That's where like Hades is at the nightclub.

564
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah.

565
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And you guys remember Gushers?

566
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah.

567
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I guess I do.

568
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That was crazy.

569
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Pikachu.

570
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I mean, that was wild when Pikachu showed up.

571
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Well, you know what?

572
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Look, we.

573
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Alice.

574
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh, the Alice Cooper was on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

575
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh.

576
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
As a dog character.

577
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I heard about this.

578
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Probably from here.

579
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah.

580
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That's probably right.

581
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
No one else has talked about it.

582
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Okay.

583
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So we got that to cover.

584
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We got the back.

585
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We got like, we got the grass to cover and the back of the grass to cover.

586
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Right.

587
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But.

588
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
We have the three or four, the, the, the Twitter account lost media busters, posted

589
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
the pictures from the attempted Herbie, the love bug CG cartoon.

590
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Really?

591
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That there's like, no, there's like nothing.

592
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Wow.

593
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
About, except a few screen grabs.

594
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And it looks weird.

595
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
We were talking about when we were pitching what we're going to do here, Kyle, you threw

596
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
out the possibility of that.

597
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
There was this little mermaid, Jim Henson show.

598
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Is that the thing you were talking about?

599
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That there was a.

600
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Ariel's.

601
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Ariel's Island.

602
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Whoa.

603
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It was a, yeah.

604
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Produced by Jim Henson in 1990, like pretty soon before he, he, he passed and apparently

605
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
he just was not happy with, with the, with the, with it.

606
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah.

607
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It was just him?

608
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Like it didn't pass?

609
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
He didn't, I don't, I think he was just a producer on it.

610
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I don't think he directed it or co-wrote it or anything like that, but it's live action

611
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and there are puppet, puppet representations of all the little mermaid characters.

612
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And they look like the Disney versions?

613
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yep.

614
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Wow.

615
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Little Mermaid's Island.

616
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Huh.

617
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Huh.

618
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Is there, is it any, is it viewable?

619
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Like.

620
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's on YouTube.

621
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I think there were two episodes made.

622
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I only know that one is available on YouTube.

623
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't know if both are.

624
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But yeah, it's fast.

625
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I mean, like it doesn't, it feels like somewhat related to like a sort of next generation

626
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
of say, welcome to Pooh Corner or Dumbo's Flying Circus or something like that.

627
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, sure.

628
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Right.

629
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Well, speaking of different versions of characters, that's very much in that where it's like the

630
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
ones you recognize, but there's something off because they got to be big enough to fit

631
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
in a suit or they're just that, I mean, it's really just that like, what is, where does

632
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
the creepiness of Pooh Corner come from?

633
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's that like, it's the like painted backgrounds and suits on.

634
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
There's just, I know that locked into your brand, the like inherent scariness of those

635
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
shows.

636
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh yeah.

637
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't, yeah, you're right.

638
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I mean, like if we were staring at the image, I feel like we could call out all the things

639
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
that are weird about it.

640
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Sure, sure.

641
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I mean, in the one case it's weird that Winnie the Pooh is talking to Piglet about strangers

642
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and drugs and stuff.

643
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
But there is like, yeah, maybe like sort of a deadness in the eyes or something like that

644
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
that isn't very warm.

645
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah.

646
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And when you've seen the like animation from the best era of animation and that's how you

647
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
know the characters, then going to sort of creepily dead eyed suits.

648
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah.

649
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I watched all that stuff too.

650
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah, I liked it.

651
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah.

652
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But let me, let's try to talk about the thing we're supposed to talk about.

653
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Guys, remember, tangents are over, all right?

654
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
The scutful policy, okay.

655
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
No, I am excited to talk about what you, you pitched this a while ago and I've been amped

656
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
on it for a while.

657
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So I'm excited that we're finally talking about Grad Night.

658
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And if you don't know what Grad Night is, just the basic cliff notes of it, it is the

659
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Disneyland and at one time Disney World tradition of renting the entire park out to high school

660
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
seniors, to graduating high school seniors.

661
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
These events that are put on throughout May and June where high school seniors get the

662
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
run of the park from dusk till dawn, an overnight event that does not interrupt the regular

663
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
flow of Disneyland business during the day.

664
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But, you know, they cut the teens wild and it's a really fun area we've never explored.

665
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And I'm glad you brought it up.

666
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Is there anything that you could point to of like, what got you excited about that initially?

667
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Well, did you do it?

668
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
What's that? I did do it.

669
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yes.

670
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Okay.

671
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah.

672
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I think, well, that's a question.

673
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Is if anybody here, I think probably only me, unless you guys didn't do like the Disney

674
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
World.

675
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You didn't travel, you know, super far to go to.

676
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
No, but I ended up at Disney World right after I graduated with the high school band.

677
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Okay.

678
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But it wasn't like, I mean, it was sort of a like, but it was a bunch of, it was every

679
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
class.

680
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That's not staying up all night.

681
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That's not going crazy.

682
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
We were staying up all night.

683
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's just your own choice.

684
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But that was our choice.

685
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Is there any Disney company making you stay on property?

686
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If you want any sleep, you got to go do it on a bench somewhere.

687
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Right.

688
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
No, not the same thing.

689
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And yeah, Jason, you haven't, you didn't do it.

690
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
No, I didn't.

691
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I was trying, I was reading up on the Florida one, which was kind of, it ran for a while

692
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and then it was kind of start stop.

693
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And Jane was like, did they still do grad nine at Disneyland?

694
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And it's like, oh, you're thinking about this.

695
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Disney World ended a while ago, but yet Disneyland has been going since 1961.

696
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yeah.

697
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah.

698
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Disney World stopped in the 2000s sometime.

699
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But Kyle, you were, so you did, you did not actually do this with your high school.

700
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
No, we had a grad night though, which was like in our gym.

701
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And I think that, you know, there was like, it was maybe casino themed and like you could

702
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
win like a, you know, an Xbox or something.

703
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Sure.

704
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Or like, you know, I don't, I don't know what the like prizes were.

705
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The main thing I remember was Cody Green got hypnotized.

706
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Do tell.

707
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
He, I don't know, man, like the hypnotist came and like Cody was going off and doing

708
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
some weird stuff.

709
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Like he's on nitrous or something.

710
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
He's like, I am the butt master.

711
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Cody Green, the original butt master.

712
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I've not seen a ton of hypnotists.

713
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
We don't need to go down this route.

714
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
That is a pretty wild thing to see.

715
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
There's some naughty ones in Vegas.

716
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah, I'm sure.

717
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
There's like dirty hypnotists.

718
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm going to be forced to be the butt master.

719
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
The whole point is like, and maybe this is the sort of mission statement with the Disney

720
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
one as well is like, let's, because I guess it's the night after graduation.

721
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Well, it depends.

722
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I think the, I mean, the Disneyland one runs, it's like, I mean, maybe they try to time

723
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
it out that way, but there's like a ton of school.

724
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So just like whenever works probably.

725
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I think for us, it was like, I want to say the night after our graduation.

726
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And the idea is let's keep all the kids contained so they don't get drunk, essentially.

727
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Let them go wild.

728
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But in a, in a way that we're checking and like, there's a question.

729
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Just like start like having sex all over.

730
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

731
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Sure.

732
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Sure.

733
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I mean, were there, were there any corners of that gym where that would have been a

734
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
party or it was that pretty lock?

735
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Oh, I feel like you know a little more than you're letting on.

736
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I might have kissed my girlfriend.

737
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Okay.

738
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Well, I might not have either.

739
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I don't, I don't fully recall.

740
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Now is that due to sneaking in booze or is that due to you being hypnotized as well?

741
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
No, I did not get hypnotized.

742
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I actually think it was very, it was for me personally, incredibly like a clean

743
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
interaction, like experience.

744
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Sure, sure.

745
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We had one of these kind of lock-in things.

746
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It was post-prom.

747
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay.

748
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So we have to the senior prom.

749
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Everyone went home and changed or changed someone else's house.

750
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Wherever the cool limo dropped you back off.

751
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But you got in the cool limo?

752
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You were in the cool limo?

753
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I was in the cool limo and we were at the Philadelphia, the Hyatt right on the Delaware

754
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
River and it was pouring rain all day except for the morning with the drunk driving

755
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
demonstration.

756
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
This is all the same day?

757
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
This is all the same day.

758
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
That's a big day.

759
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
This is where all of Jason's memories come from is one day.

760
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And then we, so you had to be at post-prom.

761
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It was like, it was like one a.m. to five a.m.

762
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And yeah, there were casino tables.

763
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
There were raffles.

764
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
There was like the big sumo suits.

765
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The pool was open.

766
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Oh my God.

767
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Sumo suit.

768
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
There's some classic stuff.

769
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh yeah.

770
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I don't think I've ever done a sumo suit.

771
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Did you do a sumo suit?

772
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I did not do a sumo suit, but everyone.

773
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Should we do sumo suits?

774
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's so sorry.

775
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Let's do it.

776
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We'll find a place to do it.

777
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Even if we have to sneak into a post-prom party.

778
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Fine.

779
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah.

780
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Everyone who went was guaranteed at least one prize from the drawing.

781
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I won a little 13 inch TV that sat in all my college dorm rooms at my first place out

782
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
here until each TV is caught on.

783
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Was that the TV you were using until Mike gave you his TV?

784
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Was that a clean transfer from the prize to?

785
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
There was one TV in between I think.

786
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Just one though.

787
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I had a smaller bedroom TV and that was just given away on Craigslist.

788
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
How's my TV doing by the way?

789
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Hanging in there.

790
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Great.

791
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's still doing good?

792
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay.

793
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah.

794
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
From what year?

795
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
From how long we talking?

796
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
2010.

797
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Wow.

798
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It's a 14 year old TV.

799
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Just set up a Blu-ray player in there.

800
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Wow.

801
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Watched the Walter Hill directed movie Last Man Standing starring Bruce Willis.

802
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The first TV commercial I ever booked bought that TV.

803
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That's right.

804
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
That's cool.

805
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Glad to hear it still.

806
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I bought a PS3.

807
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Still humming.

808
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
PS3 with that TV I think also.

809
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Wow.

810
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I was like well I'm really living it up.

811
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Geez.

812
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Sure.

813
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Glad it's still in good hands.

814
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Try to watch taking of Pelham 123 on it but Hoopla was being real buggy.

815
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
The library one.

816
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The library one yeah.

817
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The Walter Mathau Pelham not the John Travolta one.

818
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Oh the original.

819
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Okay.

820
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The original.

821
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Kyle any thoughts about Mathau Pelham?

822
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Just funny guys I guess.

823
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Some funny Robert Shaw is in there.

824
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
He's the main robber.

825
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Robert Shaw okay.

826
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Okay here I will pivot it over though to the.

827
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Well actually I'll ask you Mike though.

828
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You didn't do it as anything.

829
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Did you have anything like this?

830
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Did you have some like everybody stay sober?

831
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
No not really.

832
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I mean after prom we went to like a boat.

833
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We like drove downtown to a boat for some weird reason but then we went home still.

834
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So I don't know what the point of it was.

835
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's just a lot of travel.

836
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
40, 30 minutes.

837
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Was there anything fun on the boat?

838
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I feel like it was the same boat that we went at the end of like eighth grade where I just

839
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
remember like dancing with a girl while Casey and Jojo played.

840
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah.

841
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Wow.

842
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And I just like was like vibrating with intensity which we've talked about how much we like

843
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
this all my life this song by Casey and Jojo.

844
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Because I'm like my son's super into it.

845
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't know if I passed that to you Kyle.

846
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh I didn't know that.

847
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Actually not so much lately but there's a there was a couple months there where we just

848
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
catch him like alone in his room.

849
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh my word.

850
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I prefer someone like you.

851
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That's very cute.

852
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah.

853
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It fell off though.

854
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You know why?

855
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Long string intro.

856
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah.

857
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
He gets bored.

858
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Really?

859
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah.

860
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I don't remember that on the radio.

861
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
There must be an edited version.

862
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
There must be.

863
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yes I think that was chopped.

864
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's not exactly like some like amazing orchestral Mozart piece of work on those strings.

865
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's worth the chop.

866
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I think you got chopped that.

867
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
But no we didn't have anything.

868
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
No lock in.

869
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm not sure.

870
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I don't think there was something I didn't get invited to.

871
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I don't think.

872
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
We like stayed at my friend's house maybe after.

873
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I don't remember.

874
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't think so though.

875
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Nothing like this.

876
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm feeling really lucky that I got to do the real deal that I did the Disneyland overnight.

877
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And I did it twice in fact because I joined my little sister for it a couple years later

878
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
when she graduated.

879
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And it's fun.

880
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
When you're me when you're a like you know like well I guess a couple of things like

881
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm you know I probably lost the Disneyland nerddom the most that I ever did in high school

882
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
but it never fully goes away.

883
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You're just like you're just burying it a little bit.

884
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So the opportunity that like oh the thing is going to be the big party is going to be

885
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
a Disneyland thing.

886
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And you know men may of course I'm going to be there having fun and mainly like trying

887
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
to pretend that I like the music that's playing.

888
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But maybe once in a while they have us waiting on Main Street for a while.

889
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Maybe I could point to one of the windows and say that's actually that's the name of

890
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
somebody who worked here.

891
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Maybe somebody maybe I get a smooch because of that.

892
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I would say the answer is no that did not happen.

893
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It definitely did not happen.

894
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
But yeah I so I would have this would have been 2003.

895
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That was my as referenced in the joke.

896
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It is over 20 years.

897
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah.

898
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Is that everybody that's or you know I'm 2002.

899
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
No I'm 2003.

900
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It was OK.

901
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And Mike sorry.

902
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
What's what are you to say a little louder Mike.

903
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Oh 2002.

904
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
OK.

905
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I was just I just want I just want people to hear I wasn't trying to embarrass you or

906
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
any.

907
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Oh no.

908
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Want to make sure it's OK.

909
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah.

910
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Because he's an upperclassman.

911
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I am now.

912
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You mentioned it.

913
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm the upperclassman on the show.

914
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You're the but master and I'm the upperclassman.

915
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You don't pull rank enough.

916
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You don't toss us around like you should.

917
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah.

918
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
2025.

919
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That's our new our new name.

920
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah.

921
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Scott's got a figure.

922
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Oh he's daddy.

923
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Scott is daddy because daddy's home.

924
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You're the but master.

925
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And I'm the I am the most daddy now of the of anyone.

926
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Now with the two kids.

927
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That's right.

928
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
By default.

929
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Right.

930
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I am daddy.

931
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You are more daddy than me.

932
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Much more daddy.

933
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That's talking about pulling rank.

934
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yeah.

935
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Hey I'm more daddy than you.

936
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Upperclassman.

937
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
All right.

938
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I don't know.

939
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Does daddy outrank upperclassman.

940
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I don't know.

941
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's another debate.

942
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm prepared to have that debate for a while.

943
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I hope this is someone's first episode.

944
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Anyways yeah I mean it was great.

945
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I was really looking forward to it.

946
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The all night challenge of it.

947
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I was that's not something I did a ton and I was worried that I would lose steam.

948
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But you know you just like you know you go wild with the sodas and then you know.

949
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And every ride is open.

950
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah.

951
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yes.

952
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Unless I had this question.

953
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I meant to look up like what is not like do they not do great moments with Mr.

954
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Lincoln.

955
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Are they asking for like dark room make out trouble if they leave something like that

956
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
open.

957
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
But as far as I know yeah it's everything is open and lines are relatively shorter

958
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
because it's not you know it's a very populated part.

959
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
There's probably like I don't even want to guess but I'd say you know at least it's

960
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
somewhere between 50 to 100 high schools there.

961
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So it's still a lot of people but not nearly as bad.

962
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And the big thing I think I liked this as a trying to be quiet about it theme park fan

963
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
that they do all this stuff to make it cool for teens or whatever.

964
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Like there's a bunch of there's a lot of like DJ setups those little like nightclubs

965
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and dance zones.

966
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But I of course did not want to do any of that shit.

967
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So that means less lines for me so I can just tear through all the rides.

968
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah you don't get caught in the distractions of dancing to 50 cent or whatever.

969
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Did they have any characters dancing or was it just grads.

970
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
That's a good question.

971
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I don't recall I will say I'll jump around a little bit and say that there is some grad

972
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
night energy preserved in a special that Doug Jones reminded me existed which is called

973
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Disneyland's summer.

974
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
What is it.

975
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Disneyland's summer vacation party.

976
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah this is a very good special from 1986 hosted by Malcolm Jamal Warner and a couple

977
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
of the facts of life girls and they run through tons of bands.

978
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So many that the lineup see that.

979
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I saw I only watched the John Cicada one.

980
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Oh yes I sent you that one.

981
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah yeah that's the there are two weirdly there are two specials that they tried to

982
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
make out of that was a Disney World one which which I'll circle back to.

983
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But this this 80s one very very good.

984
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Highly recommend it.

985
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I didn't even there's not even much in it in terms of like clips or funny stuff to play

986
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
because it's just good.

987
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You just like pop around.

988
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's Videopolis.

989
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Videopolis is new and you get the bangles over there and you get Miami Sound Machine

990
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
doing bad boys over there.

991
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I know that clip because Doug put that in one of his one.

992
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Yeah one of his compilations.

993
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Yeah I love that.

994
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Which is great.

995
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
He did a really great remix that is just like he just cut together all the footage

996
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
from this thing.

997
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It was an Everything is Terrible video.

998
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Forgive me Doug.

999
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I don't remember the name but there's we could post it.

1000
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But there's like he just cut together all of the kids dancing at the various acts and

1001
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
there'll just be a sporadic character in there once in a while.

1002
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's pretty like there's like and it's always weird ones.

1003
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's like just Captain Hook at like the fifth dimension or something or my favorite 80s

1004
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
ELO.

1005
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
ELO in 86 and they're performing in front of the castle with a stage that's set up just

1006
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
for that.

1007
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That's all neon triangles.

1008
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So my vibe and it's ELO and it cuts to the audience and it's entirely human except for

1009
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
one lowly Fantasia ostrich in a sea of people.

1010
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Just one ostrich head poking up like oddly chosen characters but a hell of a part.

1011
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
This is by the way and this is I think what I wanted to say about any of this is like

1012
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I know it's things we can't look.

1013
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
These are like old high school events right.

1014
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
We're not supposed to be there.

1015
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
We're older than nice.

1016
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But any of these I would kill to time travel to like era like 80s 90s grad nights.

1017
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I mean yeah I'll sort of state the obvious here and we can go into it as much as we want.

1018
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:53,000
But like the line the musical lineups over the course of grad night history are incredible.

1019
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Insane.

1020
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
That's so crazy.

1021
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah this must be what you spark to as I have here and there.

1022
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Like if you catch these brochures ever going around you will sometimes yeah you'll look

1023
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
at like and this is a program they stopped by the way.

1024
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Today it's just DJs and stuff.

1025
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But up until like mid 90s I would say there would be these years where like as extra enticement

1026
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
there's five major recording acts or more.

1027
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And we've dealt a lot of times with like who Disney thinks is cool and good to put in these

1028
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
things and in grad nights in the 80s and 90s they weren't off at all.

1029
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
They were right on them.

1030
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
They were good good bands.

1031
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah I've got I don't know if you guys have access to a list but I mean for the sake of

1032
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Y2K our movie coming out takes place in 1999 going into 2000.

1033
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
The headliner for the 99 grad night is Britney Spears.

1034
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Oh my god.

1035
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Jesus.

1036
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Britney Spears real big fish and sister Hazel.

1037
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Like that is.

1038
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Wow.

1039
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That's like yeah.

1040
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
That's like yeah you know today that'd be like what?

1041
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Chabalrone or something like that?

1042
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah.

1043
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
That's like an idea.

1044
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And actually of the moment like correctly calibrated pop culture person.

1045
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Here I'll email actually.

1046
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I have something here but you probably have a better list.

1047
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And this is the thing I think to do throughout as we as we just get excited about these lists

1048
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
of names.

1049
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'll tell you I'll tell you the lineup that for me was most exciting that like if I could

1050
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
see I think it's I want to say it's maybe 85.

1051
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
OK.

1052
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yes.

1053
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
85 is Midnight Star.

1054
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Fuck.

1055
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Who great R&B funk group they did No Parking on the Dance Floor.

1056
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
They had a song called Curious which is one of my favorite songs of all time.

1057
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Chalamar.

1058
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Another great group.

1059
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
A Night to Remember.

1060
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
One of the good.

1061
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
That song's a masterpiece.

1062
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Yeah.

1063
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
This is for Lover and You.

1064
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Tina Marie.

1065
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Tina Marie every night.

1066
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Some of these were just one night.

1067
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Some of them were just like were five of them.

1068
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Wow.

1069
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
If you went to Grad Night 85 you're guaranteed Tina Marie.

1070
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You're guaranteed Square Biz.

1071
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And Emotion.

1072
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So we got we got some sort of new wave in there.

1073
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Run DMC.

1074
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Run DMC.

1075
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Now this is like Run DMC pretty much entering the peak of their powers.

1076
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh yeah.

1077
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Right.

1078
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah.

1079
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
85 is like exactly when that's that's when Aerosmith happens or kind of right after.

1080
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Or it's certainly after a couple of the big after Rock Box or big ones like that.

1081
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Yeah.

1082
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yeah.

1083
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Wow.

1084
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah.

1085
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Shannon.

1086
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Some good freestyle music.

1087
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I mean all of these even in 89 I see you know who went to the 89 one was our friend Mike

1088
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Moon.

1089
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I remember him telling me.

1090
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Do you know who performed it?

1091
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I have no idea.

1092
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's like information society.

1093
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That song.

1094
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I want to know what you're thinking now.

1095
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But new kids on the block were there in 89.

1096
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
That's wow.

1097
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yeah.

1098
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You're a graduating high school senior.

1099
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You get to spend all night at Disneyland and you get new kids on the block.

1100
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's not even like so.

1101
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Now sometimes they get it wrong.

1102
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Like there's a kid like in that special I was describing one that we've bemoaned recently

1103
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Shannon.

1104
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
They're still trying to shove their bullshit in there.

1105
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But for the most part these lists are insane.

1106
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah.

1107
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
There's a lot of Shalimar.

1108
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I see Pointer Sisters throughout.

1109
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
That's always a good thing for sure.

1110
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I think that was what 82.

1111
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm trying to find that one.

1112
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I see them in 81.

1113
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I see 82.

1114
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I see Sister Sledge, Bertie Higgins, Key Largo.

1115
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
That's wild.

1116
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And Frankie and the Knockouts.

1117
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Do you know Frankie and the Knockouts?

1118
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I don't know Frankie and the Knockouts.

1119
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
That's a yacht.

1120
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Well you might know it if I.

1121
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I don't know if you've ever heard of this on a yacht playlist.

1122
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Sweetheart, it was you from the start.

1123
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Now it doesn't ring a bell.

1124
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I don't know if I know that.

1125
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It's kind of good like you know like fine early 80s band.

1126
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
They were really good on Fridays.

1127
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Sometimes I'll put on all the musical guests from Fridays.

1128
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I've never done that.

1129
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Fridays was so great because it'll be like cool.

1130
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It's yacht stuff.

1131
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It's Kenny Loggins.

1132
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But then like the Beach Boys were on.

1133
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And then but then like actual like, you know, edgier, you know,

1134
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Devo the Clash.

1135
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Then I feel like every I'm forgetting one.

1136
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
There's a real like Boz Skaggs.

1137
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Anything.

1138
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And if you don't know Fridays, that is the early 80s competitor to Saturday Night Live.

1139
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That is why Larry David met Michael Richards.

1140
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I don't know.

1141
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I can't speak to the show, but music always I feel like every single week of Fridays.

1142
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Music was right on the money.

1143
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
That's great.

1144
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
That's that's that endorsement.

1145
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah, I'm looking at 87 right now.

1146
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Also, we might be looking at different lists because I have I think Pointer Sisters 82.

1147
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Sister Sledge 81.

1148
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
OK.

1149
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Wow.

1150
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Oh, yeah.

1151
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That's different.

1152
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
BJ Thomas on 75 with the Pointer Sisters on this.

1153
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Oh, yes.

1154
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I emailed like this is a version of it.

1155
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
But it's not like, yeah, it's probably some of the same stuff.

1156
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It also might be that like these people were all there and like I'm seeing a selected.

1157
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Yeah, maybe.

1158
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I've also seen lists where they like merge Disneyland and Disney World.

1159
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh, maybe that's so that I think some of them are all over the map in that regard.

1160
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
But then.

1161
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Oh, here.

1162
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
All right.

1163
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Let me throw out 88 is a strong one.

1164
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Expose.

1165
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I didn't even.

1166
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Roger Troutman.

1167
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Roger Troutman in 88.

1168
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
That's if you don't know.

1169
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That's is he.

1170
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
He is the vocoder voice in Zap.

1171
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Not Zap isn't the vocoder voice.

1172
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Is he?

1173
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I don't know.

1174
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Yes.

1175
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Roger is performing the is it a vocoder or a talk box?

1176
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Oh, you probably know better than me.

1177
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But yeah, I think their very first record he's credited as also as Zap, which is like

1178
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
he's both.

1179
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Is that what that's confusing?

1180
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I mean, the group is called Zap.

1181
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah.

1182
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But like if I think if you look at the back of the record, like you'll see all the band

1183
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
members.

1184
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And then I think like Zap is I think also sort of like the guy who's singing through

1185
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
these songs.

1186
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
If that makes any sense.

1187
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Oh, OK.

1188
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Oh, like a character.

1189
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I could be Mr.

1190
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Roger plays.

1191
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Wow.

1192
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I don't know.

1193
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Don't.

1194
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Maybe.

1195
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Maybe not fair.

1196
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
That sounds that sounds up our alley in a Garth Brooks game.

1197
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Roger.

1198
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yes.

1199
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Roger is is definitely doing everything in the mastermind.

1200
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Wow.

1201
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So even like you get to see him at Disneyland.

1202
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Holy shit.

1203
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Michael Bolton.

1204
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Bolton in 88.

1205
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Men Without Hats.

1206
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Kind of confusing in 88.

1207
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yeah.

1208
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
That's as I'm picking years.

1209
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
That's when I'm looking at that brochure.

1210
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And by the way, all these brochures also just like awesome fonts, awesome neon, weird squiggles,

1211
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
weird like diagrams showing the kind of clothes that the men and the women have to wear because

1212
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
there was a dress code for all this.

1213
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
You had to you had to be fancy for it.

1214
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
But I'm looking at like I'm seeing I get to see Roger Troutman.

1215
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Star Tours is new.

1216
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Videopolis is new.

1217
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Captain EO is new.

1218
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Any of those.

1219
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Holy shit.

1220
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
For that to be my fucking graduating year.

1221
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,000
You see you see Mr. Bolton like when a man loves a woman.

1222
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
That is pretty cool.

1223
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
But that was almost like he walked into the room just now.

1224
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
No, it's not even like that, Scott.

1225
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But I do appreciate it.

1226
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Hey, so you were lifting us up.

1227
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I got to lift you up.

1228
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
No, no, no, no.

1229
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Yeah, I mess around.

1230
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But like honestly, it's just like cool to kick it with guys like you.

1231
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But yeah.

1232
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Do you think there's video of all of this somewhere?

1233
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
No, I don't think so.

1234
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Because I looked a little bit like in a fault somewhere online.

1235
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
God, maybe.

1236
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Yeah, yeah, not on YouTube.

1237
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
That's right.

1238
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Maybe Disney documented in some way.

1239
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah.

1240
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yeah, probably.

1241
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I mean, besides the specials, I don't really know.

1242
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Now, I do have a very specific grad night Disney story.

1243
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
OK.

1244
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But it's morbid.

1245
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
OK.

1246
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I was wondering about this.

1247
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I had a memory of I was I was going to ask you, but I didn't want to put you on the spot

1248
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:38,000
about it because the whole idea of this, by the way, let me I'll back up and say this

1249
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
started in 1961 and it started in a morbid way because I think there was a community,

1250
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I forget what city in the San Gabriel Valley.

1251
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
There was, you know, things like this, like overnight events for high school seniors were

1252
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
very common.

1253
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But, you know, there's the potential for people to get hurt.

1254
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
There's potential for drinking and driving and stuff.

1255
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And I think there was a tragedy in some community and they started talking about is there a

1256
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
way to do something that is safe and where we essentially like shake everybody down before

1257
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
they get in, put them in a place where they can't drink and, you know, but but in a positive

1258
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
way, you know, give everybody like a fun, safe time.

1259
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And this guy, Jack Lindquist, is who that's a name that we mentioned here and there, one

1260
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
of the like great Disneyland old white haired guys who thought of a lot of the stuff.

1261
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And he heard the community out and thought maybe that is a good idea.

1262
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Hey, and a way for us to make a little bit of money, too, even though then he had to like

1263
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
consult with various concerned, like the sheriff's, the local sheriff's department had to

1264
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
weigh in on.

1265
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Can this happen?

1266
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And the sheriff's department told Jack Lindquist who wanted to do this.

1267
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
The kids will burn Disneyland down.

1268
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Scary shit.

1269
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Wow.

1270
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
In fact, they did not.

1271
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
As we know, Disneyland remains open to this day.

1272
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
The teens didn't burn it down.

1273
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It was a huge hit.

1274
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It was only one night then, but it was such a massive success.

1275
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It expanded to all these nights.

1276
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Now, all of that said, the idea is for it to be a safe event.

1277
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But there are many ways that this can and has gone awry for which now I will throw to

1278
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
what I thought maybe you had loaded up.

1279
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah.

1280
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Have you?

1281
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Did you relearn about this or react?

1282
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I did.

1283
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I was just trying to remember if it was, in fact, you or your mom, correct?

1284
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah.

1285
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:36,000
My stepmom, Rose, went to high school in San Diego, and they had grad night at Disneyland.

1286
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And she was class of 80.

1287
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And I'm looking at the lineup here.

1288
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And she's told me before.

1289
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But yeah, Casey and the Sunshine Band, it says Cool and the Gang, Robert John Tantrum,

1290
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
the Carr Brothers.

1291
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
For some reason, I thought maybe Shalimar was there, but I could be misremembering.

1292
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
This is a good lineup.

1293
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
This is good vibes, right?

1294
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Did all of grad night go as well as the grad night?

1295
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I feel like Celebration came out in the 80s.

1296
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So you're seeing some Pete Cool and the Gangs.

1297
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Wow.

1298
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
The idea, this is a running thing, I think, that anything where Disney tries to address

1299
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
current pop culture, they're always seven years late.

1300
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So the fact if we're getting Celebration the year of, if we're getting Drive Me Crazy

1301
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
the year of, that's kind of insane.

1302
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I believe Backstreet Boys in 97.

1303
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Yes.

1304
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Along with As Yet.

1305
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
As Yet coming off their hit cover of Hard to Say I'm Sorry by Chicago.

1306
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And I see on this other list of 97, I see also Goo Goo Dolls and Aaliyah.

1307
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Wow.

1308
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
That's a good one.

1309
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Wow.

1310
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
97 slide era.

1311
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Izzy up the girl.

1312
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I just woke up.

1313
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
All these other garbage you guys are talking about.

1314
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
They're zapping on about Zap.

1315
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
They're zapping on and zapping on.

1316
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
We've got Art LeBeau here or something like that.

1317
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But then, by the way, look, I don't mean to, I shouldn't come back and immediately give

1318
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
shit, although it's a little bit of what I do.

1319
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Jason, I'm so disappointed that Black Balloon was on your Spotify wrapped.

1320
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
That is so funny.

1321
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
That's insane.

1322
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Number four?

1323
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
That's insane.

1324
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I don't know how that happened.

1325
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Well, number five.

1326
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Wait, wait a minute.

1327
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Actually, you may have heard this on the show already or not.

1328
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Kyle, do you know the song Black Balloon by the Goo Goo Dolls?

1329
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I don't.

1330
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah.

1331
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Well, but you heard it.

1332
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It's a great comeback for Scott.

1333
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah.

1334
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
All right.

1335
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Well, now play it or whatever or sing it.

1336
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
What do you have to do to...

1337
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I can't sing it well.

1338
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
It's not...

1339
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I can sing it well.

1340
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Coming down to the forest of love.

1341
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That's pretty good.

1342
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah.

1343
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I hear that song.

1344
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Okay.

1345
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Let's hear it.

1346
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Because that sounds...

1347
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Now it sounds...

1348
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
That also sounds like a 90s rock song.

1349
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
It sounds like everything.

1350
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah.

1351
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
The rhythm is familiar.

1352
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
If you could only see the...

1353
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
See, I got pipes too.

1354
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I can do...

1355
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I could maybe take a little 90s band show on the road.

1356
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
We're going to sit here and listen.

1357
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
We're just far away from the microphone.

1358
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
It's just copyright strikes left and right.

1359
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah, I don't want to get sued by John Resnick.

1360
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I want him to like me.

1361
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You would never.

1362
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
We're the only podcast that compliments his music.

1363
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I don't even really like this song that much.

1364
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
After all this.

1365
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You're just indignant that people don't know it.

1366
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm a slide guy.

1367
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I'm a slide guy.

1368
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I'm a Broadway guy.

1369
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I'm not necessarily a black balloon guy.

1370
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
You're not a black balloon guy, and yet you're still making us hear it.

1371
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You're making Kyle hear it.

1372
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Well, you asked him if he heard it.

1373
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
What is it?

1374
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Can he hear it?

1375
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Is there a hook?

1376
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Oh, wait.

1377
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
He can play the chorus, but the answer is that no, there isn't a hook.

1378
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I'm sure I heard it in the era, but it's not...

1379
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Kyle, I'm loving this answer.

1380
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
We've been fighting for a year about it.

1381
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
A lot of people are on my side, though.

1382
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It's not like I'm completely...

1383
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm not taking a side.

1384
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I'm just telling you how...

1385
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
That's what I'm saying, Kyle.

1386
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Your radio station must have been weird when you were growing up.

1387
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I can only live my truth, and my truth is I don't know the song.

1388
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I can't know the song.

1389
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Jason's listening to it so much in this year of Our Lord 2024.

1390
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Espresso number one, black balloon number four.

1391
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That's an insane list.

1392
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It was really insane.

1393
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I think what happened was I kept forgetting how it went, and Mike kept bringing it up,

1394
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
so every time he would bring it up...

1395
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
What did I bring up?

1396
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Three times?

1397
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Well, yeah, I would listen to it.

1398
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I'd go like, oh, yeah, this played on the top 40 station into the 2000s out of Delaware.

1399
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Jason's Spotify raps might be three listens each because he listens to most of his music on a Victrola.

1400
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
He's got to crank that thing.

1401
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I know.

1402
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
His Victrola rap would be a whole different list.

1403
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Glenn Miller again.

1404
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Sitting on the dock of the bay was number five because I dozed off listening to it, I think is what happened,

1405
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and it was still on repeat from when I really had the song Wichita Lineman, one of my favorite songs.

1406
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I love Wichita Lineman, too.

1407
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I had that stuck in my head, so I had that on repeat,

1408
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,000
and whenever I jumped or I turned it off and turned it back, I don't know.

1409
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You were just looping sitting on the dock of the bay?

1410
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I still had it configured.

1411
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
What kind of serial killer shit is that?

1412
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
It wasn't intentional.

1413
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Somebody who's waiting for somebody to come back into the bay, you want to shoot in the head.

1414
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I think I was listening to the album.

1415
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Baby's Black Balloon makes her fly.

1416
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Since we're talking about Mike, I have kind of a hip lineup from Disney World in 2011.

1417
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Wait a minute, let's close the loop on the tragedy, and then we can swing into the happy.

1418
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

1419
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yes, wait your step, Mom.

1420
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Well, essentially, high school senior passed away.

1421
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
My understanding, and you can read up on it if you look up Grad Night 80,

1422
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:08,000
he was in one of the cars in the People Mover, and I believe he tried to walk into the car in front of him

1423
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
and then got run over by the car he was actually just in.

1424
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
He got caught up on the tracks, essentially.

1425
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:25,000
The way my stepmom describes it is they took buses back down to San Diego that night,

1426
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
and none of the parents knew the name of the kid who passed,

1427
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:38,000
and so everybody was just incredibly fearful as to who was this child.

1428
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
So yeah, pretty dark.

1429
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
That's insane.

1430
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But they knew that something had happened, but just nobody knew.

1431
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I think they knew that there was a death, I think.

1432
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Jesus.

1433
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,000
That's so crazy your stepmom was in that class, but it is a weird thing about it.

1434
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We don't talk about these Disneyland deaths a ton, but how many are there?

1435
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
There are like 10 to 14, is it in that range?

1436
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I don't know the number, but two of them are Grad Night.

1437
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
One of them is that, and one of them is a monorail.

1438
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Somebody trying to sneak in who was struck by the monorail.

1439
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It's often these more benign rides that have done the killing.

1440
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Insane. That's crazy.

1441
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So are you against the event for that reason?

1442
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Are you here to say they should end the event because of the capacity for danger?

1443
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Grads are calmer now, though, maybe in the year 2024.

1444
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I feel for this person's family, obviously.

1445
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Sure.

1446
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:50,000
At the same time, maybe it's not the safest thing to get out of a moving vehicle.

1447
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah.

1448
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
But it's very tragic.

1449
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:03,000
But I also say that my stepmom, she still likes school and the gang, so it hasn't fully...

1450
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
That's what he was getting at.

1451
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Yeah, he was getting at the cool and the gang question.

1452
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,000
It came on at your wedding and she did not storm out of the room or drop to her knees crying.

1453
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
No, no, I mean, accidents happen, right?

1454
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Yeah.

1455
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Unfortunately.

1456
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's a funny thing throughout this that people have still found a way to, despite aiming to be a super safe event,

1457
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
there's still a lot of weird bullshit that's happened.

1458
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I have a book called More Mouse Tales by David Koenig.

1459
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
It's a lot of weird Disneyland stories.

1460
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And they describe a story in the mid-90s that what's described as a very brawny high school football star showed up on acid

1461
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and was just freaking the hell out.

1462
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And it took 16 security officers to bring him to the ground.

1463
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And apparently what came out of that is that now, that or any future Grad Knights, the Disneyland security is allowed to use handcuffs.

1464
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh, wow.

1465
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Hooray!

1466
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Thanks to one enterprising football star.

1467
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Are they themed handcuffs?

1468
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
That's a good question.

1469
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I think you could easily put a Mickey Mouse on them.

1470
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You could like...

1471
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Yeah, on each cuff with the ear.

1472
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
The ears are in each cuff.

1473
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's nice.

1474
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
That would be nice.

1475
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
So at least you're still in the spirit, even though you're stuck in Disney jail and coming down from acid.

1476
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,000
They've described people trying to swim in the rivers of America and all this stuff.

1477
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
People still find ways to freak out.

1478
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I mean, you're what, 17, 18?

1479
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You're going to be causing trouble.

1480
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
If you don't have the respect for the sacred ground that is Disneyland, you're going to be causing trouble.

1481
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Well, this is my...

1482
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Oh, sorry.

1483
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I was going to say, it's like when I went to Hershey Park with the middle school courts.

1484
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I see these people every day.

1485
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I'm not going to be at Hershey Park for a while.

1486
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I want to enjoy Hershey Park.

1487
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I'm picking the super duper looper over you all.

1488
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Sorry.

1489
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
You're going to treat it with respect.

1490
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Yeah, I'm going to treat it with respect.

1491
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
You're not going to drink on anything?

1492
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That is how I felt.

1493
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And that is the story of my 2003.

1494
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
The only strong memory I have of the 2003 one was that...

1495
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I probably said this on the show long ago.

1496
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:25,000
But what I remember is that there was a group of girls, the girls in the Venn diagram,

1497
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
they were the coolest girls who were willing to talk to me ever.

1498
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And so I was always like...

1499
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And the kind of girls who were throughout high school was always varying degrees of crushes.

1500
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
But then I was always like, why didn't it happen for me with any of them?

1501
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And then now I know the answer, which is that at grad night,

1502
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:56,000
at some point they lifted their shirts to show that they had taped various drugs and pharmaceuticals to their person.

1503
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And even though I'm a high school senior at this point,

1504
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:06,000
that was the year that I started drinking and I started very performatively pretending that I liked smoking pot.

1505
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
So I'm like past...

1506
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I'm starting to drink, I'm starting to do drugs,

1507
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
but I still fucking square me at 17 is still like...

1508
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Disneyland though?

1509
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
How do you know?

1510
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Disneyland gives you a high in and of itself.

1511
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Why would you need that?

1512
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
So then were you no longer crushing on them?

1513
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It's not that I was no...

1514
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
For me, it just answered the question of like...

1515
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I was like, how come it never worked out for me?

1516
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
And I was like, the reason it never worked out is because I am so fucking uptight.

1517
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I'm such a goddamn square.

1518
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Even though I drink and kind of do drugs,

1519
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,000
the idea of having drugs in Disneyland at that point made me like hot in the face.

1520
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And I just walked away like, well, I don't know about that.

1521
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
There's fun, but then there's a little bit too fun.

1522
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I'm just like, why could I not have mellowed out at that time?

1523
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Why did I need to...

1524
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Why was I wound that tight as a 17-year-old?

1525
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
This is the closest I've ever felt to you.

1526
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Because the perspective of my 30s was like,

1527
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
oh, why didn't we ever...

1528
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Why did it never work out?

1529
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,000
It's like, oh, I was neurotic and annoying and square and mouthy.

1530
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Mouthy?

1531
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I mean, everyone back where I grew up was very mouthy.

1532
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
So that actually probably should have been a bonding thing.

1533
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Yeah.

1534
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I'm with you.

1535
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Well, let's listen to Wichita Lineman and kind of think about regrets.

1536
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
And we'll have a moment on this later.

1537
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I listen to it.

1538
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I think about Glen Campbell wandering through the tall grass under the monorail track.

1539
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Oh, that's right.

1540
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Disney World opening.

1541
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Disney World opening.

1542
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I don't know that he's singing that.

1543
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I wanted to compare that experience, though, to you, Kyle,

1544
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
who my sense is that you were not me at that time.

1545
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You were not an uptight square like Skycare Nerd 17.

1546
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Had you done one of these, what do you do?

1547
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Are you taping drugs to your chest?

1548
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Are you trying to sneak in a vodka in the water bottle as portrayed in Y2K?

1549
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Or is that just a work of fiction?

1550
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:16,000
There was a sort of Christian group that threw dances,

1551
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I think, starting around my sophomore year of high school.

1552
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And it was a way to meet kids from other schools.

1553
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
But there was also a sort of religious underlying component.

1554
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And to one of those dances, I remember getting drunk before.

1555
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I don't need to say the F word.

1556
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
That's actually not cool.

1557
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
You're a square now, now that you're a daddy.

1558
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
But I got caught by the main guy, and I got kicked out.

1559
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Do you remember the name of the organization?

1560
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Was it some teen term?

1561
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I do. I feel bad throwing them under the bus.

1562
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:09,000
So I had to leave the venue, and I went in my friend's car,

1563
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
and I just started crying because I was like,

1564
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I can't believe I got kicked out.

1565
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
And then I think some other people found out that I was crying,

1566
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
and they started kind of clowning on me.

1567
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:25,000
So is that the bit that you were kind of further along

1568
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
in terms of comfort with that kind of thing, with getting F'd up?

1569
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
But your thing was hiding the sensitive side and hiding the anxiety.

1570
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure that I'm answering this fully accurately,

1571
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
but I will say that I think that was a moment where I tried something like that,

1572
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and I tried to be a bad boy, and I knew I was actively breaking the rules.

1573
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And if, for instance, that occurred prior to me going to Disneyland Grand Night,

1574
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I would avoid it.

1575
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I would be nervous to do something sketchy like that,

1576
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
because if you are caught, you're fucked.

1577
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
You can't hang out for the rest of the night.

1578
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I read a story in that book also about somebody who came into the park

1579
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
with a big film canister, like what should I hold?

1580
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
35-millimeter film for photos.

1581
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
But there was a couple, and neither of them had a camera.

1582
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So security's like, what's up with that?

1583
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
They open it up full of something or other,

1584
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
and then they have to sit on the bus the whole night.

1585
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
That would not be... You might want to forego...

1586
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Hey, if you're graduating high school soon and you listen to Podcast the Ride,

1587
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
first of all, I'm sorry for wherever you're at socially,

1588
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
but secondly, you might want to be careful anyway,

1589
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
or try to pregame it, because that would be the nightmare.

1590
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Sure, succeeding and then you're having fun,

1591
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
you're effed up at Disneyland,

1592
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
but then, yeah, the sitting on the bus is so not worth the...

1593
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
That's dark.

1594
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Especially, I didn't realize schools in San Diego are going,

1595
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I watched some vlogs on YouTube of people who were college freshmen

1596
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
now went this year, when they graduated,

1597
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
spring to crab night, and they're like,

1598
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:23,000
we have to get to the high school to park at 5 a.m.

1599
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and then we will not be back until 4.30 the next morning.

1600
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Oh, yeah, right.

1601
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Because it's a two-hour each way, and it's like, good lord.

1602
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I think groups come in from Sacramento and stuff.

1603
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
There's versions of this where you leave on a bus in the morning,

1604
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
stay on the bus, go all night to Disneyland,

1605
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and then come right back, and there's no overnight sleep anywhere.

1606
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
That's intense.

1607
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I had heard various stories about Naughty Naughty at crab night.

1608
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
A past guest of this show has told us stories

1609
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
about sneaking cigarettes into tampon wrappers.

1610
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Is it Marissa Strickland?

1611
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yeah, that's why I brought it up.

1612
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
That was probably one of the first 10 episodes.

1613
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Cigarettes, that's kind of...

1614
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Because they would have been 18.

1615
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And a clever way to do it, too.

1616
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Yeah, no one's looking in there.

1617
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
But the better story, the even better story,

1618
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I had heard someone who went in the 70s,

1619
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
this woman and her friend went with some guys,

1620
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
and pretty quickly they ditched the guys

1621
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
and just shared a joint on the sky buckets,

1622
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
just shared a joint on the skyway.

1623
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
That's not bad.

1624
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Now, it's a different substance,

1625
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,000
but it's very much like former president Barack Obama,

1626
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
also smoking on the skyway, getting kicked out.

1627
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
That was just cigarettes.

1628
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Did you know that Obama got kicked out of Disneyland for smoking?

1629
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I did not know that.

1630
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
When he was in college, yes, cigarettes,

1631
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
when he was at Occidental College,

1632
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
and he said security was very nice,

1633
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
and they said, you're welcome back any time,

1634
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
but you have to leave now.

1635
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I showed you a picture of my lanyard

1636
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
from when I worked at Disneyland.

1637
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah.

1638
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
You brought this up on the show before, right?

1639
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Your brief spell working at Disneyland.

1640
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I was there for, yeah.

1641
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I never even made it to my first day of work.

1642
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
You didn't do one shift.

1643
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I was so afraid of the popcorn machine.

1644
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Is that what you were assigned to, popcorn cart?

1645
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
It was general vendor, so you didn't know.

1646
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
You could get the churro, you could get the popcorn,

1647
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
you could get glow toys,

1648
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
but the guy went through the popcorn stuff so fast.

1649
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I'm like, I don't remember what he fucking said.

1650
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I was nervous that I was going to have to go up there,

1651
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
and I was going to burn myself.

1652
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Yeah, I get it.

1653
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I'd be scared of that today.

1654
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
That's too real of a piece of machinery.

1655
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I'm scared of, I don't have a popcorn machine in my house.

1656
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
That burn, getting the oil going, that's scary.

1657
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
No, thank you.

1658
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Yeah, yeah, the kind of things my parents used.

1659
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I heard all Jason's food service stories,

1660
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
and it put me off of it forever.

1661
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Jason spilling sauce.

1662
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Spilling sauce, stabbing myself.

1663
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
A scar I still have with a prime rib and a roast beef.

1664
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Where's your roast beef scar?

1665
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It's right here, because I was slicing.

1666
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
We've seen it, but Kyle hasn't gotten to see the roast beef scar.

1667
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Show Kyle your roast beef scar.

1668
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Hard to see.

1669
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Maybe it heals.

1670
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
We're under theatrical lights.

1671
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I think it's right there.

1672
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
There's a little white mark right there on my left hand.

1673
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I said Kyle seems unimpressed.

1674
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1675
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I'm speaking for you.

1676
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Because you've got to wear a chainmail glove,

1677
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
but it was right underneath where the glove stopped.

1678
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Jason, I'm not playing right now.

1679
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
That is the best roast beef scar I've ever seen in my life.

1680
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Truly, I'm like, damn, that really was roast beef.

1681
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
They had to throw out the whole round the roast beef.

1682
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
They had a lot more, thankfully.

1683
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Because all Jason's blood was all over it.

1684
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I was.

1685
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
They had to scrub down the whole station.

1686
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
You were wearing the Falconer's gloves still, too?

1687
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I was wearing, it was right underneath where the glove stopped.

1688
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
That was another thing where they're like,

1689
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
you're going to work this station.

1690
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Here's how you do it.

1691
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
See ya.

1692
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Scary.

1693
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Yeah.

1694
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
That is scary.

1695
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I'm talking about playing with danger a little bit, though,

1696
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
because I thought there might be a good little thought exercise to do.

1697
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Because here's another way that people have managed to get fucked up at,

1698
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I'm sorry I said it.

1699
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I know.

1700
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I started something.

1701
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I know.

1702
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
That's on me.

1703
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I make my own choices.

1704
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
My parents, yeah.

1705
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Barack Obama's choom gang.

1706
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
What?

1707
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Remember the choom gang?

1708
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
That was his crew he ran with in Hawaii.

1709
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I've never heard that in my life.

1710
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
This is wild.

1711
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I'm back to the obscure Jason references.

1712
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It was just a joke they would call,

1713
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
there was just these buddies I think in Hawaii.

1714
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
What's that word?

1715
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I don't know.

1716
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
But Fox News jumped on it and were like,

1717
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Choom gang?

1718
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Obama's new choom gang are at it in Washington.

1719
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
We were just off mic saying we've got to wrap this up soon.

1720
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Yeah, I know.

1721
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
We can't get into choom gang right now.

1722
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Choom is slang for smoking marijuana.

1723
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I looked it up.

1724
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
So we are not your choom gang, Scott and I.

1725
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
No, no, no.

1726
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
No mistake.

1727
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I like that song, but I'm not in your choom gang.

1728
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
What I was going to say is,

1729
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
another thing that people tried to do,

1730
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
and probably unsuccessfully,

1731
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
was kind of do a little buried treasure with booze

1732
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
during the day you or somebody you know and trust

1733
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
goes to Disneyland.

1734
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Berries, beer or liquor or whatever it is,

1735
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
maybe in the rivers of America,

1736
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
you do a little X marks the spot.

1737
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
A day before scenario.

1738
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Or day of potentially.

1739
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
You try to sneak booze in somehow

1740
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
that you can uncover during grad night

1741
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
and now you're set for the evening.

1742
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I'm like, this is a smart group of people.

1743
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
This is a group of people who all like to drink at Disneyland.

1744
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Do we feel like we could figure out a successful way,

1745
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
and also this seems like a mic challenge.

1746
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Do you think we could figure out a successful way

1747
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
if some teens asked you and said,

1748
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
hey, you, are you cool or not?

1749
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And that would light the fire under you, I think,

1750
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
to prove that you are.

1751
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And the way that you could prove that you're cool

1752
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
is to hide booze at Disneyland during the day

1753
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
that they could enjoy a grad night.

1754
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Do we think we could figure out a way to do it?

1755
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Yes, I would be conflicted

1756
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
because I'd want to prove to them I was cool

1757
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
because it's an eternal problem, I feel, in security.

1758
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
But yes, I would also be a little worried

1759
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
that I would get in trouble.

1760
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
But yes, easily we could figure out where to do it.

1761
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I immediately think of somewhere in Grizzly Peak.

1762
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
It's a little quiet back there.

1763
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It's a little quiet.

1764
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Grizzly Challenge Trail.

1765
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Yes.

1766
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Something over there.

1767
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
That might not be open for kids.

1768
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
That might be a kids area that is not really open for.

1769
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Yeah, but then sometimes they can theme it

1770
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
for like Halloween party.

1771
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I don't know.

1772
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
If it's not open, then I can pivot here.

1773
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
California Adventure is a lot of pavement,

1774
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
a lot of open space that doesn't feel like.

1775
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Yeah, I think you could go digging around there.

1776
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
You'd like find a kind of an obscure spot in a planter.

1777
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
You have to do it in a way where like,

1778
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
you got to count rocks, right?

1779
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Like start the bend because we're not going to mark it

1780
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
because that'll draw attention to it.

1781
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But maybe it's like, all right,

1782
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
so it's the 42nd rock as you head up east on the trail.

1783
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Has Toontown open in this scenario?

1784
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I know that Toontown at least was,

1785
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
it was open for Erin's grad night.

1786
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
She remembers getting to go on Gadget's Go Coaster

1787
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
three times in a row.

1788
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
So that was a fond memory.

1789
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Nice.

1790
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
So I think it might be.

1791
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Yeah.

1792
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I think Toontown is,

1793
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I think somewhere in Toontown is the place.

1794
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Yeah, sure.

1795
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Honestly.

1796
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Any thoughts in the new,

1797
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
does the new grass scenario change things?

1798
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Again, in the back of it,

1799
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
there's a little cave area and it's a very nice place.

1800
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Now a lot of people go there

1801
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
and there's a little bunch of rocks.

1802
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And I bet you could even put like a bag that looks like,

1803
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
cause people are always back there.

1804
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So we just have a bag sitting by benches.

1805
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It's always going to seem like somebody there's bag.

1806
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And maybe, or you could also like, maybe if,

1807
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
if like we're talking bottles of beer or vodka or tequila,

1808
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
put a little funny cartoony label on it,

1809
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
like three X's or something like that.

1810
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Oh yeah, like Moonshine.

1811
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
And now it's just part of.

1812
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Oh, now you think it's like,

1813
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
it's a prop at Goofy's gas station or whatever.

1814
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Go to Mickey's kitchen.

1815
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
On your way to Mickey's house,

1816
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
get a cartoon jug of Moonshine

1817
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and put it on his kitchen table.

1818
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Oh my God.

1819
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Yeah, that's really good.

1820
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Oh, Kyle's got it.

1821
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I think, yeah.

1822
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
You just say it just has to be like bulbous enough

1823
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and you gotta like be careful with the writing.

1824
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
You can't just take a Sharpie.

1825
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
You gotta get your friend who writes the best.

1826
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I would deploy Erin for this

1827
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
if she wanted to get in on this game.

1828
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Really good penmanship.

1829
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I think she could do like perfect cartoony triple X

1830
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
on something.

1831
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Yeah, that'd be good.

1832
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It has to have like some bulge to it.

1833
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
You put that in, oh my God.

1834
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And then it's hiding in plain sight.

1835
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
That's what you gotta do is hide it.

1836
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Yeah, you'd have to put it up maybe elevated

1837
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
so kids wouldn't grab,

1838
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
like maybe on top of the fridge or something.

1839
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
There would be a place somewhere in the back

1840
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
that you could probably put it in part of his house.

1841
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
There's no way whoever is kind of in charge day to day

1842
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
of Mickey's kitchen.

1843
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Right.

1844
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
There's no way that person knows what all the stuff is.

1845
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
They don't pay that much attention.

1846
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Yeah, I don't think so.

1847
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I bet you'd be fine.

1848
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
That's it.

1849
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
That's it.

1850
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
We got it.

1851
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And then what are you putting in there?

1852
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
If you're trying to make...

1853
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Piss.

1854
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Imagine that...

1855
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Piss.

1856
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Oh man, and then after all that...

1857
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Bite.

1858
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Piss.

1859
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Oh, okay.

1860
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
That's good.

1861
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
That's a mixed bag.

1862
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
It's a bit of a punishment,

1863
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
but how bad do you want to get fucked up?

1864
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Let's see.

1865
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,000
If it was 2003 and I was 18...

1866
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Yeah, what are you drinking then?

1867
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I think we were...

1868
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Well, we were into screwdrivers, vodka and orange juice.

1869
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Right.

1870
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Nice.

1871
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
So if we have access to sodas,

1872
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I would say just make it a liquor

1873
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
and then we can maybe do a little mix and match.

1874
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Yeah.

1875
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Yeah.

1876
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
That sounds great.

1877
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That makes sense.

1878
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I would love to...

1879
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I'd love right now to go split a cartoon jug

1880
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
of screwdrivers with y'all at Disney.

1881
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
That'd be great.

1882
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
That'd be great.

1883
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
That's the next thing we got.

1884
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Last time was...

1885
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Buffalo Wild Wings,

1886
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
you had big revelations last time.

1887
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
What's going to occur to you

1888
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
over a big jug of screwdrivers in 2024?

1889
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Well, you know what?

1890
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
When we started I said we could get a drink out of this

1891
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
and you guys said you have somewhere to go.

1892
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
That is...

1893
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Wait, has the episode come...

1894
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Okay, here's what I'll say.

1895
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
The episode...

1896
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Yeah, that is lame.

1897
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
You've proposed getting a drink

1898
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
and we can't because we have to go do something

1899
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
that there's going to be an episode about.

1900
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I think the next second gate that comes out.

1901
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
So when you see the title of the next second gate,

1902
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
know that it's what prevented us

1903
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
from grabbing a drink with Kyle

1904
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
and you will be disappointed for us

1905
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
that we had to choose this

1906
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
because we're already in the tank.

1907
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It's something we bought tickets for.

1908
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Oh, it's...

1909
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Oh, my God.

1910
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
What are we doing?

1911
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
We can put something on the books.

1912
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Yeah.

1913
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Let's do it in the future.

1914
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Yeah, yeah.

1915
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I mean, how do you make it helpful

1916
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
to what you guys... your art?

1917
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Oh, the hangout.

1918
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
It doesn't have to be.

1919
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
You mean using it for content.

1920
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Anything can be content, I think.

1921
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Anything can be content.

1922
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
There's a bunch of new garbage at CityWalk.

1923
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Let's just go up there.

1924
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Or we could go to a place for grownups.

1925
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I don't know.

1926
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Yeah, but the Hello Kitty Cafe looks very cute.

1927
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
A lot of things changing up there.

1928
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
You want to get fucked up with us at the Hello Kitty Cafe, Kyle?

1929
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Yeah.

1930
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Do they have booze?

1931
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
No.

1932
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
No, they have sugar.

1933
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
But if we bring in our own...

1934
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Yeah, a little cartoon jug of screwdrivers.

1935
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I mean...

1936
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And Hello Kitty is not a cat.

1937
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
No, she's a little English child in a costume.

1938
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Right?

1939
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
That's the canon of it.

1940
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I heard a girl.

1941
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
That's the canon of it.

1942
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
That's the canon.

1943
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

1944
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Okay, that felt like...

1945
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
All right, that was probably a good end,

1946
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
but we probably have a couple more...

1947
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
All right, what were you going to say?

1948
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Well, I was going to say my solution for the booze,

1949
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
which I'd be too scared to do,

1950
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
because nowadays it's immediately a suspicious object.

1951
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
It's a suspicious object.

1952
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
They just call it the bomb squad or counterterrorism.

1953
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
But the planters scattered throughout Tomorrowland,

1954
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
you could probably cover some airplane-sized bottles of liquor.

1955
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Oh, yeah.

1956
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Like some nips.

1957
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I've heard them called nips.

1958
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Nips, yeah.

1959
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
You could probably put soil or mulch over that.

1960
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Yeah, that's true.

1961
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Those little guys, for sure.

1962
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And just say, like, okay, go over, sit on the ledge.

1963
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I don't think it's a spoiler.

1964
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Reach your hand back.

1965
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
If listeners or anyone ever gets to see the project

1966
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
that I was just out directing, nips is a giant component.

1967
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Is that right?

1968
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I had no idea.

1969
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Nips is a major element of what I was just doing.

1970
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Well, we had a conversation about nips when I was here.

1971
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Did we?

1972
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
We all talked about it.

1973
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
And you said the word nips?

1974
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Yeah, because I had a bottle with me.

1975
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And I was like, you want to take a nip?

1976
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Oh, that's right.

1977
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Here I am acting like I'd never heard the term nips.

1978
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Nips was on that episode?

1979
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
That's crazy.

1980
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
You're probably right.

1981
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
You showed up with, like, one third bottle full of rye whiskey.

1982
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
We're not going to talk about that.

1983
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
That was before the mirror.

1984
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
That was a different Kyle.

1985
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
What were we going to say about bands, lineups?

1986
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
We got to wrap it up.

1987
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Is it quick, Jason?

1988
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It's very quick.

1989
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I thought you would appreciate it.

1990
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
This is the Disney World lineup.

1991
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
The last full year at the Magic Kingdom, you have Ryan Starr.

1992
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I don't know who that is.

1993
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
American Idol person?

1994
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
American Idol person?

1995
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Yeah, maybe.

1996
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:58,000
The band called, I don't know how to pronounce this, 30H!

1997
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Oh, 303.

1998
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
303.

1999
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
They did a song with Kesha.

2000
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
They did a song with Kesha.

2001
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

2002
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
My first kiss.

2003
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Tayo Cruz?

2004
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Tayo Cruz?

2005
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Yeah.

2006
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Yeah.

2007
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And then Pete Wentz.

2008
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Solo Pete Wentz.

2009
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Solo Pete Wentz.

2010
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
You said this was for me because he's from...

2011
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Because it's all very hip.

2012
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I feel like this is hip music.

2013
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
He's from the town over where I grew up.

2014
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Yeah, that's right.

2015
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Yes, we played the same shitty...

2016
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
My band, not the same show as him, but the same shitty place.

2017
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
The band?

2018
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Wait, what's the name of your band again?

2019
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Second Level.

2020
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Second Level played...

2021
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Second Level played Back to the Office, which is a place that Fall Out Boy would play as

2022
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
well.

2023
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Wow.

2024
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And when I told Pete Wentz this one time, he could have cared less.

2025
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
You had a moment to tell that to Pete Wentz and it didn't resonate at all?

2026
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
He wasn't mean or anything.

2027
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
What's that?

2028
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
When did you meet Pete Wentz?

2029
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I did a live read of some old movie at UCB Sunset, and Pete Wentz was involved in it

2030
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
as well.

2031
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And he wasn't rude, by the way.

2032
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
He was perfectly fine.

2033
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Oh, okay.

2034
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I mean, I'm sure Pete...

2035
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Was it something random, like snakes on a plane?

2036
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It was something random.

2037
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Okay.

2038
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It was not snakes on a plane.

2039
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Did you go up to him and go like, hey, you know, Fall Out Boy is actually from The Sims?

2040
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Did you know that?

2041
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Did I tell him that the reference he was making for his band was...

2042
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
He might not know.

2043
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I think he knows.

2044
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,000
It's actually not a catch.

2045
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And my thing on the way out the door, in the lineup thing, the best one, for me, the one

2046
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I'm chasing a thousand percent, 1984, Daz Band, Matthew Wilder, Nobody Gonna Break

2047
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Up My Stride, who did the songs from Mulan later, Weird Al, apparently, some nights on

2048
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
one particular night.

2049
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Cheap Trick.

2050
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Cheap Trick.

2051
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Good era for Cheap Trick, too, coming off a Todd Runger produced album.

2052
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And Every Night, 84, Sparks.

2053
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
That is the grand night of my dreams.

2054
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Can you imagine?

2055
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I'm looking at a schedule that's like...

2056
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
They trade on and off.

2057
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,000
They're at the space stage where Halyx played before, alternating.

2058
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And at 4 a.m., Sparks, and at 2.45 a.m., Cheap Trick.

2059
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Jesus Christ.

2060
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I want to be at that so bad.

2061
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And Daz Band was there, too?

2062
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And Daz Band, I think, would play where Fantasmic is now.

2063
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
They would play across the river.

2064
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Oh, wow, yeah.

2065
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
That is the lineup.

2066
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I want to be there sharing a jug with you guys so bad.

2067
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Well, let it whip now.

2068
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Yeah.

2069
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I feel like I'm sorry about the copyright stuff.

2070
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
No, that's fine.

2071
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It's a short window.

2072
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
We cannot give you a new thing to be regretting.

2073
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
That can't happen every time.

2074
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
We need to be regret-free after this episode.

2075
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
That's not fair.

2076
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I definitely got regret.

2077
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Well, then you know what?

2078
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Let's see you out with a hero's exit.

2079
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
And hopefully as much of a regret-free exit as we can do.

2080
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And I'm so happy to say, Kyle Mooney, you survived podcast The Ride.

2081
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2082
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Because I know you got something to plug.

2083
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
You got a fucking movie out right now.

2084
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
It's a great movie.

2085
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I'll say it before you say anything about it.

2086
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
If you're not sick of talking about it, do you want to say something about Y2K?

2087
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Y2K, yeah.

2088
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It's about two high schoolers who go to a party.

2089
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
And at midnight, Y2K actually happens.

2090
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
And for those of us, all of us were alive when Y2K happened.

2091
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It was pretty much a major letdown, so to speak.

2092
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And this movie sort of rewrites that history.

2093
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And I would say there are some laughs, hopefully.

2094
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
And there are some scares.

2095
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I was going to say those things and put the word hard in front of both.

2096
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Hard laughs, hard scares, good kills, not to spoil anything.

2097
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
It goes hard.

2098
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Maybe it pulls your heartstrings at moments.

2099
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
It 1,000% does.

2100
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
It's so great.

2101
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I've seen this movie.

2102
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Thanks, buddy.

2103
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Scott helped me out.

2104
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
He gave me some great notes early in the process.

2105
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And yeah, we're really proud of it.

2106
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
So if you can, depending on when you're listening to this, go check it out.

2107
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Yes, in theaters.

2108
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
We're seeing it in theaters because the turns.

2109
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I'm happy I got to experience these things in front of an audience,

2110
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
because there's huge, great, funny, exciting stuff that happens.

2111
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It turned out so great.

2112
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Hope you're super proud, as you should be.

2113
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
And the episode, equally proud.

2114
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
How are you feeling at this point?

2115
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
It got dark there for a second.

2116
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,000
And I don't know how people feel about it, but that's truth.

2117
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's life.

2118
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Yeah.

2119
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
We dealt with it in an OK way, right?

2120
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I think so.

2121
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I think it was respectful, acknowledged.

2122
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
You said good things about the family.

2123
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I think all bases covered.

2124
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I think everything was good.

2125
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Yeah, I think everything was very good.

2126
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I'm feeling great.

2127
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I think we could maybe punch up the Hello Kitty restaurant place

2128
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
and maybe go somewhere else.

2129
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Yeah, I think it's probably another option.

2130
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I'm not married to it.

2131
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
But do you want it to be the kind of stupid shit we do,

2132
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
or should we all go to a bar for adults?

2133
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Let's text about it.

2134
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Let's figure this out.

2135
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
OK, great.

2136
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
We will solve this.

2137
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
As for us, three bonus episodes every month at Podcast the Ride,

2138
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
the second gate.

2139
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
One more bonus episode on our VIP tier, Club 3.

2140
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
You'll find all of that at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2141
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
One more main feed next week.

2142
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I'll kind of talk about some more stuff and what I was doing while I was gone.

2143
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And really quick, Y2K thing on the way out the door.

2144
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
It's Y2K Eve at Disney World.

2145
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
It's December 31st, 1999.

2146
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
You have a choice of what you could do.

2147
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Everybody vote.

2148
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I was like, I wonder what you could do on Y2K Eve.

2149
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
And the options are pretty good.

2150
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
One is Disney MGM Studios.

2151
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You see Cheap Trick.

2152
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Youngstown, whatever that is.

2153
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
And LFO.

2154
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
The light funky ones themselves.

2155
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Or you go to Pleasure Island.

2156
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Rebranded for that night only, PI 2000.

2157
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
And at Pleasure Island, you see Hootie and the Blowfish.

2158
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
B-52s.

2159
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
And Styx.

2160
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Pick your path.

2161
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Where are we going?

2162
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
It's going to be hard to top Cheap Trick.

2163
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
But the combo of those three.

2164
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
You can watch it on YouTube.

2165
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It's a very good trick.

2166
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
They do Downs.

2167
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
They do a very good version of Downs.

2168
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
The combination of those three and the name PI 2000.

2169
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
That's very strong.

2170
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Yeah, PI 2000 I think wins.

2171
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Yeah, PI 2000.

2172
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Wait, that was the one.

2173
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
That's Hootie B-52 Styx.

2174
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Yeah, that's a cool lineup.

2175
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
That's a good one.

2176
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Another one.

2177
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
God, I want to do all these things.

2178
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
What's that thing that the guys that say in the Facebook group about Pleasure Island?

2179
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
The wistful thing?

2180
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Man, tonight would have been a great night at Pleasure Island.

2181
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
And tonight would have been a great night if we didn't have to go to this dumb thing and we could get Margs with Kyle.

2182
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I know.

2183
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Oh well, we'll figure it out.

2184
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Soon enough.

2185
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Forever.

2186
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Dog.

2187
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
This has been a Forever Dog production.

2188
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Executive produced by Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner, Brett Bohm, Joe Silio, and Alex Ramsey.
