1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil rears its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried doughnut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Beignets.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, With secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Glory's board is my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, he will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of them all.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We have 15 daily very necessary episodes and which to do so. I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic for...

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
...boring.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal. Why do we do this to ourselves?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, Level 2, Stage 1.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Mine, oh shit, it's a Downtown Disney ordeal. I'm sorry, it's fine, I'll keep this in.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My name is Mike Carlson. I forgot what ordeal we were in. We had defeated boss Nick Valenti and I thought it was done, but it's not done.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, yeah, well, we're still recovering from what was a painful battle, but...

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, but we're doing well. We're doing well on this. Jason Sheridan is here.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hi, I'm here.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That was Scott Gardiner.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes, hi. I mean, obviously we're concerned about Eva.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't... I hope that we'll find Eva again and I sense that we will.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I hope.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But this is a... we have not had this where a guest has gone missing during the episode, which is certainly a little alarming and obviously something we hope will not happen to our guests today.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No, I hope she is here and makes it out safely. She is scared. She looks very scared. She might not even know what we're talking about.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is of course, Lindsay Katai. She lives here.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's what I'm known for.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, she is my girlfriend. She is... you know her from the Duffy episode. You know her from the Tokyo episode. You know her from Infinity Train.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now finally it's been on and like every other time we've recorded.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's very exciting. And also my podcast Teen Creeps.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Teen Creeps?

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, of course, Teen Creeps.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Can people know you from weighing in and correcting our dumbasses from the kitchen while we record?

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Perhaps a chuckle in the background as well.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Anything that happened before the year, let's say 1990, we've probably gotten wrong.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Or that isn't in the theme park sphere. Anything that happened in the world.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Edwin has jumped into her lap like a Mr. Bigglesworth, Dr. Evil situation.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm stroking his head with an evil glint in my eye.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll take a photo of it for the listeners.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Today, you know, look, this is the Downtown Disney ordeal.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There we go. That's a good photo.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This is Downtown Disney ordeal. This is very serious. So you're on an episode now with stakes.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I did not know that I was risking life and limb by appearing on the episode.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, you should have told Lindsay that you said Eva Anderson disappeared.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is it like a Twilight Zone stuck in the walls kind of a thing?

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We don't know. We turned to say thanks for being on the show and then she disappeared.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't know where she is.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm a fan of Eva's. This is upsetting.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She's one of our favorite guests and I honestly, I don't know where to find her right now.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, hopefully she turns up somewhere in the ordeal. I don't know. We'll see.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But there's all these basically like, okay, if you remember the last one, the Sector Keeper was our guy.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We were trying to free his spirit. But now there's all this other stuff.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Evil spirits have invaded Downtown Disney and we're trying to, they've taken, Eva must have been taken by the,

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I guess the same people who took the Level Keeper who's the Sector Keeper's cousin.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So there's all this crazy stuff. We lost a battle with Nick, not lost a battle.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We defeated Nick Valente. The evil dark Nick Valente.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But then it took a dark turn.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes. There were miseries.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes. So as far as, yeah. So anyway, I'm sure it'll be fine today. I'm sure you're going to be fine.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We'll see.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The Sector Keeper jewels now. So if you wonder why your living room is like very foggy, it's from his jeweling.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I wasn't going to ask, but thank you for clearing that up.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Also anything we seem foggy about, we're blaming on the jewel vapor.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yep. Yeah.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm going to get a contact jewel high.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's true. Yes.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's true.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The only one you, any of us would get, I would have to think.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Also, he's, he's mostly busy this episode. That's why he's not around, the Sector Keeper.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah. Yeah. Mostly, but he told us we could check in real quick and just get our assignment for today.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So let's do that right now. Oh great Sector Keeper. Where are we going today?

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Boys, boys, today's stage is Pandora Jewelry, Jamba Juice slash Jamba and Sephora. Best of luck, boys.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
All right. So first things first, Pandora.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes. Pandora Jewelry.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Dora specifically.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's good that you have a lady here who wears a lot of Pandora to walk you through this.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You, when you walk in a room, it's like a cat with a bell on.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah. Yeah.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're bangle, you are covered in bangles.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm approaching middle age and so obviously I am a part of this world now.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The second I turned 37, Mike got me a Pandora bracelet. It was my favorite gift. Way better than Duffy.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, poor Duffy.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Adult gifts.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I also though bought.

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But then you bought one for Duffy.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I was going to say I bought Duffy a few different things from Pandora.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's true. And now that has been a point of contention.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Duffy gets one more bangle.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He has a bracelet.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He did. He got an extra bangle and it's been a real problem in the house.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He has so many charms on his little bracelet.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Because he has so many jobs. You need to give him a charm to represent his sailing and his painting and his dancing.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, he does a lot of dancing. So, yes, Pandora.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is a place that I had never been in until we had to be there.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, me too.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Although it had piqued my interest and gotten on my radar before the ordeal because of some ads that were appearing, I believe, mostly on Hulu.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm still paid. I still do the ad version of Hulu and almost every commercial break for a little while.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This will date it back in May with the major relief, the earth shattering release of live action Lion King.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We were all thinking about it, all heavily anticipating it.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There were these ads where it's majestic shots of the jungle, it's vastly superior, many, many hair follicles Simba and non brightly colored Timon and Pumbaa,

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
what we now accept in November here as the ultimate Timon and Pumbaa.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Technically skilled, but not visually striking.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes, you could say that, I guess.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, it's real is what it is. It's a real war dog and real war dogs and lions can't open their mouths at all.

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They have the thinnest mouths. Their jaws are being wired shut.

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So there was this ad where it's so majestic and instrumental, Can You Feel the Love Tonight is playing and then Simba leans over to see his reflection in the waters and there's a ripple.

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then his reflection is replaced by a little jewel.

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
A charm.

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Their official term is charm.

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, because it's a fucking charm bracelet.

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And then the charm keeps going out of the water and envelops the whole screen.

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And then you realize it's all been an ad for Pandora's Lion King collection.

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think I always find reflection stuff really funny.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is a really funny song.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Mulan.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh yes.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's a really funny song for Mulan. I believe for reflection.

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Look at all that water.

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I may have talked about it before, this really funny high school musical song.

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's been the one where they work at a golf resort for summer and Zac Efron doesn't know who he is anymore.

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's called Bed on It and he looks into the reflection and his reflection is way too bright and composed on there and sings back to him.

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And so seeing some reflection hijinks just made me really happy.

128
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I got very like Pandora.

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And I guess I've seen that store at downtown Disney, but it's not like an ad for the radio.

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's not like the...

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, not Pandora, which is now merged with Sirius XM.

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's Sirius XM Pandora.

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I see.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But it's not that.

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It was like the Charm Bracelet Company bought Sirius XM.

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No, that would be very okay.

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I feel like their stock has dropped.

138
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Then they'd have like an Opie and Anthony Charm that you could buy.

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You could buy...

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But the way they render their logos are really similar too.

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So it always confuses me.

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think I must have honestly passed by it at downtown Disney and thought this is like a sign up station for the radio.

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Really?

144
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's very funny.

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That seems like the kind of weird shit that would be...

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There's all this weird Samsung VR demonstrations at the Americana.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That is something like that.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
One of those brick and mortar stores where you can't get anything brick and mortar.

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah.

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's just a weird void space that you enter to learn about.

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The actual void.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
For a minimal...

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That is one of this, I guess, coming up.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's just made me go ever since seeing that ad and now walking into the store.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I still would ask this question, what the fuck is this?

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What is Pandora?

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is the oddest thing to me.

158
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Do they have a Disney princess collection or is that the jewelry store sales?

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
They got all kinds of stuff.

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They have Disney princess collection.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay.

162
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But first off, let's say that Pandora in Greek mythology is the first human woman created by Hephaestus on the instructions of Zeus.

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And she opened a box that unleashed all the evil ones.

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah.

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's a really good namesake to choose.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It makes perfect sense because the same way that you open a box and are delighted by your charm bracelet,

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
much as Pandora opened her box and was delighted by all of the plagues and petions.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Evil is customizable.

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And that's the big selling point, I feel like, at Pandora is that it's customizable.

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So you can like, you may end up with an $800 bracelet, but it's made of like a $100 piece, a $30 piece, a $300.

172
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And it's all sterling silver, sterling silver and 14 karat gold they deal in.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And did they have a Hercules collection when the movie Hercules came out?

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That would be appropriate.

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Disney Association is pretty new.

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Fairly new.

177
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
When the live action Hercules comes out, they will.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There you go.

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah.

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It would be a missed opportunity.

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
To have a James Woods, Hades charm.

184
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
To go with your Opie and Anthony charm.

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And they will keep him the same way they kept James Earl Jones.

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah.

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You can't replace James Woods.

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah.

190
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah.

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So they have, what were you saying?

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They have, it's just gold and silver.

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's great.

194
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There's no bronze.

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
0.925 sterling silver.

196
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There is rose gold.

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And 14 karat gold.

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And then the accents include gemstones, cultured pearls, Murano glass and brilliant cubic zirconia.

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Of course, that is the fake diamond cubic zirconia.

200
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Of course.

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So your Disney spot for cubic zirconia.

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Right.

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And this old charm bracelet thing, I was trying to, have you had a charm, does anyone do this?

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, when I was a fucking child.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't understand why this is being marketed to middle-aged women.

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And these are like 40s old.

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And I mean, at this point, not even middle-aged women.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This has got to be like approaching seniorhood.

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Maybe, yeah.

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm honestly, I'm not exactly sure.

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I mean, these charms are not cheap.

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
They're $40 for a tiny charm.

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And unattractive.

215
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah.

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, I don't know.

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
When I was researching some of that, I don't know if I would say unattractive, but it may be a little bit.

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, maybe they seem very new.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, I want that actually.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That is cool.

221
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That is very cool.

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's what I'm saying.

223
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, my God.

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's what I'm saying.

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Some of them are kind of cool.

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's kind of cool, but it's also a little.

227
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The thing is, it's just a tiny charm jangling with a bunch of other charms.

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes.

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How do you, people don't even really get a good look at it.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No one will ever stare at that on your wrist.

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And if somebody's like, can I look at your wrist for a while?

232
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's weird.

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Like if you make a lot of noise at the bank, maybe someone will ask you about them.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah.

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But traditionally, the way I know it is it's a elementary school boyfriend gift.

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes.

237
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's right.

238
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's good context.

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And then you add charm.

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Is that right?

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You would add things to it.

242
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah.

243
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So it would be like somebody gets you a charm bracelet.

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Maybe they get you three charms, four charms, five charms.

245
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And then you can add to it yourself or you can keep receiving charm gifts.

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Right.

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And it becomes like how your uncle finds out you're into tigers and then he just keeps

248
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
getting you tiger shit.

249
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Forever dressed.

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It was like, oh, I know Bethany has a charm bracelet.

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's just keep giving her charms.

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm a new uncle pretty recently and this is now the thing to avoid.

253
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I should try to learn a second fact about my niece.

254
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
At least two facts and then you're like way ahead of the uncle game.

255
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
One of the best uncles in the top uncle percentile.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Maybe she'll like Disney ticket books, A through E baby.

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The E ticket.

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Oh, it's a very good Disney book.

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Lindsay likes it.

260
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's a real bummer.

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
She's been turned around quickly by this.

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You pees it up hot, you two, because Mike, you were saying on an earlier one, we wish

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
the world at Disney Store had like more specificity in their items for sale for maniacs like us.

264
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's impressive.

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah.

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah.

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So there are, there's a lot of Disney stuff in there and they have like, you know, your

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
standard, like, uh, you're liking characters and they have, uh, I think there's like a,

269
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
maybe a Jiminy Cricket and a Mickey and stuff like a Minnie.

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Um, and I don't know, Scott, if this is what you found or this is what you fascinated you

271
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
the most is that I'm looking through the site and Lindsay can attest to the excitement I

272
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
felt when I found this.

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This is a good find.

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There are Pandora exclusive characters.

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, original characters that are specific to Pandora.

276
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,500
So they own probably the IP.

277
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,000
They're called the Pandora friends.

278
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And there are, I can't believe that they have this.

279
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is, I was so excited about this Pandora friends.

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So this is like, remember when we found, what's that rock and roll, uh, lady's name, the doll,

281
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
like, I forgot her name Harley.

282
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Was it Harley Ray?

283
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It was not.

284
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It was like Bailey Ray.

285
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It was not Harley.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It was not the Hard Rock park.

287
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like Barbie S yeah.

288
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
She was an original IP.

289
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I do remember this.

290
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
She was, we realized her from hard rock.

291
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Right.

292
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I must've been passing through the kitchen when you guys were talking.

293
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I think it's on the episode with Paul shear and the city walk saga is that we were Harper

294
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Ray.

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Uh, which is, uh, yeah.

296
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Anyway.

297
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So a great thing for four adults to do a great thing for many adults.

298
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Uh, so there are characters, uh, in the Pandora friends series, like Pippo, the flying pig,

299
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
uh, and the writeup for Pippo is anything is possible in a world where pigs can fly

300
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and Pippo, the flying pig will surely agree.

301
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
One of the Pandora friends Pippo, the flying pig represents the belief that all you have

302
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
to do is trust in yourself to make your wildest dreams come true.

303
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The charms, adorable design features a pair of small wings and a cute oversized head to

304
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
let everyone know that dreaming big is always an option.

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So there's your Pippo pig.

306
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Does this predate Pippo pig?

307
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Uh, that's a good question.

308
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We need to look into that.

309
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Uh, some other, very cute names.

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Uh, boo.

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The ghost is another character.

312
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Nino, the hedgehog, Dino, the dinosaur, Nino Dino, Reno, the rhinoceros.

313
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And then we get into my favorites, floral, floral Bella bot, who is a robot.

314
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And there she is.

315
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's a Rosie the robot.

316
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
She's good heart beeps.

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Uh, it's a little bit like heartbeat.

318
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Our heart beeps line.

319
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Uh, she's, this is her just for the season in a floral headpiece and butterfly wings.

320
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Uh, then she of course has Rob bot here.

321
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And he is the boyfriend of Bella bot and he's a Pandora friend.

322
00:17:48,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And then they have Bobby bot, the dog robot, meet Bella bots, faithful dog, Bobby bot with moving left legs, flapping ears and a heart full of charm.

323
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He is a bot's best friend.

324
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Take him for a walk on your bracelet together with Bella bot.

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So the bots are my favorite of all of the Pandora IP.

326
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Obviously, uh, Bella Rob and Bobby.

327
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Those are my favorite Pandora characters.

328
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Bella Rob.

329
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Are you going to get to my favorite?

330
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Bella bot.

331
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Which one was your favorite?

332
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Uh, the one with the unfortunate name.

333
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Isn't there one with like a nothing name?

334
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, well that's not okay.

335
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So here's what we're getting to this.

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That is not an official Pandora friend.

337
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What?

338
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They have other characters and designs that don't fall under the umbrella of the Pandora friends.

339
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's why it doesn't have a real name.

340
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, if I get to pitch to Disney Plus, I know what subject matter and I know who my room is.

341
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
They're all right here.

342
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Travel to the world of cubic zirconia where you'll meet the Pandora friends.

343
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The one line that has nothing to do with Disney.

344
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So that's just a deal they make.

345
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
They just have a relationship.

346
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Those are Disney characters.

347
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
They have to pay a silver company to use these characters.

348
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Wait, so they're not okay.

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No, this is only Pandora.

350
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
They're Pandora generated characters, not original Disney characters generated for Pandora.

351
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't believe so.

352
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And it has anything to do with Pandora the world of Avatar.

353
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Nothing to do with Pandora the world of Avatar.

354
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Too much crossover.

355
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Or Pandora the woman who committed the original sin of unleashing evil to them.

356
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I guess that would be an Eve.

357
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Right, it's kind of the same Eve.

358
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I never thought about that.

359
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So they have other original characters that aren't named.

360
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So here's one of my favorites, little boy charm.

361
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And little boy charm is adorable.

362
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You are making such intense eye contact with me right now.

363
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He's got a beanie with a propeller on the top and he's smiling and I'm not going to say.

364
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Just give me the box.

365
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
God damn it.

366
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Look, it's $55.

367
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I did not buy you one.

368
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If I was doing better financially, maybe I would have.

369
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I found a $22 Pippo the flying pig on Etsy.

370
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Is it Boo-Legged Pippo?

371
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It says it's 100% 925 Sterling.

372
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Why would they be selling this on Etsy?

373
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Etsy has a resale stuff.

374
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Because remember when you said that you should buy those pins on Amazon, you got a lot of flack for that because those are burner pins.

375
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Those aren't fake Disney pins.

376
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This Pippo would just be for me.

377
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
If I put the affection on it, it's still valid.

378
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Here, we'll post all of these.

379
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Here's grandpa charm as well.

380
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Once again, I can see your appeal to daggers.

381
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why are you staring, leaning towards Jason?

382
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Here's Princess emoticon.

383
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I do like these are my favorite ones so far.

384
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
No offense to the robots.

385
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Okay, so Princess character charm.

386
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Princess character.

387
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Was this before or after Disney?

388
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's unclear.

389
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
They got a lot of princesses to work with now.

390
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This one just says wifey on it.

391
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It looks like a dog tag also.

392
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh, no.

393
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It just says wifey.

394
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This one just says nurse on it and has a stethoscope.

395
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, these are your standard charms where it's like if you were in elementary school, you would have gotten a book if you were a reader.

396
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Now you're an adult and your husband's like, I don't know.

397
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
She's a nurse.

398
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There's a charm that says your job on it.

399
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Here's a cool face emoticon charm.

400
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Big lips, big sunglasses.

401
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah, very fun.

402
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Here is one that you, Lindsay, will like a lot.

403
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Pink popcorn charm.

404
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, hell yeah.

405
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Lindsay, a big popcorn fan.

406
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The problem is I might eat it.

407
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There's a good chance that you would get in a moment of weakness.

408
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's getting lodged in there just like a kernel.

409
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You got to be careful.

410
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Don't swallow that.

411
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And then yeah, and then there's sweet tree monster charm.

412
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
This is a little monster man tree character.

413
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's just Groot with green eyes.

414
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So I am very, very interested in the expanded Pandora world because obviously there's multiple continuities now.

415
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
There's just like a emoticon face continuity, but also the Pandora friends and they are separate.

416
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So there's many different potential shows and movies based on the Pandora characters, what I'm getting at.

417
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And then eventually like the Avengers, you bring all of the Pandora charm characters together in one movie.

418
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes.

419
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And that's really, I think, going to be very exciting for the viewer.

420
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And like the Lego movie, you have access to like all of, you know, the like Ariel's in it because she's a Pandora charm.

421
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
She's a charm.

422
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Taylor made for Disney Plus.

423
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
A nurse stethoscope is in it.

424
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's right.

425
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I think other jewelry companies might sell like not bootleg, but like might sell charm sized for standard Pandora dimensions because I have a memory of being down the Jersey Shore and seeing a jewelry store.

426
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Go like, get your charms that say that's the logo for like Johnson's Caramel corn and manco and manco pizza.

427
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Like the local landmarks.

428
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You can get a charm of that to put on a charm bracelet.

429
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
How's it going? Manco delicious.

430
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's like the best.

431
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hmm.

432
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It used to be Mac and Manco and the family's had a falling out.

433
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Well, I think he's going to jail.

434
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
He was skimming money in the hundreds of thousands.

435
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh man.

436
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's crazy.

437
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Geez.

438
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Don't commemorate him on a charm.

439
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's for sure.

440
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Did you ever own, did anyone here, I mean, did you ever own a bracelet as a child of any kind?

441
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Hmm.

442
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I wasn't even answering because I feel like it's assumed a girl would.

443
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I was assumed I was being very.

444
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I had a tennis bracelet.

445
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I did have a charm bracelet at one point in time.

446
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I wish that my memory were better these days, but I could tell you what terms there were.

447
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Right.

448
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Don't remember.

449
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What do you know?

450
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Can you tell me why?

451
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Why were they called tennis bracelets?

452
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I assume they originated with like rich women playing tennis, wanting to wear a delicate bracelet.

453
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That wouldn't fly off.

454
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah.

455
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Cause they were like, yeah, but tennis bracelets as far as the traditional version I know is just like a ring of, I assume for the richer people, diamonds.

456
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But as a child for me was obviously cubic zirconia.

457
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Right.

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I see.

459
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I feel like I had like, I'm a grown up now.

460
00:24:49,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I had like a, I feel like my friend of mine who moved away and made me like a friendship bracelets out of like kind of like red and maybe like not twine, but like some light material.

461
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I feel like it unraveled after a month or two.

462
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Sure.

463
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I had some slap bracelets.

464
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Oh, hell yeah.

465
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Sure. Yeah, right now. And then there's other kind of fabric 90s ones that were like black or green or orange and had flex on them.

466
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
There were usually prizes at Chuck E. Cheese or someone like Chuck E. Cheese.

467
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Also there were lanyard bracelets.

468
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I made a few of those in my day.

469
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What was lanyard?

470
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's like the plastic string that you would then braid into a little square at summer camp.

471
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You could make either lanyard keychains or lanyard bracelets.

472
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Right.

473
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And then a really common one with girls were the best friends bracelets where you had one half of a heart and your friend had the other one.

474
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yours would say like best and yours would say friend.

475
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Right.

476
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That's sweet.

477
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
We got to do that for the podcast.

478
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
A three way one?

479
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Okay.

480
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Aw, cute.

481
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Does Pandora make a three way charm bracelet that we could all wear?

482
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Oh, I found the charm that I said was my favorite last night just because of the name.

483
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Oh.

484
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Square cartoon face Murano glass charm.

485
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's my favorite character.

486
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Cartoon face.

487
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And his eyes are like, he's like a little bit cross eyed.

488
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Why?

489
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't know.

490
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Because it's fun I guess.

491
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Because he's kooky.

492
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
He's kooky.

493
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:46,000
If you were going to try to exactly nail the charm bracelet set for you, there is a very helpful item on Pandora's website, specifically within the Disney line area on the website.

494
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
There is a quiz that you can do that determines what's your Disney DNA.

495
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Oh, wow.

496
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I love quizzes.

497
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah.

498
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yes.

499
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's a lot of fun, I believe it's five questions and I'm sure once you've answered them you'll understand exactly why you got the results you got and there you'll find them to be incredibly accurate.

500
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But it's like it's through one of the slowest loading flash games you could imagine.

501
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's not Oh My Disney's What's Your Disney Character DNA?

502
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No.

503
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I found a different quiz about your Disney DNA on Oh My Disney just now.

504
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yes.

505
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
No, it's on Pandora's Disney sub site.

506
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Yes.

507
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Start by providing a sample of your DNA.

508
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I had to send a urine sample to Pandora.com.

509
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I will so basically through five questions the only one I could, what's that?

510
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I said that's not how you get DNA.

511
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah, yeah, this right?

512
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I think it's P.

513
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Maybe you are getting cease and desist letters.

514
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Please stop sending urine samples to all the Disney Disney's.

515
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
If I send enough P then they'll know the kind of juice and ice cream that's what I want.

516
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
No, that's I hope I did this right.

517
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
They said the note is the worst part.

518
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
What's my sandal DNA, Sanuk?

519
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Enjoy the P.

520
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I answered five trivia questions.

521
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I only remember one of them which is like what's your personal anthem and then you get five random Disney songs.

522
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
One of them I think is Zero to Hero.

523
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Are you doing that right now?

524
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah, and I said like what's your motto and I said Mother knows best.

525
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Was that an option or did you type that in?

526
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
No, no.

527
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I hacked to the website to write it in.

528
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It wasn't an option to write in but I figured it out.

529
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Michael, we've gotten cease and desist letters.

530
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Please stop hacking websites to say Mother knows best.

531
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You're finishing yours right now.

532
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I will say my results which is that I am lighthearted like Mickey.

533
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I am selfless like Erik, Prince Erik.

534
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Little Mermaid.

535
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Selfless.

536
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah, I know he is.

537
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I don't see it.

538
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't see it.

539
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And I got outgoing like Simba.

540
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The old Simba who although it's an old version of Simba not the superior Favreau one but Simba who piqued my interest in this entire thing.

541
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He was one of my charms.

542
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So if I were to have my correct Disney DNA I am Simba, Mickey and Erik.

543
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And I don't know how they ended up.

544
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
There's never a gender question and I ended up with all male choices.

545
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Aaron did it and got selfless like Aladdin.

546
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
What are these?

547
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Selfless?

548
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
He risks himself.

549
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Eventually he is.

550
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Eventually.

551
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
He frees the genie.

552
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
He makes some creepy choices as it goes.

553
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Aaron is selfless like Aladdin.

554
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Heroic like Erik.

555
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Different Erik quality.

556
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Don't you dare get Erik for your for his heroism.

557
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And lighthearted like Cinderella.

558
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay number one I got Belle.

559
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I always put others first just like Belle when she offers herself up as the Beast's prisoner in place of her father.

560
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
When phrased that way it's very troubling.

561
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I am Grumpy.

562
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You are cautious just like Grumpy who warns the dwarves.

563
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Don't touch it you fools.

564
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Might be poison.

565
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
When they go touching a bubbling cauldron left in their house.

566
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That's true.

567
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That was sensible advice though.

568
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah it was.

569
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And I'm always telling you not to touch a bubbling cauldron.

570
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I never learned.

571
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And there's another one.

572
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Oh and I'm Erik.

573
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
For what reason?

574
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This character was the talk of the playground when you were in school.

575
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Did you have them on your lunch box or pencil case?

576
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
No.

577
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I got that as well.

578
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Wait it didn't give you the...what was the quality of Erik?

579
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
We'll go to the next page and look at that.

580
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah it's heroic like Erik.

581
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Smart like Grumpy.

582
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Selfless like Belle.

583
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I mean this nailed me honestly.

584
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I was going to say it did.

585
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's yeah so.

586
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That is who you are.

587
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That is pretty good.

588
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Very nice.

589
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The Mickey descriptor was similarly bizarre where it says Mickey brings his friends together to solve challenges.

590
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And make it one big game.

591
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
That is it.

592
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Does Mickey ever done that?

593
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I guess.

594
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I think so.

595
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Mickey has no qualities is the problem.

596
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
They gave me Mickey because I'm flat.

597
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Not enough about me so I had to get Mickey.

598
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Okay I can take it on an iPad.

599
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah so I'll take mine.

600
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah yeah take it.

601
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Well but let me say.

602
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Oh okay.

603
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh no no no.

604
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Well I was just going to say I feel like we've been you know critical here and there.

605
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Some downtown Disney stuff.

606
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'll say this.

607
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I think downtown Disney compared to City Walk.

608
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I think downtown Disney does a better job of having places that if you were on vacation.

609
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You would go like oh I'll splurge for that.

610
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You know on vacation.

611
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You know.

612
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Hmm.

613
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I did not think about the cost.

614
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'll impulse buy.

615
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You know.

616
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Sure sure sure.

617
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I feel like less of that.

618
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
You can only get there.

619
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah at City Walk.

620
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Well my my wife who is selfless light hearted and heroic splurged on me for my birthday.

621
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
A couple months ago and knowing my obsession with this commercial got me.

622
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh wow.

623
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
My very own and I'll show you it's still mounted in the card that she gave me with it.

624
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
The cards they call each other pal.

625
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It says happy birthday to my pal.

626
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And it is a big.

627
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's a big Simba.

628
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And then you open it up and dangling inside a screenshot of the reflection.

629
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Is there is genuine pen.

630
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And as she said a genuine Pandora Jim for my king.

631
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And he has a little like he's got a little red nose and dark eyes.

632
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'll pass around if you want to see if we since we haven't don't know what one of these is like up close.

633
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Here I'll send it this way first.

634
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
She has the greatest handwriting I have ever seen.

635
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Well it's her profession.

636
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That's true.

637
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
She's very.

638
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Thanks for that.

639
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah.

640
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
She's good at making cards too.

641
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What's that?

642
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
This looks like Mufasa.

643
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It might be Mufasa.

644
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Well I don't know.

645
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You know what I've been saying Simba.

646
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But Simba does grow up.

647
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So essentially people mistake Mufasa for Simba form Mufasa.

648
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That's true.

649
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So a very thoughtful gift.

650
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It did make me very happy.

651
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I think I have to say I believe she did get it on the black market.

652
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I don't think this was from Pandora.

653
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
She just made this card herself.

654
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Well yes.

655
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It's so crafty.

656
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I thought it was professional.

657
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I have a lot of good nice things to say about my wife.

658
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm glad you did.

659
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah.

660
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's very.

661
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't want to unmount it from this.

662
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And she even tied it in the back with a little thread.

663
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's like a little piece itself.

664
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So you don't want to put.

665
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
She's so artistic.

666
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,000
If you want to put it like maybe you're going to get very interested in another charm eventually.

667
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And then maybe like you will be tempted I think to put it on a bracelet.

668
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But we'll see because it's hard to take it off that because it's a piece of itself.

669
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Sitting in the reflection pool where.

670
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Right.

671
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
My favorite moment where Simba looks in the water and realizes he's really a charm.

672
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Right.

673
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I love my quiz.

674
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I have to say no one's mentioned the unnerving DNA strand made of pearls floating in the background.

675
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's kind of a Mickey like the little like because you get three choices and then they sort of form.

676
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Oh they form a Mickey.

677
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But as your.

678
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Genetic Mickey.

679
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
As the quiz appears there's like a DNA.

680
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Well whatever you call it in the background.

681
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Strand.

682
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Strand. Yeah.

683
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It's very pretty.

684
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Mr. DNA.

685
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Mr. DNA.

686
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm taking it right now.

687
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
OK I got happy from the seven dwarfs you love helping out others just like happy who does the talking for the shy dopey.

688
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I do talk a lot.

689
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Kanga.

690
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm getting some different ones.

691
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You are always open to making new friends just like Kanga who immediately invites Tigger to live with her and Rue when he first arrives in the hundred acre wood.

692
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I forgot she did that.

693
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I don't remember that.

694
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Takes in a strange drifter.

695
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
A lot of manic energy.

696
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Eric.

697
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
School ground lunchbox or pencil case.

698
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah that's it.

699
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm these three weird choices.

700
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
There's the charm.

701
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
What was the Eric quality.

702
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Heroic.

703
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Why did both of you not say the Eric quality.

704
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Because we didn't get into it.

705
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's on the last page.

706
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Selfless outgoing heroic.

707
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You haven't gone through all of them yet.

708
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
OK.

709
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You're not understanding the website.

710
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Hold on.

711
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Hold on a second.

712
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Hours of fun this game.

713
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The charm for Eric is a shell.

714
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The charm for happy is I can't tell what that is.

715
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Big fat belly.

716
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's like I think it's all of them.

717
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And the charm for Kanga is Eeyore.

718
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What the shit.

719
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I guess that's the only.

720
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
This is female erasure.

721
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That is true.

722
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
There's no way they have a dang Kanga charm.

723
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Here's a male character.

724
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What did you get.

725
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I got Pinocchio first.

726
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You're a liar.

727
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I am selfless like just like Pinocchio.

728
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Yeah and I get liar is way more Pinocchio and like aimless and gullible and.

729
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
A disgusting actor.

730
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Almost turns into a donkey.

731
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You are selfless just like Pinocchio when he risks his life to save his father proving his selflessness to the blue fairy.

732
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Ish.

733
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I also got happy.

734
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Outgoing and friendly with everyone.

735
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Son of a bitch.

736
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You got to be fucking kidding me.

737
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Eric.

738
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Eric.

739
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Why?

740
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Why in God's name?

741
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I have a theory.

742
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I got selfless outgoing and heroic.

743
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
My theory is that they have like an overstock of shells.

744
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Yeah.

745
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And they're like we got to call everyone Eric I guess to get it.

746
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Like and so they're like when they have too many bells they'll just be like everyone's bell.

747
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Everyone's selfless.

748
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You turn the shell upside down.

749
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
That's weird.

750
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's the bottom of her dress.

751
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Your bell.

752
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Here's their skirt.

753
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Your bell now.

754
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I said my anthem was poor unfortunate souls.

755
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Why are you Eric?

756
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Heroic.

757
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Heroic.

758
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm the only selfless Eric in the room.

759
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah.

760
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Well I'm a lying selfless person.

761
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm the so I looked at it.

762
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The Pinocchio is just a little Pinocchio charm hanging after the mobs got to him.

763
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The Eric one is the shell and the happy one is all of the dwarves shoved in a mash.

764
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah.

765
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I got that.

766
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah.

767
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Okay.

768
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Which is kind of disturbing like they've been rolled up into a wheel and are fused

769
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
together for eternity.

770
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Like a dwarf king, like a rat king.

771
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah.

772
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
They're a dwarf king.

773
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
This is David Crote.

774
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's tragic.

775
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Seven dwarves.

776
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It is.

777
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's body horror.

778
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Let's try.

779
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Okay.

780
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm going to go back in the quiz.

781
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Let's try to see you getting something way different.

782
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
First question is what year were you born?

783
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm going to put 1902.

784
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Okay.

785
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So 1902.

786
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
What song is your anthem?

787
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Zero to hero.

788
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I just can't wait to be king.

789
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Let it go.

790
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Mother knows best.

791
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Poor unfortunate souls.

792
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Let's say like poor unfortunate souls.

793
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That's what I said too.

794
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Do we need to do something else?

795
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Let it go.

796
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It's too late.

797
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Zero to hero.

798
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It's too late.

799
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's too late.

800
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Okay.

801
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
The next, yeah, the DNA really takes a while to load.

802
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You've got a day off.

803
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Do you explore somewhere new?

804
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Spend all day with a good book?

805
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Do something creative?

806
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Make new friends at a party?

807
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Hang out with friends.

808
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I said book.

809
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's so generic.

810
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Book.

811
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I would say-

812
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Well, I said book.

813
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Do something.

814
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Don't say book.

815
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Explore somewhere new.

816
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Okay.

817
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Let's say that.

818
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And then cute Mickey shoots a star out of his hand at the DNA to add-

819
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
He often is blasting pyro from his fingers.

820
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
That's true.

821
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Very often in the parks.

822
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Blasting pyro.

823
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Do you discover some treasure?

824
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Do you give it all to charity?

825
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Share it with friends, family.

826
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Keep what you need.

827
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Give the rest away.

828
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Go on a shopping spree.

829
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Bury it in the garden and tell no one.

830
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Jason, did you say bury it?

831
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
No, I said-

832
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Feeling weak.

833
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I said, I split the difference and said keep what I need and give the rest away.

834
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Sure, sure.

835
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I said too.

836
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
We all lied about that.

837
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah.

838
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Most selfless answer.

839
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Bury it in the garden and tell no one's what I'm clicking on.

840
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Keep what I need and keep the rest also.

841
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,520
Okay.

842
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,680
Mickey is now blessed to the DNA.

843
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
You're setting out an adventure.

844
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,800
Do you create a detailed list of all possible destinations?

845
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,200
That's what I said for me.

846
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
Ask friends for recommendations.

847
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Flip a coin.

848
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Choose a destination at random.

849
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,680
Let the roads be your guide.

850
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,000
I assume none of us said let the roads be our guide, right?

851
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I asked for recommendations.

852
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yeah, do let the roads be their guide.

853
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Me too.

854
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Okay.

855
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Well, once again, Jason and I are the same person.

856
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Yes, a running theme.

857
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,080
I refrain from saying that you both should have sleepy as your dwarf.

858
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Just fucking say it.

859
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
You called me a liar already.

860
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
No, that was me.

861
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,080
And said my favorite charm was going to be popcorn.

862
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Really just like exposing me.

863
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,080
They said you would like that one.

864
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,600
Also, when I turned, you gave me Duffy for one of my birthdays.

865
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,640
You guys are mixing up what I've done wrong to each of you.

866
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,040
You're planning a night in with friends.

867
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,000
You go karaoke, fancy dress, Disney movie marathon, games night, fancy dress.

868
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,360
I don't think any of us answered that.

869
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
Yeah, okay.

870
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
Fancy dress.

871
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
I said karaoke.

872
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
I think I said that too.

873
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
Very limited.

874
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
And considerate for the neighbors.

875
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,640
Well, it's not in your apartment.

876
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,880
It said a night in, not a night out.

877
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,400
Oh yeah, you're right.

878
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
That is weird then.

879
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
You'd have to have a machine.

880
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,720
It's karaoke at home.

881
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
That is weird.

882
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
I mean, you can do it.

883
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
But like I've.

884
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,680
The gaming systems have them, I guess.

885
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
That is true.

886
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
Machines.

887
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
They should have been more specific.

888
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
Okay.

889
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
So we've gotten Minnie.

890
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,320
You're the whole head and tend to stay calm in stressful situations, just like Minnie,

891
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,760
who often takes charge of hectic situations in the house of mouse.

892
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,360
Some of those old cartoons, Minnie mostly screams.

893
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,240
You have to take charge of a hectic situation?

894
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,560
Use the tin.

895
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,840
And as we revealed in that old cartoon, the comic strip that we talked about in the Mary

896
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,440
Holland episode, Mickey in the 1930s said that she was a peach for looks, but an applesauce

897
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
for brains.

898
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
God, I love that.

899
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,480
I love that line so much.

900
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
So funny.

901
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,480
Princess Jasmine.

902
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,160
Oh, this is all new stuff.

903
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
Yeah.

904
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,240
Just like Jasmine, you accept.

905
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,040
You wish the best of others.

906
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,560
And then the last one is Grumpy.

907
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,880
So yeah, it's Minnie, Jasmine, Grumpy.

908
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,560
So this is the opposite of us.

909
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,560
Yes.

910
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,560
Selfless serious.

911
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
All right.

912
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Anyway.

913
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
We aren't this at all.

914
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,800
The punk gets the right hive mind.

915
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,600
Let's see listeners that we challenge you to find the weirdest combination of the three

916
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,080
taking these quizzes.

917
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,520
Can you get Hades?

918
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
Can you get No Shell?

919
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,120
Can you get the goat that Mickey cranks that plays Turkey in the Straw?

920
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,040
I took it again and I got Doc.

921
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,520
You helped Mickey make great music.

922
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
Did I get Doc last time?

923
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
No, I got happy.

924
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,520
But is it always the same seven dwarf like goo?

925
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
Yeah.

926
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,200
There was a human centipede of charms.

927
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,400
Dwarf human centipede.

928
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,960
Oh, horrible.

929
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,840
When we were talking about Downtown Disney and we're like, yeah, it's a little thin.

930
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Who knew we would do 40 minutes on Pandora?

931
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,560
That is why we ever learn this lesson.

932
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,800
I want to stop interrupting as much.

933
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
No, please.

934
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
I guess with that.

935
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,200
This is a common team creeps mini sodas.

936
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,600
We just take a quiz.

937
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
Oh, really?

938
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Yeah.

939
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
That's fun.

940
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,000
Our listeners, our donors are supportive.

941
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Sure.

942
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Great.

943
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Well, this is a one.

944
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
This is 10% of the episode.

945
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh, no.

946
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Oh, God.

947
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
We're going to keep going.

948
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,840
Let me just briefly name check that there is a weird array of disembodied fingers with

949
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,800
it show how the terms can be worn to shed out to the disembodied finger row.

950
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,920
If you go in the physical store and you can put on headphones and watch a movie about

951
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,600
how they're made, which seems like shady and in Thailand.

952
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Yes.

953
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,200
So then that blood charms.

954
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,840
Blood charms.

955
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,120
People died to make a sequel to Blood Diamond.

956
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Blood charm.

957
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,840
Do we feel comfortable enough to move to?

958
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
I feel.

959
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Yes, I feel comfortable.

960
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,840
I'm feeling juiced up.

961
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,480
Very good.

962
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,880
And off we go to what is good currently in its final days, Jamba Juice.

963
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Yes.

964
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:54,000
But what we have learned is that this entire company is rebranding to be Jamba.

965
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Open ended Jamba.

966
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,080
We are all about to witness a great becoming.

967
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,080
The rebirth.

968
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,240
Juice is a, there's a negative connotation these days for juice.

969
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
That's what I was reading.

970
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,560
That's what the company feels.

971
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
What?

972
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,560
That juice is sugary.

973
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,560
We were obsessed with juice now.

974
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,560
Sugary and.

975
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,560
I was explaining this to the sector keeper.

976
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
Yeah.

977
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,360
It's like fake stuff and there's been like, yeah, it's not so many D times.

978
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,920
So it's like bowl, it gets a lot more Acai bowls and different, yeah, different juices

979
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,480
and everything's getting more health conscious.

980
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,800
They're going to try to put a little less sugar in their drinks.

981
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,800
Sure.

982
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,800
But juice is like.

983
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,040
It's got a lot of sugar.

984
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,280
Cold pressed juice is everywhere now and you can charge $10 a bottle.

985
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,280
I experienced this.

986
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,240
There's a juice place by me and I was like, I'm feeling kind of, I don't remember when

987
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,400
I had a vegetable.

988
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,800
Let me go get a green juice.

989
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,280
And I looked on the like website to see when they opened and it was like $10 for a bottle

990
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,240
of just single serve bottle of juice.

991
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
And I was like, fuck this.

992
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,240
I'm going to Trader Joe's.

993
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
It's $4.

994
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,240
Yeah.

995
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,880
What kind of juice was it?

996
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,880
Cold pressed green juice.

997
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
Oh, okay.

998
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,880
Have you ever heard of Moon juice?

999
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,440
I think it's called Moon juice.

1000
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,800
It's like this very fancy store.

1001
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,920
I know there's at least one in West Hollywood on Melrose and that place is bananas.

1002
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,600
It's like the crystal shop of juices.

1003
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:24,480
There's a crazy one over in Burbank that's like 10, 12, $15 juices that have like, it's

1004
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,760
like char, I mean, I know that it's not that crazy.

1005
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,760
Charcoal juice.

1006
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Yeah.

1007
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Yeah.

1008
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,760
Exactly.

1009
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,760
You know what I'm talking about?

1010
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,760
Okay.

1011
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,960
Real quick about juice and smoothies in general for years, Jamba juice had fooled me.

1012
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,320
I probably said this on the air before they have fooled me into thinking that it wasn't

1013
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,160
just chock full of sugar and I was just going in there to get a dessert.

1014
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,160
Yeah.

1015
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,160
I'm a, I was a fucking idiot.

1016
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,160
Yeah.

1017
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,280
It happened with vitamin water.

1018
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,680
I've been tricked so many times in my dumb life.

1019
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,680
Yeah.

1020
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,680
Yeah.

1021
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,680
I like, Oh, well this is a vitamin.

1022
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,680
I'm drinking vitamins.

1023
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,400
You would show up to like improv practices drinking.

1024
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,120
You would either have a Jamba juice or you'd be eating a happy meal.

1025
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,440
And there was no in between.

1026
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,000
So I would, and I was tricked by McDonald's.

1027
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I thought happy meals were good.

1028
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,640
And they just, I was like, there's gotta be a chemical that makes me happy.

1029
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,640
Like an anti-depressant.

1030
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,640
Yeah.

1031
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,320
Happy meals now at 25?

1032
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,680
Well, what I would do is, what I would do is I would get like a happy meal cause it's

1033
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,680
a smaller portion.

1034
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
It's a deal.

1035
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,680
It's a smaller portion.

1036
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,960
So I would have just a little bit of the terrible food and then we would play some sort of game

1037
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,880
and then we would get, we would give the toy away as like a present in practice.

1038
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,880
Yeah.

1039
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,480
So it's like sort of a little ritual.

1040
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,480
That sounds fun.

1041
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,040
But I knew that was bad food.

1042
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,240
I remember like being fooled by Jamba juice and still being fooled when I learned of Jamba

1043
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,760
juice's secret menu.

1044
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,520
This is one of the first times I ever learned about a secret menu.

1045
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:43,840
It was like 10 years ago when someone told me that they had like gummy bear flavor.

1046
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,840
Whoa.

1047
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,680
Like red gummy.

1048
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,240
And I was like, I remember I was at the third street promenade and I went in and I ordered

1049
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,240
it and I felt like I was like, I knew a, but a special club.

1050
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,240
And then I was drinking it still.

1051
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,040
And I would still be like, this is a, this is good for me.

1052
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,640
You were tired of juicing red gummies at home.

1053
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,640
Yes.

1054
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,640
Old fashioned way.

1055
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:09,280
The machine is so expensive and you have to clean it out like in between, like in the

1056
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,760
middle of trying to juice.

1057
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,320
I used to work next to a Jamba juice and I would get the green juice at lunch with the

1058
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,320
boosts.

1059
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,600
The boosts never really did anything.

1060
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,160
If I was really hungry, I'd get a sandwich or a little handheld waffle.

1061
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:28,280
And the thing is the green juice, and I just had a green smoothie with kale in it.

1062
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,160
The green juice, if they are truly, truly healthy, shouldn't taste that good.

1063
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,960
The green juices, they still have a Jamba or Jamba juice.

1064
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,960
Tastes too good.

1065
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,440
It's like the number one ingredient is lemonade on some of them.

1066
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,080
And it's like, kale is like the fifth thing down and it's the only green and who knows?

1067
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,760
Like we're still being tricked.

1068
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,400
I was drinking this green juice from what's the company?

1069
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Suja?

1070
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
Yeah, Suja.

1071
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,560
And you pointed out after like a few months that there weren't even that many vitamins

1072
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,560
in it.

1073
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,480
It was like the vitamin content and it was like next to nothing.

1074
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
And it was like $10 bottles.

1075
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,240
You destroy the fibrous stuff with all the vitamins in it when you juice.

1076
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,240
Yeah.

1077
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,360
Well, yeah, it wasn't even just no fiber.

1078
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:12,280
It was like not really any vitamin A, not really any vitamin C, K, nothing.

1079
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,520
And that tasted bad.

1080
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,520
That just tasted bad.

1081
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,520
Yeah, it did.

1082
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,760
I refused to drink it and you were on my ass about it.

1083
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,400
We were like, just drink green juice every day.

1084
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Because we both lament.

1085
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,640
And I was like, no, it's a lie.

1086
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,000
We both lament the fact that it's like hard sometimes to make vegetables if you're trying

1087
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,480
to run and get something fast in the fridge.

1088
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,040
It's like, hey, you got to put a little salad together and you got to put some on.

1089
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,560
So I was trying to figure out a solution to this.

1090
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,200
And I found that and I thought it was working.

1091
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,240
And you pointed it out.

1092
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,600
And for a long time when you were like, I'm not eating enough vegetables.

1093
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,960
I was like, well, just get this green juice.

1094
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,000
And then finally you put me to shame.

1095
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,840
You said, I'm sorry, there aren't that many vitamins in this.

1096
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,720
Like maybe it was a really good placebo and you're getting like placebo vitamin A.

1097
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,720
Maybe.

1098
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,720
I don't know how it works.

1099
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,720
But I just think this whole like health thing with smoothies and green drink in general.

1100
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,000
Over and over again, just being duped in a different way.

1101
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yes, I'm a rube.

1102
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm an idiot.

1103
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,160
I'm drinking an acai smoothie right now.

1104
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,160
It's great.

1105
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,160
I really like it.

1106
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,400
It's a lot less sweet.

1107
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,400
It's a lot more.

1108
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
There's like dates in it.

1109
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,400
It's that kind of sweet.

1110
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,400
Sure.

1111
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,360
I went to, and I'm not saying it's yours because they're different, but I was going to a place

1112
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:22,280
that has that has acai bowls and I was getting it and I was like, oh my God, I'm so healthy.

1113
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,280
This is delicious.

1114
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,240
I'm getting a lot of fruit, although that has sugar.

1115
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,240
It's still fruit.

1116
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
Right.

1117
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,240
It's fruit sugar.

1118
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:34,280
However, then I found out it was basically acai flavored ice cream.

1119
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,880
And I was like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

1120
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,880
I can't win.

1121
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,080
I just want to eat something fast and healthy and to go.

1122
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:47,920
I was, I ordered this knowing it was the case, but I ordered an acai bowl at Whole Foods

1123
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,840
a few weeks ago and I looked and it was 1500 calories.

1124
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
Exactly.

1125
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,600
So like it's all, everything is a scam.

1126
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,600
Everything's a lie.

1127
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,600
Everything's a lie.

1128
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
Everything's fake.

1129
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,280
And I even looked at the new Jamba website and it's the same shit.

1130
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,680
It's not even like they've really overhauled and now it's like something different.

1131
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,560
It's just, they're trying to rebrand to maybe like anybody who has sort of a negative connotation

1132
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,560
or feels like they were duped by Jamba Juice, like come back.

1133
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,560
It's all good.

1134
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,560
And it's not like it's bad.

1135
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,560
And again, it's

1136
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:22,200
brilliant in the same way that calling it S Y F Y redefine the sci-fi channel forever.

1137
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,200
Oh, so it's not just science fiction.

1138
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,160
It's like, it could be whatever it wants to be.

1139
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,440
And I know that because there's wise in it now.

1140
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,440
Yes.

1141
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,040
The Y Jamba is going to, nobody is going to remember like just having milkshake bloat

1142
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,840
from what they thought was healthy juice.

1143
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,840
Yes.

1144
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
They took the word juice out.

1145
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,000
I mean, it's become the one stop shop for geeked them.

1146
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,680
I mean, I like to think of it like that.

1147
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,360
Well, we all were looking for a home for geeked them.

1148
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,360
I mean, and we found it at sci-fi.

1149
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,480
How can I let my geeked them out?

1150
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,920
I yeah, it's just like, I have been looking, I've been looking to express my geeked them.

1151
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,200
It is a world where you cannot say that you were a dork and I am about ready to make for

1152
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,440
it to be acceptable in this world to finally declare that I'm a big old dork.

1153
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,560
I'm going to open up a competitor to Moon Juice.

1154
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,560
It's called dork juice.

1155
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,560
Oh man.

1156
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,880
It's for schlubs to get their fancy crystal juices.

1157
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,880
Wow.

1158
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,880
That's a good idea.

1159
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,880
You mean in the way that crystals are.

1160
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,080
Visit MoonJuice.com and you'll see why I'm phrasing it that way.

1161
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:28,440
And I'm a woman who loves her crystals, except somebody just forwarded me an article about

1162
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,720
how it's like on the backs of child slave labor, like digging up these crystals, not

1163
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,720
done with that.

1164
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,440
There's no joy to be had in this world.

1165
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:45,120
Is there a juice that grinds up Pandora charms and lets me get the good, the great charm?

1166
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,120
Oh, that's a good idea.

1167
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,040
The charms are being made by child labor.

1168
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Yeah.

1169
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,240
Well, I assume that, but Tiffany Haddish told everyone to drink turpentine.

1170
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,720
I saw that article this week.

1171
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,080
She was on the red carpet at the Emmy.

1172
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,720
That was so long ago.

1173
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,720
So now everyone's been drinking turpentine.

1174
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Listening to this.

1175
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,720
No, no.

1176
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,280
If you go to Amazon and look up reviews of turpentine, people are doing it as like a

1177
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,080
snake oil kind of cure all back in the day.

1178
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:14,440
People would drink turpentine along with radium water.

1179
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,320
It was like, this will cure is what else?

1180
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,320
Yeah.

1181
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,320
It's like an article.

1182
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,160
I saw people, it's an old Sheridan family remedy.

1183
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,440
Sheridan family thing.

1184
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,840
I saw somewhat like multiple people on my Facebook feed.

1185
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:30,140
I saw recently, like there was an article that said like she cured her Alzheimer's by

1186
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,600
changing her diet.

1187
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,400
And it was from like evolution dash news.

1188
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,360
Oh, I love sites like that.

1189
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,960
People are like, I look into this news dot biz.

1190
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Yeah.

1191
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,960
Mm hmm.

1192
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,960
Anyway, yeah.

1193
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,760
Do they think it like inoculates your body to toxins?

1194
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,600
I think it kills toxins in your stomach.

1195
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:55,400
What it really does is kill your stomach lining and the toxins that are supposed to be there.

1196
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,120
Are we sure it's bad for you?

1197
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,120
Better.

1198
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,840
I'll try being anti duped.

1199
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,840
You're going to get.

1200
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,960
You're going to get.

1201
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,440
I don't believe anybody, but anything anymore.

1202
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,560
Anti vaxxers going to turpentine thinking that that's the better solution.

1203
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,000
It's possible, but maybe it is.

1204
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,480
Maybe I'm a true maybe they'll re after rebrand again.

1205
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,000
And in 2022, their Jamba turpentine.

1206
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,320
It's like I saw that anti vax tweet where it was like some guy posting a photo of this

1207
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:35,560
like six year old crying, holding a card, saying goodbye from his first grade class.

1208
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:40,400
And they were like, this is a little boy being forced to leave the first grade because his

1209
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,520
mother doesn't believe in vaccinations.

1210
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,460
This is what you're doing to children.

1211
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,460
And I was like, what the.

1212
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:52,040
And so I looked into it and from 20, 20.

1213
00:53:52,040 --> 00:54:00,960
2017 to April, 2019, it was purely a cryptocurrency pusher.

1214
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,240
All it did was a Twitter account.

1215
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,520
All it did was promote a certain kind of cryptocurrency.

1216
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,840
And then in April, 2019, there was a hard turn and now it's nothing but an anti vax

1217
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,840
account.

1218
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,840
They're like, this is a bot.

1219
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,840
This is a bot.

1220
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,880
We're all getting mad at it, but it's not real.

1221
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,360
Nothing is real.

1222
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,480
And you can find like you just look for that kid and there's like a he's like a stock photo

1223
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,480
actor.

1224
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,920
You could find him in a sailor suit like two days prior.

1225
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,760
My theory is it was like the last day of first grade.

1226
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,560
This kid was going to miss all of his classmates.

1227
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,640
It was some mom in Illinois posting on Facebook.

1228
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,280
And now it's a like tool of politics.

1229
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,320
Jamba's rebrand is that they are a suitable replacement for vaccinations.

1230
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:48,120
Instead, moms don't want to inject poison into your children.

1231
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,640
Jamba, Jamba, don't be number one.

1232
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,640
Be patient zero.

1233
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,640
It's a good slogan.

1234
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,640
I like.

1235
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,960
OK, I don't want to trash.

1236
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,800
I'm too kind of think of it as a good dessert that you might get some vitamins from.

1237
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,140
You don't want to milkshake if you're in more of a sherbet move.

1238
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,140
This is your place to go.

1239
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,220
Like I eat a ton of ice cream.

1240
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,880
Who am I to criticize?

1241
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,120
It's the being tricked part.

1242
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,440
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

1243
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,620
And like you can get like just carrot juice from there if you want.

1244
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,960
So there's a couple options sometimes where I go.

1245
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,360
Well, you are getting like a pure juice experience.

1246
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,360
You can get like a wheatgrass shot and they do it.

1247
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:31,480
I was about to say, as soon as I realized that it was just sugar, I would go into Jamba

1248
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:36,640
Juice and I'd buy like a three dollar double wheatgrass shot and you got a little orange

1249
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,640
afterwards.

1250
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,640
Yes.

1251
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,720
And I you know, you see them take just straight up wheatgrass and put it through a juicer

1252
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,080
and that's what comes out.

1253
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,880
So that's what if that's like suja.

1254
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,120
And you're getting none of the vitamin K that you think you're getting.

1255
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,120
You fools.

1256
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,040
There's lawns everywhere in Los Angeles.

1257
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,040
Free for the picket.

1258
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,040
Wheatgrass lawns.

1259
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,040
How about this?

1260
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:03,040
Maybe we have to give this location some credit because at the Disneyland Resort, there is

1261
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:08,480
not there are not a lot of fast places to get something that might be beneficial to

1262
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,000
you and not super unhealthy.

1263
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
That's true.

1264
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,600
A lot of things are unhealthy there.

1265
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:18,680
But if you're like, I've been at Disneyland for three days and I'm on my way to something,

1266
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,520
is there something quick that is not bad for me that I could do?

1267
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,520
You could do it.

1268
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,520
Yes.

1269
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,600
And it's probably not bad that it's there.

1270
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,680
And you could have there's a I forget what it's called, but there's like a yogurt type

1271
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,080
strawberry granola, you know, 300.

1272
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,080
Parfait?

1273
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,480
Sort of, yes.

1274
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,520
But it's called something different.

1275
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,480
It's like a strawberry topper or something.

1276
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,480
It's called something fun.

1277
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,480
So like a parfait?

1278
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,480
Yes.

1279
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,480
It's very similar to a parfait.

1280
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,480
Get his ass.

1281
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,480
No, I'm getting Jamba's ass.

1282
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,720
Yeah, I was just going to name it.

1283
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,280
I forget what it's called.

1284
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,240
But that's not a terrible thing to have in the morning and you get a little bit of protein

1285
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,600
from the granola, you know, there's so it's not like I'm not trying to trade.

1286
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,800
It's not completely like you're there's there's benefits to it.

1287
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,640
And you know what else they have?

1288
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,640
Oat milk.

1289
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,640
Oat milk is here.

1290
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,640
Yes.

1291
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,640
Several places in the store.

1292
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,520
It says oat milk is here.

1293
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,040
They are they are pushing the oat milk.

1294
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,360
The humane option.

1295
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,600
They're also going to start rolling out pea protein.

1296
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,280
Protein made from peas.

1297
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
Vegan protein.

1298
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,280
Yes.

1299
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,520
So they're trying to push a little.

1300
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,520
It's called pea protein.

1301
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,520
It's made from peas.

1302
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,520
It's in peas.

1303
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,520
You know, urine protein.

1304
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,520
Oh, I know.

1305
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,520
It's just weird.

1306
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,920
Unless you've been sending them all your pea samples and then they're like, well, we got

1307
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,400
to do something with it.

1308
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,000
I hope they're using it for something.

1309
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,680
You have proteins in your pea, right?

1310
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,520
I don't know if it's good when you do, but.

1311
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,440
There's got to be protein in your pea.

1312
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,640
From Alive in Waterworld.

1313
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
That's true.

1314
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,640
Bad protein.

1315
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,640
All right.

1316
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,440
It's just like as you want these places to be sort of magical in their displays and elevated

1317
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,200
because they're near a theme park.

1318
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Yes.

1319
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,280
That this place's biggest boasting point is oat milk is here.

1320
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,360
Here's what I want to say about oat milk, which I fully support.

1321
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:08,600
I'm trying to get off buying things in the house that are inhumane to animals.

1322
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:14,440
And so I was buying oat milk and I was sick all week and my stomach hurt.

1323
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,440
And it's because of the oat milk.

1324
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,440
You really think that's it?

1325
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,440
You're making the assessment.

1326
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,440
I'm fine today.

1327
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,600
And it's the first day I haven't had oat milk in weeks.

1328
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,720
I tried some of the oat milk.

1329
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,960
And you were feeling sick too.

1330
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,400
And I felt pretty sick and then got really sort of sick, stomach sick.

1331
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,640
What I'm hoping is it's just that I've been buying brands that add sugar and maybe some

1332
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,600
other stuff to make it creamier.

1333
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:42,240
I don't think I was feeling bad when I was drinking Oatly, a specific brand.

1334
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,240
Oatly is the name of it?

1335
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,760
Where it's with Silks Oat-Yeah and Planet...

1336
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,680
Oh dang, I forget the name of it.

1337
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,680
But Oatly.

1338
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,320
Oatly is the good one.

1339
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,320
Maybe.

1340
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,800
Oat-Yeah, what was it called?

1341
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,800
It's Silk.

1342
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,800
It's the Silk brand.

1343
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,800
Right.

1344
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,800
Oat-Yeah.

1345
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,160
Oat-Yeah might not be as good.

1346
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,400
Yeah, I was feeling a little bit sick on that.

1347
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,160
And then the worst one was this week's Planet something oat milk.

1348
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,280
All right, well if you are a listener, I have two...

1349
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,920
But it might, I'm sure it's different for everybody.

1350
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,920
I was going to say if you're a listener...

1351
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,920
I got an Americano at a cafe and I tried the oat milk in it and it sucked.

1352
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,680
Like it didn't mix well.

1353
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,160
If you're a listener, I have two questions for the listeners.

1354
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,400
Number one, tell us your oat milk experience.

1355
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,960
Number two, do you have some sort of green drink that can truly supplement me just having

1356
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,520
to cram lettuce in my mouth or spinach?

1357
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,240
Can't you just take a capsule or something?

1358
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,760
I did find that one that does have all the vitamins.

1359
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:48,000
It's like just a juice in one of those glass bottles and like a sprouts or whatnot.

1360
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,480
But it was so gloopy.

1361
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,480
Oh yeah.

1362
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,480
We got to find...

1363
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,480
That I just couldn't...

1364
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,480
Right.

1365
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,480
I was like, I'm not going to fall with it.

1366
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,480
It made me gag.

1367
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,480
But it had all of the vitamins.

1368
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,480
That was my issue.

1369
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,680
I got a packet of pea protein mix and dumped it.

1370
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,480
Yeah, I don't like pea protein.

1371
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,920
This is the adult-iest episode of the Potrillion.

1372
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,320
We got to bring it home, Sephora.

1373
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,960
It's Planet Oat Oat Milk.

1374
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,520
So I don't want to disparage these brands entirely.

1375
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,760
I'm just saying they didn't agree with me.

1376
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:23,440
So if suddenly you're not feeling well, consider the possibility that it's the oat milk you're

1377
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,440
drinking.

1378
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,360
Try a different brand if it's not working for you.

1379
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,480
Perhaps you should not say to your body, oat milk is here.

1380
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,480
Yeah.

1381
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,880
So not necessarily.

1382
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,600
But unfortunately it is on the ASPAs...

1383
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
CPAs...

1384
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,600
What is it called?

1385
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,600
ASPCA.

1386
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,600
ASPCA.

1387
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,600
The animal thing.

1388
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,600
Yeah.

1389
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,120
It is on their list of humane milks.

1390
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,120
Sure.

1391
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,120
Well, that's good.

1392
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,120
Yeah.

1393
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,120
All right.

1394
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,040
So we're going to come into the next place as well.

1395
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,040
Sephora?

1396
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,040
Humane issues?

1397
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,040
Sephora.

1398
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,720
I'm talking so much about each of those stores.

1399
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,720
I'm sorry.

1400
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,720
Yeah, I know.

1401
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,720
We're not even there.

1402
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,080
You're here because you like Sephora.

1403
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,080
I love Sephora.

1404
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:12,800
And I was listening to the City Walk Saga and Mike made reference to like, you go to

1405
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,560
Sephora and he's like, mom, I want to look for toys.

1406
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,560
Yeah, we do split off in that.

1407
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,560
Yeah.

1408
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,600
We should hear your side of it.

1409
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,880
What's in there?

1410
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,240
I'm afraid to go into the makeup store.

1411
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,240
Well, makeup.

1412
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,240
Okay.

1413
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,240
Only makeup.

1414
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,240
Can I eat any of it?

1415
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,240
It looks pretty good.

1416
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,240
Makeup and skincare and hair care.

1417
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:35,360
Is there female... is there male stuff in there?

1418
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,840
It's mostly geared toward female, right?

1419
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,640
Here's the thing.

1420
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:48,440
Yes, but also it's bullshit to think that men can't use any of the products just because

1421
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,840
they're not gunmetal gray.

1422
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,840
Right.

1423
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,440
But I'm saying like, is it all marketed...

1424
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,640
I really want to put on one kind of makeup stripes under my eyes.

1425
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,640
That's it.

1426
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,640
Because, yeah, because...

1427
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,160
Yeah, but they're all for all genders and skins and faces.

1428
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,840
But it is marketed specifically for the female just because that's the general...

1429
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,840
Yeah, because that's his generally wearing makeup.

1430
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:13,400
But when you go into a Sephora now, as you're seeing all genders and all...

1431
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,400
Sure.

1432
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,680
I think everybody wearing some impressive makeup that I couldn't do myself or I'd need

1433
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,680
to practice.

1434
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,280
I will say we were in the Sephora and I like the displays a lot.

1435
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,080
Like I like... because they've got a lot of colors going on.

1436
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,800
We were just in Macy's the other day and I was really trying to...

1437
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,720
Jason's checking his email and there's emails from Pizza Hut.

1438
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,720
Jason.

1439
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,720
Right now looking at a Pizza Hut 35% off email.

1440
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,720
It's a makeup topic.

1441
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,720
That's just the top one.

1442
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,720
There is a serious one.

1443
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,720
Jason could not be of more of a...

1444
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,720
There was a serious one I...

1445
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,720
Checking it out.

1446
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:46,720
Accidentally archived and had to find real quick.

1447
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,400
Brief anecdote.

1448
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:56,080
When we were recording Public Domain Theater, which we have brought back on the Teen Creeps

1449
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,000
Patreon only.

1450
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,440
But when we're doing Public Domain Theater, my second podcast I had with Kelly Nugent,

1451
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,680
who is my co-host on Teen Creeps, where we read a short story from the Public Domain

1452
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:14,720
Cold, read out loud and respond to it in real time and they're very silly.

1453
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:19,080
We did an episode we recorded with this New York comedian who came in and anytime she

1454
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:23,880
wasn't reading, she was checking her phone.

1455
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,240
So we didn't release her episode because it was just all this dead space and she never

1456
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,800
noticed or said anything and so fine fuck her.

1457
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,560
So DM you and you'll tell the listener who that was.

1458
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,560
I won't.

1459
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,560
I actually won't.

1460
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,560
I won't burn her down.

1461
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:42,720
I accidentally archived an unpleasant email about my car and I was like, oh, I have to

1462
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,080
put this where I can find it to deal with.

1463
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,080
I wouldn't have noticed it.

1464
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,080
I didn't have a problem with the email.

1465
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,920
But it's just an iOS.

1466
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,680
When you archive something, it just goes to the next thing.

1467
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,680
That's why it popped up.

1468
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,840
And she wasn't texting to be like, oh, this is going a little longer.

1469
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,080
I'll meet you later, blah, blah, blah.

1470
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,600
Because she did have something right afterwards.

1471
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,660
She was looking at Twitter.

1472
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,520
To be fair, maybe she was looking at Pizza Hut's Twitter.

1473
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,520
Maybe.

1474
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,520
And there were deals involved.

1475
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,520
Maybe.

1476
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,520
And I didn't want to say that fast.

1477
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,520
Okay.

1478
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,620
This is the real let's move on.

1479
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:16,320
With Sephora, I stayed outside at Sephora because I'm kind of sensitive to scents.

1480
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,800
There's a lot going on.

1481
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:22,160
I know there's a lot going on and I had a stomach ache because I eat it too much.

1482
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,160
Can you eat it?

1483
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,040
I eat it too much and I got a tummy ache.

1484
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,320
We'll get into that in a future episode.

1485
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,660
But I stayed outside.

1486
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,240
The lights can also be a little overwhelming.

1487
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,240
It's very bright.

1488
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,240
Very bright.

1489
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,920
I was thinking like when I was in that Sephora, I was thinking maybe if it was, I do think

1490
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,520
it's like if they had more hair care and skincare, they'd have to ease me a little bit more into

1491
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,520
the different departments.

1492
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,040
Because I think I have, oh, go ahead.

1493
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,040
I'm interrupting.

1494
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:52,520
But all of the skincare is mostly on the walls.

1495
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:56,200
It's like the walls have skincare, perfume, hair care.

1496
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,080
And then if you head straight or no, if you head straight toward the back, maybe that's

1497
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,200
where they keep perfume now.

1498
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Got it.

1499
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,600
I almost feel a little overwhelmed and I think it's probably too in there is like I have

1500
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:13,240
a feeling of like as a child, feeling like this is not, and nothing in here is for me.

1501
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,720
So I sort of check out.

1502
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,640
But I was trying to be very present in the moment of the Sephora and trying to enjoy

1503
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,880
just from an aesthetic point of view and the display.

1504
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,040
Well, that's the thing we struggle with every day.

1505
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,160
Like Jason was struggling with it just now.

1506
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:30,000
You weren't checking your email.

1507
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
You weren't checking your email.

1508
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Also, I had to.

1509
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
You've all always been 100 percent present on a podcast.

1510
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Please.

1511
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Yeah, right.

1512
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Come on.

1513
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It was right there.

1514
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,720
I had to take it.

1515
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,640
So yeah, so I was looking and I was like, I think I also feel a little bit like I just

1516
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,880
need a little way in.

1517
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,080
And I don't know if it's just like the old I need.

1518
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,240
I think skincare would be the way in.

1519
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,240
Right.

1520
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,760
I don't know if it's like I need like a Paul Bunyan type man in the corner beckoning me

1521
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:05,480
over because, you know, I'm such a, you know, the manly animatronic.

1522
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,800
Oh, I would love it at Paul Bunyan animatronic in Sephora.

1523
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,920
But he's like hot Paul Bunyan.

1524
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,320
He's like kind of a club raver Paul Bunyan.

1525
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,360
He's wearing a little eyeliner and lipstick.

1526
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,360
Yes.

1527
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,360
A little shimmer highlighter.

1528
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,360
Yes.

1529
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:24,380
And he's got a babe, the blue ox, who's like dressed in sort of like a sparkly vest maybe.

1530
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,800
And they're like kind of going out on the town.

1531
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,800
A lot of mascara.

1532
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,520
Tons of mascara on babe, the blue ox.

1533
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,720
So, yeah.

1534
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:36,800
So I was trying to figure out like what, yeah, because I like the skincare.

1535
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,720
I like to try stuff out.

1536
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,440
I just subscribe, not subscribe, but I got shampoo that I custom made for myself.

1537
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,960
Because of the podcast?

1538
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,960
Not because of the podcast.

1539
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,240
Because I wanted to get free points for my Marvel card trader game.

1540
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,340
But that's another discussion for another podcast that we haven't run over.

1541
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,520
But I was very intrigued by it.

1542
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,780
So I like all of this stuff.

1543
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:03,000
I just feel like I needed, I need like a long time to get to figure out where my spots are.

1544
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Sure.

1545
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,520
Isn't that what a lot of people use?

1546
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,520
Kiehl's is not cruelty free.

1547
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,520
It's not?

1548
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

1549
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,760
If I, you made like five things this episode.

1550
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,900
That's a new thing of mine.

1551
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:21,000
Ever since I did Jackie Johnson's Nach Butte, she's very super vegan in all of her products.

1552
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Yes.

1553
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,240
Makeup, skincare, food, et cetera.

1554
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:32,720
And so ever since then, I have really tried to stick to cruelty free skincare and makeup

1555
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,080
and hair care.

1556
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:41,540
And so I have a page bookmarked on my phone because you can like, you can add a specific

1557
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,200
website to your phone.

1558
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,880
I don't know what you'd call it.

1559
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:47,880
What do you mean?

1560
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,880
Like the same way you have an app.

1561
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,880
Oh, an extension.

1562
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,880
On your phone.

1563
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,880
Yeah.

1564
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,880
You can just like a shortcut.

1565
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,880
Yeah.

1566
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,440
And then at crueltyfreekitty.com.

1567
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,960
And there's a list I check every time I go out and Kiehl's is not cruelty free.

1568
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:03,960
I see.

1569
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,720
You know your boyfriend eats 90% Taco Bell McDonald's, right?

1570
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,720
I am aware.

1571
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,720
Okay.

1572
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,720
It's very hard to cut out entirely.

1573
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:10,720
I'm not vegan.

1574
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,040
I ate Taco Bell last night.

1575
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,080
All black beans, baby.

1576
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,520
No meat at all.

1577
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,520
And here's the thing.

1578
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,520
It's like food, it's harder.

1579
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:23,320
You do, you need to eat, but you don't need to buy products that are tested on animals.

1580
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,320
It's just unnecessary.

1581
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:29,520
And the thing is Kiehl's is not tested on animals, but they sell in mainland China and in mainland

1582
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,400
China it is by law.

1583
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,840
They have to test it on animals before you can sell theirs.

1584
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:39,960
We don't test it on animals generally, but anyway, I'm going very long.

1585
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:40,960
What a country.

1586
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:45,280
Also, I'm ready for them to replace all the fast food with fake meat.

1587
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,280
Sure.

1588
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,280
I'm ready for it.

1589
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,280
I don't care.

1590
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,280
It's already kind of fake.

1591
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,360
It's just part corpse.

1592
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,600
Is there any particular difference?

1593
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,800
Is that an especially good Sephora?

1594
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,760
We aren't that far from other Sephora locations.

1595
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,440
Not an especially good.

1596
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,840
It's very standard.

1597
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,040
It's a little smaller than some, I would say.

1598
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:10,120
Like the one at the Americana is pretty small, but then there are some Sephoras in JCPenney's.

1599
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:16,880
Those are very small, but you get pretty much the essentials that you would need.

1600
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,880
Sure.

1601
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:23,760
I'm a little sad they killed off Dupars, the diner in this area, a diner scene in Boogie

1602
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,760
Nights.

1603
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,760
Yeah.

1604
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,760
And now it's a Sephora.

1605
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:30,280
Yeah, that one's a bummer, but I want to hold that against him.

1606
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,280
Dupars.

1607
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,840
Yeah, I always want to go to a Sephora.

1608
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,400
I browse it like it's a bookstore.

1609
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:42,440
I would stay in there for like an hour straight and I'm obsessed with buying skincare, realizing

1610
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,120
it makes my skin worse, and then returning it and buying a different one.

1611
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:51,120
I have so many points, like V.I.B. beauty points.

1612
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,120
V.I.B.?

1613
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,920
V.I.B., like very important beauty insider.

1614
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,800
I forget.

1615
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:06,920
So I get free two-day shipping on all of my orders because that's how much I buy at Sephora.

1616
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:11,200
And so I have 2,270 beauty points saved up.

1617
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:17,200
And you can like buy stuff with your points and I saved up so much that I am for the next

1618
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:24,000
10 days entering a $25,000 sweepstakes and I can buy five entries per day using my points.

1619
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Oh, nice.

1620
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
That's what I'm up to right now.

1621
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,600
Do you get cash or mega products?

1622
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,800
I think cash.

1623
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,400
I think it's a cash prize.

1624
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,400
Wow.

1625
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,440
He came back and reported.

1626
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,440
That's what happened.

1627
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,960
I'm sure like Mike will update everybody if I suddenly win $25,000.

1628
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,960
The podcast is over.

1629
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,760
Yeah, no, we're moving to the Cayman Islands.

1630
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,160
We can live off that $25,000 for life.

1631
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,160
Yeah, right.

1632
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,160
So that'll be great.

1633
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:54,800
Yeah, it wouldn't merely pay off half my debt at all.

1634
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,560
Oh man.

1635
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,680
Yeah, big Sephora fan.

1636
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,680
Yeah.

1637
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,680
Well, that's good.

1638
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,160
I'm going to get into Sephora.

1639
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,480
You're not in point debt.

1640
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,480
That's the problem.

1641
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,480
No, that's the problem.

1642
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,480
You're doing great point wise.

1643
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,480
Yeah.

1644
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,800
It'll pay off my Sephora debt.

1645
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:17,320
Do you, is this like a, what I painted, is it accurate to say that, yeah, you guys will

1646
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,360
like split and Michael go to-

1647
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:25,760
Well, I used to go to D Street when it existed at Downtown Disney and I'd go in and see what

1648
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:32,440
like Marvel character thing they had or what like hipster-y Disney parks thing.

1649
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,440
And then I'd come back.

1650
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,440
So that would happen often.

1651
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,320
But from now on, I'm going to get in that Sephora.

1652
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:40,960
I'm going to see what applies to me, what I could use.

1653
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,720
You know, I want to be important that you take Disneyland time away and devote like

1654
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,880
at least 45 minutes per visit.

1655
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,280
I want to grow as a human.

1656
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,800
I will say that I try to only go into a Sephora when I need something because inevitably I

1657
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,800
will buy something if I go in.

1658
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,800
Right.

1659
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,800
Yeah.

1660
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,280
And I always ended up buying more than I wanted to as well.

1661
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:13,720
And as much as I'm constantly buying skincare stuff, you hundred percent have better skin

1662
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,200
than I do.

1663
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,480
Why am I doing this?

1664
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,480
It's a trick.

1665
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,720
It's a good question.

1666
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,920
I do have lotion.

1667
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,080
I put stuff on my face.

1668
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,720
I have like creams and lotion that I put on my face.

1669
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,720
But don't you just wash your face with like bar soap?

1670
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,720
Bar soap, yes.

1671
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,720
I do do that.

1672
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,720
Oh, that's it.

1673
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,720
And that does work.

1674
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,720
Why am I doing this?

1675
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,720
That does work for me.

1676
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,720
I'm spending so much money that I don't need to spend.

1677
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,720
I'm spending with all of this stuff.

1678
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,720
But it's fun.

1679
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,720
It is fun and it feels-

1680
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,360
It's not fun to look at.

1681
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,640
It feels like a magic potion, all of this stuff.

1682
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,280
It's like you, because I still have that.

1683
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:45,560
I'm like, you know, I'm going to find a thing that makes my hair just the perfect.

1684
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:50,160
And like you can get better and worse stuff for sure, but it's like nothing's actually

1685
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,560
going to really make it perfect.

1686
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,520
Unless you're buying like $500 face creams.

1687
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,520
Maybe that's what we need to do.

1688
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,520
Like look-

1689
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,520
We should buy that.

1690
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:05,880
I'm approaching, I am buying more and more expensive stuff and not like amounts, but

1691
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:13,720
like the product itself is edging on way too expensive.

1692
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:19,040
There are these, like Vogue is releasing these videos on YouTube of celebrities walking you

1693
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,200
through their skincare product routine.

1694
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:30,680
And like what's her face, Olivia Wilde's skincare routine is like four things and she's a big

1695
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:33,440
snob about it being only four things.

1696
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:38,200
Clearly she's like judging the even the concept of the video itself.

1697
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,760
And then Liv Tyler has like a 25 to 40 product routine.

1698
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,760
Oh my gosh.

1699
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,840
And she says that her dad is who got her into it.

1700
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,320
He's obsessed with skincare.

1701
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,320
Of course.

1702
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,640
He does look pretty good.

1703
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,320
He looks, oh, he's so fucking hot.

1704
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,320
He looks pretty good.

1705
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,520
When I look at him, I think hot as shit.

1706
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,520
That is what I'm saying.

1707
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,520
I'm maybe not saying that-

1708
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,000
Like it can't change your genetics, but it does affect your skin.

1709
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,480
He looks like shit.

1710
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,480
He's 70 years old.

1711
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:12,520
Well that's because of wrinkles and drug abuse and lack of soft tissue in his face, which

1712
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,520
is not his fault.

1713
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,520
I got to find a picture of him now.

1714
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,760
But the actual skin itself.

1715
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,640
Make me want Steven.

1716
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,640
I didn't.

1717
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,320
I'm not attracted to Steven Tyler.

1718
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,320
No one said hot.

1719
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,640
I just respect his beauty game.

1720
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,840
I didn't say Steven Tyler is so fuckable now or anything.

1721
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,440
I'm going to say keep going, Scott.

1722
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,200
I want to see where this rabbit hole leads.

1723
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,760
I mean the scarves alone for me are a turn off.

1724
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,760
What's that?

1725
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,720
The scarves alone for me are a turn off.

1726
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,720
Too many scarves.

1727
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,920
Well the hair is worse than the skin.

1728
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,000
Let's be, you know, let me be-

1729
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,440
I just think for a 70 year old guy, all the pictures of him, he looks good for Steven

1730
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,440
Tyler.

1731
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,440
Sure.

1732
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,440
Yeah.

1733
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,800
Like, I don't know unless he's bow taxing or something.

1734
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,760
I mean, there's some lighting involved in here, but he looks like Steven Tyler.

1735
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,280
He looks alive for a corpse.

1736
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,280
Yeah.

1737
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,280
He looks better than Keith Richards.

1738
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:08,400
Again, the bar you're setting.

1739
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,400
The bar that is one millimeter from the ground.

1740
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,400
We're talking skin alone.

1741
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,400
We're talking drug abuse.

1742
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,680
He has a distinct glow about him.

1743
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,680
He's-

1744
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,680
Yes.

1745
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,760
That's what happens when you're living it up while you're going down.

1746
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,960
I was going to say living on the edge, which should have also worked.

1747
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:25,960
It also works, yeah.

1748
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,040
But also just the routine is fun.

1749
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,920
But am I too lazy to wash my face at night?

1750
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:31,920
Yes.

1751
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,920
I don't wash my face.

1752
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,480
Do you two have any sort of facial routine?

1753
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,480
Never moisturize?

1754
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,120
Sure.

1755
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,680
I use Cetaphil usually and-

1756
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,680
Not cruelty free.

1757
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,680
Great.

1758
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:49,320
I've also been trying the Trader Joe's face wash.

1759
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,320
Cruelty free.

1760
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,320
Yeah.

1761
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,960
It's pretty much the same.

1762
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,440
And then usually I use some sort of sunscreen that is moisturizing.

1763
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,440
Yeah.

1764
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,440
Moisturizer in it.

1765
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,200
Sunscreen is the most important skincare product you can use.

1766
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,720
I like Hawaiian Tropic.

1767
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:10,600
Again, smells very particular about, but the Hawaiian Tropic, either the moisturizing sunscreen

1768
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:15,000
or yeah, it's coconutty or the Hawaiian Tropic Sport, which isn't really moisturized, but

1769
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,120
it's still strong sunscreen.

1770
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,800
I try to get in the routine.

1771
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,580
I'm very bad at building daily routines.

1772
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:25,640
It's very easy for me to be driving away from my house going like, oh, I didn't do anything

1773
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,640
to my face today.

1774
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,960
I think the beard, having a beard is a thing where it's moisturizing is very important,

1775
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,800
depending on what the weather is and depending on-

1776
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,800
Yeah, I'm definitely bad at that.

1777
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,800
Because you can see sometimes-

1778
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,760
This thing's going away soon because it's dry as shit.

1779
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,200
Sometimes I'll forget you and it gets real dry and I have stuff in my car.

1780
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,680
I have stuff upstairs.

1781
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,680
Anyway.

1782
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:47,200
You don't find if you leave it in your car, the bottle goes like-

1783
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,480
It's in a little glass container.

1784
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,480
Oh, glass.

1785
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,480
Interesting.

1786
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,880
Well, do we have any listeners left?

1787
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,960
Not Steven Tyler.

1788
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,320
We lost him a while ago.

1789
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,840
Do you think we lost him at the beauty?

1790
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,840
Is that what you're saying?

1791
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,840
No, no.

1792
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,680
It was Jason and I discussing our beards is when I was like-

1793
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,680
Oh, I see.

1794
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,680
Why would that be?

1795
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,680
I'm kidding.

1796
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,680
They love us.

1797
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,680
They love the show.

1798
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,680
They'll clearly listen to anything.

1799
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:18,480
They are having a great time in the downtown Disney ordeal level two, stage one.

1800
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,480
Stage one.

1801
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,480
You get recognized everywhere we go, which-

1802
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,480
I'm just being self-deprecating, which is charming.

1803
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:28,320
Is insane to me because this is not a visual medium.

1804
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,280
The fact that they know what you look like so well astounds me.

1805
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,480
I think it's mad when someone recognizes me.

1806
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,980
I'm horribly jealous.

1807
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:37,080
I'm insanely jealous.

1808
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,400
Listen to Team Creep.

1809
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,600
I need validation.

1810
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,420
Watch Infinity Train.

1811
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,420
Also what people do sometimes-

1812
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:44,420
I'm important.

1813
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:48,360
You're the first person to just barrel into their own plugs.

1814
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,360
Yeah.

1815
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,360
Right now.

1816
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:55,000
I'm a selfish person who is trying to fill a void.

1817
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,640
Sometimes people know you from the podcast or at Extended Universe.

1818
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:58,640
That's the thing.

1819
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,640
Which bothers her too.

1820
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,680
When they see you, then they're like, oh, and you're Lindsay.

1821
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:08,360
I'm like, thank you, but also this is not how I want it to happen.

1822
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,320
I'm flashing to the beginning of the episode where you were introduced as you know her

1823
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,320
from living here.

1824
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,320
Yep.

1825
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,440
That played right into this.

1826
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,440
Perfect.

1827
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,520
Speaking of the podcast, the ride, the Extended Universe-

1828
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,520
It is how I was known in this universe.

1829
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,520
Sure.

1830
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,880
An item is appearing for us as we finish this level.

1831
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:31,360
I feel like it would make perfect sense if, because we got all the stones last time, probably

1832
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:36,480
getting some stone, like some of the Pandora charms would probably make sense.

1833
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:41,520
So here, this item must be sent to us from the beyond by the statue keeper right now,

1834
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,640
and it's oat milk.

1835
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,640
It's a jug of oat milk.

1836
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,600
Do not bring that into my home.

1837
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,600
Okay.

1838
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,720
Well, we'll put it in Jason's satchel.

1839
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:55,160
If we had that seven dwarfs charm, we could make a boss choke on it and throw it into

1840
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,160
his mouth.

1841
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,440
Yeah, but we don't.

1842
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,440
We don't.

1843
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,440
We have oat milk.

1844
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,440
Great.

1845
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,440
It's not one of the oat milks that makes you die.

1846
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,440
I hope it's oatly.

1847
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,840
We have your charm, but we're not going to use that to fight.

1848
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,200
No, that's my church item from Erin.

1849
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,200
Keep shake.

1850
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,000
Well, all right.

1851
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I guess with that, we survived downtown Disney or DL level two.

1852
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I do.

1853
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,080
I love that I'm here for Sephora and we talked about most of the other two stores.

1854
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,320
Well, who knew there'd be so much about Pandora?

1855
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,320
There's always so much.

1856
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:33,200
Hey, if Sephora would offer some more quizzes, give us, let me know what Disney.

1857
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:37,360
I'm sure that there are quizzes, but there are no Sephora.

1858
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,400
Also there's no Sephora IP we know about.

1859
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,400
There's no extended Sephora universe.

1860
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,400
Yeah, Sephora friends.

1861
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,400
As far as I know.

1862
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,400
You have a robot.

1863
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,520
I don't look into those things the way that you do though.

1864
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,840
I'm always looking for original IP.

1865
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,280
My fandom is very superficial.

1866
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:55,280
We want friends and what are you checking right now?

1867
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,280
Quizzes.

1868
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,280
Oh, okay.

1869
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,480
There's a whole, there's, here are the quizzes.

1870
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,800
Using skincare, hair, concealer, mascara, fragrance, lip.

1871
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,840
I can't answer zero to hero for any of those.

1872
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,840
No.

1873
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,000
I guess, okay.

1874
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,400
So we survived it.

1875
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:14,560
We're moving on to stage two.

1876
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,960
Lindsay K. Tell you survived, I guess, this specific thing, the downtown Disney or DL.

1877
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,200
You already covered it, but also-

1878
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,200
I'm doing it again.

1879
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,200
Yeah, doing it again.

1880
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,200
Plug again.

1881
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,200
I'm doing it again.

1882
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,040
And if you see both of us, don't just say Lindsay.

1883
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,040
No, it's fine.

1884
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,040
I'm kidding.

1885
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:35,240
It's exciting when they know me too, instead of just like, and who is this here with?

1886
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,040
It's like that scene from A League of Their Own where it's like, this is our daughter

1887
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:43,640
Dottie, and this is our other daughter, Dottie's sister.

1888
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:44,960
Yeah.

1889
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:50,040
So I have a podcast with my cohost, Kelly Nugent called Teen Creeps.

1890
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:55,920
We review teen horror from the 80s and 90s like Christopher Pike and Arl Stein.

1891
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:01,040
And I am a writer on the Cartoon Network show, Infinity Train.

1892
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,480
First season, if that's what we're calling it.

1893
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,840
What are we calling it?

1894
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,400
It's confusing as-

1895
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,400
Question.

1896
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,680
Stages and levels.

1897
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:14,780
So yeah, the first 10 episodes of the show were released.

1898
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,200
Go find them there.

1899
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,960
You can buy them on iTunes, Amazon, Google.

1900
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:19,960
Streaming.

1901
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:24,840
I believe you can find them streaming on the Cartoon Network site.

1902
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:30,920
I do have to have a cable login for that, I think, but fuck you, it's worth it.

1903
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:37,120
And there will be more, that's all I can say, that there will be more Infinity Train, I

1904
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,040
can't say in what form, but please, please watch it.

1905
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,640
I'm very proud of that show and it is a dream to work on.

1906
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,640
Okay.

1907
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,640
And your Twitter?

1908
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:48,560
Oh, my Twitter, LindseyKati on all the social medias.

1909
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,880
And please, please, please, this is maybe the most important one.

1910
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:59,160
Please check out my work when I walk through behind the podcast and laugh.

1911
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:07,160
So keep an ear out for me being somewhere present in the room when you record the show.

1912
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,520
And shouting stuff when someone says something wrong.

1913
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,320
It's clear from all that, that you do so much more than live here, which is more than I

1914
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,320
can say about Edwin.

1915
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,320
Aw, he does a lot, how dare you?

1916
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,320
Look at, what is reality?

1917
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:22,320
Edwin is so terrible.

1918
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:27,160
He always seems a little nonplussed.

1919
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:32,120
We're doing the thing, as I'm saying, we're doing the thing that is not, Mike's doing

1920
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,840
the thing where he doesn't get to hang out with Mike.

1921
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,920
He stayed by my side this whole recording.

1922
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:36,920
Yes, he did.

1923
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,200
Yeah, the chair the entire time.

1924
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,200
You survived, Edwin.

1925
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,440
Good job.
