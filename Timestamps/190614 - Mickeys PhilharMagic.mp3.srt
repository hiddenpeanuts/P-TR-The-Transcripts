1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Warning, the following podcast is a wild character crossover featuring favorites like Donald Duck,

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:17,400
Mickey Mouse, Ariel, Garfield's girlfriend Arlene, Jeffy from the Family Circus, and that

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,000
incorrigible Nimgaloo.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All that plus the return of Souvenir Smackdown.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Will a bizarre new Disneyland wormhole be opened up?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Spoiler alert, yes.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's Mickey's Full Harmadge on Podcast the Ride.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:56,920
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, hosted by three grown men who love themselves a good animatronic

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,200
duck bottom.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,120
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Jason Sheridan.

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,840
Thanks for the boost on that one.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,240
Where is the lie?

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Where is the lie?

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
You know?

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,640
I mean, yeah, we loves what we loves and Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm here and what an edgy comment.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, I know.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,120
You said it in the most aggressive way possible.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,880
It would be that is saying that like, I think my mom who will be listening eventually to

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,680
this, she'll be like, that's cute.

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,120
She'll say like, that's nice.

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,840
That's the type of humors you would like more of.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Because we made it bottom and not.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Yeah.

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,960
Even rear would be too much.

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Even in quarters.

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,440
I just built up around Jason saying, what's the gist?

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,920
Something about an animatronic duck bottom?

31
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,520
I just liked that moment.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,240
Not the horniest part of the show.

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
You wouldn't?

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
You don't think so?

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,680
Of the Philharm Magic of today's topic.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Mickey's Full Harmadge.

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
We'll get to it.

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,920
I don't know what you mean or what your pursuit, what your.

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,880
OK, I'll just come out and say the palpable chemistry between Ariel and Donald Duck.

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Oh, yeah.

41
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
Very uncomfortable.

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
There is any between.

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,080
I think it's entirely one sided.

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,160
I think Donald's swimming after her.

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,720
He is horny, though.

46
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,080
Yeah, she's touching his face.

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
But she's not.

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,000
She's just being like, oh, you're a cute duck.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,040
She's not like.

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,240
But that song plays a little different when you sing it to someone.

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,520
That is a sounder to Donald, but she wants to be part of his duck world.

52
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm saying it.

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480
I don't think that played a little romantic for me.

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,440
Well, that's not the reason I have this.

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,320
Gadgets and gizmos are plenty.

56
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,640
Now, that joke is too far.

57
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,880
That's a little bit too suggestive.

58
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,520
Scott, I would appreciate if you would go back to the clean material.

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
No, I don't. I don't think we shouldn't.

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,920
We usually like to do a little ramp up to this, but no,

61
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
I don't think I think Ariel is just going about her business.

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,040
And she goes back around.

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Let's consider it here.

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,240
And then she like kind of pinches his little cheek.

65
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,320
And then she goes back to singing about wanting to be part of the human world.

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,840
That's my take, at least.

67
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,960
It felt like they were flirting.

68
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,720
It felt like new love.

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,120
I mean, he's into her.

70
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,320
I just don't think vice versa.

71
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,360
She's just charming naturally.

72
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,920
But I don't think she was wanting to express anything other than friendship.

73
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,000
To the duck, to this duck swimming around looking for his hat.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,840
You know, I wanted to see where it went.

75
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,400
He goes for the kiss and she moves out of the way.

76
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,400
She's performing.

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,760
But I'm saying like, there was art comes.

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
That's what I'm saying about the whole thing.

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,320
The whole entire thing is performance.

80
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,760
I see. Yeah.

81
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,000
Uh huh. She's a Hollywood phony.

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
All that affection isn't real.

83
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,240
She would have made every stripper I've ever been to.

84
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,520
She would have been to.

85
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,560
Now we're getting to some stuff.

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,800
She would have made out with Donald if she was into him at the end of the thing,

87
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,120
or at least kissed him on the lips or something.

88
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,720
Like some day I know a stripper will do with me.

89
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,720
Kiss you on the lips.

90
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,800
I'm going to kiss her and it's not going to be a

91
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,880
eel with lipstick.

92
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,280
Yeah. As up to Donald.

93
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,600
Up to this point, every strip club you've gone to, you like lean in for the kiss

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,560
and then like they move out of the way.

95
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,760
You end up kissing like the bouncer or something.

96
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,800
And then it's a big kerfuffle.

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,760
He does a big smooch.

98
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,920
It's like a like a Roman statue.

99
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,480
That's why they have those around.

100
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,120
And you get electrified by the taser he carries.

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,280
Yeah. And I've thrown out onto the street.

102
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,280
That's interesting. That's my life.

103
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,320
Few too many Chardonnays, pal.

104
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,680
Yeah. The bricks.

105
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Um, we're talking about Mickey's Philhar Magic, which is a 3D movie

106
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,440
that is a 4D movie, if you will,

107
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,560
that is in almost all of the Magic Kingdoms at this point.

108
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,880
Or not Magic Kingdom, not in California.

109
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,160
Oh, yeah. It's I'm sorry.

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,480
So it's in it's on almost every property.

111
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,000
It was at Disney World in 2003 and somehow didn't make it

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,840
into California Adventure until this very year.

113
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,680
This year, a few months ago on multiple continents.

114
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,000
I was shocked to learn that.

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,240
We're in Orlando, Anaheim, Paris and Hong Kong and Tokyo.

116
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,440
I passed by it there and did not go in.

117
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,920
That's a good way to save time.

118
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,760
Well, in Tokyo, too. I missed that.

119
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,480
I believe so. I think I saw.

120
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,000
I mean, I did not go in it and see it.

121
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,080
But yeah, it's a it's an attraction that, you know,

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,120
started at Disney World and came out of the gate fairly strong.

123
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,640
And I feel like was well regarded and replaced the much needed to be replaced.

124
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,120
Just a Lion King puppet show, which was probably very good when it opened.

125
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,760
But these things are in their course.

126
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,440
And it was, I think, fairly well regarded at the time.

127
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,600
And there were immediately rumors.

128
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,280
Well, does it make it out to to California?

129
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,600
Do they maybe put it into the Muppet Space,

130
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,200
which has been playing to a quarter of a crowd for many years?

131
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,320
And the answer was always no, they couldn't put it in there

132
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,120
because probably the big thing about the movie is that at some point

133
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,120
it goes black, the screen.

134
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,600
And then when you come back, the screen is much larger than it was before.

135
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,120
There's like a reveal of a mega screen,

136
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,480
which is a move a lot of these attractions do now.

137
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,560
It happens in the DreamWorks theater.

138
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,720
And so the answer is always, well, it couldn't come to the Muppet Theater

139
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,680
in Disneyland because it's not wide enough to do that.

140
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,280
And then all of a sudden, a couple of months ago, they're like,

141
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,920
and I remind us to put it in.

142
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,680
Yeah, this was like a the it's called the largest

143
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,200
purpose built 3D screen ever made at the time.

144
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,920
150 feet wide, I believe over 30 feet tall.

145
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,040
I didn't know how big it was. Wow. Yeah.

146
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,600
And it definitely wraps a lot more in Florida.

147
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,880
Bigger than T2 3D.

148
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,800
Not that you have screen dimensions in front of you,

149
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,560
but I'm trying to remember from having gone there.

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,040
I don't know if that's one consistent screen.

151
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,560
There's like big metal beams between.

152
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,480
This is the largest continuous screen. Interesting. OK.

153
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,760
Now in DCA, yes, they retrofit at the standard Muppet screen

154
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,480
and stuck some sideways DynX widescreen TVs on the walls

155
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,000
to kind of simulate a wrap around.

156
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,160
I think what if you aren't picking this up, listener,

157
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,800
we maybe were not thrilled with this experience.

158
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,000
I mean, the experience itself, because we all went down together

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,160
to see this, and it's probably very rare that we all experience

160
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,120
an attraction for the first time together as a unit.

161
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,680
And we had fun doing it.

162
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,760
But we sort of walked out quietly

163
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,720
and didn't discuss it much further,

164
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,080
which is probably what everyone else in the audience did.

165
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,360
It just sort of it landed with a little little thump.

166
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,440
And that was it.

167
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,680
I thought taken on its own.

168
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,400
The movie is is charming. Yeah.

169
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,680
And people had told us before, like, hey, if you're in the Magic Kingdom,

170
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,720
don't sleep on this. Like, don't skip it.

171
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,520
And I can see the appeal in its original iteration with the giant screen.

172
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,280
And I also have to say, I watched a couple

173
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,880
ride throughs of the Florida one and that Donald Duck Bottom

174
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,720
wiggles a lot more.

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,600
And the gag is a lot clearer in Florida.

176
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,200
And thus the audience is a lot hornier.

177
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,600
Yes, a lot hornier out here.

178
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,560
It felt a little more a statue that shifted a little.

179
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,280
And maybe you think maybe somebody's just up there shaking it around.

180
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,960
Shake it, just poking a broom at it.

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,720
Not even fully awake themselves, like a sleep in a chair and kind of like

182
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,880
kicking it with one leg.

183
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,120
Yeah, I the audience, it was not packed in there.

184
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,360
And as we left, I didn't get the sense of, oh, people going, wow,

185
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
like that was great or anything.

186
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,400
We all just sort of had a slow trudge to the exits.

187
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,520
And it was like, OK, great. OK, this is here.

188
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,480
At least they're using this for something other than just movie previews.

189
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,120
Yes. So that's good. Yeah.

190
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,600
But that aspect ratio. Uh huh.

191
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,400
Well, yeah. So we all sound like we came from a funeral.

192
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,640
It's not that bad.

193
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,960
It's not that bad.

194
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,920
Mainly I'm avoiding at the top of the episode, we're still in the first

195
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,720
10 minutes or so that we've just told people, like, so we're talking about

196
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
a boring thing we didn't like.

197
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,920
Yeah, we're all I feel like we got to like, get the positivity.

198
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,440
Yeah, I'll get I'll I do a positive stuff to say.

199
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,600
One, this is a nice.

200
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,560
I think it's it's fun to see the hits.

201
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,400
This is definitely you're seeing

202
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,120
the greatest hits from a lot of musical

203
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,600
90s Disney stuff, 90s and then Peter Pan and Fantasia also.

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,400
Which compared to like the more Broadway centric 90s songs,

205
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,800
the Peter Pan one kind of stuck out like,

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,840
you know, why suddenly do we go back in time? Yeah. Yeah.

207
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
I like seeing this.

208
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,240
It reminded me how much I liked these movies and I like these songs.

209
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,760
I think it's very funny.

210
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,760
The idea of like it's the some of our greatest songs through over the years.

211
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,360
And it's mostly Donald getting owned like Donald just getting his ass

212
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,160
kicked through movies.

213
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
I like that.

214
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,560
I less like that.

215
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,520
It's called Mickey's Philharmagic and he's barely in it.

216
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,840
It should be called Donald Duck's Philharmagic. Yeah.

217
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,360
Or Donald Ruins Mickey's Philharmagic.

218
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,320
I would disagree.

219
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,200
I think it's it is actually fun that it's a misdirect.

220
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,400
You think it's like you're going to see a concert that Mickey is going to conduct.

221
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,880
And then Donald fucks up and takes the hat and travels through IP.

222
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,960
He travels through other IP.

223
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,440
It's a great description of the plot.

224
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,760
Yeah. Donald takes a hat and sees IP in progress.

225
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,520
Development of the attraction, I think, is interesting.

226
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,480
This is one of the times that Imagineering has worked with another department in the company.

227
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,680
They worked with Walt Disney Animation to make this.

228
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,200
They got Glen Keane to do the animation for Ariel again.

229
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,120
Really? He supervised redoing it as in 3D.

230
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,200
And apparently this was his first time working with CGI.

231
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,240
And then after this, he went on to work on Tangled.

232
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,640
Oh, wow. I know.

233
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,160
Kidding. That's cool.

234
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,720
But we talk much about Glen Keane, the most who did

235
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,840
Ariel, who did Bell or the Beast.

236
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,000
He did the Beast.

237
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,400
And I'm sure I'm forgetting another big one.

238
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,720
But yeah, one of like one of the great animators of the late 80s, early 90s era.

239
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,720
But the thing I like about him is that he's the kid of the family circus.

240
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Keane artist. Yes. Bill Keane.

241
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,040
Bill Keane. So one of those kids is him.

242
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
He's Jeffy. Yeah, I guess he's Jeffy.

243
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,200
Could be Jeffy.

244
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,880
Scott, you did a very funny series many years ago.

245
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,840
Where you inserted a drawing of yourself into Family Circus.

246
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,160
Scott meets Family Circus dot Tumblr dot com.

247
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,600
That was a Tumblr I did.

248
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,080
It was very funny and mean.

249
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,040
Like you like all the gag is you show up and you're mean to the family circus kids.

250
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,400
If you took you take one because it's just a one panel circus frame.

251
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,440
So I added a second, which in many cases was me adding a punchline

252
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,000
that was not previously there in a punchline free script.

253
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,120
But yeah, I was mainly just like correcting the kids.

254
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,240
That's how it started was just like it's pronounced spaghetti, not just being

255
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,040
just being helpful.

256
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,440
And then it became then I started within the world of this having sex with the mom.

257
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,280
I was breaking up the family circus,

258
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,120
which now I realize is animator Glenn Keane's mom.

259
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,120
How you are having sex with Glenn Keane's mom.

260
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,440
I made a comic, a fan comic where I have sex with Glenn Keane's mom.

261
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,920
You were cuckolding.

262
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,280
Yeah.

263
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,680
In a literal sense.

264
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,040
Yeah.

265
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,520
Mr. Keane.

266
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,880
The actual illustrator now deceased of the family circus.

267
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,360
Yeah.

268
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,000
I boy, this is a bad one for Mrs.

269
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,840
Carlson if she's sorry.

270
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,040
It's got I don't know.

271
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,680
Look, there's no way she understands.

272
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,280
There's no way those the kids with the little lines that they leave behind,

273
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,280
those dashes that you follow, the grandparents who are ghosts.

274
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,320
Like, I think we've all had enough of family circus.

275
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

276
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,680
It felt fun to come in and be a little a little combative.

277
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,360
And but also, I mean, the admittedly, the the plot with the wife was kind of

278
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,760
because I was like, she's got all she's kind of got going on.

279
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,680
Yeah, I was.

280
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,720
She I don't remember what the dad just is kind of like,

281
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,120
like just a regular kind of frumpy glasses dad.

282
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,040
And then the wife's kind of like a hot 60s lady.

283
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,400
Yeah.

284
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,360
So what's the name?

285
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,040
Is it Helen or anything?

286
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,240
Could we look at it?

287
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,640
I don't know.

288
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:54,960
I know.

289
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,200
That's a good question.

290
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,920
Family.

291
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,480
Oh, God, I bet it is.

292
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
Family circus mom.

293
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,600
What's her name?

294
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,240
Thel.

295
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,760
Oh, her name is Thel.

296
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,960
Is it true for Thelma?

297
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,840
Thel's a pretty good name, honestly.

298
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,320
Cool.

299
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,880
Yeah.

300
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,920
Thelma Karnke.

301
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,800
Yeah, right.

302
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,000
So it passes Thel and test.

303
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
She has an interest.

304
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, another great thing to put on a list of great qualities

305
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,160
about battle.

306
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,360
Thel does sound like a replicant from Blade Runner,

307
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,640
like Deckard's after Thel.

308
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,800
It's like a girl in Tron.

309
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,440
Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

310
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,400
I am Thel.

311
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,480
Wasn't I'm a thousand years old.

312
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,520
There was a period where we were trying to think of you

313
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,480
playing Jeffy in a family circus movie.

314
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,000
Am I wrong?

315
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,440
I mean, look, I got to work.

316
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,400
Hashtag Jason for Jeffy.

317
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,520
Jason for Jeffy.

318
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,000
Jeffy all grown up.

319
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,280
I would like to river.

320
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,800
No, no, no, no.

321
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,560
No.

322
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,080
Oh, you want the classic.

323
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,880
I want you to play him as a six year old.

324
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,760
I do think family circus.

325
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,080
All the comic strips are right for the Riverdale treatment.

326
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Oh, my God.

327
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, you want to see.

328
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,560
I don't know if I think you want to see them grown and

329
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,880
again, let's say horny and mysteries and cults.

330
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,840
And yeah, I don't know.

331
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,560
High and Lowis, maybe family.

332
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,080
Dagwood.

333
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,280
No, Dagwood.

334
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,400
Like Dagwood, like a blood Dagwood means bloodline.

335
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,920
Heathcliff. Yes.

336
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,400
Crank Shaft. Yes.

337
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,880
Lock.

338
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,640
Beetle Bailey.

339
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,240
Lock horns. Lock horns.

340
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Yes. OK.

341
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,000
Family circus.

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,520
Foxtrot. Foxtrot.

343
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,360
Right there.

344
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Foxtrot is right ready to go.

345
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,600
Mark Trail. Yes.

346
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,080
Yeah. They've got to grow up someday, though.

347
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
And sure.

348
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,560
Mark Trail would be awesome.

349
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,640
A CW Mark Trail would kick ass.

350
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,200
I would like I would like another Garf.

351
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
I would like a Garfield movie played straight.

352
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
Like we were talking about straight.

353
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,840
What do you mean?

354
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,000
I want a Garfield movie that's good.

355
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
I want a good Garfield movie that looks like the comic strips.

356
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,040
But you mean played straight like no jokes.

357
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,320
No, like not live action with the CGI.

358
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,120
Like I want like an animated.

359
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,120
I want an animated Garfield.

360
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,840
You want an all animated Garfield played like the played like the comic strips

361
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,720
once in a while.

362
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,880
Funny comic strip.

363
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,760
Yeah. Yeah.

364
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,000
Occasionally, maybe once 20 years ago.

365
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,800
I don't feel like the problem was ever with the Garfield movies.

366
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,480
Of all the problems you could have with it, I never felt like not capturing

367
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,040
the tone of the comic was one of them.

368
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,080
I'm interested in what you were thinking, like what your Garfield movie would be.

369
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,600
I don't know. It just kind of came to me like

370
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,800
you just feel like we haven't had a good representation.

371
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,160
Do you want to see the barn that barnyard gang to like from the com?

372
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,720
Is that what more you're thinking of like the cartoon Garfield?

373
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,200
Yeah, I thought the cartoon did capture pretty well.

374
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,680
And it had the full supporting cast with

375
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,320
Arlene, Arlene and Nermal, Nermal,

376
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,880
John's girlfriend.

377
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah. I don't remember if she was actually in it.

378
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,000
I didn't like that barnyard gang, though.

379
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,760
You did or you didn't? Didn't. Really? Yeah, really.

380
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,880
I think I did like them.

381
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,880
I like the idea that a show would have like a second.

382
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,480
Well, I get bored with the main stories of almost every show, so I like it.

383
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,200
All right. And then there's another thing going on.

384
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,760
I was uninterested in them.

385
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,520
But if you're if you're going to ask me if I liked Heathcliff's Cadillac cats,

386
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,720
which I know the hell, yes, I did.

387
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,640
All four. I love those guys the best.

388
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
I didn't give a shit about Heathcliff.

389
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,160
I wanted the Cadillac cats.

390
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,320
I wanted to riff raff and Hector and the other one.

391
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,800
I think I probably I may have never encountered these cats.

392
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,400
That's how much I hated just the intro of Heathcliff.

393
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,640
The song Heathcliff, it's the best theme song.

394
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,440
No, I hate that song. What?

395
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,680
This cannot be a first opinion.

396
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,160
Anyone? I've never heard that before.

397
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,680
That's really a good song.

398
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,520
I think I don't like fifties.

399
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,360
I don't like doo woppy, especially like down in the 80s doo wop.

400
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,320
That's a great theme song.

401
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,920
Heathcliff annoys me for this is this has been raised on the doughboys.

402
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,360
I forget where they fall on it.

403
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,720
Well, the comic strip is nonsensical.

404
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,200
It doesn't make any sense.

405
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,560
It's less about the cartoon.

406
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,760
The cartoon. Yeah, because the comic strip, if you even read it,

407
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,520
whoever is making it still or if it's just a rehash, it's nothing.

408
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,880
It doesn't make any sense.

409
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
So you liked the cartoon or you didn't like.

410
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,160
I didn't like the Heathcliff part of the cartoon.

411
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160
I love the Cadillac cats part because they lived in the junkyard.

412
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,840
They were very cool.

413
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,120
And riff raff had a car that transformed.

414
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,960
It was like he could make it into like a living space.

415
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,840
He could make it into a cool like Cadillac of some kind.

416
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,000
I truly am seeing the Cadillac cats for the first time ever as we speak.

417
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,160
Really? And observation number one,

418
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,200
horniness, a theme in this episode.

419
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,360
Well, he had a hot girl.

420
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,920
He was a tiny little cat and he had a very tall, sexy girl.

421
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,440
Short kings unite.

422
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,640
So his little like Dom DeLauise had a scarf.

423
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,960
And how does he land a girl twice his size?

424
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
He was that cool.

425
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,800
And also, this is the thing people complain about, that everything is sexist.

426
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,120
Confidence.

427
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,400
Because like it's like Lola Bunny or we've talked about this before, where

428
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,720
the cartoons, like the male cartoon is like a dumpy.

429
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,960
Looks like an animal.

430
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,840
I'm actually going to take the other angle on this and say that

431
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,080
it's heightest to go like, how did he get her?

432
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,000
In this case, in the Cadillac cat.

433
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,480
All right. Fair enough.

434
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,640
There's a lot of unfair judgments put on shorter men in society.

435
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,040
I believe that to be true.

436
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,880
So I see what you're saying.

437
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,160
I'm looking at a picture of the whole gang, of the other half of it, too.

438
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,320
And Heathcliff has a Heathcliff is with his exact equivalent.

439
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,120
And then Cadillac cat is with somebody twice his size.

440
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,080
I guess I should not be heightest about this, but they're

441
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
that pairing is a lot stranger.

442
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,280
I'll tell you that.

443
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,040
Well, I think you would like the Cadillac cat.

444
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,440
Yeah, character and confidence goes a long way.

445
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,120
Stuff do they get up to?

446
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
They're like up to no good a lot.

447
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,480
Like not nothing, I think, too, too dangerous.

448
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,840
But there's like they're like hot characters in this show and they're up to no good.

449
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,080
And you liked it.

450
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,360
Yeah, believe it or not.

451
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,880
I think it was a lot of having to do with the transforming car.

452
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,560
I think I like that he had like kind of a transformer type car.

453
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,600
And I thought I thought Hector specifically, which is the one with the tie.

454
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,320
I thought he looked cool and I wanted to like look like Hector.

455
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,200
And I liked Riff Raff's hat.

456
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,640
Why are you wearing a Dom Delahue's hat all the time?

457
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,680
I guess I should. I guess I should age into that.

458
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,160
It's your style. Or captain's hat.

459
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,200
Yeah, or captain's hat.

460
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,320
You should be a jughead hat.

461
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,440
Yeah, yeah, a lot of options.

462
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,760
We should put it up to a vote.

463
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,000
What kind of hat should Jason wear?

464
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,720
Could we talk just about Cadillac cats for the rest of the episode?

465
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,280
That's fine, because clearly we don't have a lot to say about.

466
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,640
That's why I like some of the some of these episodes,

467
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,400
there's the too many things episodes where we are all stressed.

468
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,920
We have to jam it all in.

469
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,880
I kind of like these ones where like I feel like we have open

470
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,720
landscape to talk about whatever the cat like.

471
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,560
Let's check in with how each other are doing,

472
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,200
because I don't have a lot to say about.

473
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,320
I feel like you're coming in with a bad attitude, though.

474
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,480
Maybe I am. Maybe I am.

475
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,480
It's to be fair, it's more about the jamming it into California Adventure

476
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,120
and less about because I did walk out of the Disney World one

477
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,440
whenever I saw it like a decade ago, thinking that that ain't bad.

478
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:18,000
At the time, it was interesting to see the characters converted into 3D.

479
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes, that would have been very important thing to note that maybe you haven't.

480
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,920
Now, of course, 3D, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast and Lion King

481
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,360
are all that we live for and talk about.

482
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,920
But yes, these are the new classic canon of today.

483
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,280
But at the time to see actually the very first one you see,

484
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,040
especially because when you're not you're not sure where the attraction is going.

485
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,400
And I think the big reveal of the big screen and what all of it is,

486
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,680
is when Donald is like there's just like a candlelight and it's dark otherwise.

487
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,760
And Donald's like, huh.

488
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
And then there's more light and it is Lumiere.

489
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,280
And then you get the 3D Fide to be our guest.

490
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Yes. So seeing it like, oh, I see.

491
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,480
So it's going to kind of step you through these great moments

492
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,360
and in a new dimension.

493
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
That's kind of fun.

494
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,440
And I did like it when I when I first saw it.

495
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,960
Did not read as well on this because it just seemed like.

496
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,720
And now we're using all of the normal size movie screen.

497
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,520
Yeah, I think. Did they start using all of it?

498
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
At some point, they switched to all of it.

499
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,160
Well, that's the problem.

500
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,440
And you know what? I did.

501
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,760
I looked it up and it's the same thing that happened in Paris,

502
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,800
where it only went in.

503
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,280
They only put in PhilharMagic in October 2018. Right.

504
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,280
And I watched a video of it and it's the same aspect ratio.

505
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,680
It's the same cut.

506
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,480
So if we had to explain this,

507
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,560
if you see it in Florida, there's a there's a really nice

508
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,240
frame with like musical instruments, golden and there's musical instruments on it.

509
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,200
And when the part of the show happens, we're going to watch a concert

510
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,480
that Mickey is conducting.

511
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,560
It fills up that whole screen and then everything goes dark.

512
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,520
And then it comes back up and there's a much, much bigger screen.

513
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,480
Big reveal. Really cool in Paris and in California Adventure.

514
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,680
They have reduced the screen with digital curtains.

515
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,160
So we're just not using all of the screens.

516
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,040
And the big reveal is, oh, they're using almost the whole screen

517
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,560
because still, for a lot of it, at least for be our guest,

518
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,920
there's just like a black bar at the top.

519
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,080
So it's like a letter boxed.

520
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,520
It's so strange.

521
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,600
I was like, they letter boxed it twice almost like

522
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,080
we were trying. You're trying to figure out the numbers.

523
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,000
I was saying it's two thirds of one one eight five one

524
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,680
divide one eight five one into thirds

525
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,200
to multiply by two.

526
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,120
You need an equation. It's an un-pioneered aspect ratio.

527
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,120
Is there a plus up way for them to have done this?

528
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,720
Because obviously putting these in these theaters are just quick fixes.

529
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,960
There's specifically California Adventure, like this theater.

530
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,880
All of this area will be redeveloped within the next five years, I'm assuming.

531
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,000
We see something right.

532
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,360
That it's all tied, I think, to the Eastern Gateway, which will come back soon.

533
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,760
That's my prediction.

534
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,360
That's what I explained the Eastern Gateway.

535
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,160
Yeah, it's basically the that we're going to build a parking garage

536
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,400
on the other side of harbor with a bridge.

537
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,400
They were going to shrink sort of the entryway into California Adventure

538
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,920
because you would go through security over on the other side of harbor

539
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,320
by the parking garage.

540
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,520
And then Anaheim, of course, when there was a less friendly government said,

541
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,880
don't do that, it'll choke all the businesses on harbor because you'll just

542
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,200
you put a bridge over harbor and made it inaccessible from the resort.

543
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
And they said, Elysium rules.

544
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,880
The rich people go above.

545
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,520
And Disney, instead of saying, oh, well, we'll just make a little walkway to harbor.

546
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,880
They said, fuck you.

547
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,160
We will not build this the way we wanted.

548
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,280
And then that because they they pulled that, then they lose a lot of real estate

549
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,920
that they were going to be able to develop out into the Esplanade.

550
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,600
I see. So there would have been like it would have.

551
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,800
California Adventure can then like bleed into the Esplanade more

552
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,640
because it's going to be a very narrow or a much more narrow walkway into

553
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,560
or into the main hub of Disneyland.

554
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,240
So the main thing is we it's been rumored for a long time that, I mean,

555
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,760
already some some Marvel is going in.

556
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,840
We lost Bugs Land and we lost it's tough to be a bug.

557
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,440
But presumably more Marvel will end up in that Hollywood area.

558
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,160
How much is the question? Right.

559
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,160
And it's and this this sort of dull on its face

560
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,480
parking bridge issue impacts that ultimately.

561
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,720
Or the expansion area behind Cars Land.

562
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,240
I think you can build out into that.

563
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,080
Yeah. And there's there's one behind the tower that they were going to

564
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,640
supposedly build the Avengers coaster, which who knows?

565
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,680
We haven't heard what is going on with that.

566
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,600
Or if they just say, fuck it, we're imploding that Alpine Hotel

567
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,280
that's right on the property.

568
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,120
Y'all had your chance.

569
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,640
Just like they just invade it and drone strike it.

570
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,760
And that's their that's their property now.

571
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,080
Like they have a new fireworks show and they aim the fireworks at the hotel

572
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,160
and blow it up. Oh, whoops, whoops.

573
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,360
Made a mistake.

574
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,120
Yeah, the way they put this into DCA and I I I don't mean to just say

575
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,360
I didn't mean to imply that just you had a bad attitude, Scott,

576
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,640
because my reaction to the execution of this would be described as,

577
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,160
well, this feels a little craven like this

578
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,560
because they put up the posters of like the fake.

579
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,360
There's a bunch of fake movie posters as you walk in and those are cute.

580
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,200
Like Jeannie sings the blues or like Hades, a character

581
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,080
they can never have the same actor do the voice again because he's a lunatic.

582
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Like there was a poster with why not? Who is that now?

583
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,680
I don't know, because he's been censored by all the social media networks.

584
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,280
Yeah, so there was like fake

585
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,320
posters for musical acts with your favorite Disney friends.

586
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,040
And that led to a pre-show area that was just some more

587
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,040
cheapy flat screen TVs not really showing anything.

588
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:06,800
And good point in Florida, that pre-show area doesn't seem to have much either,

589
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,600
but at least they have some fake chandeliers and stuff like you're going into a concert hall.

590
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,840
Right. There's a little more because it was built for it.

591
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,760
But the real thing was the entryway sign. Yes.

592
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,560
You notice this?

593
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:26,520
Well, I would call it the most pixelated logo anywhere in a Disney park.

594
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,040
If you just look at the like, I think

595
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,760
if you go to California Adventure, look at that sign that used to be it used to say,

596
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,360
sadly, I'm up at Vision 3D and now it's a Philharmonic sign.

597
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,600
And just look up at Donald.

598
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,680
Donald looks like a not fully rendered PlayStation 2 character.

599
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,240
He Donald needs more polygons.

600
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,720
Yeah, it's I guess really I am cutting it some slack because it's better than nothing.

601
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,160
And it's been what was literally in there before?

602
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,400
Was it a preview of a wrinkle in time?

603
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,560
I think for three years they were showing five minutes of a wrinkle in time.

604
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,960
There was also the Pixar short film festivals.

605
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,120
They were running a bunch of Pixar short film festivals for a little while.

606
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,560
It was the Frozen sing along.

607
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,240
And then Nutcracker Four Realms was also the previous three years

608
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,640
had been a preview of Nutcracker in the four realms.

609
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,560
Boy, these Disney previews.

610
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,160
This has been quite an era. Yeah.

611
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,200
So this is I'm cutting it slack for that reason,

612
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,400
because it is absolutely better than those things.

613
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,360
It definitely is.

614
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,400
And I think if they had just done this five years ago, I feel like.

615
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,200
Sure. Yeah.

616
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,520
I think it's just so strange that suddenly and any fellow nerds listening

617
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,160
maybe caught this happening that like Mickey's Philharmonic opening in three weeks.

618
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,120
And we all went, what? Why? Right.

619
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,320
And I guess the idea being, well, let's just jam every corner of California.

620
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,680
California Adventure was stuff.

621
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,600
So to maybe pull out some crowds might be gone to Star Wars.

622
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,680
The name of the game is Galaxy's Edge alternatives.

623
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,800
We should also say we're recording this.

624
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,320
This will likely come out after we've been in Galaxy's Edge.

625
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,160
So we should say like, we're not the same people that we will be.

626
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,520
No, our voices are going to sound different.

627
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,160
Yeah, it's going to. Yeah, it'll be like sort of a post like acid trip

628
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,720
where you're different forever. Right.

629
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,760
So this will be the last.

630
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,040
This will be the last artifact of us before.

631
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,480
Unless or the change, unless we somehow have

632
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,000
we're so disappointed by it that we think Mickey's

633
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,800
Pharma magic was better, who is better than the Falcon.

634
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,600
What world?

635
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I can't even imagine that world, but maybe that's right.

636
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,800
Maybe we will say, you know what? The Falcon sucked.

637
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,440
If the ride breaks and like sprays oil at us, then maybe if we're disfigured.

638
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,520
That would be the most eventful thing that ever happened to me at a theme park.

639
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,480
So I'd be excited for that to happen.

640
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,680
Plus like it is for story.

641
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,520
What a story.

642
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,440
Plus you'd ring out your clothes and hey, free oil.

643
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,160
Hey, free oil.

644
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,840
You know what hydraulic fluid goes for nowadays?

645
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,760
Jason rung out a glass of hydraulic fluid and into a glass after the ride.

646
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,960
And he's coming up. He's coming. He's winning.

647
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm ahead. He's ahead.

648
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,000
That's what I meant to say. You keep it in the fridge to like,

649
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,560
yeah, oil up any rusty gadgets you got around the house.

650
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,360
Yeah, I have a lot of like Wayne Zelinsky style

651
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,280
doodads and gadgets. Breakfast machines.

652
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,880
Yeah, breakfast machines.

653
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,640
Sausage shooters.

654
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,000
Dressing tie tying machines.

655
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,520
Yeah. So the Fjällharm magic.

656
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,760
It's it's it's better.

657
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,520
Yeah, it's better. It's glad it's there.

658
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,480
It's better. Yeah, it's like

659
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,720
it's clearly we're just like throw this in.

660
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,960
We got to do something.

661
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,240
What movie do we have lying around? We had that idea.

662
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,320
Yeah, that was a bad idea back then. But whatever.

663
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,360
It's better than nothing.

664
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,920
Is it really going to draw anyone away from Disneyland?

665
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,120
No, not currently.

666
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,760
It's not drawing anyone now.

667
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,840
I mean, it's a new thing that there's probably West Coast people

668
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,240
that have not seen it.

669
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,440
Families will probably I mean, there'll probably be kids and families

670
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,880
who like it, although the audiences that we were with seemed a little checked out.

671
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,000
Yeah. Yeah. We did get sprayed with water a lot.

672
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,680
They were leaning on the water sprays.

673
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,280
Yeah. A little too much isn't always a Disney thing.

674
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,480
And I like that.

675
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,680
I like that maybe I'm not sprayed on a Disney ride with water or hydraulic fluid.

676
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,000
The best I maybe this is a full two and a half hour episode,

677
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,040
but the best water spray in a Disney park.

678
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,120
I'll decide it now.

679
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,800
Sinbad in Tokyo. Oh, I don't even remember a spray.

680
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,880
You go into the after you're out of the village, when they say goodbye,

681
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,400
you go into like a dark area and there's a storm and you get a little mist.

682
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,280
Oh, that's right. Right before.

683
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,600
And it's so great.

684
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,720
It's more pleasant than other ones.

685
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,920
I think we still went.

686
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,080
Sure. But if we have to say the best.

687
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,040
Yeah, yeah, I guess it would be.

688
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,400
I can think of a better water mist or spray Disney experience.

689
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,000
It's not I mean, well, it's something to I think the worst one is the one

690
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,440
I did in the fake Soren in Canada, where it's a sprayed Aaron and I

691
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,160
and a ruiner contact for the rest of the day.

692
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,840
Not these. That's not what we had to go Disney.

693
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,920
I mean, you can say sprays, best best spray or

694
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,080
I guess you could say like putting your hand out for the water on Big Thunder,

695
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,080
because then you can control the amount of water you're getting.

696
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,120
We hate that, too. Really? Yeah.

697
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,800
Every time we you'll our star go to reaction is.

698
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,320
Ah, OK. It's always it for us.

699
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,240
So you tell if you tell me you like one, I'll say, ah, or not.

700
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,840
And I'll probably say, ah, I've got one that always makes me laugh,

701
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,080
but it's at Universal and it's at the end of the Jurassic Park.

702
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,640
No one's following my rules for this exercise.

703
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,120
It's too limiting.

704
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,000
At the Jurassic Park boat ride at the end, when you are pulling back into the queue,

705
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,720
one of the spitter dinosaurs pops up when you think it's over

706
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,680
and like hits some people with a spray.

707
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,360
I'll say I'll say everyone. That's an a for me.

708
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,720
It's a funny because people if people aren't looking and aren't expecting it,

709
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
they think the ride's over.

710
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,880
I felt very fortunate as a tour guide.

711
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,160
One of the most unpleasant sprays is on the tram tour in Hollywood,

712
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,560
where spoiler alert, when you pass by some, you know, three

713
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,000
Jurassic Park jeeps, then in the bushes, some spitters spit at you.

714
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,440
And as a tour guide, I was the only person with a window blocking me from this.

715
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,200
So I never had to worry about it.

716
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,960
And everybody else was a sucker.

717
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,640
Would you consider the old it's gone now,

718
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,920
but the mist where you would see Captain Barbosa on Pirates of the Caribbean?

719
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,880
No, that's fine.

720
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,680
That was not so thick that it like stayed on me or anything. Right.

721
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,720
Yes. That would that felt so like intangible.

722
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,680
And so maybe that's your favorite.

723
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,560
If you consider that, I just don't think that's even a spray.

724
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,600
It's so little of a spray.

725
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,960
I don't know if you can call it a spray.

726
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,360
You're right. It's not a surprise.

727
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,480
One's probably.

728
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Soren doesn't have any water.

729
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,280
No, thankfully, no water.

730
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,640
It's obviously Splash Mountain.

731
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,000
You get soaked, depending on where you are. Sure.

732
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,840
But yeah, I guess you would call this spray.

733
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,920
So is there a tough to be a bug one? Probably.

734
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,800
Yeah, I think so, but I don't remember where it is.

735
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,600
Uh, the T one million exploding is a spray at the end of T2 3D.

736
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,160
There's not a ton at Disney, though.

737
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,320
No universal every ride.

738
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,160
So we couldn't do a final four or there'd only be four if we did it.

739
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,800
Yeah, we'd have to do it universal.

740
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,840
We'd have to add universal in.

741
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,880
Copy vision.

742
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,520
Yeah, I like it. OK, when Foggy does Fossey.

743
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,080
Foggy, Foggy Bear.

744
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,840
Foggy bottoms. I've been misspeaking a lot today, too.

745
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,600
He does that. Doesn't he do the flower?

746
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,480
He you get a little flower.

747
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,840
That one's fine. They didn't go overboard with it.

748
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,440
OK, just a little bit. Yeah.

749
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,000
But this felt like universe this the application of it in this felt universal.

750
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,440
It felt like too much water.

751
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,360
I think because they do it in the two sequence.

752
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,800
So so just chronologically, there's a whole big intro where they're not ready.

753
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,600
And Mickey yells at Don't like we're not ready.

754
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,280
Like, Donald, don't touch my hat like they're going to get ready for a concert.

755
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,680
Donald, of course, touches my fucking eye of the star.

756
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,520
And also not to side check you for telling the story too much,

757
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,800
but before that, in the pre show and then while you're sitting,

758
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,360
just a lot of business of like, we're almost ready.

759
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,600
We're polishing the brass.

760
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,040
Yeah, not a thing you usually hear at a professional performing environment.

761
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,400
Yes, at a stately opera.

762
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,680
People are not assuring you that the opera is going to happen.

763
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,680
And it's not very professional.

764
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,640
And it's not fun like Muppet Vision pre show banter.

765
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,120
No, great little bits and stuff.

766
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,840
This is just the Disney characters assuring you that they will be ready soon.

767
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,320
And all doing very like workman like jobs.

768
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,320
Right.

769
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,920
Mickey gets to conduct and thus many Donald and Goofy have all been deployed

770
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,960
as his personal assistants.

771
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,600
They're all fetching him waters.

772
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,000
Yes, it's weird.

773
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,640
Yeah.

774
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,760
And this this has like a literal hat on a hat because Mickey is both a conductor,

775
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,800
but has the sorcerer's apprentice hat at his disposal as well.

776
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,080
Yes, he's now the pupil is now the master.

777
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,800
Yeah.

778
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,920
And he is in the mold of the sorcerer.

779
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,160
And thus and so now when he conducts,

780
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,280
because he steals the hat to conduct and now it's both.

781
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,960
Now he's but he has permission.

782
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,360
He killed the sorcerer.

783
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,560
The sorcerer is dead.

784
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,040
Right. He slayed him.

785
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,360
And now the hat is his.

786
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,920
Yeah. Yen said is in hell or at least some sort of limbo.

787
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,280
Oh, that's right. His name is Yen said.

788
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,680
Yeah.

789
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,880
Anybody can you listening at home who doesn't know that fact already?

790
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,400
Know what you said is if you reverse it, it's the name of the one true God.

791
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,840
It's the Illuminati.

792
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,720
They're trying to communicate with us.

793
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,880
Yeah. OK.

794
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,840
So, yes, the sorcerer's apprentice, the events, the sorcerer's apprentice are done.

795
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,640
And we're not talking Jay Baruchel sorcerer's apprentice.

796
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,480
We're talking original.

797
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,320
Oh, gee. That vaguely with the cage.

798
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,080
Yeah. Wow.

799
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,680
I only know this because I want all this Disney promotional company.

800
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,360
I edited Facebook content.

801
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,240
And I remember I might have said this on the show already, but I just remember a lot.

802
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,240
Nicholas Cage rambling, prattling on about

803
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,960
I also think about playing Balthazar.

804
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,480
You know, you got to remember Balthazar is real.

805
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,200
That's a good cage.

806
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Hey, thanks. That's only that's my cage keyword is Balthazar.

807
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,840
Oh, man. Here's something to recommend.

808
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,240
The the Blu Ray for Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse

809
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,640
has making of feature X that feature both

810
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,640
a Nick Cage talking about the movie because he's Spider-Man noir.

811
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,240
And a very old Avi Arad Arad Arad Arad Arad.

812
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,960
Avi Arad. Yeah.

813
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:06,200
A long time Marvel producer, but bought Marvel when he was a toy biz with like Perlmutter.

814
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,480
Yeah. And still has producer credits on like the Spider-Man movies, at least.

815
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,440
Maybe the X-Men ones.

816
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,200
And I believe he's a maniac.

817
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,360
Yeah, him and Cage are out of it.

818
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,520
And he's like behind the scenes things.

819
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,400
And just hearing the cage go like, my Spider-Man's a little rougher.

820
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,320
He fit right in with Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade, Raymond Chandler.

821
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,160
I was watching a clip of Nick Cage from the Superman Lives costume fitting last night.

822
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,440
And he's going on and on about Superman and what he's going to do.

823
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,800
And he's in the outfit.

824
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
And I looked it up. He was 33.

825
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,720
And I lost my mind.

826
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,160
Like how younger than us?

827
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,600
Yes, younger than all of us.

828
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,000
And he's weathered already.

829
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,080
He's got that voice.

830
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,960
And you're like, oh, my God, we should be happy then.

831
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,240
You're not so weathered, I guess.

832
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,360
I'm downright boyish compared to Nick Cage at 33 trying on weird Superman.

833
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:08,240
I hear a Nick Cage now go like the movie just goes to show that anyone can be Spider-Man.

834
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,760
It's very fun.

835
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,240
That sounds good.

836
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,080
What are we saying that we're like, OK, everybody's doing grunt work for Mickey.

837
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,480
So he can put on a little music show.

838
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,520
Donald starts fucking with the magical hat and the orchestra, the magical instruments go insane.

839
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,600
Well, we've missed we've lost over that that when preparing for the show,

840
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,520
Donald has to take all the all the lots of instruments out of a bag.

841
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,720
And then those do those come to life and perform rather than musicians being there.

842
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,080
Thus, once again, nobody's getting paid.

843
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,800
This has got to be Skirting Seven Union rule.

844
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,120
There's like 78 people in an orchestra all not making their salary because he's just going straight to the instruments.

845
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,480
Mickey, you're a bad employer.

846
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,240
Your theater should be shut down.

847
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,280
Yeah, that's got to be against some like musicians equity or something.

848
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,400
Yeah. Yeah.

849
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,240
Support musicians.

850
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,680
Do not automate orchestras with magic.

851
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,040
Yeah, that is a cause for you to take up.

852
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,200
I think. Yeah, it's important.

853
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,800
So so yeah, then.

854
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,480
All right. So Donald puts on the hat and then they all.

855
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,440
They all start. They start playing Mickey Mouse's theme song.

856
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,680
Another great thing.

857
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,680
What if I get a lot of instruments together and what if I get instruments together and I'm a play my song?

858
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,920
Yeah. And then I'll go home.

859
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,200
That seems to be what his plan is with the show.

860
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:40,160
Donald, as we know from the theme song from the opening of the Mickey Mouse Club, hates the Mickey Mouse song more than anything.

861
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,480
Donald Duck, he tries to say.

862
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,200
He's mad. He's jealous of Mickey's fame.

863
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,880
And he doesn't have a song.

864
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,760
But no, he has a song, but he is he's even mad at his own song.

865
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,160
Yeah, but no one but Donald Duck.

866
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,440
Why? He's still like still mad.

867
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
He's very much Sally area in this.

868
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,600
Would you consider this? Would you consider Disco Duck his song?

869
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,240
No, that's not related to him.

870
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,960
That's still again more people stealing.

871
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,280
That is not an official Disney movie.

872
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,480
Yeah, he's just doing what he's doing a Donald Duck voice.

873
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,160
Yeah. Yeah, he was the original Mickey, not crediting musicians properly.

874
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,760
Hmm, too bad.

875
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,600
So all of that happens and then and then the instruments go crazy.

876
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,040
Yeah, they attack him.

877
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,760
And then you you do go to that moment I like where it is black and then the flame comes up and it's Lumiere.

878
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,760
And they're starting strong. It's a great song. Be our guest. Great song.

879
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,600
That animator came back as well.

880
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,160
Oh, really?

881
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,840
Nick Ranieri.

882
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,160
Really?

883
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,760
Came back to do Lumiere.

884
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,720
Oh, but you know who didn't come back for any of it?

885
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,400
The voices of the actors or of the characters.

886
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,720
Yeah.

887
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,920
Clearly, it's all just original audio.

888
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,640
Oh, yes.

889
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,240
And a lot of Donald is original audio.

890
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,800
Right.

891
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,440
Oh, yeah.

892
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,720
Of Clarence Nash of the original voice of Donald.

893
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,320
You can hear the audio recording.

894
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,800
Like the quality is poorer, like especially on like some of his yells.

895
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,040
You can hear it's like a clip from the 60s or something.

896
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,080
The current voice actor only recorded five new lines for this.

897
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,720
Everything else was like old stock.

898
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,480
Probably Disney pays by the line.

899
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,240
And they're like, we can only we only have $500 for him. $100 a line.

900
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,920
So when Donald's humming be our guest, that's new guy.

901
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,400
Right.

902
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,600
Okay. If it refers to something explicitly happening, but if it's just like,

903
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,840
Here's my problem with this show in general. It's just the recordings from the movies.

904
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,280
Donald doesn't really interact that much.

905
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,840
He is just in the background of these famous scenes getting hit or owned or whatever you

906
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,960
want to call it.

907
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,280
Sure.

908
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,480
A lot of fun to be had with Donald singing along or getting into like some sort of

909
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,280
altercation with like Lumiere, the main characters.

910
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,840
There's a lot of fun I feel like you could have with Donald getting in there and really

911
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,440
messing the songs up or something.

912
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,760
I like the brooms hitting him with water in a row.

913
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,200
I like some of the stuff, but it's really just you're watching a

914
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,000
CGI version of a song you know, while a picture in picture little thing happens with Donald.

915
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,120
An unrelated story.

916
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:26,960
Unrelated story in the promise of if you pitched me, Donald goes through Disney history,

917
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,840
screws everything up. That sounds fun to me.

918
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,480
But this version of it, I'm assuming to save money so they didn't have to get a

919
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,400
rerecorded version of everything.

920
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,800
They might've been worried. I'm realizing about like maybe the guy was going to like

921
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,120
hurt himself doing Donald's voice because I just did Donald for one line and I'm like,

922
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,480
yeah, I'm like choking a little bit.

923
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,440
I'm going to you guys keep talking.

924
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,160
I'm going to get water.

925
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,640
I've been stifling it.

926
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,680
That really fucked me up.

927
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,000
All right.

928
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,520
Boy, much respect to Clarence Nash and Tony and Selmo.

929
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,800
Just go over the sink.

930
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,400
Yeah, I'm going to cough up a storm.

931
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,240
Get something over the from the sink.

932
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:00,960
You okay.

933
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,040
So be our guest.

934
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,320
Sort her as apprentice brooms.

935
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,520
But do you do you know what I'm saying?

936
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,880
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

937
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,920
I mean, we did get the introduction of the greatest love story of our time.

938
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,960
Donald and Ariel.

939
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,240
The Little Mermaid.

940
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:12,960
So I get there.

941
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,760
She's interacting with him, but the songs are the exact same.

942
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,720
It would be fun if Donald took a verse and said what he wanted to be part of.

943
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,120
Does he want to be like if the scenes were under new management, some might say.

944
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,600
Sure.

945
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,280
But that's that's the fun.

946
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,920
I think that's the promise of a premise like this.

947
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,720
Yeah, that's true.

948
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,520
Get Donald's doing fun stuff with the songs and it feels like you're just listening to

949
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,200
the exact same which you are the exact same song and you're getting a little

950
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,440
piece of business here and there and it feels it feels like I'm not seeing a new experience

951
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,440
as much as I'm seeing a little some cute little gags, but I'm just listening to the

952
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,720
soundtrack from the movie.

953
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,400
I already know very well.

954
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,920
It doesn't feel like a fun special movie to me.

955
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,240
That's what makes the whole thing to me uninteresting.

956
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,920
I've got a short tangent because it's music related.

957
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,560
I put we post that picture a while back of the I had found the like two disc Disney World

958
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:17,040
soundtrack I bought years ago on CD and I was listening to it again at my car and it

959
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,960
struck me how odd it was and I'm like what year is this from and it's copyrighted 2008.

960
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,280
So there is some strange stuff on it.

961
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,320
Like I was driving along, did not expect to hear like the Tiki Room song until

962
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,840
like halfway through and then stop stop like the under new.

963
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,640
It's got the under new management Iago song on it.

964
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,160
Be careful with that Iago voice.

965
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,360
Let me tell you from experience.

966
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,640
No, I'm not doing it anymore.

967
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,600
Scratchy.

968
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,360
I survived, but just barely.

969
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,560
And then the like second song on it is a thing called Main Street Medley, which for most of

970
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,080
it is like little snippets of like long way to Tipperary long way to Tipperary or like

971
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,840
sure or Clank Clank Clank with a trolley.

972
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,880
But then there's an original song about how like it's Main Street today and we're happy

973
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,600
to see you.

974
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,160
Oh, I don't know.

975
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,440
Like it's very odd.

976
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,040
So like 2008, I guess I don't even know where I would have bought this.

977
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,520
Disney World.

978
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,240
No, but I wasn't there in 2008.

979
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,320
I think maybe I was in Disneyland and I was like, why do they have this year?

980
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,160
Guess I'll buy it.

981
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,040
You think it's odd that you were in Disneyland and there's a CD that has a

982
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,800
song about Main Street being nice?

983
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,720
No, but it's the Walt Disney World soundtrack that they made.

984
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,640
I think they were selling in Disneyland.

985
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,520
That's not like Disney, Tokyo Disney, where they sell like CD singles.

986
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,080
Yeah.

987
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:38,800
Isn't it weird?

988
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,960
Are they have like, it's just like you buy the it's like expensive CDs and it only has

989
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,320
one track on it.

990
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,840
It's 15 minutes long.

991
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,080
Yeah, I bought a three disc set to try.

992
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,800
I wanted to get everything, but if I were to buy all the music at Tokyo Disney, it would

993
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,480
have cost me a thousand dollars.

994
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,400
I think like physical media more there.

995
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,960
Well, yeah, they haven't gotten into the streaming thing as much.

996
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,840
Yeah, but yeah, I don't know.

997
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,800
I mean, I have not.

998
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,520
I would like to hear that Main Street song that you're referring to.

999
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,240
Yeah, I gotta dig it out.

1000
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,720
I gotta finish listening to it because I think there's some more.

1001
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,840
You got it in 2008.

1002
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,080
And I listened to it then and I forgot like this whole thing.

1003
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,360
It's been on his to-do list.

1004
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:25,760
Listen to the rest of the tracks on the thing I bought 10 years ago, 11 years ago.

1005
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,960
So the entire Obama administration passed.

1006
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,360
Anyway, so yeah, part of the world.

1007
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,080
I've already established beautiful chemistry.

1008
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,640
So I just I was watching that as we were talking to refresh my memory again.

1009
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,880
So here's here's what happens that I do.

1010
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,880
I see some of what you're saying.

1011
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,640
She takes his little feed ease.

1012
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,480
She plays with his little feet.

1013
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,240
He takes his snoot, his little snooty and his feed ease.

1014
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,520
And she plays with his feet a little bit.

1015
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,640
And then she kind of like gently touches his bill.

1016
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,080
Yeah, so like lovingly touches his bill.

1017
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
Still, I read that I see how you,

1018
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,440
oh, Donald could misinterpret those signals.

1019
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,640
I will say that.

1020
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,040
I'm not saying it's a full arc of a love story,

1021
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,840
but I'm saying it could be the start of something magical.

1022
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,840
But let me let me say this.

1023
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,320
If people saw the way I was affectionate with Edwin, our dog,

1024
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,240
would you think maybe Edwin would get the wrong impression that I was in love with him?

1025
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,360
Do you sing to Edwin?

1026
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:27,680
Yes.

1027
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,760
Does he quack back at you?

1028
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,640
No, he just like rolls around a little bit.

1029
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,560
But like if I I play with his paws, I like rub his snoot.

1030
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,880
I'm just saying like Donald is a little cute animal and I don't think Ariel is.

1031
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,920
But he's sentient.

1032
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,640
Yeah, yeah, he is.

1033
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,840
But Edwin is different.

1034
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,720
Edwin is a little sentient.

1035
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,160
Donald speaks.

1036
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,660
Yeah.

1037
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,400
Yeah, but he doesn't.

1038
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,080
She I don't think I think she can't under she doesn't know that.

1039
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,080
I get the sense that she's not even reacting to what he's doing because she can't hear it.

1040
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,160
It's like one of those cartoons where the animals speak, but like the humans don't know.

1041
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,880
She's not reacting to any of his noises.

1042
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,880
She's just like, oh, look at this cute animal.

1043
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,000
And she plays with his little feet.

1044
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,600
I'm just saying it's not dissimilar to the way I play with Edwin's feet.

1045
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:17,520
And I'm saying that Ariel is not coming on to him at all.

1046
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,440
She's just like, oh, this is a cute animal.

1047
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,800
And Donald is misinterpreted.

1048
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,960
I can see where his his his misunderstanding is coming from.

1049
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,560
Well, are you ever playing with Edwin's feet and then he gets a big old boner?

1050
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,960
Not the feet, but he certainly has gotten a boner while I've been playing with him.

1051
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,200
But it's not because I was.

1052
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,400
Sounds like he's getting the wrong message.

1053
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,160
He has been known to hump.

1054
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,440
Yeah, he humps me all the time.

1055
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,480
When you sing all of part of your world to Edwin, Edwin gets a boner.

1056
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,360
Yes, maybe.

1057
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:52,000
But I'm just saying I can I can understand why he maybe gets the wrong idea sometimes.

1058
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,560
Sometimes when I'm like playing, I think, yeah, he's getting the signals mixed up.

1059
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,480
And if I'm on the ground, he will get on the back of my leg and try to hump me.

1060
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,880
So that's what's going on.

1061
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,520
I'm just saying Ariel is not interested in Donald in a real romantic way.

1062
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,640
Donald is thinking that she is, but it's not the case.

1063
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,480
That's all I'm saying.

1064
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,640
But I see what you're saying, because she does.

1065
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,520
She does touch him and it's a little coy.

1066
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,040
Hey, Edwin, here's a little test.

1067
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,000
Look at this stuff.

1068
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,840
Isn't it neat?

1069
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,160
Wouldn't you think?

1070
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,040
Not interested in it.

1071
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:27,840
Mike does it.

1072
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,360
He might want some water.

1073
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,400
Don't be so coy, Scott.

1074
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,520
OK, so so moving on for part of your world,

1075
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,320
it goes to I Just Can't Wait to Be King.

1076
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,520
This is the thing I noticed.

1077
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,520
This is the only song all the other songs take place in locations.

1078
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,840
I Just Can't Wait to Be King is kind of a dream sequence.

1079
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,640
Abstract.

1080
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,880
It's like this in the real.

1081
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,000
How would you describe this?

1082
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,880
It almost becomes like a like it's a simplified paper cut out worlds that we go into.

1083
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,320
There's 3D Simba and 3D Donald, but everything else is like

1084
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,240
the animals from Brian Fellow's Safari Planet opening.

1085
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,560
Yeah, like pillow paper cut outs.

1086
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,960
Like montage isn't quite right, but like in singing in the rain where they go into,

1087
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,640
they start doing the scene from the movie and then that takes over.

1088
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,880
You like enter this hole.

1089
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,600
You enter the Broadway melody.

1090
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,720
I find this to be sort of a successful sequence, I think because I tend to like when 3D movies

1091
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,440
don't just do and it's 3D characters and they're fully rendered.

1092
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,200
I like when there's some style like in Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark.

1093
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,720
That there's not turn off the dark.

1094
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,360
That's the fuck.

1095
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:39,680
Fuck.

1096
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,880
It's so in my head.

1097
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,720
That is what you meant.

1098
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,200
I mean, yes, I like everything about that.

1099
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,080
Spider, what's that?

1100
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,800
Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse.

1101
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,800
I don't think I ever could have produced that so lodged in my head is Turn Off the Dark.

1102
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:59,280
I like that there's different styles and 2D with like 2D rendered as 3D is

1103
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,880
often much cooler to me than 3D rendered as 3D.

1104
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,840
That's what you're saying.

1105
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,680
Or Lego movies a little in that way to like a kookier.

1106
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,800
Yeah, it looks cool.

1107
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:08,960
Yeah.

1108
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,320
Spider-Verse is incredible.

1109
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:16,720
Like the way they replicated certain artists, comic styles and animated it.

1110
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,320
Oh, there's the references.

1111
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:18,820
Yeah.

1112
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,040
The way the Kingpin looks, the way Gwen Stacy looks.

1113
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,800
Yeah, that was I had just seen it recently and it's so great.

1114
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,440
First time I teared up at a movie in a long time.

1115
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,320
Spider-Man really?

1116
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:36,000
Yeah, when Miles catches him at the end, catches Peter at the end before he lets him go.

1117
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,080
Oh yeah.

1118
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,840
Peter says, what if I mess up again?

1119
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,880
I'm like, oh no.

1120
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,600
Oh yeah.

1121
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,600
I tear up at movies all the time as I get older.

1122
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,120
I don't even have to like it.

1123
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,400
I could not like the movie and I could tear up at something.

1124
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,040
Sure.

1125
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,240
Yeah, I don't know if I can handle a new Toy Story this summer.

1126
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,240
Oh, and they're really going to put the pedal to the metal on the emotion.

1127
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,360
I don't think it's going to get me.

1128
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,200
I think they've put too many stories.

1129
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,600
The story's over.

1130
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,120
I'm kind of criticizing it in the sense that I think like they went in like,

1131
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,280
well, we got to top the last one, which to me feels like a recipe for like too much.

1132
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,000
Yes.

1133
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,360
It's a pattern now.

1134
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:09,840
Yeah.

1135
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,440
And how do you top the last one?

1136
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,080
No, I don't know.

1137
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:12,480
The lesson's the best.

1138
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,560
Looking the specter of death in the face.

1139
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,440
Yeah.

1140
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,240
It's very heavy.

1141
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,120
I don't know.

1142
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:19,600
We'll see.

1143
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,520
I'm sure I'll like it.

1144
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,640
But Aladdin might do it too in that I'll just be crying like,

1145
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,800
I can't believe I don't have that money anymore.

1146
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,120
I don't have that $12 anymore.

1147
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,240
Will Smith's once promising career.

1148
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,720
What happened?

1149
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,360
What happened?

1150
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,000
But yeah, I just came here to be king.

1151
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:48,240
This sequence also makes the most effective use of the side screens because abstract.

1152
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:48,800
You know what?

1153
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,760
Okay, I will say this.

1154
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,240
I don't mind what's happening on the side screens.

1155
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:52,720
No.

1156
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,000
It's not great.

1157
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:54,960
Okay.

1158
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,600
Okay.

1159
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,720
If you're in the Muppet Vision Theater,

1160
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:05,120
they're using the screens that used to just exist to imply that the theater got banged up at the end.

1161
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:05,520
Yes.

1162
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:13,200
And now they're doing a little more substantial with bonus water or bonus clouds in the Peter Pan sequence.

1163
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,920
It's kind of like I'm told, I still haven't done it and I want to.

1164
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,600
I want to see one of these Screen X movies that just stretch abstract imagery to the side.

1165
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,240
Oh, interesting.

1166
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,880
Yeah, there's one in Buena Park down by our beloved knots.

1167
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,840
But this, I don't know, you put extra abstract giraffes and monkeys over there.

1168
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,480
That was fun.

1169
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:34,800
Yeah.

1170
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,280
Yeah.

1171
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,080
I mean, if you can't do like the DreamWorks theater Kung Fu Panda,

1172
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,360
that is a pretty seamless wraparound there.

1173
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,400
This isn't that.

1174
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,040
It's not that.

1175
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,480
But yeah, no, I like the abstract.

1176
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,840
They also drew abstract like Donald and the Sorcerer's Hat at the one point,

1177
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,960
like spinning by Simba's head, like in that style.

1178
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,460
Oh yeah.

1179
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,960
I like that.

1180
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,460
Yeah.

1181
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,200
Mainly just to hear all these classic songs in one place

1182
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,000
and every once in a while interrupted by my hat.

1183
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,360
My hat, I need the hat.

1184
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,280
In the background.

1185
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,920
Yeah, not really mixed properly.

1186
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,720
Like the I think you should leave sketch Bozo dubbed over.

1187
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,760
Oh yeah.

1188
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,640
Oh, fuck.

1189
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,440
I don't know, Guns Entered, Jacks Off.

1190
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,640
Am I supposed to be here?

1191
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,720
I hope I don't jack off.

1192
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,280
The Tim Rouds and Netflix show, it's so good.

1193
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,440
But you know what we haven't really talked about also is like what,

1194
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,480
and talking about modding out the Muppet Theater,

1195
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,040
are Styler and Walder still up there?

1196
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,840
Where is everything?

1197
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,640
That's a very good question.

1198
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,520
I think they're still up there because it's very expensive to remove animatronics.

1199
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,040
So we're just looking at a curtain because these are unused balconies at this point.

1200
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,360
They used to have characters popping out of them.

1201
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:01,440
Bean Bunny, Statler, Waldorf, this great animatronics just sitting in a coma state.

1202
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,240
It's labor intensive to move them and also if they're hydraulic fluid powered,

1203
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,480
then you have to concern yourself with disposing of closing off hydraulic lines,

1204
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,320
disposing of fluids and so this is why Buzzy sat untouched for so many years.

1205
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,920
Otherwise, Jason's gonna get it all.

1206
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,640
Yeah.

1207
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,360
Yeah, you should do a hydraulic fluid heist.

1208
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,120
Like in The Simpsons when Homer and Bart were getting the grease.

1209
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,760
The grease.

1210
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,640
Oh man.

1211
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,800
You just go into those balconies and suck out,

1212
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,040
just have a long tube and suck out the hydraulic fluid with a length of hose.

1213
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,760
This means hydraulic fluid for his cuckoo clocks at home.

1214
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,000
My clock.

1215
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,320
I don't know what hydraulic fluid is used for.

1216
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,120
Yeah, I don't either but I assume it's for Jason's cuckoo clock collection which

1217
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,120
honestly I've known you for a long time and I've made up a lot of funny specifics for your life

1218
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:52,080
but I haven't come on, I haven't thought of cuckoo clock collection which makes a lot of sense to me.

1219
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,120
Sure, that is a good movie shorthand for like this character's a little quirky.

1220
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:57,520
Yeah.

1221
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,000
Right?

1222
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,440
But nice sometimes too.

1223
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,480
Gepetto's nice.

1224
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,520
Maurice is nice.

1225
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,400
Maurice is nice.

1226
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,240
I'm sure Mr. Magorium's got his share of cuckoo clocks.

1227
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,120
Oh for sure.

1228
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,840
I think it would also make sense for you to be doing something at home,

1229
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,920
tinkering to where you need like the big glasses that make your pupils look very big.

1230
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,600
Oh, that I can put up and down depending on how much.

1231
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,880
Just like Wainsolinsky, yes.

1232
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,200
Oh yeah.

1233
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,160
Oh yeah.

1234
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,400
Sure.

1235
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,400
I don't know where to get them but you need some good eyeball expanding glasses.

1236
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,120
Trying to figure out the perfect ratio of like mustard relish onions on a dog.

1237
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,240
I don't like those big pumps because like then you end up with one puddle and then you have to

1238
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,280
smear it around.

1239
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,840
Oh man, if you were the Dom DeLuis beret and the goggles.

1240
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,720
Oh man.

1241
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,040
Wow.

1242
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,240
You should really start becoming like one of these fancy men, Disney like dress up men.

1243
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,920
I think that's really a look that you should do I think.

1244
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,040
Yeah.

1245
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,360
Maybe for your birthday I'll buy you a full outfit.

1246
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,160
Like a duffy style outfit.

1247
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:57,600
Yeah.

1248
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,520
Crazy old Jason came in here talking about some kind of beast.

1249
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,200
He's out of, he's a loon.

1250
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:13,760
That does feel more fun than like all the 90s like vintage 90s and pattern shorts and stuff

1251
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,680
coming back like hypey shit in fashion right now.

1252
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,440
I don't think I can pull that off.

1253
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,800
Go back to the 1890s.

1254
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,640
But if I go back to like, yeah.

1255
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,360
Not even the 1890s, like I don't want to be like an old timey guy but I want to be like a quirk,

1256
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,360
like an old timey kook.

1257
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,480
Now that's something.

1258
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:32,720
Yeah.

1259
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,200
Yeah.

1260
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,120
That's a style you could own.

1261
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,600
Don't you have like a cabi hat that you wore for a while?

1262
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,320
That I wore for a while?

1263
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,680
Didn't you used to wear like six or seven years ago you had like a cap you would wear

1264
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,000
maybe on like a special occasion.

1265
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,200
If you had like a sport coat on you would wear like a floppy cap.

1266
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,960
Am I wrong or is this a fantasy?

1267
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,360
I don't think so.

1268
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,200
You never have a hat like not a baseball hat but you didn't have like a little floppy cabi hat?

1269
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,880
I think there are pictures of me like wearing one in high school or something.

1270
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,800
I think I found one at a Goodwill.

1271
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,560
I'm sure I've pulled it out for like shows or stuff.

1272
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,640
Do you have, do you know where it is?

1273
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,920
I have a box of hats.

1274
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,360
Sure.

1275
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:16,400
I have a box of hats of like four boxes of props from years of doing comedy.

1276
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:16,880
All right well.

1277
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,440
So do I.

1278
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,000
I have every prop from any video I ever made.

1279
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,680
I want them to go away.

1280
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,840
Yeah I know but I feel like.

1281
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,280
Get rid of them but then.

1282
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,360
I might need this sweater from Steamroller's not just for crushing people again.

1283
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,080
I do like that sweater.

1284
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:32,400
Sure.

1285
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,840
I have a rumpled Grimace costume that's just a sheet with Grimace's face printed out.

1286
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,280
It's a nightmare.

1287
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,160
Duck taped to the front of it and it's the scariest thing but I will not get rid of it.

1288
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,600
I've used it twice in five years and there's really no reason I should keep it but it's truly

1289
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,560
like a nightmare and I but it's like my favorite thing.

1290
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:58,000
I was grimace once for Halloween and I just got like green or just purple fabric and draped it

1291
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,320
Oh yeah.

1292
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:58,960
Myself.

1293
00:59:58,960 --> 00:59:59,600
It's a.

1294
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,640
Yeah good costume.

1295
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah I did it for too but every time I do it he'll look worse because he's been in a rumpled

1296
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,480
mess under my bed and I think it'll just be funnier if I have it in 20 years from now

1297
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,160
because it really will.

1298
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,000
Grimace was homeless for a little while.

1299
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,160
Yes.

1300
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:14,400
Sure.

1301
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,560
What else.

1302
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:21,840
So after I Just Can't Wait to be King back to back you can fly in a whole new world both

1303
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:27,440
flying sequences both kind of feel a little like an afterthought.

1304
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,240
I guess he gets tossed around in the clouds a little more.

1305
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,440
They're not not magical or in a whole new world.

1306
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,240
You don't get a lot of Peter Pan time I feel like that gets to the short end of the stick.

1307
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:45,680
You get a little bit of it but yeah it just it's not a satisfying experience.

1308
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,760
None of this feels satisfying to me.

1309
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,600
It's not the ultimate rendering of these classic moments.

1310
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:51,920
Yeah.

1311
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,320
No.

1312
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:58,400
I'm also I have another question which is why so if this hadn't happened if Donald hadn't gone

1313
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:05,200
from IP to IP would they are these characters all just like in a Groundhog Day loop singing

1314
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,080
their famous song every day every second.

1315
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,680
Well if we're talking about a multiverse in general I think there always is going to be

1316
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:19,360
a version of you we're doing like there's a version of us doing this episode forever somewhere.

1317
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,480
What.

1318
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,440
In the multiverse.

1319
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,320
This one.

1320
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,520
This specific one.

1321
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,160
Over and over again.

1322
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,320
Those poor guys.

1323
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,640
Yeah where this is just a loop there.

1324
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:37,760
So I think I like to think of it like that where it's just he's accessing a timeline in a multiverse

1325
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,360
where he's getting right to those important moments in those characters lives.

1326
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,240
Yep the important the most important moment for Aladdin was the magic carpet ride.

1327
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,880
The most important moment in our lives was talking about the Cadillac cats 45 minutes ago.

1328
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,600
That's so far my favorite part of this episode.

1329
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:59,120
Uh the ending is Mickey scolds Donald.

1330
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,760
Donald gets back to the orchestra show.

1331
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,320
Yeah.

1332
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:08,720
Somehow Mickey scolds him they do a little bit of music and then the tuba shoots Donald

1333
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,640
back to the back wall of the theater his little butt wiggles.

1334
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:18,640
And yeah there's a mild animatronic in the back where if you ever looked back in the

1335
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:24,880
Muffet Vision 3D show to see the Swedish chef projecting or later with the musket.

1336
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,560
And then a cannon.

1337
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,760
And then a cannon yes.

1338
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,480
Yeah they use that same space.

1339
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,040
Here's what I say.

1340
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,640
And that's fun I think we all like that.

1341
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,200
That's like the best thing.

1342
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:39,600
Start there start with that start with the tuba shooting Donald into the back and go from there.

1343
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,080
Sure.

1344
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,000
It's like Kurt Vonnegut always said write 15 pages and throw the first 10 in the garbage

1345
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,320
and your story should start at page 11.

1346
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,120
So where would you go once he gets shot where would you go from there?

1347
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:55,840
I don't know but I want to see what happens from that that's like the best part and I wish.

1348
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,280
Right.

1349
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,560
I don't know I wish there was more.

1350
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,040
Where else do you want to see Donald's butt show up?

1351
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:06,480
Yeah where would you want him to be more in the 80s Disney movies he shows up in the rescue

1352
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,920
on Scuttle or no Scuttle's in Little Mermaid what's the name of the of the bird in the rescuers?

1353
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,200
We don't know.

1354
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:13,600
The rescuers down under.

1355
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,760
We mentioned this recently and I couldn't remember we talked about a Soren that was that but I

1356
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,400
couldn't remember.

1357
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,560
And there's two different birds because they.

1358
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,640
It's a Benny and Lenny the Cav situation extremely similar the second one was John Candy.

1359
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:26,800
Right.

1360
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,160
And I don't remember the previous.

1361
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:29,520
Yeah.

1362
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:34,560
I watched rescuers down under a lot and I did not watch the original rescuers a lot

1363
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,680
because we didn't have it on tape and also I found it scary.

1364
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:48,240
So yeah I don't know I just think like all the all the property should come together at the end

1365
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:54,960
it should you should see Aladdin and with you know with Lumiere like there's sure so much fun to be

1366
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:01,760
had with this type of premise and it's just not delivered and I'm sure that the Imagineers

1367
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,120
whoever were putting this thing together had fun ideas and there was some practical reason why the

1368
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:12,320
suits were like we can't do that that's not we just need the songs that's the cheapest way to do

1369
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:12,800
it.

1370
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:12,960
Yeah.

1371
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,560
People like the songs.

1372
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,640
The answer is the global recession.

1373
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:16,880
Right.

1374
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:23,760
That's the look we just need it all we want to put in is money for the basic 2000 rendering of the.

1375
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,760
We're not paying Jerry Orbach an extra dime.

1376
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,000
Right.

1377
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,840
Gilbert Gottfried really stands out too that he comes in and just squawks and it is such a

1378
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,840
squawk that doesn't interact with whatever Donald is doing.

1379
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,080
Right.

1380
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,520
Even though they brought they had already brought him back for Enchant Tiki Room under new management

1381
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,640
so bring him back again.

1382
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,800
This thing I think in Florida had a lot of buzz because at the time

1383
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,720
it was probably cool to see them in like 3D animation.

1384
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,080
I think probably at the time people like oh this is neat we get to see the classic surrendered in a

1385
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:08,000
new way but I think in 2019 it's like it's pretty unimpressive it's not bad looking but it's like

1386
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,720
yeah okay these are competent CGI versions of the exact same sequences I know.

1387
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,520
Yeah.

1388
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:19,440
Okay it's the same song and there's a little Donald fun but like it's just the it's like

1389
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,280
10 percent of what the premise is in my mind.

1390
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,280
It's nice that I think it's nice that there's something in that theater like.

1391
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:25,520
Yes.

1392
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,880
As we said it's nice there's something.

1393
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,080
California Adventure especially I feel like is a park where like the really good stuff

1394
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:40,720
there is times where the really good stuff can fill up a little like get really long wait times

1395
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,120
and you're like oh no what do we do now.

1396
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,760
They have less swell at least this won't have a line.

1397
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,360
Yeah so like and that sort of stuff is like Monsters Inc, Little Mermaid and now this so in

1398
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:56,720
that sense it's not bad it's nice that there is like a little show and it's bad yeah I think

1399
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:02,480
kids if you have kids if you really like these movies like yeah this is fun but I wish that

1400
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,480
projector was a little brighter like all of these projectors are aging.

1401
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,080
That's what I said before we went in I said because I had seen I had done this in Florida

1402
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:15,760
a couple years prior and I was like man this 3D is rough on my eyes like hopefully it'll be

1403
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:21,040
upgraded for this and I won't hurt as much and no it was not it felt like a magic eye

1404
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:26,720
where I would have to kind of like really focus my eyes to make the 3D work very well.

1405
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,280
Like I think there's probably something where they would have to go in and re-render the whole

1406
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:36,240
thing in a different type of 3D to make it so it didn't hurt.

1407
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:46,560
Yeah there's also talk about like cheaping out a little and you know weird retrofitting to a

1408
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:54,480
facility that's there. Back when this thing opened at Disney World in 2003 our pal through

1409
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:01,280
our ears Jim Hill wrote an article about like here's what you know here's what it could have

1410
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,960
been and here's why Imagineers had to cut corners. Apparently this was going to debut

1411
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,720
for the first time anywhere with the 2005 opening of Hong Kong Disneyland and it was going to be a

1412
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,080
rare thing like that was so chintzy opening day Hong Kong Disneyland this was going to be a rare

1413
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:22,480
thing that is only there here's the first place you can see it but it was they got done with the

1414
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:29,280
movie sooner than expected and Disney World started like they started thinking well can we jam it in

1415
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:35,520
there and basically it was going to have a premiere there was going to be a premiere in a retrofitted

1416
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:42,480
new theater in Hong Kong Disneyland with a custom pre-show that would have set the stage for the

1417
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,760
film that was to follow and because the movie got was on track to get done sooner they said you

1418
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,960
know we're just going to put it in in Orlando and the lobby whatever we don't have time and no pre-show.

1419
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:58,160
It does feel like a big a nice pre-show. Yeah yeah would have helped. Yeah because there's nothing

1420
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,240
yeah there's maybe like clouds swirling around so I think this I think there's been a domino effect

1421
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:07,360
potentially from that decision from not just letting it be its ultimate version in Hong Kong

1422
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:12,080
right building it out from there but I have something else to say about this Jim Hill article

1423
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:17,840
I'd like to read you the headline of this article from 2003. Go ahead. The headline is

1424
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:27,680
did Disney execs unintentionally slip Philharmagic a Mickey? Mr. Hill. I don't need to be Mike's mom

1425
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:34,800
to be offended by that headline. Watch out for the salt and pepper shakers on the table because that's a reach.

1426
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:44,800
It's a different time 2003 was a different time. You know what I thought this opened in Orlando in 2008

1427
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:53,920
so that is extra bizarre to me that we are in 2019 getting a 60 year old attraction out there. So late.

1428
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:58,880
So very late. Also yeah that headline doesn't quite if we're really like one to like trying to figure

1429
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:05,040
out the analog for the joke it would be like did it I mean I get it that Mickey is a is a

1430
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:11,360
famous drug you put in someone's drink to knock them out. Yeah but it should be more it just

1431
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:17,200
it should be like I'm not gonna be able to think of the joke but it should be more like

1432
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:22,800
cutting it off at the knees or like popped its tires or something like slowed it down.

1433
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:31,120
They poisoned the ride. They put it to sleep. If we're noting the joke headline. Yeah and we are.

1434
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:36,560
We certainly are. We've noted a lot of different ride jokes too over the over the course of the

1435
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:40,400
last two years as well. That's the problem with some of these things they're just done and tossed

1436
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:46,480
out of the world and nobody expects some nerds to scavenge and analyze it years later but

1437
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:52,320
the internet never forgets. Yeah so I'm looking at you Jim Hill media article from 2003.

1438
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,200
I'll come up with it. Maybe in like a couple months I'll have it.

1439
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,040
I'll have what I think is the better maybe headline for it. I guess that's where you gotta

1440
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:07,200
give him credit. A deadline was looming I guess. He had to do it. It's I get it. Jim Hill's publisher

1441
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:13,440
Jim Hill was demanding an article that day. Jim Hill is his own J Jonah Jameson so he's got like

1442
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:18,160
a voice in his head yelling like you're watching me Hill. Yeah well that's how you do it. You have

1443
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:22,800
to be a self-starter and I think we all should sort of have a J Jonah Jameson in our heads.

1444
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:29,120
That's your tip for productivity. Yes. Have a mustache man yelling at you in your own head

1445
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:34,000
of like I gotta get it done. We have to have it done by 3 p.m. tomorrow. Get me those pictures.

1446
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:40,800
I do like that. We're like you know we're in an era where people are tweeting

1447
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:48,080
you know a lot of you know like writery advice and here's how why. I think you can get a lot

1448
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:53,840
of retweets from that like a good you know young writer advice. Put a tiny J Jonah Jameson in your

1449
01:10:53,840 --> 01:11:01,520
head. Well editors are the first jobs like cut. Fact checkers and editors first to go you know at

1450
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:08,400
writing places. Newspapers and magazines. Imagine a mean old man or a Luke Green or somebody. Yeah I

1451
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:14,320
could turn I think I could turn this into a full blown like seminar workshop probably. Find your

1452
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:20,160
inner J Jonah Jameson. Yeah I could fill up arenas and I could do a whole I could have a whole racket

1453
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:25,200
out of this. Probably. Yeah probably. Cut five sentences from that and get me more pictures of

1454
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:33,200
Spider-Man. Yeah sure. Okay but so I mean this has been plugged into California Adventure and it's

1455
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:41,600
in most of the other parks somewhere and also via Jim Hill there's been discussion and rumors

1456
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:48,000
that maybe there is some revamp of this. I don't know if you guys caught that but that maybe they

1457
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,600
do a new edition of Philhar Magic much like they would do with Phantasmac where they get in

1458
01:11:54,400 --> 01:12:01,040
you know let it go. Right. Because there is you know we need to find one place in the theme park

1459
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:07,200
universe where let it go can play. Right. But anyway I mean there's like

1460
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:14,480
are you potentially excited or about or interested in like all right well I'll pepper in some newer

1461
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,560
sequences. Does that do anything for you? Does that do anything for me? Is if it's done like this?

1462
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:25,200
No not at all. It's just it's another like greatest hits with a little bit. Keep in mind Donald is

1463
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:31,520
still grasping for a hat. If he's still grasping for the hat but if he can sit like let him sing

1464
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:38,320
like whatever. That's not how he sounds but let him sing it. Like let's see something fun like that.

1465
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:43,520
Let's like let's let him get in the story more. If that's going to happen then I'm interested.

1466
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,400
Like I well that's what I want but if it's just going to be we're going to hear the exact same

1467
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:55,440
version of Adina Menzel singing let it go. No thank you. Pass. At the very least let's get more

1468
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:00,880
characters. I don't even see Goofy on this thing. I don't want to just hear Goofy. He's my favorite.

1469
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:06,400
Yeah. Yeah. I mean I like that. Let's get something going where I can see my favorites. There was that

1470
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:11,680
show I think Jim and Lynn were talking about it pretty recently. The Mickey Mouse clubhouse is that

1471
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:18,160
it? Where like Mickey ran a nightclub and all the characters are there. Yes. Oh yeah. Like that's fun.

1472
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:24,560
Okay sure. I just like it does seem I want more characters. I want more interaction. I want it to

1473
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,680
actually feel really specific to my experience at the park and not just like I'm listening to the

1474
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:34,560
exact same song. Sure. Yeah. That's what I'm looking for. They just laid one new element over

1475
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:40,320
something that already existed. Yeah. Well you know I was thinking if they're going to put new

1476
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:48,400
movies in it's very expected to do Frozen or Tangled or what have you but in the many many

1477
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:54,880
years since this experience was created Disney's bought a couple of new movies. Oh interesting.

1478
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:59,760
I mean you got your Marvels and you got your Pixars but you also have the entire Fox archive

1479
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:10,080
and I thought well what about you know some of the films that Fox has done in the early 2000s

1480
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:15,200
part of the Fox films Wikipedia that I looked at. Go ahead. And maybe you could put some of those

1481
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:21,600
in you know. What if what if Donald you know got like what if the hat ended up on a golf course

1482
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:28,480
giving Donald the opportunity to interrupt a backswing by Bagger Vance. I mean that sure.

1483
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:34,480
What the famous Bagger Vance song that he'll interrupt the famous musical number. I do that

1484
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,840
is an old video I did also when we're talking about my old things. Oh yeah I like that video.

1485
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,640
Yeah I did a Will Smith Bagger Vance. So y'all my name is Bagger Vance.

1486
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:49,040
What was it? Time to do the Bagger Vance dance. It was the rap he did for Bagger Vance. Yeah yeah

1487
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:54,400
if he had done a credits. Sorry. There's that guy on Twitter who does those all the time.

1488
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,480
Oh Dan. It's funnier than what I did. Yes there you go. But you know also he could

1489
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:03,120
you know you could the the hat could go to medieval times he could get caught up in a

1490
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:09,040
ultimate joust gone wrong with Martin Lawrence's Black Knight. Oh wow. Sure. Who wouldn't love to

1491
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:15,920
see Donald's interacting with. Sure. You know he could I mean scariest he's already been underwater

1492
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:21,280
but if you wanted to do a new underwater sequence and you know somebody a little less fun than the

1493
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:29,520
Little Mermaid. What if Donald got stuck in a pool with swim fan. Don't forget Disney owns swim fan.

1494
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:35,600
Sure. I'll be honest I did forget. I think we all forgot and let's never forget we all must

1495
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:42,000
remember one thing it all began with a mouse and now the mouse owns swim fan. But don't forget all

1496
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:49,280
those fox animated movies we like Ice Age, Epic. You could interrupt you could interact with my

1497
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:56,320
favorite Steven Tyler's Nimgaloo. Yeah. I think they were. Who are you? I'm Nimgaloo.

1498
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:02,720
I think Nimgaloo that is good. I really that's my favorite so far. Nimgaloo is very small. He

1499
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:08,320
could like sweep up Nimgaloo and then Donald puts the hat back on. He's got a Nimgaloo crawling

1500
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:13,040
around his head. That'd be great. Yeah. And also if you wanted to do you know that corner of the

1501
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:19,200
park has guardians and monsters after dark. If you wanted to do a darker one that's just for parents

1502
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:27,440
well what if the hat flew all the way to France and ended up in the in the backpack of Maggie

1503
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:35,760
Grace right before she's taken by Albanian sex traffickers in the world of taken and now you let

1504
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:42,320
all the events of taken play out but Liam Neeson is after Donald. He's after his daughter but without

1505
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,800
knowing it Donald is stuck in the backpack. Right. He's trying to get his hat back. That's

1506
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:52,160
fun. That's cute. That would make that story cuter. And you know you could do that's a perfect

1507
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:57,200
excuse for new dialogue as he can grumble about you know Albanian sex trafficker.

1508
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:03,600
Hopefully do they do they have classic dialogue from that old guy where he says Albanian sex

1509
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,320
trafficker in any of his old curtains. Oh maybe. He might have just been talking about how he was

1510
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:14,400
going to use one. Well don't forget there's also three. His personal life. There's three takens

1511
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:20,080
and one of them Liam Neeson gets taken. Oh yeah. And because there's like a sequence where like

1512
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,320
the daughter is in the apartment and he tells her where to find a grenade in the apartment

1513
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:30,960
and she's like I think it's a flashbang and he's like hold it hold it hold it throw it in the air

1514
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:38,160
because he he can tell by how far away the pop it like how far away they explain he can like

1515
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:45,920
tell like OK that was that far it sounded that far away. I've been in a car for five minutes so

1516
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:51,120
this is the mile radius I've been in. Why haven't I watched the other takens. Yeah I haven't seen

1517
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:56,880
them. Yeah. So maybe Donald could be the one getting taken. Sure. Or doing the phone call.

1518
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,000
Have that duck quack. Make him quack. I'll listen to the quack and listen to the echo and the

1519
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:09,040
reverberation. I have a very specific set of skills. Let him do it. I will find you. I'll kill

1520
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,840
you. That's I mean that's great. That's obviously more than they want to do though with these moves.

1521
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:19,760
I'm just saying keep your expectations low for the PhilharMagic story. It will all have to be

1522
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,560
with pre-recorded Liam Neeson. It has to be the characters have to have said the things they said

1523
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:30,240
before and have to be reused I think. Unless they go all out. I hope they do. I hope he gets taken

1524
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,920
and sees Bagger Vance. I hope that does happen. Every one of these yes and when we need some saves

1525
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:43,440
him he can say oh boy. My Donald's getting there. I just don't want to blow out the pipes. All I can do is

1526
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:49,920
are quack quack quack. That's it. That's much better than what I did. But I can't talk like that. I can just talk. No I can't do that.

1527
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:55,360
I don't think I can do the duck trick. Yeah that's it. All right well those are great ideas for

1528
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:01,840
plusing this thing up. But hey since we got a little extra to this is finally a topic where

1529
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:06,720
we don't require two and a half hours minimum. Right. We can do something we haven't done in a

1530
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:12,720
very long time which is souvenir showdown. We've had a couple of these in the past. Isn't it Smackdown?

1531
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:18,560
I think it's Smackdown. Could be. It's been long enough we don't know. Nobody's really holding

1532
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:23,600
us to the fire. Souvenirs Smackdown. I'm surprised I got that close. I got half of it. Yeah that was close.

1533
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:31,040
Sure. The classic segment which I'm now told is called Souvenirs Smackdown. I think. We all go

1534
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:36,720
onto eBay and we try to find the oddest piece of Disney or universe or theme park

1535
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:43,120
merch in general that we can possibly find and we'll have each other guess what we think that

1536
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:50,720
would or should cost. Who thinks they have the least weird one? I think I do. Okay yours famously

1537
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:57,600
the first one you did was not weird at all. No not weird at all. What was it? I don't remember.

1538
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:04,800
It was something about orange bird I think. Oh yeah yeah. I think it was weird. It was a children's

1539
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:11,520
inflatable pool toy with the orange bird on it. I went and found an actual interesting thing as

1540
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:18,080
opposed to an oddball oddity. Okay. So let's see what we've got. So this one but the thing that

1541
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:29,200
has always struck me with this with the eBay culture in general is the massive price. You know

1542
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:35,840
how the way the price can fluctuate on stuff. Sure. So this is I have a picture here to show you.

1543
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:44,800
Tomorrowland opening day Disneyland classic cup collectible 1998. So this is from the infamous

1544
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:51,600
Tomorrowland redo. I'll show you that. Oh no it hurts. It's a souvenir plastic cup. Okay.

1545
01:20:51,600 --> 01:21:02,080
Sort of a gold steampunky top. Yes. Okay. How much do you think this sells for? Well let me ask you

1546
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,040
this. What did you check? Is it what's how it's listed or have you checked and seen that the

1547
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:11,600
same thing has actually sold for the money? How what it is currently listed. I see okay.

1548
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:17,200
Okay. Because sometimes I do see things that are listed as like a thousand dollars and if you

1549
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:22,400
search for the same thing and sold it sold for much less or there's nothing else there's no

1550
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:27,520
precedent even for it. So it feels like people are just guessing. Yeah. I'm going to guess that is

1551
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:34,560
three hundred dollars. Okay Scott. Then I maybe I got to go higher to make it crazier four hundred

1552
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:41,440
fifty dollars. Well gentlemen I'm here to tell you that you have any number of choices of how much

1553
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:47,440
you want to pay. You can pay thirty two dollars. You can pay eighty nine ninety nine. You can pay

1554
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:53,760
a thousand dollars. You can pay a hundred and twenty five for the same. You just want to buy

1555
01:21:53,760 --> 01:22:00,800
the topper for the same product. You can find it listed numerous times on eBay for any price you

1556
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,960
could imagine. So that's okay. So do this real quick. Search for it and hit sold items completed

1557
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:12,320
items and it'll show you exactly how much it's been selling. It is actually sold. I mean with

1558
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:16,960
the actual the prices that you tend to see the most tend to be about twenty four ninety nine.

1559
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,680
Okay. So somebody was getting like that's a reasonable price. So that's probably how much

1560
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:26,960
it was. It's one listing when I first found it was one hundred ninety nine ninety nine. So that was

1561
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:32,000
two hundred dollars. They they're the ones who came down to eighty nine ninety nine and that one

1562
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:38,320
comes with a collectible coin. Oh, which I actually think you should just sell on its own.

1563
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:45,120
Sure. Sure. Might go for something. Yeah. So without a coin, people are trying to sell this for

1564
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:52,320
close to a hundred bucks more or a thousand bucks, whatever price your heart desires. You can find

1565
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,720
in this list. I really want to pay a thousand dollars for this. I thought it was very strange.

1566
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,680
This kind of this thing that it seems like a lot of people are like, yes, I have this opening day

1567
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:07,760
for New Tomorrowland sort of thing and I'm going to flip it. And there's just a dozen or more

1568
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:14,800
people with the same thought. And you can and I will have this item for sale next to it, the same

1569
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:21,680
item that costs a hundred like hundred times less. I bet I could get one of these for seventeen

1570
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:27,200
dollars. Oh, you can also there's other listings for just the topper. If you just want the top of

1571
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:32,160
that bottle, you just want the straw. Are you thinking about getting it? Not really. OK,

1572
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:37,040
it's not a thing I have affection for. OK, I think I was just I don't even remember how I found it

1573
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:42,800
searching around and then I just couldn't not find it. I just kept finding pages of it. Right. I

1574
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:48,720
think everyone needs to send them to you. Somebody has one that you would send to Jason for free.

1575
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:54,960
Sure. Is that good hydraulic fluid holder? Actually, I'll say that it is. It does look

1576
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,280
like it holds a lot of liquid, so it would be good for storing hydraulic fluid. Right.

1577
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,600
Well, that's great. All right. You two tell me about your weird ones.

1578
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:11,680
Well, yeah, you want you want me to go for it? I think so. Go for it. I'm pretty I'm pretty

1579
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,960
pleased with this and I'm pretty pleased that, you know, we have we talked about doing this months

1580
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:21,520
ago and I'm really happy that it's still up there. And I think you guys will recognize it when I spin

1581
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:29,120
it around and show you. But first, let me read the title of the item, which is Hard Rock Theme Park

1582
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:38,320
Mick Jagger Rolling Stones Lip Statue artwork. Look at this guy. No. Pretty familiar. We know him

1583
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:45,040
from Hard Rock Park. It's a statue that slips and the teeth are piano keys and a big gross tongue

1584
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:51,280
sticking out of it and weird mismatchy legs, ones in like a kiss boot and ones in a more of a

1585
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:59,120
Disney shoe with tiger striped socks. It is one of those bizarre sculptures that was created for

1586
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:08,880
Hard Rock Park and it is just on on eBay. Very small description. Rockin' Lips Statue. Unusual

1587
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:14,400
Rockin' Lips Statue from Hard Rock Theme Park. Wow. This fiberglass masterpiece of artwork is

1588
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:18,960
11 feet wide, 12 feet deep and seven feet tall. Great attention grabber for a business, concert

1589
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:24,400
halls, theme parks or amusement parks. Very different. Designed after legendary Mick Jagger.

1590
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:32,400
Call for shipping information. Maybe less, the description not super interesting, but it is,

1591
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:40,240
you would go to pick it up in Georgetown, South Carolina and it is an odd user on eBay

1592
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:46,640
called Po Boys Discount, which otherwise is just selling like industrial kitchen equipment.

1593
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:54,400
Like they have like a flash fryer or their most recent item put up today is a

1594
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:03,440
souvenir bottle of popcorn kernels from something called Studebakers Myrtle Beach.

1595
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,760
So go to Po Boys Discount if you want a Mick Jagger lips statue, but also

1596
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:16,640
you know, a electric thermo food finishing oven for $400.

1597
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,680
It is weird. I do not know why they ended up with this. What you are saying is they have a

1598
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:27,040
warehouse. Yeah. They have a warehouse to hold bulk goods. It is all bizarre kitchen

1599
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:32,480
bullshit, which might be useful if you are trying to start a restaurant in the Carolinas.

1600
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:39,440
Also may have been a lot like an auction lot that they bought from Hard Rock Park.

1601
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,320
This might all have been used. That is a good point. All those barbecues or whatever.

1602
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:50,880
Actually their second most expensive item, the Cleveland Tilt Skillet. It is a brazing skillet.

1603
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:57,760
Makes soups and the large yield can produce 40 gallons. So if you want 40 gallons of soup,

1604
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:04,240
go to Po Boys Discount. Would you guys like to put a ballpark on what you might purchase that for?

1605
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,160
Five grand. Jason?

1606
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:11,200
Yeah, I was thinking around there too. I will go higher. I will go 10 grand asking.

1607
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,840
It is a little bit lower, but you are closer in the over under. It is $8,000.

1608
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,520
$8,000. I could pay $385 for the next 24 months.

1609
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:24,560
Did everyone go like, oh the Mick Jagger statue? When you guys think about Hard Rock Park and you

1610
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,600
think about that statue, do you immediately go like, oh Mick Jagger?

1611
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,880
No. No.

1612
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,840
It actually feels more Steven Tyler-y to me with the big tongue.

1613
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,760
It also just feels like a little generic rock and roll. The lips and the tongue wag and rock

1614
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:44,000
and roll. That rock and roll divorced from all known rock and roll.

1615
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,720
From the way anyone actually listens to rock and roll. No, but apparently they are,

1616
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:53,680
I take that description to mean they are scientifically exactly structured to Mick

1617
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:59,680
Jagger's actual lips. So there you go. Wow. Piece of Hard Rock Park history. It never stops. The

1618
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,840
tale of Hard Rock Park never steps unfolding. When we have Binkowski on, maybe he just has a

1619
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,440
couple lying around. Oh man.

1620
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,720
Like prototypes. Maybe they'll just give us one for.

1621
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:10,240
They'll just give us each one lip statue. That's what I'm hoping for.

1622
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,560
All right. Mike.

1623
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:19,680
Okay. So this is probably a full episode if I really want a deep dive, which probably people

1624
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:26,000
would say we're good, but let me show, well, okay. Let me describe what this is first and

1625
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:33,440
then I'll show you what it looks like. Rare VTG 1950s sterling silver,

1626
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:37,520
Chuck-O the birthday clown wishing ring Disneyland.

1627
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:47,440
Chuck-O the birthday clown. And let me show you what the ring looks like. Here it is.

1628
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:54,800
I have it on the TV. Here he is. He's Chuck-O the birthday clown. Now that didn't work how

1629
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:02,160
I wanted it to. Now you might say, I get so many notifications from Disneyland. So when I put my

1630
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:10,560
phone, so that's Chuck-O. Here's the thing. Chuck-O is a real clown. He died about 10 years ago. He

1631
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:16,240
was a local Los Angeles clown and he had a TV show where kids would celebrate their birthday.

1632
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:22,160
And like, it was a long waiting list to get on Chuck-O's TV show, like a five year waiting

1633
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:29,920
list to celebrate your birthday on Chuck-O's show. And Chuck-O not only, actually now I should put

1634
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:35,440
that actually back up. Chuck-O not only has this wishing ring that they would give out at Disneyland,

1635
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:46,560
he also, and this comes with it, was the menu for a restaurant at Disneyland. What? So gourmet

1636
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:54,960
Disneyland children's plates. Oh, children love grilled filet of soul. Roast turkey, broiled lamb

1637
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:03,040
chop, ground around steak patty, jello and cream. 25 cents. What the fuck is bib juices? Bib juices,

1638
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:12,240
no idea. Pear and cottage cheese salad. I mean, hamburger in a bun with cat soup. Yes. This isn't

1639
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:18,080
says copyright 1961 and it's the happiest clown in town. It says, and Chuck-O's face is on the

1640
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:24,720
other side and it's terrifying. Yes. Well, wait, go back, go back. I think I know the menu is a mask.

1641
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:29,520
The menu is also a mask. So you can wear Chuck-O's face. You can wear Chuck-O's face. Look, there's

1642
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:37,120
eye holes. And here is a headshot of Chuck-O on KBC seven, our local affiliate. Chuck-O the birthday clown.

1643
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:43,760
So Chuck-O was a local LA children's performer who had a Disneyland present. Yes, that is correct.

1644
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:48,400
That's why I'm saying Patreon exclusive Chuck-O. We have to learn about Chuck-O. We have to learn

1645
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:54,160
about Chuck-O. Now you might say, please, can you play me Chuck-O's theme song? And the answer is,

1646
01:30:54,160 --> 01:31:00,640
yes, I can. How many months have you been sitting on this? What many months? Oh my God. His name was

1647
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:07,600
Randy, Randy Runyon, I believe was the man's name. And here is his theme song. The heir to the canyon

1648
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,000
fortune.

1649
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:24,000
Too much echo.

1650
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:37,600
I hate you, Chuck-O. So there's Chuck-O. He was a legend in Los Angeles. Chuck-O dumped over.

1651
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:46,960
So Chuck-O, yeah. Did you find out more about his Disneyland presents? That's what I have. I'm

1652
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:52,080
trying to figure out what restaurant it was and I can't. It's not easily accessible for me here. I

1653
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:59,760
should have done more. I honestly, I forgot to look. We're going to be like, who's the

1654
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,640
reporter in Zodiac? We're going to be like at the LA Times building asking to see their microfiche.

1655
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:09,360
Like, sorry, we're trying to figure out Chuck-O. We've almost got the whole picture put together.

1656
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:17,440
Here's the, I'm finding there's a, oh, Disneyland Hotel is where the restaurant was. Oh, weird.

1657
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:22,880
So that's a little, that's kind of why it wasn't. Right, not in the park. Not in the park, but they

1658
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:27,680
did essentially have a mall built into the Disneyland Hotel for a long time. And he would

1659
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:34,800
open the coverage of the Santa Claus Lane Parade, the Hollywood Boulevard Christmas parade, which

1660
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,160
still happens to this day. He would bust through a big drum and bow and salute. That'd be the

1661
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:46,080
beginning of the TV coverage. He also made a lot of appearances at supermarkets and shopping centers.

1662
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:52,640
He'd pull into say the Topanga Plaza, my childhood mall. And there'd be thousands of people as far

1663
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:58,160
as you could see. Thousands of people would show up. He was very popular, it sounds like.

1664
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:05,440
Yeah, totally missed this guy. Chuck-O. Chuck-O. He was at Disney. He opened, wait a minute,

1665
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:11,200
after leaving television, he opened Chuck-O's Party House at Jungle Land in Thousand Oaks.

1666
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,280
Jeez. What's any of that? I don't know what that is. We gotta get there.

1667
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:17,360
This is the history of where I grew up. I don't know about Jungle Land or Chuck-O's Party House.

1668
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:22,400
So that's why we gotta do it. That's why I said we gotta do it. Patreon on

1669
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:27,840
Chuck-O's Party House. This is, he may have died a few years ago,

1670
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:34,000
but like they say, nothing stays dead forever. No. Chuck-O's still alive.

1671
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,800
Chuck-O does feel like, this feels like the start of a Stephen King work.

1672
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:46,000
If we wanted to find out more about Chuck-O, we could read his biography written by his

1673
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,920
widow Millie, the biography from 1994, which is called Our Clowns Hatched.

1674
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,960
This is terrifying. Chuck-O. Maybe Halloween Patreon.

1675
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:03,600
Oh no, I'm too scared. We don't all love haunts now, Mike.

1676
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:09,120
I don't wanna go to Chuck-O's Party House. Would you rather go to Halloween Horror Nights

1677
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:12,560
or go to Chuck-O's? Well, luckily I can't go to,

1678
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:17,120
I'll talk about Chuck-O's Party House, but if it was still there, I wouldn't wanna go there.

1679
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,000
And I don't wanna go to wherever it used to be. It's haunted.

1680
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,360
Yeah, it for sure is haunted. Where is he buried?

1681
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:30,480
Oh, my under this apartment. Oh no, Mike's pulling off his face

1682
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,520
to reveal Chuck-O's face. I'm Chuck-O.

1683
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,280
He was always a local clown. He's shoving bib juice down our

1684
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:43,040
throats. I gotta figure out what bib juice is. It's weird I don't know what bib juice is.

1685
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,040
For sure you drink bib juice. You just don't know it.

1686
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,280
What does it mean? I don't know.

1687
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:55,200
It sounds to me like if your bib caught all of the various foods that have spilled on you as a baby

1688
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,840
and then it was all combined into a mush. Yeah, maybe.

1689
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:02,240
So maybe it's like all the kitchen's droppings like ground up.

1690
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:10,880
Is it a name for like, it looks like it might be a name for the juices that come in bags that are

1691
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:16,480
put in boxes and you put the boxes in the dispenser. Maybe.

1692
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:22,320
Do you know what I'm talking about? If you ever look at a restaurant next to the soda fountain,

1693
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:27,760
there's the juice dispenser. Those are boxes and those are industrial boxes filled with bags of

1694
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,440
juice. Why would you buy that? Why would you sell it as that?

1695
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:35,920
Bib juice. There'll be a Patreon on bib juices too.

1696
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,800
I'm very unsettled now. Do you want to guess how much that

1697
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:46,480
wishing ring plus the menu and the headshot. That's a lot of stuff. If you're a Chuck-O fan,

1698
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:52,320
that's invaluable. Let me guess $600. Jason? I'll say $100.

1699
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,840
$425. $425. Oh, okay.

1700
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,320
So I win the over under. So Scott wins that.

1701
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,800
Wow. For all that Chuck-O memorabilia.

1702
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,920
That doesn't mean that I have to have it now. That means that you've bid on it with $600.

1703
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:11,840
You offered $600. You won it. That's where bib juice comes from.

1704
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:16,400
So these are like hotels. The orange juice dispenser machine, I guess is known

1705
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:21,520
in the beverage industry as bib juice. Well, don't throw that beverage industry

1706
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,640
insider shit at me. Yeah, I don't.

1707
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:33,200
Tell me on your menu what it is, Chuck-O. Even ground round is an old food turn. There used

1708
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:37,280
to be a chain of restaurants called the ground round. That's the only way I know. It was like

1709
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:43,280
an early Benegans TGI Fridays kind of place. They would bring you popcorn instead of bread.

1710
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,520
Fresh pop, buttery popcorn. I like that.

1711
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,000
Yeah. Free bib juice.

1712
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,720
Free. The ring was not mass produced item.

1713
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,360
The woman who's selling her aunt worked at Pars, which is a jewelry company at this time,

1714
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:01,040
and told me they were commissioned for a celebrity's child's birthday party

1715
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:04,560
and were given out as party favors to the children who attend it.

1716
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,880
There were only 50 ordered and the extras were returned back for credit.

1717
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,880
Here. This is a real

1718
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,400
hardcore Chuck-O fan delight. Was this celebrity arrested and

1719
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,040
put away where they could never? Doesn't mention that.

1720
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,880
Yeah. Never terrified children again.

1721
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:26,000
The extras were returned back for credit because the people who received them died mysteriously

1722
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,400
soon after. Wait a minute. Check his fingers. It's the ring again.

1723
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:34,320
Oh, it's the ring again. The dozenth kid this month.

1724
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,520
I. Yeah. So, all right. So this is-

1725
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,400
Chuck-O might be one of our greatest discoveries on this podcast.

1726
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:50,240
Chuck-O, I think this is another, we have to look into a lot of different IP purchasing,

1727
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:53,520
like Marvel McFay, of course, famously and other characters.

1728
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,280
You mean that we own the rights.

1729
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:59,440
So we would be able to control Marvel McFay and like license movies and stuff.

1730
01:37:59,440 --> 01:37:59,840
Bear Metal Family.

1731
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,560
Bear Metal Family.

1732
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:01,360
Chuck-O.

1733
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:06,560
And I think Chuck-O, I'm sure the family owns the intellectual property on Chuck-O,

1734
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,400
but perhaps that's something we look into when one of us takes over the mantle of Chuck-O.

1735
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,720
Did Jason, are you interested?

1736
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,880
Yeah, you did. He pointed at me so fast.

1737
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:20,880
I'll be Chuck-O if you won't. I will take over as Chuck-O. I will declare that. But if you want

1738
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,560
Chuck-O, I'm willing to give it to you.

1739
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:26,960
I mean, if my country is asking me to serve, by which I mean being Chuck-O,

1740
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:29,360
and if the curse is not giving me any choice.

1741
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,480
Well, maybe it is. Maybe it's more like the Harry Potter wand and the Chuck-O. When we

1742
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,480
get the ring, it'll choose one of us.

1743
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,640
Yeah, it's not going to fit all three of us.

1744
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:41,760
Obviously, because Jason and I are both willing, it's of course going to choose

1745
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,760
Scott and Scott will have to become Chuck-O.

1746
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:50,480
No, I'm a host. It's a parasite that you're going to buy that mask. You're going to take it out of

1747
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:55,280
the envelope and it's going to come to life and press itself against my face and be my face.

1748
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,080
Yep. And you will.

1749
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,960
And my blood will become bib juice.

1750
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,760
And podcast the ride will be hosted by Mike, Jason and Chuck-O.

1751
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,680
Scott is...

1752
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,680
I'm more fun than Scott was.

1753
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:09,760
The ratings go through the roof. America looks Chuck-O.

1754
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,120
Sorry, Scott.

1755
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:12,960
You're always missing something.

1756
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,880
You are unfortunately Harvey Dent and Chuck-O is Batman.

1757
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:22,480
Chuck-O is the hero we need, but you are the hero we deserve. Unfortunately, Chuck-O.

1758
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:27,920
If I can fight it off and Chuck-O only takes over half of my face, then it's exactly the Harvey

1759
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,240
Well, what if you were two-faced with the Chuck-O?

1760
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,200
Oh, no.

1761
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:32,180
Wow.

1762
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:35,920
I want wine. No, you want bib juice.

1763
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:39,780
Oh, man.

1764
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:43,680
The podcast the ride is hosted by... The next episode we'll start with,

1765
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:48,160
it's a podcast hosted by two theme park fans and one man whose face was half taken over by a clown

1766
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:53,040
mask and he airs out his soul's intergrievences in every episode.

1767
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,520
I feel like fan art is really called for right now. I have to say.

1768
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,320
Oh, no.

1769
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,040
Scott Two-Face.

1770
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,720
I'll only look at half of it.

1771
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:02,640
Scott Two-Face as Chuck-O.

1772
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:05,680
Well, Scott, how are you fighting Chuck-O today?

1773
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:10,240
I filled a barrel with bib juice. I'm trying to age it into Sauvignon Blanc.

1774
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,880
In seven years, the bib juice will be sweet wine again.

1775
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:18,560
That is the end.

1776
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,360
Stop it. Stop, Chuck-O.

1777
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:27,120
Aaron's my wife now. No, you stay away from her.

1778
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,200
She is also unfortunately Chuck-O.

1779
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:35,600
Our clowns hatch.

1780
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:43,840
The run of the rings leapt into her ear and crawled into her brain and made her Chuck-O.

1781
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,280
Oh, she's Chuck-O now.

1782
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:51,520
This is no longer the PhilharMagic episode. It is the Chuck-O episode.

1783
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,720
I never thought I'd miss the PhilharMagic episode so much.

1784
01:40:55,200 --> 01:41:01,280
Oh, God. We barely survived Podcast The Ride. I'm going to have bad dreams forever.

1785
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:05,280
I almost choked to death trying to do a bad Donald. This was a harrowing one.

1786
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:12,400
But go to Patreon.com slash Podcast The Ride where eventually, unfortunately,

1787
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,400
there will be a Chuck-O episode.

1788
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,680
Hey, meet me there.

1789
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,320
I'm Chuck-O. I'm Chuck-O. Scott's Chuck-O.

1790
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,360
Scott's Chuck-O.

1791
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,800
Oh, no. Stop it.

1792
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:27,520
I'm getting out of here. If you want to plug anything else, do it yourself.

1793
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,840
All right. Well, you go to all of our stuff, Podcast The Ride Instagram.

1794
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,000
We can email us, PodcastTheRide.gmail. We're on Twitter at PodcastTheRide.

1795
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,320
Email spam. That's what I want. I want viruses.

1796
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,520
Classic Chuck-O.

1797
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:45,520
We have shirts at T-Public, but we may have to add a Chuck-O shirt,

1798
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:51,680
an unlicensed Chuck-O shirt. We have to ask the family if that's okay to do some Chuck-O merch.

1799
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:53,440
Scott-O, Chuck-Scott.

1800
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:56,000
Once you put the shirt on, you could never take it off.

1801
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,560
The shirt will become one with you. You will laugh like that forever.

1802
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,080
Honestly, it's a better way to live.

1803
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:05,920
And just a reminder to all our listeners, sometimes dead is better.

1804
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,480
Sometimes you don't want to bury the Chuck-O ring in the pet cemetery.

1805
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:13,600
That's true. So I think, yeah, that we're good.

1806
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,120
We'll see you later.

1807
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,800
See you in your dreams.

1808
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:26,880
