1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:10,320
When your town has made you frown, When your swear has made you swear,

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:19,920
When life gives you one more punch, You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge,

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:29,520
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol, A place that features part of the Berlin Wall,

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,540
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks, A place where you can tattoo your lower back,

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:47,540
So let's go take a walk, let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight, tonight.

6
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:55,260
Podcast The Ride presents the City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness, a daily,

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,920
extremely necessary series, exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder that make up

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,300
Universal City Walk Orlando.

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,180
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the City Walk Orlando Saga,

10
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,320
Multiverse of Madness, day something.

11
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,500
I couldn't begin to tell you, I have no clue at this point.

12
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,120
It would be nice if we had, the SectorCuper, excuse me, had named everything just sort of one through

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,420
2019, because I think actually I would be better in my head and I understand what day it was,

14
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,560
but I don't know what day it is.

15
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,080
There was sort of a clarity to just a count, but now with phases

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,840
we're all over the map.

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,980
It's his fault, it's not our fault for doing this.

18
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,340
No, he mapped it out.

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:37,960
If you have a

20
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,860
problem with this, you take it up with the SectorCuper, as we might.

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,180
I mean look, you know,

22
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,240
tensions have been high and I don't, you know, actually we're, he's kind of not in

23
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:56,740
sight currently, because last that you heard from us yesterday, we narrowly escaped the land of

24
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,740
Neverbilts and Fallen Brothers.

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,960
Barely, I was surprised how much I enjoyed the company of the

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,620
SectorCuper.

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,500
Yeah, he was cool.

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,420
Yeah, yeah.

29
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,520
So, you know, we dug him.

30
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,280
SectorCuper gave us this

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,180
confusing map and numerical system.

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,700
Maybe we don't get along with him the next time we see him.

33
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:18,800
I

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,680
don't know how it's going to be.

35
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,820
You know, as soon as we did that, I went home and found out

36
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:32,600
that all those Moldarama machines I spoke so lovingly about have now appeared in the land of

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,220
Fallen Brothers.

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,320
They all got removed.

39
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,180
Is that true?

40
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,020
Yes.

41
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:36,780
Whoa.

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,460
They're not, wait, the Orlando one?

43
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,300
The ones that you touted using yesterday, where you made the little clock.

44
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,520
No way.

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,220
Hopefully they're being,

46
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,420
you know, refurbished and put back, but no guarantees.

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,840
What are the chances of that though?

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,780
No guarantees.

49
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,900
It doesn't sound right.

50
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,560
It doesn't sound right.

51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,660
But maybe, I mean,

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,340
you think like maybe the guy, like the guy who fixes all the machines went around and rounded

53
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,860
them up and he's taking them back to his workshop to get them just right.

54
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,000
Like was the Grinch,

55
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,160
that the Grinch would say that?

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,740
It's hard to say.

57
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,780
Like all the Chicago ones are an entity and then

58
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,860
Universal had some, but they were serviced by someone else.

59
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,200
Yeah.

60
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Oh, it's a whole thing.

61
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,640
So

62
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,500
there was probably like a Cindy Lou who, who was like, Mr.

63
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,520
Where are you taking all the Moldarama

64
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:21,980
machines?

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,300
And he's like, I'm taking them to my workshop.

66
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:24,920
Yes.

67
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,320
Yeah.

68
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,080
Fix them up really nicely.

69
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:35,940
So for all we know, like an Anvil falling on a looney tune, the sector creeper was just down there

70
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,920
blasting his stogies and a bunch of Moldarama machines appeared on his head.

71
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:41,780
Probably.

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,050
He was

73
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:44,890
narrowly avoided.

74
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,570
I'm not sure if he made it.

75
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,410
What with all of the fuel rod kiosks

76
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,150
shooting up in his direction.

77
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:51,910
I don't know.

78
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,770
It doesn't bode well.

79
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,670
The rules of his world were

80
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,450
big bulky items could crush him and kill him at any time.

81
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,410
I wouldn't want to be him, but I did

82
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,570
like hanging out with him.

83
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,210
I also almost feel a little bit, by the way, I'm Scott Garner.

84
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:07,450
There's

85
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,570
my name is Mike Carlson.

86
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,750
I don't know how much we need.

87
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,790
If you're here now, you know.

88
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,290
So we just

89
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,290
started with this episode.

90
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,870
Someone first.

91
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,810
They always say, you know, you make your, this could

92
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,010
be anyone's first podcast.

93
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,230
So make it very accessible.

94
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,630
And we've done the opposite with all

95
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:21,890
of these.

96
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,050
I think, I think is that besides this, the series, I think the regular episodes have

97
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,870
been inaccessible.

98
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:28,550
Yeah.

99
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,150
For some time, at least half a decade, we are just, we're just digging

100
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,610
deeper and deep burrowing into the core of the earth.

101
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,250
That's right.

102
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,250
As we will a little more,

103
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:45,570
because if you didn't listen to fallen brothers and never built, I, there's actually a little bit

104
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:45,790
more.

105
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,850
I caught a few as we were running for our lives out of there.

106
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,130
I saw a few, and I don't know

107
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,250
if you clocked these, but these are late breaking.

108
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,750
I didn't see them in time to mention them in that

109
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,930
episode, not fallen brothers, but never built.

110
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,590
And I feel like we have to say, I'm, cause they're all

111
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:02,970
kind of crazy.

112
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,650
I don't know how far any of these got off the ground, but you know, at least proposed

113
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,470
or even maybe like on a survey of like, would the people like to do this in city walk Orlando,

114
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:13,990
right?

115
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,630
A German beer hall, which would have been in the space of that legacy store that you liked

116
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,930
with the mold orama, uh, didn't happen.

117
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,510
A robot cabaret show, a la that one in Tokyo that everybody's

118
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,850
trying to push into robot kind of like the, yeah, yeah, I think so.

119
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,070
Yeah.

120
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,270
Yeah.

121
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,830
But it seemed kind

122
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,050
of like annoying or touristy or so.

123
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,210
I didn't realize there was a reservation because we tried

124
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,770
to go there, but there are like this reservation.

125
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,610
So we didn't get to do it like months and months

126
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,210
out or something.

127
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:40,950
Okay.

128
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,750
Well, uh, might've been the same there.

129
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,190
I don't know.

130
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:43,910
Or a different rope.

131
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,070
I I'm not sure the deal.

132
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,830
Uh, uh, some regional food stuffs, EMAC and bolios ice cream.

133
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,250
I think

134
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,730
it was very close to coming in.

135
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,450
Well, now EMAC and bolios, uh, is in the hard rock hotel.

136
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:56,690
Uh,

137
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:04,410
that is the ice cream parlor from Boston that got popular with rock acts cause it would stay open

138
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:04,610
late.

139
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,890
That is the one that is this is their, that's their mythology.

140
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,110
That's their lore,

141
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,070
which I'm sure we're going to hit a lot today.

142
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,430
They almost called this place the hard rock act

143
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,930
cafe.

144
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,610
And then they cleaned it up a little bit.

145
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,050
So EMAC and bolios was the place that I was trying

146
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:31,330
to find in area 15 cause in Vegas, cause it was, it was there the first year or two and then it

147
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:31,850
was gone.

148
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,590
So by the time I got there, it was like a repeat of little me asking about Marvel

149
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,030
media.

150
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,870
Just every Vegas worker was like, nah, I don't know what you're talking about, man.

151
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,290
She's searching for answers.

152
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,730
They aren't, they aren't all as informed as you.

153
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,490
They can provide

154
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,250
you no help.

155
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,290
It's still pretty good.

156
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,630
I went there at the hard rock hotel when we were down.

157
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:53,870
What

158
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,330
flavor ice cream flavor?

159
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,850
I think I had like one of those like cookie monster flavors where they

160
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,850
cookie dough and cookies and green.

161
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,390
Any colors in there?

162
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,610
No, this one was not colored.

163
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:05,970
I know

164
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,070
that's often blue.

165
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,550
I like when it's blue.

166
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,130
It's a little less fun when it's full of food color.

167
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,910
But it's very rich ice cream.

168
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:13,530
Okay.

169
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,030
That's what I saw on a list of never built for city walk,

170
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,710
but maybe I guess if you're all right, if it's at the heart, maybe that was always the intended plan.

171
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,730
Well, it was very, it had a lot of, it's now a totally white like minimalist space because it's

172
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:33,070
also the quick service and the general store and the ice cream counter like next to the

173
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,710
restaurant.

174
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,470
What would the vibe be if it's not that what's a really mac and bolos in Boston?

175
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,170
Aesthetically very similar to Ben and Jerry's another New England ice cream.

176
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:45,630
Okay.

177
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,070
Like a

178
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,370
little hippie dippy, you know, did they steal it?

179
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,070
Did one steal the idea from the other?

180
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,550
I don't know.

181
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,030
I don't know.

182
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,710
I've always been wondering that I've poked around a little, but I don't think I saw

183
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,990
any like blood feud, any Crips versus Bloods for you, mac and polio.

184
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,470
So that and Jerry's,

185
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,850
the idea of two names in a psychedelic ice cream place.

186
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,130
So it's like a grateful, when you say rock

187
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:14,090
people, it's grateful dead rockers, maybe not, uh, you know, CBG be rockers.

188
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,490
Well, uh, no, don't you

189
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:22,570
mean you just mean you mean bands now, no touring bands in like the seventies or whatever.

190
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:22,830
Yeah.

191
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,950
Everything closed at nine or whatever.

192
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,610
Okay.

193
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,750
Oh, I don't know.

194
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,510
I don't know either.

195
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,930
I don't think

196
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,910
it'd be CBG beast type bands.

197
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,730
It was Billy.

198
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,570
It was Billy Idol ever in there.

199
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,970
I'm just trying to

200
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,130
think, was it like leather jacket rock guys or was it more Jerry Garcia rock guys?

201
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,270
That's good

202
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:42,790
question.

203
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,310
Yeah.

204
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,830
Cause I will, or maybe the aesthetic had nothing to do with it.

205
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,570
It was just literally

206
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,170
was open late and they already had like a hippie aesthetic.

207
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,790
That may be what it is.

208
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,250
Yeah.

209
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,470
Sounds

210
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,210
like that might be more likely.

211
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,830
Sure.

212
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,010
Google EMAC and polio rock acts.

213
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,790
We'll find out rock acts.

214
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,470
Oh, well here's on their website as a picture of Steve and Zant there.

215
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,690
So there you go.

216
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,210
Do you

217
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,850
qualify him more as a Billy Idol or is more of a Jerry Garcia, the two types of rocker.

218
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,630
Good question.

219
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,790
What a good question.

220
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,710
How to even define cause little Steven on his own is much more with his

221
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,210
disciples of soul is much more rock and roll of the fifties and sixties, but with Bruce in some

222
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,030
own genre, but I guess it would fall also in line with like a meatloaf too, very like theatrical.

223
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,650
So it's really tough.

224
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,410
I gotta work this out.

225
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,750
I can work it out more.

226
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,850
If you want on the

227
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,170
podcast.

228
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,430
That's an option or we could keep saying other things.

229
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,230
We keep saying words of any other

230
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:33,230
kind.

231
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,610
I want to know the unbuilt.

232
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,090
Yes.

233
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,850
Well, thank God.

234
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,190
I would, of course we would.

235
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:38,730
I know

236
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,310
normally everyone likes to hear it, but today we have business.

237
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,550
Could have been an in and out there

238
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,370
that was vaguely discussed, but also, but that's, that'd be the furthest east in and out,

239
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,470
at least at the time by long shot.

240
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,470
Um, but here's really the big one.

241
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,530
And this, I think they, I think

242
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,770
they made major steps in this direction.

243
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,190
And I don't know where this would have been.

244
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,510
Um, but,

245
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:06,630
this was definitely floated fairly publicly strong rumor of something called the SNL lounge.

246
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,510
Of course, with NBC universal ownership, it makes all the sense in the world.

247
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,810
They would try to

248
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:23,730
parlay the most popular brand and late night comedy to a physical space where, uh, tourists could, uh,

249
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:30,310
dine amongst props from the, uh, at the time of this article, 42 year history of the show.

250
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:37,370
Uh, what could have been, that would have been amazing to have, uh, awful wings next to mango

251
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,590
shorts.

252
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,210
Well, would they serve like a bill braskie size cocktails perhaps, or at least I guess maybe they

253
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,930
couldn't just like, cause bill brask, if you don't know, was a sketch where guys would say, uh,

254
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,130
they were at a funeral probably, or at a baseball game talking about a guy loud drunk business,

255
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,030
and they would have giant glasses of whiskey.

256
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:57,870
Really huge.

257
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,390
Um, I don't know if I had to guess,

258
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,330
I think that probably the premise would have been a restaurant that's like all the other restaurants,

259
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,130
except there's a cone head around.

260
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:07,710
Okay.

261
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,390
Yeah.

262
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,490
There'd be like one outfit maybe.

263
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,490
I think so.

264
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:11,890
Yeah.

265
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,070
Yeah.

266
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,410
Like the one, you know, there's, yeah, there, yeah.

267
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,870
Well, you gotta have, you have to,

268
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:21,910
you have to have some bees because then if diners are like, this is a new establishment,

269
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,390
am I going to be enjoying it here?

270
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,670
They walk in, they see a beer or two and they're laughing,

271
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,390
they're laughing their asses off at the bees.

272
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,730
And then, uh, they feel comfortable to have a meal.

273
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,610
Well, you know, what would have been some of their signature entrees?

274
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,850
What, what do you think?

275
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,330
Cheap burger, cheep burger.

276
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,370
Another one.

277
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,310
50 year old sketch.

278
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,410
Funny, funny stuff.

279
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:45,990
Pepsi.

280
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,050
They would have gotten in trouble because maybe they would have been a Coke restaurant.

281
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:50,590
Coke is

282
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,210
universal.

283
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:51,770
Pepsi.

284
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,330
They got the freestyle machines.

285
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,950
They would have, they couldn't have said Pepsi,

286
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,470
Pepsi.

287
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,590
If they didn't line up with, you know, I like the idea they would stick just to the first

288
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,390
five years.

289
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,650
Maybe that's the premise.

290
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,610
But you'd only be able to possibly that is a lot of,

291
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,790
there's a lot of things out there that are like, you know, we've been laughing for,

292
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,570
and then it's Mr.

293
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:17,350
Bill and the, um, you know, the nerds, um, the, is that what the name of them were

294
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,010
and the samurai?

295
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,810
I'm sure.

296
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,170
I bet if you revisited the samurai, everything would be hunky dory with

297
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:24,990
samurai.

298
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,830
It's the stuff I like.

299
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,150
I think I like is like the acroid Irwin mainway stuff.

300
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,950
Most resembles what comedy is today.

301
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,210
It most resembles a sketch with a premise,

302
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:44,190
with performances in it and not just a bunch of like weird druggy posturing.

303
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:51,110
I was going to say the host is the host or hostess should be the two blues brothers and they dance

304
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,190
your seat.

305
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,190
But if they want to do a front, a throwback, you can be seated by like a Chevy

306
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,570
chase, Gerald Ford, and they could fall their way to you.

307
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,470
You want waiters, you want to throw back

308
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,310
to three years before the early stuff.

309
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,850
And you have to request that.

310
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,970
Can I have you go up to the

311
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:17,330
stand and you go, can I have a waiter that's doing the Gerald Ford, Gerald Ford, if anybody's there

312
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,750
is willing to take the bump.

313
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,770
I got an acroid Jimmy Carter, Jerry Gerald for calling sick.

314
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:31,090
Yeah, it's kind of nondescript, kind of a weird and it's he's got the skin color painted over the

315
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,430
mustache.

316
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,610
I was going to say that was one where he didn't shave his mustache.

317
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,390
He did the Caesar

318
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,170
Romero for yeah.

319
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,350
This is this sucks.

320
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,750
This really I wish was there.

321
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,550
Yeah, yeah, I really do.

322
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,310
I don't

323
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,410
comedy oriented restaurant.

324
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,190
Well, they have the closest thing they have is those

325
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,690
it's sugar things in Hollywood that's that are the SNL products.

326
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,390
Yes.

327
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,030
Oh yeah.

328
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,550
Schwedie balls and I don't know.

329
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,450
It feels to me like this might have been a vaguely humiliating

330
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,470
idea for anyone involved in the comedy.

331
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,210
I think that's true.

332
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,710
In the menu items.

333
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,350
Here's the thing

334
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,630
though.

335
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,990
This is not off the table.

336
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,790
Could still have as long as this show is on the air, which

337
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,450
don't think there's any chance of it going off the air anytime soon.

338
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,250
I think this is still possible.

339
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,750
Yeah, I'm surprised something like it hasn't happened.

340
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,570
Yeah, I know.

341
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,950
Really?

342
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,370
In New York or

343
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,590
yeah, it feels like it's been sitting there.

344
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,410
It's been sitting there for something much

345
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,010
cheesier to happen with.

346
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,110
Yeah, then it's just I mean, you take the NBC bar and grill, take the

347
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,930
name off the front, call it the SNL Cafe and throw Matt Foley's outfit in a glass case.

348
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,730
And who's

349
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,730
really going to even notice, like you don't even change the sports like art on the wall.

350
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,070
No one

351
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,650
gives a shit.

352
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,110
Sure.

353
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,170
You know, if you order like wings or corn on the cob, they could give you like,

354
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,870
you know, the Kristen Wiig, Lawrence Welk, Andrews Sisters bit.

355
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,990
She's got the little hands that give

356
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,370
you a set of little hands.

357
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,690
So your hands don't get messy when you're eating corn or wings.

358
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,370
Uh huh.

359
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,910
That's as recent as we're getting though.

360
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,390
Okay.

361
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:06,870
Yeah.

362
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,270
Okay.

363
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,070
I'm fine with that.

364
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,230
Yeah,

365
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,230
you're getting two nods to post 2005.

366
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,210
Right.

367
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,730
You're not getting Bill Braske.

368
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,550
People don't,

369
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,730
the average theme park goer probably doesn't really have so much affection for Bill Braske.

370
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,690
Yeah, I don't think I don't think a whole wing of the restaurant will be devoted to writing my

371
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,190
donkey political talk show.

372
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,150
This is where my taste lies in the show.

373
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,730
The Patrick Stewart erotic cake

374
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,170
sketch.

375
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,450
I don't think it's gonna.

376
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,730
If they served them, if they made every cake that which is the

377
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,650
it was always women going to the bathroom.

378
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,230
Correct.

379
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,170
Patrick Stewart was working in an erotic bakery

380
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,350
that only sold cakes in the shape of women going to the bathroom.

381
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,050
And he couldn't understand

382
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,650
anything but that being erotic when anybody had any other pitch.

383
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,070
Right.

384
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:51,830
Of a cake.

385
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,010
That's the only

386
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,830
his, his narrow view of erotic is only that.

387
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:56,430
Okay.

388
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:56,690
Yeah.

389
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:56,970
I will.

390
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,770
The only way that I approve of the

391
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:03,070
SNL land is if they offer a full array of Patrick Stewart described cakes.

392
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:03,910
Uh huh.

393
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,550
That's good.

394
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:04,910
All

395
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,290
right.

396
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:05,330
Okay.

397
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,870
Well then then I'm in on that.

398
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,230
Okay.

399
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,170
That that closes out never built.

400
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:09,650
But listeners,

401
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,950
if you somehow know more, what am I saying?

402
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,150
No, don't tell us.

403
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,770
We don't want to do more of these.

404
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,450
What are we talking about?

405
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,030
What am I tying us into?

406
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,110
Don't tell us anything.

407
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,330
I, when this is over,

408
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,950
I don't want to know any more information about city walk Orlando ever.

409
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:24,770
Yeah.

410
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:25,670
Okay.

411
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,750
Back to sanity.

412
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,990
Anyway, uh, that said, why don't we go to the sector keeper and find out what it is we're,

413
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,990
doing today.

414
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:39,500
Boys, boys phase four sector one is hard rock cafe and hard rock live.

415
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,250
Good luck getting down boys.

416
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,890
Boy, I can't miss the creeper right now.

417
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,590
How much lemur is his voice

418
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,390
sound these days?

419
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:49,810
He does.

420
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,110
Yeah.

421
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,950
I mean, he doesn't have that cool edge.

422
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:52,730
Yeah.

423
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,910
I like a cool guy with

424
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,730
a cool voice and that is what the sector creeper was like.

425
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,470
Yeah, I know.

426
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:57,850
Yeah.

427
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,250
Yeah.

428
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,330
That that

429
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,190
fry.

430
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,270
Yeah.

431
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,130
Yeah.

432
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,270
Oh God.

433
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,670
Well, I don't think we don't make the rules of this.

434
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:06,930
I don't think

435
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:11,210
we're allowed to replace a good sector to bring up the unbuilt SNL cafe.

436
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,390
Cause I feel like that's a

437
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:20,490
great example where like the popular consciousness idea of SNL and the way that they occasionally

438
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,450
market it for like, yeah, novelty cereals or like Halloween costumes.

439
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,730
They'll do like real,

440
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,330
sometimes there will be, yeah, they'll really, they really will sell this Spartan cheerleaders.

441
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,090
That'd be so much Spartan cheerleader presence.

442
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,630
Yes.

443
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,460
Just like nobody thinking about those

444
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,870
in decades.

445
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,750
For a long time.

446
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,150
It will be all cheerleader stuff.

447
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,610
But that is hard rock cafe

448
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:51,810
occasionally, very often, occasionally, very often veers into that idea with quote unquote rock and

449
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,030
roll.

450
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:52,990
That's all it is.

451
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:52,990
Sure.

452
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,030
Yes.

453
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,910
This version for kind of this, this very populist for everybody

454
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,930
with a lot of the recurring figures and the, you know, that it's all way they, cause they,

455
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,330
we've seen, we'll see it here.

456
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,710
There's a thousand things like this hard rock park.

457
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,750
We've talked about a lot of iterations of hard rock cafe and here we are again,

458
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:15,030
but they love to do it's Mount Rushmore and on Mount Rushmore is Elvis and Bob Marley.

459
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,970
And it's the, and then it's the statue of Liberty and it's a Jimi Hendrix and he's holding a guitar

460
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,230
instead of a torch.

461
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,710
Yeah.

462
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,210
And yes, they make, they turn the statue of Liberty into a man

463
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,790
cause they can't think of a female rock star to use.

464
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,190
There's none.

465
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,050
Who's it going to be?

466
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,930
Lita Ford.

467
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,710
I don't know if people know who that is.

468
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,370
It should be Lita Ford.

469
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,190
I would like that again.

470
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,710
That would be cool.

471
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,190
The deeper these places cut,

472
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,010
a Lita Ford.

473
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,310
I don't think I know any Lita Ford song, but I would love to see a Lita Ford statue

474
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,750
of Liberty.

475
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,410
But here we are at, I think one of the biggest icons in this we're in, we're across the

476
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,010
lake now.

477
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,590
We're like, this is like, these are the big icons that you see, um, you know,

478
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,830
waiting you over on the park side of things.

479
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,510
And boy is this entire facility grand.

480
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,790
My God,

481
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:11,190
is this, and it's tough to say cause it's right next to Toothsome Chocolate Emporium, but is,

482
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:17,230
is hard rock this facility, could it be the most ostentatious restaurant in the world?

483
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,470
Oh, the world.

484
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,070
Yeah.

485
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,710
The only competition is being other hard rock cafes.

486
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:22,630
Yeah.

487
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:29,730
The original one, I was reading a lot about the original one, uh, which at one point in time

488
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,130
was one of the most successful restaurants in the world.

489
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:34,730
Yeah.

490
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,010
First hard rock cafe in Florida,

491
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:43,530
first in Orlando, first built from the ground up one, because before that they had all taken over

492
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,970
existing spaces.

493
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,850
Every, yeah, they just like, you know, the doors having to bend to the

494
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,490
censorship.

495
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,430
No, they didn't.

496
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,390
They said it just like the Rolling Stones having to sensor their own

497
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,770
lyrics.

498
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,390
The original hard rock cafe is all had to fit in some confined existing space.

499
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,830
Yeah.

500
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:10,290
They boxed them in, but this time they could rock as hard as they would, as big as they wanted to.

501
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:17,650
Two, they, including one that they closed when the second location, the newer location was ready.

502
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,330
Yes.

503
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,810
I don't think that ever occurred to me that they only ever closed the first one,

504
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,890
which famously had a guitar shaped pedestrian bridge.

505
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:27,910
Uh huh.

506
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,230
Yeah.

507
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,310
This is, so what you're

508
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:34,670
describing is, you know, before there was City Walk, when there wasn't even a glimmer of an

509
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:43,190
E-Zone, they, one of the only, like the only sort of outside restaurant on the universal Florida

510
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,250
property was this hard rock cafe.

511
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,290
This was opening day, 1990, along with the rest of the park,

512
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,370
massive, sprawling.

513
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:58,050
Uh, I saw it described as like it's Graceland plus ancient Rome.

514
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,510
It's like all of it.

515
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,730
It's this, it's a temple.

516
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,170
It's a temple to rock.

517
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,650
Um, and you might have read the

518
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:12,130
same article I did that the, how they landed on the placement of it.

519
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,510
And this is, this is a great

520
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:14,790
moment.

521
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,350
I mean, take, take the wheel, take the lead, take the solo.

522
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,250
Well, I don't think I have

523
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,370
the exact wording right in front of me.

524
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,630
So if you have it, go ahead.

525
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:23,630
Okay, sure.

526
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,110
Um, this is from the,

527
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,590
the Orlando Informer.

528
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,250
Um, when the partnership between Universal and Hard Rock first came out,

529
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,830
the company's president at the time, Robert Earl.

530
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,710
Earl is back, baby.

531
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,410
You almost forget,

532
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,570
you think of him as the planet Hollywood guy.

533
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,590
You think of him as the Earl of Sandwich guy,

534
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,930
a big presence in sagas at this point, at least the last one.

535
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,810
Uh, and I'm glad he's, I'm glad he's

536
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,390
with us here.

537
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,290
Bucatepepo, of course, also.

538
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,970
Um, so Robert Earl was given a choice of locations,

539
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,450
for the cafe.

540
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,790
Would you, would it be inside Universal Studios, Florida?

541
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,890
So the ticket

542
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:06,970
holders get to go, or would it be outside where I'm going to quote the actual article,

543
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:13,010
where all the rest of the city beautifuls, residents and tourists could get easy access

544
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,110
to city beautiful.

545
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,330
City beautiful, Orlando city beautiful.

546
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,050
Um, so you got a choice, Robert,

547
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,530
do you want it to be inside the park or do you want it to be outside the park?

548
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,830
What about both?

549
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,650
He said, and then twiddled his little fingers, I would imagine.

550
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:31,890
And then a guy

551
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,310
behind him played a killer electric guitar grip.

552
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,970
And then all of his staffers heads exploded because they couldn't even, they couldn't handle

553
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,070
the create the Hard Rock energy of that idea.

554
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,350
How could a restaurant be in both the inside and the

555
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,510
outside of a theme park?

556
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:54,230
You mean we'll have to order two more turnstiles and three more hand stamps?

557
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,310
Holy shit, Robert.

558
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,450
Don't bore me with the details.

559
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,390
That's not what I want to hear.

560
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,970
I want to go shop

561
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,890
for more flouncy shirts with busy patterns.

562
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,390
I want to come back and you figure out how it works.

563
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:15,910
So yeah, it's going to be both one entrance for the park guests where you get hand stamps.

564
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,190
So you

565
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:21,630
can come so they know who's who, uh, to separate you from the riff raff and another for everyone

566
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:27,930
else at a price tag of $5 million, a massive sum of money for just one building at the time.

567
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:33,930
But how will people get from the parking lot to the restaurant?

568
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,810
They'll be crushed.

569
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,730
Cars will

570
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,690
mow them down for an over.

571
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,710
No, no, no.

572
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,150
There will be actually this.

573
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,690
There's another.

574
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,310
This actually

575
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:46,230
is how it was pitched that they said, well, Robert, there will be a pedestrian walkway you see,

576
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,750
that will.

577
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,770
And he's like, no, that's not interesting enough.

578
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,050
Make it a, give it a rock

579
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,610
flair.

580
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:59,710
And they came back and they said, what if the entire restaurant sits on a big platform

581
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,870
that is a giant concrete guitar?

582
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,290
Uh, and if you see that from the sky, that's what you're looking at.

583
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:14,410
So the pedestrian bridge is the neck of the guitar complete with fiber optic strings at the top that

584
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,430
lit it up at night.

585
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,350
And of course I'm making fun of this and I'm making fun of Robert Earl.

586
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,150
Um,

587
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,970
and I didn't, let me admit, I didn't go to this original one, but I've seen a lot of photos.

588
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,330
It was so fucking cool.

589
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,670
This building is awesome.

590
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,030
And it really takes me back to 1990.

591
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,450
It's like,

592
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:37,850
it's part of it for me when I see those overhead shots anywhere you are in the park, or if you're

593
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:42,610
watching old footage or if you're watching, as I discovered once the beginning of a Michael Winslow

594
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,670
standup special, that's the guy who made all the voices and police academy.

595
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,470
And that was

596
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,550
filmed at Universal Studios.

597
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,690
If you ever see aerial footage or anything, part of it is, what is that?

598
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,010
There's a giant guitar as part of this theme park.

599
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,730
That's so dumb and cool.

600
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,230
Can I say something that

601
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,590
I don't know if it'll be controversial?

602
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,590
I don't think it is.

603
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,450
Is the hard rock more iconic than

604
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:11,610
almost any part of original Universal Studios from an exterior, like architecturally,

605
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,450
or just, you know, you go down Main Street, you see the castle, you go to Spaceship Earth.

606
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:15,890
Oh my God,

607
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:16,670
like go crazy.

608
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,750
Like there's nothing like that.

609
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,050
That's not the strength I wouldn't say of original,

610
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,430
all the attractions are good, but all the attractions are hidden in these back lights.

611
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:25,890
Right.

612
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,390
Exactly.

613
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,710
So, so especially back then, now you could say at least Diagon Alley is like,

614
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,010
oh my God, this is insane looking, but hard rock.

615
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,890
I love that back to the future ride building.

616
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,210
And

617
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,830
I love the photo op where you could put the space shuttle on top of it.

618
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,750
But that's a very specific

619
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,530
after the fact, 1990 world's fairest glass brick thing.

620
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,330
I don't think that's iconic to

621
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,110
everybody.

622
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:50,910
Yes.

623
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,690
And I don't know that there were a lot of eight-year-olds like me who would go like,

624
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,590
that's the recreation of the wild pharmacy where a lot of stars were discovered.

625
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,070
People would like it.

626
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:01,270
Yes.

627
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,210
People liked that.

628
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,150
The famous garden of Aalav.

629
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,490
It's where stars went to get treats.

630
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,130
It was kind of the EMAC and Bollio's of 1950s.

631
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,730
So hard rock is like the weenie or something.

632
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,810
Like what would you call it?

633
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,710
Well, no, because it doesn't like lure you anywhere and you have to be above it to know.

634
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:23,830
All I know is I'm looking at aerial footage or photos now and it's the most ostentatious,

635
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:24,430
dumbest thing.

636
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,530
And it's the first iteration of something.

637
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,050
It's hard to describe.

638
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,730
I think we,

639
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:37,070
three of us get the same sensation from it's a restaurant that's both inside and outside the park.

640
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,750
It is cool.

641
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,570
Why do I care about that?

642
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,010
Why do we think that's neat?

643
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:41,850
Do we know?

644
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,470
I mean,

645
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:49,370
you might say it just is, but is there any psychology to why we think that's so cool?

646
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:55,150
Well, I think there's probably two, there's maybe a more practical reason and then there's a magical

647
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,750
reason.

648
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:01,110
And I think the magical reason is that almost every theme park, it does feel like you're

649
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:05,450
going through a Kronos or a portal or a jump point when you enter the gates.

650
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,310
Yes, or a gate.

651
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,630
There is a sort of psychological thing that happens to you where the music changes.

652
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,290
You get a little

653
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,070
bit of a different feeling and you've passed through this magic.

654
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,530
And it's either in or out.

655
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,730
And when you were a kid, you really had to make those moments count.

656
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,050
Yes.

657
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,010
Maybe it's you're at

658
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,110
whim of your parents.

659
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,390
You go and they decide you can go.

660
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,450
So either I'm in or I'm out.

661
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,230
But the idea

662
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,250
of something that blurs those boundaries.

663
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,730
It's like you're in some sort of limbo.

664
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,730
It's like you're in a phantom zone in a way.

665
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,050
Except like a good one, not a depressing one.

666
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:38,810
Yes, exactly.

667
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,570
Not a prison limbo, but a limbo where you can get mozzarella sticks.

668
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,050
A mix of rock and roll, heaven and hell.

669
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:46,950
Exactly.

670
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,930
Who's a rock and roll angel,

671
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,570
Peggy Lee is there.

672
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,510
Yeah, OK.

673
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:57,050
But also, I don't know who's Bozzy, except he's not dead.

674
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,710
I don't

675
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,430
know.

676
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,910
I'll get back to you.

677
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,530
Jim Morrison, of course.

678
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,310
Well, I have been thinking about this

679
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,210
hard rock a lot since we started doing this series, because just thinking about the times

680
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:17,710
have been the universal times have been the city walk and forever glued in my memory is this image

681
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,390
from, you know, by like five and eat.

682
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,790
I just remember as a little kid looking and seeing

683
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,690
like, OK, there's the T ride.

684
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:28,730
There's a five.

685
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,410
I'll go west like water slide and play area.

686
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,690
And then I moved to the left and there's the psycho house on a lonely,

687
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,290
a lonely hill, the second house from one of the sequels.

688
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:40,490
Yeah.

689
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:40,790
Yeah.

690
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,710
You got to figure that out.

691
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,410
Psycho.

692
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,330
Why?

693
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:49,210
Well, from psycho four, of course, from exteriors, you see, unless it was three,

694
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:54,550
I could be wrong, but certainly a not to and then I can rule not to.

695
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,250
But then you pan left

696
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,690
past the psycho house and there's a giant white mansion looking thing.

697
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,770
And I'm like, I knew that

698
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,090
was a hard rock cafe.

699
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:10,070
But as a kid, I saw the movie psycho at way too young an age and it scared the

700
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,970
hell out of me.

701
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,110
And so I always associate that in my mind.

702
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,010
Something in my mind just clicks of like

703
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:16,990
original Hard Rocks.

704
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,310
I go out like, yeah, it's all the same.

705
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,310
It's all the same.

706
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,130
Yeah, yeah, me too.

707
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,590
It was what it was a striking like a striking tableau.

708
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,290
I only went to this era of universal

709
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:31,310
once in like ninety four and I really I definitely recall the like sparness of it.

710
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,870
I think I recall

711
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,710
like looking at it all from afar and my parents going, no, not that way.

712
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,850
There's nothing for you

713
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,550
there.

714
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:41,510
Yeah, that's like the adult zone, you know, basically.

715
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,970
Yeah, I went when Planet Hollywood

716
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:50,370
started popping up, I think my every one of my family board was like, yes, the movies Hollywood,

717
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,350
we like that.

718
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,930
Hard Rock was threatening.

719
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,250
We are watching Psycho now and you just see sort of a

720
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,090
shot of the house.

721
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,930
Do you imagine there's a Hard Rock right sort of down the road, like the dirt

722
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:07,070
I'm mostly watching the Vince Vaughn cause found some shot shot.

723
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,790
Same thing, same thing.

724
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,190
So that

725
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,730
one does it would naturally fit in.

726
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,590
So Norman goes down and he manages the hotel, but then he goes

727
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,430
back up and manages the Hard Rock as well.

728
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,450
Shifts from the house.

729
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,930
Yeah, three twisted mac and cheese

730
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,030
all day long or whatever the cook terminology.

731
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,550
That's how I watch from now on.

732
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,130
Yeah, yeah, no,

733
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:28,910
just picture it right.

734
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,010
Yeah, you know, Hitch doesn't show you because it's not important to

735
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:32,570
story.

736
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,330
Yes, of course.

737
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,870
The Hard Rock Cafe is right there.

738
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,950
Also that globe that like that domed

739
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,130
globe up top is really striking.

740
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,290
And then I think it says Kingdom of Rock.

741
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,590
Yeah, the building is

742
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:50,990
really it's a I would love to have like a die cast or like like a model of that Hard Rock.

743
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:51,250
I don't

744
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,070
know if such a thing exists, but I'd like to put that next to my Bonaventure Hotel mug.

745
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,870
It's just

746
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:02,970
like I'm so I remain so confused about do I like Hard Rock or do I not?

747
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,210
I feel like I've had like

748
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:09,270
great moments in them, but I don't have any particular affinity for the brand or the food,

749
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,990
but I would love to have a little version of that.

750
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,290
I like the new one too.

751
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,150
I love all of it.

752
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:20,630
The hotel stuff they're built like that big hotel that's a big guitar was that in Florida?

753
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,010
That's in

754
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,270
Florida.

755
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,110
That's in Florida, but then they're building one on the Vegas.

756
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,050
Yes, right, right,

757
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,550
I like though.

758
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,450
I like that.

759
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,090
Yeah, I kind of want to say so I understand what you're saying.

760
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,350
Like

761
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:35,950
I'm because I'm sometimes I'm like when is this thing going away and never they don't ever lose.

762
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,330
And if one's closed, they just reopen somewhere else in the city.

763
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,650
Yes, because the Hard Rock

764
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,370
closed in Vegas, the hotel, but they're building a bigger cooler one.

765
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,870
They're taking over the Mirage.

766
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:52,230
Yeah, yeah, and it's going to be in the shape of a big guitar and the one they have in Florida.

767
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,530
I

768
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,790
go this looks cool.

769
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,410
I want to stay in here.

770
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,770
Yeah, well, never dies Rock and Roll can never die.

771
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,970
Except the one in New Orleans that partially collapsed and they called it.

772
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,590
They're like we're not finishing this project.

773
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,190
So sometimes it'll pop up somewhere else.

774
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:08,770
Yeah,

775
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,250
that's what they tend to do.

776
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,970
They're mushrooms these places.

777
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,470
But anyway, so this this as Jason

778
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,270
said, this was like an unbelievably successful restaurant.

779
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,630
And just before I move past it,

780
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:28,100
the discovery that this thing that we love the inside outside there again,

781
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:37,370
this thing that we love the inside outside theme park restaurant that Robert Earl himself invented.

782
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:37,990
Right, right.

783
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,130
I don't think I've been giving him enough credit all these years.

784
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:41,810
Yeah, I should

785
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,910
have been because he like put a lot of the dumbest looking buildings of all time on the map.

786
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:47,330
Yeah.

787
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,690
But and I love his web series also and his shirts.

788
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,950
Love his personality.

789
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:53,470
Yes.

790
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:53,970
Yeah, yeah.

791
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,350
There's a

792
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,210
lot to love.

793
00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:00,990
And I just got to go to this as mentioned on the show a couple weeks ago,

794
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,430
a Planet Hollywood auction.

795
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,470
It was happening.

796
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,910
I think it's happening concurrently to when

797
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,530
listeners are hearing this.

798
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,250
But I was like I was racing over to this thing to go like be in a

799
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:17,630
building where all of the Planet Hollywood stuff is back and the logo is up everywhere.

800
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,150
I don't

801
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,750
think I'm ever going to buy anything, but I wanted to be at this exhibit.

802
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,810
And I went with friends of

803
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,110
the show Van Robe Show and Bugman Buzz Buzz.

804
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,450
And they're sending me pictures of what's there.

805
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:34,890
There's a chewy and there's like the like what what rose the piece of wood roses on in Titanic.

806
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,190
The wood really?

807
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:36,750
Yeah.

808
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,110
Wow.

809
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,470
These are nuts.

810
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,590
It's crazy.

811
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,610
If you're in LA and this thing's still

812
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,750
happening, I forget it's on Olympic and Beverly Hills.

813
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,730
I think what's the I forget the name of

814
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,390
the collectible company.

815
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,250
But anyway, I'm like they're sending me photos and I'm like, God,

816
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,910
I can't wait.

817
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,330
I can't wait to get there.

818
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,870
And then I'm going through Coldwater Canyon, not one,

819
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,290
but two potholes just shredded my tire.

820
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,250
Just absolutely.

821
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,430
And so then I'm stuck.

822
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:01,870
I'm having

823
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,650
a call AAA and I'm like only two miles.

824
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,890
And the part of me is like, maybe I could get.

825
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,130
And then

826
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,050
I try to go a little further and I'm like, cook, clunk, cook, clunk, cook.

827
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,270
It drove me.

828
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:11,890
It drove

829
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:18,450
me so crazy that I'm like, I'm so close to and then somebody came, uh, put my spare on.

830
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:18,910
All right.

831
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,210
You know, don't drive too much on this.

832
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,810
Okay, sure.

833
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,750
I start thinking I'm going, I'm going to go to it.

834
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,610
I'm going to go and I went, I took, I took this.

835
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,570
It wasn't, no, it didn't add that much to it.

836
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,370
But oh my God, to be in a, to be in a Robert Earl environment again,

837
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:35,430
to see his ugly logos, to see an entire judge dread corner.

838
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,230
Oh, they didn't have Stallone in

839
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,190
the tube out, but yeah.

840
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,070
They have on display the Ivan news.

841
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,430
Uh, no, yes.

842
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:43,830
Okay.

843
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,090
Yeah.

844
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:44,570
This is another

845
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,990
thing we've been, maybe there's more material to mine out of this.

846
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,790
There's a lot of stuff was on

847
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,030
display.

848
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,170
Oh, and Mike, Mike, while this thing is open, um, I don't want to build up your expectation

849
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:53,870
too much.

850
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,130
When you send that, well, you'll know why.

851
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,010
Batman forever.

852
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,410
There is Batman forever.

853
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,530
There's Batman forever stuff.

854
00:34:59,530 --> 00:34:59,810
I know.

855
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,090
Robin stuff.

856
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,370
Uh, Marty's kitschy,

857
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,570
um, uh, back to the future three, the thing doc makes him wear.

858
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,590
That's like old west

859
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,990
style with the Adams.

860
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:13,030
Uh, that was kind of jaw dropping to see, uh, where was I?

861
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,270
I'm getting

862
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,610
lost.

863
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,590
Oh, Ivan news.

864
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,150
Yeah.

865
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,330
Yeah.

866
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,510
Besides what they have on display in the real, in the facility,

867
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:25,290
there's all this stuff that isn't on display that is so up our alley, uh, the full Ivan news costume

868
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,810
what can be bid on.

869
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,610
Maybe by the time listeners are hearing this, we've put our money together

870
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,550
to buy it.

871
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,230
Maybe.

872
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,170
Oh my God.

873
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,490
And this display it in here.

874
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,310
No man.

875
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:34,790
Yeah.

876
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,110
Geez.

877
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,190
Where keep a manic.

878
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,190
I, yeah, I guess this has gotta be my garage.

879
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,490
The closest thing to our perma facility.

880
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:40,930
There's

881
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,310
something I, you know what?

882
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:48,650
There's something I have received that I, we need to find a place for it.

883
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,930
Oh, and whatever it is, whatever this museum is, that's all I'll say.

884
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:52,730
I'll tease that right now.

885
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,890
We need a separate museum.

886
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,550
We need like, okay, well we're coming like the hard rock where we're

887
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,010
like, the collection is outgrowing.

888
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,350
Thanks to listeners who've gotten us incredible things.

889
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,610
We want to keep them.

890
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,010
I'm Griffin's baby.

891
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,330
Aladar toy over there.

892
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:04,690
Yeah.

893
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:04,870
Yeah.

894
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,750
That's all in there.

895
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,770
There's a, uh, uh, you know, but there's only so many walls in this place.

896
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,350
We're going to have to

897
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,010
get a facility.

898
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,710
It's just like, that's the attic, a real thing.

899
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,030
We need our museum of the weird.

900
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,290
We need our own.

901
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,870
Yeah.

902
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,030
Yeah.

903
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,870
I don't know where it would be.

904
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:20,610
Maybe that's the way.

905
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,010
And then we

906
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:21,530
charging.

907
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,510
Oh yeah.

908
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,310
This is going to be a money making.

909
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:24,610
Yeah.

910
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:25,270
Yes.

911
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,990
Look, we got to pay the bills

912
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,550
for this place.

913
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:27,930
Somehow.

914
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,270
Yeah.

915
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:34,190
Maybe the first week, but then going way up.

916
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:34,390
Yeah.

917
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,030
Jurassic park.

918
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,890
Maybe we could have a coupon day.

919
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,330
Right.

920
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,970
There's a lot of storefronts in Burbank.

921
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,830
I'll say that

922
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,770
there's a lot of wonderful small businesses in Burbank that had been there forever,

923
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,690
but then there's a lot of stuff flipping, you know?

924
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,070
And so we can go get one of those for only

925
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,670
all the money on earth.

926
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,430
Everything is so fucking expensive.

927
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:56,750
Yeah.

928
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,130
Sure.

929
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:57,570
Yeah.

930
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,310
I should be.

931
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,610
I'd love

932
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:03,850
to be able to just put up podcasts, the rides, museum of the weird, but I, you know, it's going

933
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,830
to cost us, I think.

934
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,350
Yeah, probably.

935
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:05,710
Yeah.

936
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,150
Um, maybe we could just go in the back of gun world

937
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,570
and put a whole, just a room together.

938
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,270
Probably reasonable people too much space.

939
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,030
That's like

940
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,450
the giants.

941
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,390
They took over the old bubble head studios.

942
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,270
I think remember bubble head.

943
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:21,730
I know

944
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,650
that that was like their public art.

945
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,010
I don't know.

946
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:25,230
Yeah.

947
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,430
But it was, they had the biggest building

948
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,490
and I don't know.

949
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,070
This is a real place.

950
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,530
Listeners.

951
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:29,750
Yes.

952
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,070
We love Burbank, but also there's an alarming

953
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:36,650
amount of gun stores for here for some reason, otherwise very pleasant, wonderful.

954
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,250
Um, anyways,

955
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,610
to speak a little more about things they, and they had at this location, some of which I think

956
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:50,170
moved to the other one, um, the handwritten lyrics to imagine think about that without,

957
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:55,330
if he hadn't taken pen to paper, when he, that, when that ink touched that paper, that allowed,

958
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,750
uh, gal Godot to say her name.

959
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:06,790
No, it's more like, I think that's what you're saying, but I don't,

960
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,950
I'm not a hundred percent sure.

961
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,830
Anyway, that if John, if without that piece of paper,

962
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,090
many celebrities wouldn't have been able to embarrass themselves and make us all laugh.

963
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,850
And the first week of the pandemic, we really needed it.

964
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,990
It would have been like a different,

965
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,830
it would have been like, they all sang silly love songs or something.

966
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,310
It would have to be a different

967
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,090
Beatles solo.

968
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,810
Imagine, imagine a world with no imagine.

969
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,430
I mean, I know this is very close to

970
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:34,870
the premise of yesterday, but imagine, but isn't it the, like all of, all of that, all the Beatles

971
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,790
music being gone, maybe doesn't have the same effect as just one.

972
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:38,530
Imagine.

973
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:39,190
Yeah.

974
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:39,790
Yeah.

975
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,090
That's,

976
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,790
that's a movie.

977
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,670
You should pitch that now, since they're doing the four Beatles movies.

978
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,090
They're going to definitely, they're not going to stop at four or four Beatles movies.

979
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:47,770
Yeah.

980
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:53,390
We're sure if you have any ins for all of us to be in the punch up room for Ringo.

981
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:53,870
God.

982
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,210
And they're like all releasing in 2027.

983
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,290
I'm like, how's it with one with Sam,

984
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,790
what's his name directing all of them?

985
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,050
Sam Mendes for movies.

986
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,050
He can't be doing all.

987
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:04,430
I swear.

988
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:04,990
That's what I read.

989
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,290
Maybe I'm misremembering, but that's what I thought

990
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,410
please, please, please.

991
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,370
Fingers crossed.

992
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,950
He's there's an old, there's an actor who he's old

993
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:19,330
buddies with who he had a, a award winning collaboration with.

994
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,650
And we know this man is

995
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,990
a fan of John Lennon and his music and his message and being incredibly pissed off.

996
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,250
And that's Mr.

997
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:27,990
Kevin Spacey.

998
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,790
Could you put the please Kevin hashtag Kevin as John,

999
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:32,990
just he's coming back.

1000
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,430
He's doing monster cons.

1001
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,390
Kevin is back and he needs to be back as John

1002
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:37,730
Lennon.

1003
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,530
We could use the Irishman technology on him and just make him young so he could play

1004
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:41,930
John Lennon.

1005
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:42,770
No, never.

1006
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,930
He's already experienced this area.

1007
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,730
He played Bobby Darin when he was 19

1008
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,410
years older than Bobby Darin.

1009
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,530
He can, he can contort.

1010
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,410
Hey, let me take you to the sock hop.

1011
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,850
It's like 43.

1012
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,590
Um, oh God, please, please.

1013
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:01,790
Spacey is Lennon.

1014
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,050
Uh, more Beatles stuff.

1015
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:08,350
This place and I think the new one's still bricks that were taken from the cavern club where the,

1016
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,810
where the Beatles first performed.

1017
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,870
Now I have a question about that because I saw that plaque

1018
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:18,670
and, uh, I believe it says, I want to get this wording right.

1019
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,370
These bricks were taken from the

1020
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:24,670
building adjacent to the legendary cavern.

1021
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:29,630
So doesn't that mean, and maybe I miss remembering

1022
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:38,870
my word definitions, but it doesn't adjacent me next to unless, unless it is the bricks that

1023
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,790
literally provided the border.

1024
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,690
That's the only thing where I give it where it's like, it's the,

1025
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:50,290
but I also, I still wording that adjacent doesn't sound like what I'm describing.

1026
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:57,830
That makes me think of Lisa at the museum going like, wait a minute, there's not a cane and

1027
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:03,510
a sink adjacent to the cabin, adjacent to the cab.

1028
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:03,890
Wow.

1029
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,810
So, you know, catch if in the,

1030
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:13,010
the biggest you could dream of is that like John and George took a piss on these bricks before

1031
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,690
a concert.

1032
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:18,150
They went out for a, they went out for a cig in the alley.

1033
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,150
I dropped me toast sandwich

1034
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,010
against it.

1035
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,690
They dropped their toast sandwich toast sandwich, of course, two slices of bread

1036
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,450
with a piece of toast in the middle.

1037
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,490
A war ration food.

1038
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,150
Is that real?

1039
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,910
It is real.

1040
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,070
You think the

1041
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,030
Beatles would have eaten?

1042
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,350
Well, in between shows, you got to scar something down.

1043
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,290
Have you ever had

1044
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:39,530
one?

1045
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,490
You ever had one?

1046
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,610
You know what?

1047
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,230
I have it.

1048
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,790
I should be shows every meal.

1049
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,830
Every time we do a

1050
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:50,230
show, know that if you go to both shows, know that Jason's eating a toast sandwich, a war ration toast

1051
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,650
sandwich.

1052
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,830
Is that just a roll with fries on it?

1053
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,310
I think you're going to have to tell me these are

1054
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:01,970
British like, you know, uh, three AM or hangover foods.

1055
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:02,650
Wow.

1056
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,570
Still, do you think people are still

1057
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,290
eating toast sandwiches in Britain right now?

1058
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,230
I mean, maybe.

1059
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:06,970
Wow.

1060
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:07,470
Really?

1061
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,490
Is there, you don't know

1062
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,890
the war ended still.

1063
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,410
They have an inherent rationing in their heads.

1064
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,110
There's a car.

1065
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:15,370
Yeah.

1066
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:15,910
Cargo.

1067
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:20,870
There's cargo cults in the Pacific, but then there's also Brits who don't know the war and that

1068
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,370
still eating toast sandwiches.

1069
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:27,070
Still only listening to number station broadcasting.

1070
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:27,750
Wow.

1071
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,530
What a picture.

1072
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,150
What a picture you're painting here.

1073
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,270
1955.

1074
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:32,630
All right.

1075
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,290
We might, by the way, I'm now I'm looking up what is next to the cavern club and

1076
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:40,250
we might have to go to Liverpool and do a mini saga about all the crap.

1077
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,270
Oh, is there like a

1078
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,850
cavern club?

1079
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,010
I've never thought about this.

1080
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:46,070
That the cavern club is of course some bad tourist trap

1081
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:46,650
kind of place.

1082
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,050
Right.

1083
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:47,510
I'm amazed.

1084
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,910
There's not a hard rock right there.

1085
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:49,550
I have, although I haven't

1086
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,390
the broader search.

1087
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,070
I'll Google, I'll, I bet there's one within the mile, but anyway, it's just all a

1088
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,550
bunch of garbage like with the, that's named Sergeant Peppers.

1089
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,090
There's a hotel called hard

1090
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:02,350
days night and there's a band and get ready.

1091
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:06,110
There is a mall called the cavern walks.

1092
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:07,250
No.

1093
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:07,710
Yes.

1094
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:07,910
We're

1095
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,850
going to have to do the cavern walks out of here.

1096
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,610
The cavern walks.

1097
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:13,470
Apparently.

1098
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,850
Holy shit.

1099
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,330
Yep.

1100
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:15,730
Yep.

1101
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,110
How much stuff is in the cavern walks?

1102
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,170
I don't know.

1103
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,570
I wonder, I was reading, uh, uh,

1104
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,630
oh God, what is it?

1105
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:29,010
Uh, in the guardian a while back, there is a phenomenon happening on the,

1106
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,430
is it the high street?

1107
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,570
Like several row area, like streets that had a lot of

1108
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,150
banks and like very fine clothes.

1109
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:43,770
There's a lot of them, obviously, you know, places closed or

1110
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,210
during the pandemic.

1111
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,710
And they're like, for some reason now the high street is filled with candy

1112
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,710
shops selling overpriced American candy.

1113
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,970
Most of the money laundering operations for the mafia,

1114
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,710
for the British mob.

1115
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:05,370
So I am wondering if the cavern walk is full of candy shop money laundering

1116
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,290
operations.

1117
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:10,290
That's how I mean, it's all like, I, I looked it up and it's on the outside.

1118
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:13,750
There's

1119
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,310
Chantilly Beatles cafe.

1120
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:17,210
Sure.

1121
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,010
Chantilly have to do with it.

1122
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,250
But you can get big breakfast all day.

1123
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:21,570
3.

1124
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:22,350
95.

1125
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:23,470
3.

1126
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,250
95.

1127
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,430
Good price on that.

1128
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:26,550
Well, pounds.

1129
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:31,170
I was, what's the little L I didn't say it out loud

1130
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,470
because I didn't want to be embarrassed.

1131
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,330
That's not Euro.

1132
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:33,790
Is it?

1133
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:34,270
I don't know.

1134
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:34,850
I think that's

1135
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:35,190
pounds.

1136
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:35,710
Okay.

1137
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:36,570
Okay.

1138
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,010
Um, okay.

1139
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,330
Well, cavern walk saga coming soon.

1140
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,050
Let's get through here.

1141
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:41,570
One saga

1142
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,210
at a time.

1143
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,770
We'll figure it out.

1144
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:48,690
Um, anyway, this place is making, uh, $45 million a year.

1145
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,670
This is unbelievably successful.

1146
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,630
So when they decide to do the broader city walk shopping

1147
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,750
district, of course, hard rock has to be a part of it, but it doesn't make sense for them to be all

1148
00:44:58,750 --> 00:44:59,670
the way out there.

1149
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,190
They got to bring it more central.

1150
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:03,570
And despite this already being the biggest

1151
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:08,670
hard rock ever built, one of the biggest restaurants ever built, they're like, I think we can go bigger.

1152
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,870
And they do.

1153
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:15,390
And they build not only the new restaurant, but this massive concert venue,

1154
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:21,430
a 3000 seat concert venue, uh, that looks like the Roman Coliseum on the outside.

1155
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:22,190
I remember the

1156
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,010
first time I didn't know any of this was built.

1157
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:26,630
And when I came back to universal post this in

1158
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:33,310
99 or whatever, like, Oh my fucking God, they have a dumb looking Coliseum now.

1159
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,670
Boy, is that

1160
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,110
spectacularly silly.

1161
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:40,490
Um, and there's probably more restaurant stuff before we move to the venue.

1162
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:45,250
I just wanted to say that, like that they couldn't, the hard rock has to be, it's like,

1163
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:49,870
it's part of it might've been the most successful piece of the property, maybe more than the theme

1164
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:50,030
park.

1165
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:50,530
I don't know.

1166
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,010
Just like square footage.

1167
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,710
So Jason, as you said, they did a perfect transition.

1168
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:58,890
One closed the next day, the new one opened.

1169
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,630
There was never a downtime.

1170
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,370
I did not know that.

1171
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,010
It is

1172
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,690
unbelievable.

1173
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:11,170
And that said the Sheridan family routine when staying at universal, we would check

1174
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,250
into the hard rock hotel, drop our bags.

1175
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,250
Okay.

1176
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,850
It's time for lunch.

1177
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,730
We will walk over to the hard rock

1178
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:24,070
cafe and I never had a bad time.

1179
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,610
Never had a bad meal.

1180
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,410
Never got me sick, which is saying something

1181
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:30,430
in this series.

1182
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:36,210
Unlike the hard rock, uh, uh, that used to be at universal Hollywood city walk,

1183
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,650
which I believe got me sick at least a couple of times.

1184
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:40,090
Yeah.

1185
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:41,630
I can't, again, we got to lower this

1186
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:41,830
bar.

1187
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,770
I'm glad your family was fine.

1188
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,730
I definitely, I went to this one in 2008 and thought it stunk,

1189
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:52,630
but for me, but that was, but you know, these things are very, it does a lot of variables.

1190
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:54,450
A few years before is what you're describing.

1191
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,830
Well, I, I am a very fond memories of my go to order,

1192
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:05,090
which was a pulled pork sandwich with French fries and looking back, surprisingly flavorful,

1193
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:05,690
baked beans.

1194
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:11,450
I have not seen in a while, but like beans with like pork in like real barbecue

1195
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,010
beans.

1196
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:12,350
Yeah.

1197
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:12,530
Yeah.

1198
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:12,750
Yeah.

1199
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:13,930
And like, it was good.

1200
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:17,350
Hard rock, hard rock, Lord, they've always pushed

1201
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,810
like the pork ribs and burgers.

1202
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:25,370
They're so proud of serving their burgers, which I think they're so,

1203
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:32,550
they're so proud of serving their burgers, which I think if you go back to the original,

1204
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,390
the original art rock was in London.

1205
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,470
I think some of the marketing was like, I couldn't get a good

1206
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,830
burger in this city.

1207
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,630
So we opened this place.

1208
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,530
And I'm sure the quality today is just as odd at every

1209
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,050
location.

1210
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:46,990
Can I ask a question?

1211
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,890
Cause like in Hollywood, I have such a strong memory of going

1212
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:54,090
cause every kid likes, but the most part likes movies and especially in the nineties behind the

1213
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,370
scenes was very exciting.

1214
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:59,210
I feel like everybody thought it was fun to see all those making of and

1215
00:47:59,210 --> 00:47:59,430
stuff.

1216
00:47:59,750 --> 00:47:59,990
Yes.

1217
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,010
Hard rock as a concept was your family, did they like rock and roll?

1218
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,190
Was that even part of

1219
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:05,410
it?

1220
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,170
My family liked rock and roll.

1221
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:11,270
I mean, I think I thought my dad saw a lot of concerts in the 70s.

1222
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:14,610
Bands usually came through Philadelphia.

1223
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,370
Tickets were very affordable.

1224
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,170
I think the funniest story,

1225
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:21,730
he, he, he saw Elton John on one of his first tours.

1226
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:24,170
I think he saw Neil Young open for the

1227
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:28,650
Kings and the Kings never finished their set.

1228
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,390
Cause the brothers started fighting.

1229
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:39,690
The real, uh, thing that's like in a waste, like if I went to an oyster show and the brothers

1230
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,950
started fighting, I would see a live fight.

1231
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,910
That's so you want to, if they're going to play the hits,

1232
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,250
one of the hits has to be a fight.

1233
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:45,670
Yeah.

1234
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,730
I don't even need them throw fists like battle of words,

1235
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:52,270
like it's just someone yelling like, I'm done with you.

1236
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,470
Like, and storming off stage with like, uh,

1237
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,910
you know, Becks or Heineken or whatever, you know?

1238
00:48:59,250 --> 00:48:59,690
Yeah.

1239
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,830
I just don't think, I guess where I'm going

1240
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:07,010
with this is just, I feel like I, maybe it's just me, but I don't have like the same association

1241
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,630
with this in rock and roll as I do with planet Hollywood and Hollywood.

1242
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:11,970
It's almost its own thing

1243
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:12,490
in my mind.

1244
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,830
And maybe that's, I think that's right.

1245
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,730
Even though there's memorabilia of rock

1246
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,970
and roll on the wall.

1247
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:18,530
I don't know.

1248
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:23,450
Cause planet Hollywood is early 90s blockbuster.

1249
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:24,010
Yeah.

1250
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,230
It's

1251
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,610
such a direct connection.

1252
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:29,050
And you know that the people who were plugging it, that Arnold and Sly

1253
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,010
are donating the costumes.

1254
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,590
Right.

1255
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,470
Or there's a kind of a through line where it felt like show

1256
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:40,110
business going to plan Hollywood in Illinois felt like a little bit like I'm in the movies now.

1257
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:43,590
All the hard rocks feel like, does Tom Petty know that's here?

1258
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,430
Yeah, no.

1259
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,250
Well, yes.

1260
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:54,350
But then when you, when you break down the practical nature, uh, as the food got worse

1261
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:59,150
and worse at the plant, Hollywood's, it was always pretty consistent at the hard rock.

1262
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:00,590
They're clearly, yeah.

1263
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:04,370
As much as I'm not going to, I'm not going to tout this as a good restaurant,

1264
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,150
even close.

1265
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,790
I think I gave it two forks on doughboys forever ago.

1266
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,690
Uh, but the, it, it didn't have the

1267
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:17,630
full slide that is like notorious, like regular people who don't care about any of this crap.

1268
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,950
If you say, what do you know about planet Hollywood?

1269
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,330
It says this big dumb restaurant

1270
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:22,530
with Arnold and Stallone.

1271
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,050
And then the food was horrible.

1272
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:24,830
And then it closed.

1273
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:25,590
That's like,

1274
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:28,650
that's kind of the cliff notes and hard rock never.

1275
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:28,910
Yeah.

1276
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,890
It's like, they kept it just good enough.

1277
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,330
Yes.

1278
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:31,610
Sure.

1279
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,850
I'll say I will give the Hollywood one a compliment.

1280
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,670
There was a time where my dad was

1281
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:45,170
visiting in like rainy February in LA, we both had colds and I remember going like, oh, thank God,

1282
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:51,390
the hard rock, uh, had a very, we were up at city walk and we went there.

1283
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,590
We need somewhere, please

1284
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,310
the shelter.

1285
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,290
We need sanctuary.

1286
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:59,650
We, we had a very, a very safe back at sheet.

1287
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,010
Like a very flight.

1288
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,150
Like, do you have a warm cup of water?

1289
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,950
All we, all we're simple folk.

1290
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:07,570
All we need is a Mac and a

1291
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:07,990
cheese.

1292
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:12,570
Um, I hear you cause as a parent, that's all I'm looking for is a safe Mac and cheese.

1293
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,030
And I think, and we, this is probably, even though it was twisted, even though, by the way,

1294
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,310
we're all so screwed on these repeated stories because anybody who's got club three and we've

1295
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:27,010
released the same thing, some people are going to have heard the repeated stories, but seven days

1296
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:27,470
prior.

1297
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:27,790
Right.

1298
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:28,290
That's true.

1299
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,110
So serves us right.

1300
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:30,690
I say, I sure.

1301
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:31,190
Yeah.

1302
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,370
But different contexts now,

1303
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:40,030
different context, much worlds of different hard rock, Orlando in the city walk ranking,

1304
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:44,630
a better food choice, the most it is on the higher end.

1305
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:45,850
I would have to agree.

1306
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:46,550
Yeah.

1307
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:47,750
Um, now here is,

1308
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,490
here was my experience on this particular trip.

1309
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:51,970
I did not stop and eat there.

1310
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:52,690
I don't believe any

1311
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,310
of us stopped and ate there on this, unless I missed something.

1312
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:59,650
Um, what I did do was go and

1313
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,210
take a walk through it.

1314
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:05,610
I believe in the order of events I was in between, had been hanging out with

1315
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:08,330
Jason was about to meet Mike, had a little stretch of time to kill.

1316
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,370
It was late.

1317
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:10,450
It was after the

1318
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:10,990
rush.

1319
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:15,410
And I just took a walk and walked into every room that they have.

1320
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:19,430
And I was, uh, baffled and

1321
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,350
humbled by this walk that I took through the hard rock cafe.

1322
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:23,510
I knew it was big.

1323
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,150
I'd been in there.

1324
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:29,190
I had a meal in there, but I didn't do the full explore doing it when it's more spare at night

1325
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:36,270
and the entire rooms that, okay, just the room that I'm in, that's completely empty would be

1326
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,210
enough space for an entire restaurant in and of itself.

1327
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,070
Yes.

1328
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,750
And in most cases, those have

1329
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:49,030
a domed ceiling, uh, made out to be like a beautiful chapel and being in one of these

1330
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:55,850
places by yourself and, and just every, and every item kind of being at least jaw dropping or just

1331
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:56,470
weird.

1332
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:02,710
This walk was kind of the most, one of the most like peaceful and cool things I did

1333
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,570
in the trip.

1334
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:06,690
It feels like they could fit all of San Diego Comic-Con in this restaurant.

1335
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:10,250
It's like, like they're always talking about, well, where can we move it?

1336
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:10,990
But most places

1337
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,450
don't have a convention center big enough.

1338
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:14,250
Let's move it to the hard rock in Orlando.

1339
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,350
I'd find it so big.

1340
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:20,190
Uh, it was really, and the fact, I just didn't know the sheer,

1341
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:27,710
the volume of rooms and that rooms have entire like, okay, now we'll just deal with the Woodstock

1342
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:35,510
room and now we'll deal with the CBGB's room and that there's that many sub genres and then big

1343
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:41,010
circular staircases and the entire way up the circular staircases, there's a bunch of crap

1344
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,270
and then balconies and outside.

1345
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:48,470
And then you look up like this, just this, the stained glass or just

1346
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:53,790
whatever paint ceiling painting content in here is mind boggling.

1347
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,410
There's a different one on everyone

1348
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,530
and they're so dumb.

1349
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,450
They're so ostentatious.

1350
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,330
Look at this one that you guys are across the room.

1351
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:07,370
So this just looks like, you know, regular boring church stuff, right?

1352
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,210
And the style that would

1353
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:13,730
have been the most beautiful thing you've ever seen in the year 700, but like, okay, boring,

1354
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:14,030
right?

1355
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:18,250
Then zoom in, wait a minute, who are these angels and lords and priests?

1356
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,150
Why it's Elvis and

1357
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:26,790
Mary Garcia and we're deifying cousin, Marrior, Jerry Lee Lewis.

1358
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:29,170
And then there's also big stained

1359
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:32,110
glass, like the most beautiful church.

1360
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,470
And then it says hail, hail, rock and roll.

1361
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,190
And it's Chuck

1362
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,670
Barry.

1363
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:44,150
These pieces, whoever put together every individual piece of art, this is like unbelievable

1364
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:45,050
artisans.

1365
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,270
So funny.

1366
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:46,890
Yeah.

1367
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,570
And I'm so surprised even that they got all this approved because

1368
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,070
when did you think somebody be like, that's kind of sacrilegious.

1369
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,150
Like this is all just

1370
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:58,810
like religious imagery and we're going to put rock and roll people in there.

1371
00:54:58,850 --> 00:54:59,270
But obviously

1372
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,890
everybody thought it was cool.

1373
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:01,290
This is in Florida.

1374
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:02,670
This is a more religious.

1375
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:03,750
Yeah.

1376
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:04,830
But I don't know.

1377
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,370
Yeah, I guess it didn't, I guess people like that about it.

1378
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,890
Just like the son of God, King of Kings,

1379
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,930
rock and roll never die.

1380
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,350
Yeah, exactly the same thing.

1381
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:15,550
That's the same thing.

1382
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:17,330
Like Ken Ham like

1383
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:18,310
this.

1384
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,210
I don't know from the arc encounter.

1385
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:20,850
Yeah.

1386
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:23,470
Well, does this disobey commandments?

1387
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,090
It does,

1388
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:24,750
doesn't it?

1389
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:25,750
Idolatry.

1390
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:26,110
Yeah.

1391
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:26,750
Yeah.

1392
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:30,190
Maybe this place needs to be struck down is what we're finding.

1393
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:30,650
Yeah.

1394
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:36,690
The centric keeper were here, who's been going to church with you, Jason Lilley, he'd

1395
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,650
good thing he's not here.

1396
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,150
Yeah.

1397
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:38,310
Yeah.

1398
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,930
This is more sector creeper vibe.

1399
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:40,670
That's right.

1400
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:41,270
Yeah.

1401
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:47,030
Some of the things on this walk, let me say a couple that I thought were genuinely

1402
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,670
impressed.

1403
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,310
The ones that struck me the most, right?

1404
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,090
I just, I need to stop and stare at this

1405
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:51,590
for a minute.

1406
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:57,810
One were these, these two metallic masks from the cover of

1407
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:00,730
Pink Floyd's, the division bell.

1408
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,430
Like, I mean, like I know crazy.

1409
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:03,950
Yes.

1410
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:04,950
And those are them.

1411
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:05,490
Wow.

1412
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,690
That's the cover.

1413
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,450
It's insane.

1414
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:12,290
I mean, obviously today it's best known as the, the cover of,

1415
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,890
it was, it was reappropriated to be the cover of bug mains, the division bug.

1416
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,270
And those are,

1417
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:20,010
wait, not wait, is it waddo?

1418
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:20,790
It might be waddo.

1419
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:21,350
I think it's waddo.

1420
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:22,250
I think they're waddo heads.

1421
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:22,570
Yeah.

1422
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:27,330
So, but this was the precursor and, and, you know, there couldn't have been division

1423
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:28,350
bug without division bell.

1424
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:34,470
I'm trying to think like, okay, let me get into, should I do sillier

1425
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:34,950
ones?

1426
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:35,830
Okay, wait, sure.

1427
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:36,690
Genuinely cool.

1428
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:40,370
I mean like a Freddie Mercury jumpsuit, like a black and

1429
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:44,150
white zebra stripes, an Angus young school boy.

1430
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,850
So some of these you're like, I think it might've

1431
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:50,650
been like a vest that Hendrix wore at Woodstock.

1432
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,390
Some of these are such jaw droppers.

1433
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:53,090
And then the

1434
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:58,430
one, this will not be for everybody, but I was just so with my, my specific interests, I was like,

1435
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,530
I just need to like reflect on this.

1436
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,850
That this is in the back of an Orlando.

1437
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:02,750
It's just like next to

1438
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:08,690
somebody's like ringing up table 34 and they like, nobody's paying attention to this.

1439
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:09,590
It's just

1440
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,610
rotten away in Orlando restaurant.

1441
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:16,270
Uh, Kate Pearson from the B 52s dress from the love shack video.

1442
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:16,910
Wow.

1443
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:21,610
And this, this just struck me because like, that's how you know her.

1444
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,270
That's like, that's her

1445
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,970
iconic outfit.

1446
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:24,510
Yeah.

1447
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,010
Yes.

1448
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:28,570
If you think of her, it's that with the red and all the tassels,

1449
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:35,510
that is like her iconic wardrobe and it's just in a box in this rest.

1450
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:36,570
It just really, I don't know,

1451
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,510
it just like kind of took it out of me in this weird way.

1452
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,110
Just had to reflect on this tassel dress.

1453
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,490
I feel like it would be, it's, it's sort of conflicting because on one hand you're like,

1454
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:46,550
oh, that's awesome.

1455
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,550
And then the other hand, you're like, people are eating onion rings here all day,

1456
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:50,790
not looking at it.

1457
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:51,230
Yeah.

1458
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:54,550
It's like, I want it to be, we quote, we say this a lot.

1459
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:55,150
It should be in a

1460
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:55,690
museum.

1461
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:55,810
Yeah.

1462
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:59,390
It maybe should be in the rock and roll hall of fame museum.

1463
00:57:59,390 --> 00:57:59,830
Right.

1464
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:00,510
Shouldn't some of

1465
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:04,430
this be a little more paid attention to is what I'm saying.

1466
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,530
But also, but you're right.

1467
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:06,750
But then I,

1468
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:07,990
for free, right.

1469
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:13,590
Got to just walk up to things like this and maybe there's like one person a day who

1470
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,850
goes, Oh, yeah.

1471
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:16,750
And that's pretty good.

1472
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,210
I mean, like it's being appreciated on some level.

1473
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,170
This

1474
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:25,710
per year likely gets more visitors than the rock and roll hall of fame.

1475
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,350
Don't you think?

1476
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:27,310
That might be true.

1477
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:28,330
That could be true.

1478
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:28,630
Yeah.

1479
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,790
This is the biggest hard rock cafe

1480
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:32,730
now, I think.

1481
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:33,210
Right.

1482
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:33,830
Probably.

1483
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:37,730
And I believe it has more memorabilia than any other one.

1484
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:42,770
This isn't like, there was a lot of playing Hollywood and some of them admittedly,

1485
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:47,950
even in this auction we've talked about, had recreations of things.

1486
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:49,750
I feel like the hard rocks

1487
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:56,630
especially this one being like a kind of a flagship one, they have like some A list stuff here.

1488
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:57,090
Yeah.

1489
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:57,350
Yes.

1490
00:58:57,350 --> 00:59:02,310
I mean, the cavern club bricks are funny, but legitimately it is wild.

1491
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:02,870
They have

1492
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,250
John and Yoko's marriage certificate.

1493
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:06,690
Oh my God.

1494
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:07,310
Wow.

1495
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:10,290
They have a, there is a John Lennon room

1496
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,230
you can visit.

1497
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:11,770
Yeah.

1498
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:17,250
My favorite John Lennon thing was a letter from John Lennon to Mal Evans

1499
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,950
regarding him having caught the measles.

1500
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:25,050
The love seat, a love seat he wrote a bunch of songs on,

1501
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,050
a little couch.

1502
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:29,530
Oh wait, no, isn't because I think, because I was getting some things mixed up.

1503
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:34,010
I believe that the hard rock hotel, and if we haven't clarified this, hotels are out of this

1504
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:36,350
saga because something has to be.

1505
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,910
Secretary Keeber never mentioned it, so we're just gonna

1506
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,490
pretend we never heard it.

1507
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:45,430
The John Lennon room is in the hotel, I think, and that's a thing that

1508
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,470
you can go ask for a tour of.

1509
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:48,130
Oh, okay.

1510
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,830
I think, because it's so huge, I don't think it would fit

1511
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:57,730
in here, but that is like decorated like his New York apartment and it's got a huge piano,

1512
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:04,850
huge, the piano, the size of a piano, but it's like white and ornate and every key is signed by a

1513
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:05,770
different music legend.

1514
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:08,470
The key is signed, but the piano itself is a replica.

1515
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,210
Oh, okay.

1516
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:09,930
That is not

1517
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:10,750
original piano.

1518
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:11,090
Gotcha.

1519
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:15,250
I was wondering, like this looks more like a hotel room over an apartment,

1520
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,090
where is it?

1521
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,110
But the attic.

1522
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:19,150
The attic is in here.

1523
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:19,890
At the restaurant.

1524
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,730
Yes, so if it wasn't enough that

1525
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:27,370
there's all of these endless rooms in this place, there's also one that is off the menu,

1526
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:33,290
the attic, where things are a little disorganized and it's just, they like fake you out.

1527
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:33,950
I think

1528
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,510
there used to be a time at least where they offered tours of this.

1529
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:39,030
You would go and ask for the vibe

1530
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:42,190
tour is what there were people who were called the vibe hosts.

1531
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:43,970
Yeah, I got a lot to say about the

1532
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:44,270
vibe.

1533
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:45,650
Can we?

1534
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:46,250
Yes.

1535
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:46,530
Yeah.

1536
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:49,810
Well, let me say one of the things you could do is go to the secret room,

1537
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,250
the attic.

1538
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:54,870
It's a little more disorganized, but like it's signed by all the acts that played the

1539
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:55,610
that venue.

1540
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:01,090
I think they used it as a green room kind of for, so just there's all like you were like,

1541
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:07,510
you know, you're, you're made to feel small in the universe by how much memorabilia there is in

1542
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:08,010
this place.

1543
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:12,550
And then there's still another one that we don't even get to go to anymore because

1544
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:13,970
you would have had to ask a vibe host.

1545
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:15,690
I don't know if they still have vibe host.

1546
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:16,050
What's the deal

1547
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:16,690
with vibe host?

1548
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,610
I don't know if they have to still vibe host either.

1549
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:21,210
I found this on a 2013 touring

1550
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,870
plans blog post.

1551
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:29,650
The vibe hosts, quote, walk around the entire restaurant, meeting with guests and

1552
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:35,350
answering any questions they may have about the hard rock cafe and doing their best to create an

1553
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,510
experience for each guest.

1554
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:41,890
They also carry with them an iPad that contains an app which allow

1555
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:46,650
guests to pick out songs that play in the whole restaurant.

1556
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,170
You could pick the music.

1557
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:48,790
And these

1558
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:52,890
are, these two are credit as, uh, Lauren and Randy rock.

1559
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,830
Now I don't know if that's Lauren rock and

1560
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:56,730
Randy rock.

1561
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,210
Were they characters or did they only hire people?

1562
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:01,610
Looks like a character.

1563
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:05,210
Oh yeah.

1564
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:05,330
Yeah.

1565
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,930
People with the last name rock.

1566
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,350
That is a good question.

1567
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,510
I mean like rock or wall because it's

1568
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:12,290
like, Oh, that's so funny.

1569
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:16,310
We have the Berlin wall right out there and your last name's your

1570
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,150
Henry wall.

1571
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:17,530
Yeah.

1572
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:18,330
Get in here.

1573
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:18,730
Jason.

1574
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:20,490
They would, they would hire Henry.

1575
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,670
Your cousin, Erica rock.

1576
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,430
Would they have hired Robert wool?

1577
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:24,710
Cause it's close to wall.

1578
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,590
Only if they misheard what he said.

1579
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:26,730
Only

1580
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:27,230
if they, okay.

1581
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,050
The job interview.

1582
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:30,430
Um, yeah, it's wild.

1583
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:33,130
This is such a, this is such a massive campus.

1584
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:36,310
And then I haven't even gotten to my favorite area.

1585
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,470
And this is really like, there's this too.

1586
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:44,390
They have the Florida room, an entire room just for Florida's prominent musicians.

1587
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:46,050
Um, this is

1588
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:50,490
another one where you're like, Oh my God, I watched this so many times.

1589
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:51,790
I can't believe they have this.

1590
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:56,310
They have the jacket that Tom Petty wore and the, you don't know how it feels video.

1591
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:56,810
Yeah.

1592
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:00,190
Another

1593
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:02,550
tasseled wardrobe pieces.

1594
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:05,030
You told me this right after you had seen it and you were like, just like

1595
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:06,130
incredulous.

1596
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:07,890
They have that.

1597
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:10,450
We wear these on the, these on the turntable.

1598
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,090
Weird things are

1599
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:11,850
happening behind you.

1600
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:12,390
Yeah.

1601
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:16,410
Uh, it's that's such, I feel like I was on MTV like every hour for a long

1602
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:16,770
time.

1603
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:23,530
Um, so Florida greats like Tom Petty and Scott staff, they got some shirt that Scott staff

1604
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:26,770
wears a bit less iconic, but hang on now.

1605
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:27,210
Sorry.

1606
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,470
What do you mean?

1607
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:29,870
Uh, uh,

1608
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:36,310
Cat Boone's shoes, Joey Fatone shoes from the gone video.

1609
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:39,630
And then my favorite area of the Florida room,

1610
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:46,430
uh, personal effects, belonging to Fred Durst, he of Jacksonville, Florida, a lot are just like,

1611
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:49,730
there's like receipts, receipts for things he bought.

1612
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:52,250
He went into a shop on Melrose Avenue

1613
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:56,410
and bought something for $500 and you can only see part of it.

1614
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:58,370
And it does say red at the end.

1615
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:58,490
And

1616
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:01,130
like hat was a hat.

1617
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:04,410
It doesn't seem like one of those hats would have cost $500, but I don't know

1618
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,830
you're Fred Durst in 99.

1619
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:08,510
You're probably only paying top dollar for red hats.

1620
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:09,810
You might be right.

1621
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:10,750
Could be.

1622
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,950
I mean, that would be, he's associated with the color.

1623
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:14,630
Yeah.

1624
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,710
Um, I loved my time in the

1625
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:17,410
Florida room.

1626
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:21,990
Um, this wasn't an, I don't know where this person or band is from, but, uh,

1627
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:26,790
I did like seeing a smashed guitar from owned by God smack.

1628
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:31,210
And then the plaque, this might be the best plaque in the place.

1629
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:33,730
This Gibson Les Paul was rocked,

1630
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:38,410
rolled and utterly destroyed by God smack front man Sully Erna.

1631
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:41,930
His inscription reads one bad night.

1632
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,750
Was it, or was it the best night there ever was?

1633
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,690
Sully Erna.

1634
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,010
We know that now.

1635
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:51,230
Yeah, we do Sully

1636
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,730
Erna will be coming to the show more often.

1637
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:57,230
Well, the end coming to theaters, my biopic Sully.

1638
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,930
I have not run it.

1639
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:04,410
I've not run the check on it's about the origin for this and the trial that

1640
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:07,150
ensued after the fact mostly about the trial.

1641
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:07,630
Yeah.

1642
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:07,930
Yeah.

1643
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:12,010
You destroyed over $700 worth of

1644
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:13,730
Gibson Les Paul equipment.

1645
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,290
You don't think that this guitar regulatory bureau is going to make

1646
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,530
it through a couple of weeks of trials.

1647
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,090
You've got another thing coming, Sully.

1648
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:22,830
Yeah.

1649
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:23,490
Uh, did you

1650
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,450
say Elvis's karate outfit was here?

1651
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:26,870
I didn't mention that.

1652
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:27,750
I missed it.

1653
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:28,150
Okay.

1654
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,050
So many things.

1655
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:30,770
Elvis's karate outfit is here.

1656
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,850
I really like that being there.

1657
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:34,170
Wow.

1658
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:35,710
Apparently they have a contract

1659
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:42,190
signed by Fats Domino and the contract says that he can end a concert at any time if the concert

1660
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:49,750
venue turned on an air conditioner because Fats Domino grew up singing in Southern churches,

1661
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:53,770
which never had AC and he found that AC messed up his voice.

1662
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:54,170
Yeah.

1663
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:54,350
Dry.

1664
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:54,570
Yeah.

1665
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:55,310
It'll dry out.

1666
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,090
Dry out.

1667
01:05:56,270 --> 01:06:01,190
So do not put on air conditioning in the presence of Fats Domino or Fats is out.

1668
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:01,830
He's out

1669
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,750
like the Davies brothers having a big fight.

1670
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:04,750
That's pretty cool.

1671
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:05,330
Yeah.

1672
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:05,850
Yeah.

1673
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,230
Ironically kind of

1674
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,790
tough in Orlando, Florida.

1675
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:10,430
Yeah.

1676
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:14,350
You want that air conditioning on it is hot and muggy most of the

1677
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:14,570
year.

1678
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,350
Thank God Fats isn't around to put on concerts now.

1679
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:17,750
Yeah.

1680
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:18,650
I don't know if people would

1681
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:19,590
put up with that shit.

1682
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:20,070
Yeah.

1683
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:25,570
Um, maybe the coolest thing that they had, uh, past tense.

1684
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:26,470
Were you guys

1685
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:32,570
ever there in the time where, and this is okay, they, they brought back Earl's baby, the indoor

1686
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:33,630
outdoor, not indoor outdoor.

1687
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:34,270
What do you call it?

1688
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,430
The in park out park.

1689
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:35,570
Yeah.

1690
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,190
The magical

1691
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:40,730
inside outside park portal limbo restaurant.

1692
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:41,330
Yeah.

1693
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:41,530
Yeah.

1694
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:41,830
Okay.

1695
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,490
They brought back Earl's limbo.

1696
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:43,930
Yeah.

1697
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:48,670
What's the, what's the, what's the kind of box, the box with the conundrum

1698
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,730
flicker Schrodinger's or something.

1699
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:52,330
Yeah.

1700
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:52,570
Yeah.

1701
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:53,210
Something like that.

1702
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,010
Am I fucking that up?

1703
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,370
Lament configuration from Hellraiser.

1704
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:58,330
That's not what I mean, but I like that.

1705
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,350
Well, yeah,

1706
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:04,310
we'll just go with, uh, uh, Earl's, uh, Schrodinger's cat.

1707
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:05,830
Is that what I mean?

1708
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,010
Schroeder's box.

1709
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:07,510
Yeah.

1710
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:07,810
Yeah.

1711
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:08,630
Okay.

1712
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:09,090
Schroeder.

1713
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:09,390
Yeah.

1714
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:10,350
Um, yes.

1715
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:13,430
Well, this, that's, that's Earl's limbo, Earl's purgatory.

1716
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:14,410
Um,

1717
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:20,270
on the Nickelodeon studios side of things, that's part of the, you know, they lost the other area,

1718
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:21,990
where it's weirdly decay.

1719
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:27,530
I love, we didn't mention the, the time where, uh, it's all the kid stuff,

1720
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:35,230
I was Playland Barney and then still Psycho House and now an unopened hard rock cafe that they've

1721
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:41,990
tried to make more pleasant by painting four stars on of, of light colors that immediately faded in

1722
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,770
the Florida heat.

1723
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:46,810
But like now it's just a, do a oddly ghostly decay.

1724
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:47,870
It literally just looks like

1725
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:49,650
some weird haunted temple or something.

1726
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:49,850
Yeah.

1727
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,370
This area gave me the creep.

1728
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:51,970
Yeah.

1729
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,330
Yeah.

1730
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:53,170
I mean,

1731
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,890
I'm a little sad it's gone, but yes, it makes sense.

1732
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,950
I'm just, I'm glad they blew it up and

1733
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,410
they're kept DT, but okay.

1734
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,630
So then you go to the other side, it opens on the other side and they

1735
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:06,910
do the same like little special entrance right by Nickelodeon studios, cool area.

1736
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:08,410
And in, in a

1737
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:12,410
planter over there was parked the magical mystery tour bus.

1738
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,330
I have seen that at universe.

1739
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:16,110
Yeah.

1740
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:16,630
I

1741
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:17,530
have seen that.

1742
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:21,310
That one really baffled as a kid, like, Oh my God, the magical, wow.

1743
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:23,150
The bus from a

1744
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,550
terrible film.

1745
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:25,970
Let's be honest.

1746
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:29,510
Look, we, everyone likes, we act like everything the Beatles ever did

1747
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,050
was perfect.

1748
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:31,810
Magical mystery tour is a tough one.

1749
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:32,850
I haven't seen all of it.

1750
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:34,510
It's if you, if you view

1751
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,890
it as just like a bunch of music videos and you're like, okay, well your mother should know is

1752
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:38,530
fucking great.

1753
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,590
I'm the walrus is great, but you watch it as all one thing.

1754
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,830
I think it was regarded

1755
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,230
as like Paul's folly.

1756
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:49,150
I think the other guys are like, what are we on high school?

1757
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,150
I made a point

1758
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:57,650
like learning about the Beatles and going through the albums and listening to that album like on a,

1759
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:02,230
you know, Walkman in the, you know, early, early two thousands.

1760
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:05,570
I was like, well, this one has some,

1761
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:09,310
a handful of good songs, but it's not a great album.

1762
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:10,950
Well, it's not a proper album.

1763
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:11,510
I think

1764
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:16,070
only the first half is songs for the special and the other half are like singles they had at the

1765
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,590
time.

1766
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:22,070
So it's like not, not technically nonetheless seeing the bus, very cool, but I think they play

1767
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,050
favorites with this bus.

1768
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:26,250
They move it to the newest, shiniest hard rock facility.

1769
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,270
I think for a while

1770
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:28,770
it was well, not for long.

1771
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:30,250
It was at hard rock park.

1772
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:34,050
And then it ended up at one of the casinos

1773
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,270
they opened or something.

1774
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:37,850
Lucky person that gets to drive that bus around.

1775
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:38,390
Yeah.

1776
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:38,690
Wow.

1777
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:39,150
What do you

1778
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:39,330
think?

1779
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:44,530
Imagine being just like, I don't know the character of the bus driver in mystery tour,

1780
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:48,870
not especially popular, but yeah, you'd feel just like that.

1781
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:49,110
Yeah.

1782
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,190
Unpopular character.

1783
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:51,870
So

1784
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:53,190
that's all the stuff.

1785
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,470
I loved my weird walk through there.

1786
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:56,450
I was humbled.

1787
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:59,210
I reflected on a lot of

1788
01:09:59,210 --> 01:09:59,670
things.

1789
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:02,590
And, but that's not it.

1790
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:03,330
It's not okay.

1791
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:04,810
There's a thousand rooms at this place.

1792
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:05,290
And then

1793
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:06,630
also the concert venue.

1794
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:07,270
Yes.

1795
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:12,670
Hard rock live still seemingly one of the biggest concert facilities

1796
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:14,230
in the Orlando area.

1797
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:14,730
Yeah.

1798
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:17,410
It seems like the big, you know, if you're not, if it's, if it's not the

1799
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:19,050
arena, it should be the biggest shows.

1800
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:19,430
Right.

1801
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:22,930
Maybe it's house of blues and then it is, is that still,

1802
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:28,030
that's still there or Disney Springs or blues in Disney Springs?

1803
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:31,410
I think so.

1804
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:31,770
Yeah.

1805
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:32,930
On the one side

1806
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:35,350
by like the former NBA experience.

1807
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:35,970
Okay.

1808
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:39,190
I got dropped off there once I sprinted through

1809
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:42,990
Disney Springs for 45 minutes on this last trip and God, I was confused.

1810
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:44,090
Like I was so confused

1811
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:44,950
where everything was.

1812
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:47,830
I kind of know where everything is, but I was still just like,

1813
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:53,310
I was trying to get to Gideon's and then I was trying to get, I forget, I was trying to buy a

1814
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:57,130
bag to put things into good and get on the plane and I was so lost.

1815
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:58,470
It is so massive.

1816
01:10:59,310 --> 01:10:59,310
Yeah.

1817
01:10:59,410 --> 01:10:59,810
Like

1818
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:03,270
there's no way we'll ever do a saga about that.

1819
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:04,650
No way.

1820
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:06,010
All right.

1821
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:07,250
I'll quote you on that.

1822
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:07,970
Wow.

1823
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:08,870
Wow.

1824
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,930
There's no way we can do a saga.

1825
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,270
It does seem.

1826
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,570
Stop this battle of wills.

1827
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:14,590
I can't take it.

1828
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:15,010
You too.

1829
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:16,290
No, no, no, no, no.

1830
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:17,390
I'm, there's no battle.

1831
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,470
I can't believe Mike is saying, I'm like, wow,

1832
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:24,350
Mike is willingly ruled out a complicated saga.

1833
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,830
There's not, let me, well, I won't quote, I won't

1834
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:31,570
quote a man who's done a lot of evil things, but I'll say, well, we already talked about spacey

1835
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:31,750
earlier.

1836
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:33,410
I was going to quote Vince McMahon.

1837
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:36,190
There's no chance in hell we're doing Disney

1838
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:40,790
brings saga, but hell is a place where the sector keeper might go if we do.

1839
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:41,770
What if he needs us?

1840
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:42,510
Yeah.

1841
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:49,730
And listen to me, there's no, there's no great balls of fire.

1842
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:51,270
We aren't doing,

1843
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:51,710
listen to me.

1844
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:54,170
There's no way in hell I'm dating that woman.

1845
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,250
I'm not related to.

1846
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:58,190
Yeah.

1847
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,330
So, so yeah, anyway, it's hard rock life.

1848
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:01,270
Hard rock life.

1849
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:04,330
Hey, March 29th.

1850
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:04,950
If you're in

1851
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:07,150
Orlando, we just mentioned him.

1852
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:11,310
A legendary night, Joey Fattona, Vince Sink and AJ McLean

1853
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,650
from Backstreet Boys.

1854
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:13,650
So they're together.

1855
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:14,490
They're teaming up.

1856
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:15,710
They're teaming up.

1857
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:15,810
Wow.

1858
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:16,150
Geez.

1859
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:16,910
Wow.

1860
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:19,630
Put combining their fractions.

1861
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:20,250
Hey.

1862
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,210
Or if you're there.

1863
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:23,510
Go ahead.

1864
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:24,790
In March,

1865
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:29,090
the show choir national championship series.

1866
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:30,170
Okay.

1867
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:31,550
All right.

1868
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:32,810
Fame Orlando.

1869
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:34,170
People, maybe people

1870
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:35,610
listening or participating.

1871
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:39,350
Maybe some people are singing with some gentle hand movements

1872
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,990
is what I know of show choir.

1873
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,570
I believe some swaying, some bouncing.

1874
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:45,390
That's another thing.

1875
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:45,750
I'd rather.

1876
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:49,450
Expected you to have done a show choir when you were a kid.

1877
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:51,910
Uh, I know I didn't.

1878
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:52,990
Did you ever think about it?

1879
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,750
I don't think it was ever an option.

1880
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:55,370
Okay.

1881
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:55,530
Well,

1882
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:56,610
that would be hard.

1883
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:59,210
I did chorus for a lot of years.

1884
01:12:59,410 --> 01:12:59,530
Right.

1885
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:00,410
Just not show choir.

1886
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:00,990
Yeah.

1887
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:01,450
Okay.

1888
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:04,030
How old were you when you're doing choir?

1889
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:05,270
Oh, middle school.

1890
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:07,690
Halfway through high school.

1891
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:08,370
Okay.

1892
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,730
What songs did you sing?

1893
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:16,530
Uh, like all, uh, Irish and Italian.

1894
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:19,010
Oh, ease on down, ease on down

1895
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:19,350
the road.

1896
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:21,970
I think you have said this before.

1897
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,950
I think you have said this before.

1898
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:24,510
Now that I think

1899
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:25,050
about it.

1900
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,910
What Jane also recently brought up.

1901
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:30,990
It's like, yeah, when I was in show choir, uh,

1902
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,190
we did the ease on down there.

1903
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:35,250
Oh, I was like, Oh, I know he's on down the road.

1904
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:35,930
That's funny.

1905
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:36,630
Wow.

1906
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:41,830
Uh, we also did, uh, though is that is in your review, the whiz white again,

1907
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:43,030
white again.

1908
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:47,950
We also did a spiritual called weed in the water.

1909
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:49,750
Have you ever weed in the water?

1910
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:53,550
What that is probably should have been saying that when Amy sang blackbird.

1911
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:54,670
Oh, wow.

1912
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:55,870
That's an easy

1913
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:56,830
one to give.

1914
01:13:58,990 --> 01:14:08,770
I said that our music teacher made us sing hero when I was in third grade or second

1915
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:12,390
grade by Mariah Carey, which, well, how did that sound?

1916
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:13,710
Yes.

1917
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,170
All of you have a bunch of kids

1918
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:16,990
striving for Mariah Carey.

1919
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:17,050
Yeah.

1920
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,050
And then I hear all comes along.

1921
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:23,190
Um, I, uh, uh, there was like a

1922
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:30,290
scene the music teachers would get and they would break down popular songs to like, and then you'd

1923
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:31,290
learn them in class.

1924
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:36,190
And I remember back to back one year it was, I believe I can fly.

1925
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:36,570
And then

1926
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:38,070
one year it was kiss from a row.

1927
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:38,330
Yeah.

1928
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:39,650
You've said the, yeah, we've talked about this.

1929
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:39,890
Yeah.

1930
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:40,110
Yeah.

1931
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:40,890
So

1932
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:45,870
those were, I wish you would perform at one of these, at these hard rock when you were,

1933
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,150
you never got the call.

1934
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:50,510
I mean, it might be able to, I was looking at the calendar coming up and

1935
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:53,410
there's some openings, you know, seemingly.

1936
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:58,210
So you, so you were going to sing podcast.

1937
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,830
I think we need to team up with someone.

1938
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,350
Yeah.

1939
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:03,650
Yeah.

1940
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:03,930
We might.

1941
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:04,110
Yeah.

1942
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:05,330
We need to team up with the

1943
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,570
AJ and yeah.

1944
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:06,770
Yeah.

1945
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:07,090
Awesome.

1946
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:13,370
Um, uh, hard rock live opens with, uh, uh, uh, uh, a blast of rock and

1947
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:16,670
roll from the Glen fry band featuring Joe Walsh.

1948
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:19,110
That is the first concert in 99.

1949
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:20,670
Uh, the Orlando

1950
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:27,430
weekly said the concept of rock and roll as theme park attraction took two steps forward with Joe

1951
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:28,250
Walsh and Glen fry.

1952
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:32,190
They played a professional, but perfunctory set that proved how lucrative the

1953
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:36,670
packaging of outlaw imagery has become to the business of family entertainment.

1954
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:38,550
What cut them

1955
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:42,510
down of the whole, that's fucking nailed their ass.

1956
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:42,870
Yeah.

1957
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:43,070
Yeah.

1958
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,010
Well, we, this is why we need,

1959
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,110
I miss our weeklies.

1960
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:50,010
I miss our, our, uh, our snarky papers to, to rip eagles, the new one and the like.

1961
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:54,050
Um, uh, anyway, so that, that kicked it off.

1962
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:57,390
Um, but you know, but, but tons of prominent concerts.

1963
01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:03,290
Um, I'm going to ask Mike, I feel like you've discussed being at this venue.

1964
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:03,690
Sure.

1965
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:05,010
Well, let's

1966
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:07,450
have, and we know, cause I've said it before.

1967
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:09,090
You remember who I saw.

1968
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:10,670
I don't.

1969
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:14,890
Or you remember the zone of type of act where I think I remember.

1970
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:15,430
Go ahead.

1971
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:16,550
Was it the goo goo

1972
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:16,670
dolls?

1973
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,010
You're a hundred percent correct.

1974
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:18,410
Okay.

1975
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:19,730
I have found the set list.

1976
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:20,950
I know the date now.

1977
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:21,450
Okay.

1978
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:26,470
So his, for historical purposes, this was June 14th, 2002.

1979
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:28,290
So it's 22 years ago.

1980
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:28,330
Well,

1981
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:29,650
let's cut, let's get to the chase.

1982
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:30,570
The big question.

1983
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,790
Did they do the song from treasure planet?

1984
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,610
Well, that's a solo John Resnick.

1985
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:37,990
So well, but you know, but he could do it.

1986
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:38,830
Glen fry, you know,

1987
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:40,890
they do Joe Walsh solo in the Eagle shows.

1988
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:41,610
No, you're right.

1989
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:42,050
Yeah.

1990
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,910
No, he did not do that.

1991
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:44,550
Uh,

1992
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,830
song.

1993
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:49,210
Uh, it was this of course, I was touring off of the album gutter flower.

1994
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:53,810
Just like how maybe let's like a quick pace to the set list.

1995
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,430
You could do.

1996
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:55,590
Oh, well, I was going to,

1997
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:58,770
I was going to read all of it, but if you want, I could just read some of the highlights.

1998
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:00,190
Might be good.

1999
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:02,250
Well, slide was number three slides.

2000
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:03,150
Probably the biggest tale.

2001
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,150
Well, I guess, uh,

2002
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:05,970
the city of angels, Iris song that's 17.

2003
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:08,030
They, they, they do that later in the set.

2004
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,110
Didn't then do they come back with like a rocker?

2005
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,930
Um, well the end song, which I have said this

2006
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:16,110
before on the show was a cover of Tom Petty's American girl.

2007
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:19,210
It was the finish of the show,

2008
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,510
which I remember being very excited about.

2009
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:22,910
This is cool.

2010
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,350
These guys are so cool.

2011
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:24,730
They don't even

2012
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:26,890
play their own song to close out a show.

2013
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,790
And that was my thought.

2014
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:30,970
They're so cool that they don't

2015
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:32,710
have the bravo.

2016
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:34,730
You know, the Google dolls were bold.

2017
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:36,430
Some acts limit themselves.

2018
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:37,490
Not the goose,

2019
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:38,410
not the goose.

2020
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,170
The goose.

2021
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:41,950
You know, they call the food fighters, the food sometimes, but I'm going

2022
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:42,630
to call the anyone.

2023
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:44,850
Are you inventing calling them the goose?

2024
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:46,770
I think I'm inventing it, but I might

2025
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:48,170
not be probably in the history.

2026
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:50,290
Google does been around for 30 years at this point.

2027
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:50,950
Sorry, did you

2028
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,870
say they call the food fighters, the food?

2029
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:53,990
I see that sometimes.

2030
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:57,690
Yeah, you do see never the goose,

2031
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:00,230
but the goose haven't been as prominent lately.

2032
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:02,430
I feel like in the rock and roll press, so you're

2033
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:04,130
not going to see it as much.

2034
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:05,590
It's really, it's a press thing.

2035
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:06,670
It's a media bias.

2036
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:07,130
Yeah.

2037
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:07,470
Food fighters

2038
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:11,190
still can play a stadium or an arena, but the Google dolls, not as much.

2039
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:13,050
Um, so yeah, somebody

2040
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:13,950
give them a shot.

2041
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,030
How about you?

2042
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:16,390
How about you do it?

2043
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:17,950
They opened up with a song, big machine,

2044
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:23,330
which was the first song on gutter flower, which I really liked at the time and still like now.

2045
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:27,970
But you know, it's a, it's a 21 song set list.

2046
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:30,010
They play all the, they play all the hits.

2047
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:30,150
They

2048
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:30,850
play Broadway.

2049
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:34,330
They play black balloon, you know, I don't know any of those.

2050
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:34,910
Yes, you do.

2051
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:35,290
I bet you

2052
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:37,130
know broad balloon is dark.

2053
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:39,070
That's it right there.

2054
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:39,530
Okay.

2055
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,410
A black balloon is like a real slow one,

2056
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:42,210
kind of a ballot.

2057
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:43,110
Okay.

2058
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:46,650
Um, but I don't want to, we're too late into this episode to torture.

2059
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:51,050
Only we could have, why didn't you get these out at the beginning?

2060
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:53,050
I know, I know people would have

2061
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:55,470
done the entire list up top.

2062
01:18:56,170 --> 01:19:00,230
Um, can I mention the thing I discovered filmed at the hard rock live?

2063
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:01,590
Did you encounter this?

2064
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:01,910
Yeah.

2065
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,970
Unless you were, unless you had more to go, Mike,

2066
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,670
weren't there other bands that I saw?

2067
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:07,230
Actually no.

2068
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:09,370
I only saw it was a vacation.

2069
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:10,090
I saw my mom

2070
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:11,250
and my sister and I were there.

2071
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,010
I didn't see, I was about to say my saw them on stage.

2072
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:13,350
They did

2073
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:14,790
perform with the Google dolls.

2074
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,550
Although that would have been thrilling.

2075
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:17,450
They were brought

2076
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:18,450
up for American girl.

2077
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:19,250
Um, yes.

2078
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:19,570
Yeah.

2079
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:23,150
Uh, uh, call back to an earlier episode.

2080
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:24,450
Um,

2081
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:28,830
Creed's music video for hire is filmed at the hard rock live.

2082
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:29,830
Really?

2083
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:30,570
Okay.

2084
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:31,880
So not the one

2085
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:36,690
that we talked about in the second gate episode with the like catastrophe happening.

2086
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:37,350
That's my

2087
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:37,930
sacrifice.

2088
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:40,990
My sacrifice was filmed on the New York streets.

2089
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,710
They flooded the streets.

2090
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:43,330
He had a little

2091
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:44,090
rowboat.

2092
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:46,110
There was some surreal imagery.

2093
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:51,210
This one, they filmed like backstage and on stage and they

2094
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:58,770
use some like slow motion technique or like camera rigs that were very advanced for the 2000s.

2095
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:03,270
And he said real filmmakers, Creed, real filmmakers.

2096
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:05,910
Uh, Scott steps said it's very

2097
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:10,410
embarrassing to look back on and it's, I was submitted.

2098
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,110
It's kind of nothing.

2099
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:19,630
I besides the like slow motion, like he's hovering in the air, like a Christ like figure, maybe that

2100
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:25,270
the budget, like this was higher was like the big hits that really like broke them out.

2101
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:25,990
I feel like

2102
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,790
where they were.

2103
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:29,970
So like they probably didn't have the budget I'm saying to, to do anything crazy

2104
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:30,650
and ambitious yet.

2105
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:36,570
I think he is mostly embarrassed by the leather pants that he was wearing a lot at

2106
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,250
the time.

2107
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:42,910
Um, and all the memories of shooting this music video is like, I had to get done very

2108
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:45,670
quickly cause we were about to go on tour in Japan.

2109
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:46,390
Okay.

2110
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:48,530
Well yeah, he was, I don't know, if I were

2111
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:54,330
Scott step, I'd be embarrassed by yes, the leather pants and also all the other clothes and also my

2112
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:59,950
hair and also the music that we were performing and the music video that we made and all the other

2113
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,170
music that we made.

2114
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,210
Well, I was going to, you know what I was going to say?

2115
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:06,510
Don't worry about it, Scott.

2116
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:08,550
You're being too hard on yourself.

2117
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:10,050
Good cop, good cop.

2118
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:13,430
That was my advice to him, but he can choose his own adventure.

2119
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:14,990
I always beat myself up.

2120
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:15,590
Yeah.

2121
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:17,950
I'm my own worst enemy.

2122
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,930
I know that's another bad song, but I thought it

2123
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:22,310
resonated with me.

2124
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,510
I could have come in here and been like, did you know I saw lit at the hard rock

2125
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,010
life?

2126
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:26,270
Yeah.

2127
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:28,850
And you're really, yeah, what do they play?

2128
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:30,010
It's long from American pie too.

2129
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:32,630
That I can't remember the name of yet.

2130
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:34,430
Well then what you would say, you'd say what you said,

2131
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:37,450
well, well they played the hits, they played a set with the hits.

2132
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:38,850
So really the hits they played.

2133
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:41,590
I think, I think, okay, let's say black balloon.

2134
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:43,610
80% of the audience knows black balloon.

2135
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:43,930
I bet.

2136
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:44,870
Good for them.

2137
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,310
I'm just saying, I'm not saying you don't.

2138
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:48,690
I'm just saying it's not crazy for me to

2139
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,370
have said, of course black balloon.

2140
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:53,090
It's not crazy, but I don't think it's crazy for me to not know.

2141
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:57,250
I'm just saying that it's, I'm not wrong for assuming that you might know black balloon.

2142
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:58,050
That's all I'm saying.

2143
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:03,730
And I'm saying there's no, there's no plausible reason on this earth why I

2144
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:05,810
should or need to know black.

2145
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:08,130
You were alive during the summer of black balloon.

2146
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,190
That's the only reason

2147
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:09,910
I assume.

2148
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:15,530
I guess I, well, I didn't, I didn't have the ultimate summer of black balloon that I could

2149
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:15,990
have had.

2150
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:17,290
Turn it up.

2151
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:22,010
Jason would say when he was in the car cruising, is that black balloon?

2152
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:22,650
Crank

2153
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:23,170
it up.

2154
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:24,550
You're in the panzer seat.

2155
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:26,530
You turn, you're the closest to the radio.

2156
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:27,090
You turn.

2157
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:31,070
Creed, of course I'd send you guys this video recently.

2158
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:35,050
Summer of 99 tour this year Creed and

2159
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,170
three doors down on tour together.

2160
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:37,830
Wow.

2161
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:40,350
There's like a whole, like there's a little like skit

2162
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:44,730
and then he caught, he's like, somebody who should go with us.

2163
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,350
And then he doesn't talk like he

2164
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:50,950
sings, but I'm going to, he, well, it cuts to a phone and there's a guy who's like, Hey, what's

2165
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:51,570
up?

2166
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:54,110
And I'm like, you're in need to ID this person fast.

2167
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:57,090
I do not automatically know who this long

2168
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,670
air is that you're talking to.

2169
01:22:59,390 --> 01:22:59,390
Yeah.

2170
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:04,650
Of course it's what I think is it some of the stuff I like.

2171
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:08,070
So most songs better than some of this crap switch.

2172
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:08,410
Yeah.

2173
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:09,550
What does switch foot do again?

2174
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:10,470
I don't know.

2175
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:11,770
Not as popular as black balloon.

2176
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:13,590
Whatever that song switch foot does, they never

2177
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:14,730
add their black balloon.

2178
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:15,670
It did not.

2179
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:18,990
Um, our listeners had, I was like, I'm not going to look

2180
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:24,190
at every concert they ever did here, but I'm, I'm like, well, did any listeners have memorable

2181
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:26,770
concert moments at this hard rock live?

2182
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,410
Uh, a lot of comedy stuff that's fun.

2183
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,010
Mystery science

2184
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:33,010
theater, kids in the hall, uh, Tim and Eric all played here.

2185
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:35,110
Uh, listeners, Sarah got thrown out

2186
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,590
of an Aaron Carter concert.

2187
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:37,110
Oh my.

2188
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,730
Curious the details there.

2189
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:41,810
Um, uh, Travis saw Weezer doing

2190
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:46,950
an MTV taping at one point, something messed up and they had to perform Beverly Hills twice.

2191
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:53,450
Oh, the dream to get to hear Beverly Hills two times in one show.

2192
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:54,930
Did they change, did the solo,

2193
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:56,530
did they change to Brian or Rivers?

2194
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:57,790
I forget who plays the solo on it.

2195
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:58,570
They change it up.

2196
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:02,210
I probably had to be consistent for the taping so they could cut them together.

2197
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:02,870
I would think.

2198
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:03,750
Yeah.

2199
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:08,590
Um, Andrew Solaro at there at the top is after both of our hearts.

2200
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:10,710
Uh, he specified for me

2201
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:12,330
that he and his dad seems right.

2202
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:14,070
Saw Steely Dan there together.

2203
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:15,470
Uh, bare naked ladies.

2204
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:15,830
He saw

2205
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:16,150
there.

2206
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:20,010
I believe the first bare naked lady show without Steven page happened.

2207
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:20,610
Yeah.

2208
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:21,390
These responses

2209
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,130
were great.

2210
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:27,450
So that's a, that would be, uh, uh, if I saw that, that would be one of the most upsetting

2211
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:28,330
moments of my life.

2212
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:31,890
The first show where Steven wasn't there where they're all in, if somehow you

2213
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:36,270
didn't know if the band's coming out and then you're like, what, what, did he trip backstage?

2214
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:36,930
What happened?

2215
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:37,450
Yeah.

2216
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:39,130
Oh my goodness.

2217
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:39,890
Yeah.

2218
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:42,870
Well then it's, this might be a tough place for you

2219
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:43,750
to ever return to.

2220
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:47,290
No, that being said, I've been watching videos of the four of them still playing

2221
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:47,890
recently.

2222
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:50,630
And when I say recently, I mean an hour and a half ago.

2223
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,850
Oh, you mean you recently,

2224
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:58,070
you just were, I mean I watched every, the non-Steven version of the band play a few songs on YouTube

2225
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:00,170
with my daughter two hours ago.

2226
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:03,270
So you'll still tell, even though you're, you're seething with

2227
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:04,610
anger, you'll tolerate it.

2228
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:05,330
I'll tell her.

2229
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:05,430
Yeah.

2230
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:07,370
I like some of, I like some of it.

2231
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:09,310
Uh, for turncoats,

2232
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:10,310
sweetie.

2233
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:13,950
I'll say, look, I'll say this.

2234
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:16,850
It's not fair that I feel some feelings like that about

2235
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:17,710
them.

2236
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:17,710
Okay.

2237
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:19,430
Now it's not fair though.

2238
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:20,970
I just want him back in the band.

2239
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:22,290
When did he leave the band?

2240
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:25,970
Cause I saw them in Atlantic city 2013.

2241
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:27,590
Uh, he was gone by then.

2242
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:28,750
Yeah, he was gone by then.

2243
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:29,190
You didn't

2244
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,490
even notice.

2245
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:33,310
Fair weather fan Jason had no idea.

2246
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:34,210
I am a fair weather fan.

2247
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:35,030
You didn't even know.

2248
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:36,230
My

2249
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:39,430
youngest people there probably by 10 to 20 years.

2250
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:42,670
It upsets me so much that that's an average person

2251
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:46,150
goes and they go, Hey, the one week part of the song sounds different.

2252
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:46,570
Yeah.

2253
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:47,130
Whatever.

2254
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:49,290
Yeah, I know

2255
01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:49,670
the paint.

2256
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:53,450
Well, it's like people, when people tell me that beach boys are doing the Hollywood

2257
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:53,670
bowl.

2258
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:54,750
No, they're not.

2259
01:25:55,150 --> 01:26:00,670
One of them is the rest are all elsewhere and two of them are dead.

2260
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:01,110
Yeah.

2261
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:01,970
Damn it.

2262
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:02,370
Yeah.

2263
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:06,350
Um, also the same guy, Andrew, I had my ninth grade homecoming dance there.

2264
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:06,470
We

2265
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:10,950
got to take pictures on the stage and I said to my friend, can you believe we're standing where

2266
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:12,450
smashing pumpkins did?

2267
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:18,510
I wouldn't be able to couple smashing pumpkins mentions, couple strings.

2268
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:19,950
She's incident mentions.

2269
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:23,570
I don't know if I've heard a string cheese incident song.

2270
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,070
Yeah, I have,

2271
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:25,850
they don't have one.

2272
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:26,470
They have one.

2273
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:27,410
They have just one.

2274
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:28,150
Yeah.

2275
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:30,730
They've just, they've made one, uh,

2276
01:26:30,730 --> 01:26:32,890
a 20 year long song.

2277
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:33,430
Yeah.

2278
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:35,690
They're still playing.

2279
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:38,130
They're still recording right now.

2280
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:38,990
Um, uh,

2281
01:26:39,670 --> 01:26:43,810
let me though, let me bring it back to something you mentioned, uh, early.

2282
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:44,250
Well, actually,

2283
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:45,110
actually two quick things.

2284
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:46,710
Uh, they've taped an entire show.

2285
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:48,970
Well, uh, uh, Travis mentioned the

2286
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:49,510
MTV show.

2287
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:52,250
There was a whole MTV series filmed here.

2288
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:54,670
Uh, AT&T wireless presents hard rock live

2289
01:26:55,410 --> 01:27:01,750
and, uh, with, or all the best bands performed, Evanescence, Huba, Stank, God smack and Jason's

2290
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:07,570
favorite par more, um, those strong lineup there.

2291
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:10,070
But my favorite thing that I saw that happened at

2292
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:13,690
hard rock live, this is very Orlando and it ties it back to something Jason said earlier.

2293
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:14,710
Uh, um,

2294
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:19,130
so AJ McLean is playing there soon from the backstreet boys.

2295
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:19,510
Yeah.

2296
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:22,490
Um, and actually AJ McLean,

2297
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:25,150
I don't think has played there before.

2298
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:27,050
Um, is that confusing?

2299
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:27,550
Yeah.

2300
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:29,050
Well, a little bit because

2301
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:36,410
he hasn't played, but a rock and roller who bears a little resemblance to AJ McLean may have,

2302
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:39,130
I'm talking about Johnny no name.

2303
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:42,290
Does anyone have any, I feel like I might be the first person to

2304
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,070
mention this in any media ever.

2305
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:44,750
That's probably right.

2306
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,990
Uh, besides MTV news at the time.

2307
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:48,290
I, uh,

2308
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:53,830
basically AJ, the bad boy of the backstreet boys had to get out some of his bad boy energy

2309
01:27:53,830 --> 01:28:01,850
somehow outside of backstreet and, uh, he invented a kind of, it's really like a quarter committed to

2310
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:06,430
Chris Gaines, another guy who's a, uh, a less committed to Chris.

2311
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:06,810
Yes.

2312
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:07,270
Yeah.

2313
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:07,750
Yeah.

2314
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:08,510
That with

2315
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:13,730
it's confusing, but at least he had like a, a costume that made him look a little bit different.

2316
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:19,490
Johnny no name just dressed as far as I can tell exactly like AJ McLean, but just, you know,

2317
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:22,510
he wouldn't wear like the all white, like you'd have to in the backstreet boys.

2318
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:22,810
Yeah.

2319
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:23,050
Anyway,

2320
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:23,290
yeah.

2321
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:26,490
Johnny no name is his, his rock and roll alter ego.

2322
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:29,530
Um, and, uh, okay.

2323
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:30,230
This is from some

2324
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:31,630
Orlando from an Orlando paper.

2325
01:28:31,850 --> 01:28:34,970
According to the Johnny no name official website, Johnny met the

2326
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:38,610
members of his band while serving time in prison after a false arrest.

2327
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:40,490
And he must be escorted onto

2328
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:44,370
the stage by his parole officer, uncle marshmallow.

2329
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:48,510
Now we know this mythology,

2330
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:53,950
Johnny no name, the rock star whose parole officer has to stay with him.

2331
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:54,450
And the parole

2332
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:55,850
officer's name is uncle marshmallow.

2333
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,930
Why is, why does he have a weird name?

2334
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:00,690
He is a parole officer.

2335
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:04,170
He does a normal kind of straight laced job.

2336
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:05,930
Why is he uncle marshmallow?

2337
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:07,610
Why is uncle in there at

2338
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:08,030
all?

2339
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:08,950
Is it his uncle?

2340
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:09,490
Yeah.

2341
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:12,510
It should be like Richard marshmallow or Henry.

2342
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:15,370
I pick Henry.

2343
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:16,350
I'm going with Henry.

2344
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:19,230
Henry marsh officer, Henry marshmallow.

2345
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:19,950
Now,

2346
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:22,710
if that's your last name, then it is, you can't help that.

2347
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:25,390
It's silly, but uncle only serves to

2348
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:26,270
make it sillier.

2349
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:30,210
Probably AJ's intended effect, but frankly, it makes me question the entire reality

2350
01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:31,890
of the Johnny no name universe.

2351
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:35,730
This is a professional wrestling gimmick where it's like,

2352
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:37,070
they're so dangerous.

2353
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:38,550
They need to be escorted.

2354
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:39,310
Yeah.

2355
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:39,870
Yeah.

2356
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:40,110
Yeah.

2357
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:41,470
From the police or something.

2358
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:41,870
Yeah.

2359
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:42,270
Yeah.

2360
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:48,390
No, he's going to like grab somebody's beer, smash it, slice up everybody in the audience

2361
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:50,890
and then still don't go try to do his set.

2362
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:52,030
Johnny.

2363
01:29:52,330 --> 01:29:56,410
So this is trying to escape maybe just the like

2364
01:29:56,410 --> 01:29:58,090
teen girl audience exclusively.

2365
01:29:58,890 --> 01:29:59,030
Yeah.

2366
01:29:59,030 --> 01:29:59,050
Yeah.

2367
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:00,930
Teeny bopper, you know?

2368
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:03,370
And, you know, he's not the kind

2369
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:07,570
of reserved, very Christian Brian Luttrell.

2370
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:08,030
Right.

2371
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:09,870
He's not a good boy in the band.

2372
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:10,250
Right.

2373
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:11,430
He's a rock

2374
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:12,270
and roll maniac.

2375
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:16,550
And that brings me to this interview from MTV news, which might be the only

2376
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:18,950
prior media about Johnny no name.

2377
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:22,030
He's being interviewed by, uh, is this Chris Connelly?

2378
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:22,150
Is

2379
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:22,770
that his name?

2380
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:23,130
Yeah.

2381
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:24,170
Um, so it cuts.

2382
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:24,670
All right.

2383
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:28,970
So there's a band and they're all, uh, in different

2384
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:30,390
kinds of fedoras.

2385
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,270
One of them, one is in a red fedora.

2386
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:37,050
One is in a cow hide, sleeveless

2387
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:43,130
vest that frankly it, you know what it's like is like when Fred Flintstone in the 1994 movie

2388
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:49,390
comes into a lot of money and goes to see the B 50 to be C 52 is incidentally anyway, that's what

2389
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:52,690
this, this cool, probably going for pimp vibe.

2390
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:55,370
He just, he looks like rich Fred Flintstone.

2391
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:59,730
But anyway, here's the reveal of another facet of Johnny no name.

2392
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:00,650
He's British.

2393
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:05,530
Now does Johnny get the same kind of fanatic fan base that AJ does?

2394
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:06,470
Is there screaming?

2395
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:07,070
Is there

2396
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:08,130
this nodding from the back here?

2397
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:08,710
Yeah.

2398
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:12,150
There's lots of screaming, lots of craziness, you know,

2399
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:12,930
take it from him.

2400
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:15,690
You know, you know, well, crazy, right.

2401
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:18,710
Actually a lot more panties than,

2402
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:21,810
you know, actually gets, I get all the good panties.

2403
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:24,630
Good paintings.

2404
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:30,150
It's always, always, always everyone.

2405
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:31,090
I kissed the wide bag.

2406
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:32,030
I get all the phones, man.

2407
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:43,990
I mean, it sounds like the music does sound like everything in that list.

2408
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:45,050
I read the MTV

2409
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:45,450
film.

2410
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:47,750
There sounds like I'm like a velvet revolver song.

2411
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:48,290
Totally.

2412
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:48,830
Yeah.

2413
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:49,890
This is plausibly.

2414
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:53,310
There's, there's a lot of music as bad as Johnny.

2415
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:55,430
No, it's not the worst thing.

2416
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:58,030
He is wearing a fedora.

2417
01:31:58,130 --> 01:31:59,610
Like he is about to go soft.

2418
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:00,110
The mystery,

2419
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:09,410
while the Johnny no name Chronicles, Johnny, no name is helping out more.

2420
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:09,870
Sure.

2421
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:11,330
Spade is helping

2422
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:12,090
out Clive.

2423
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:13,650
Oh, and it monsures speed.

2424
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:18,250
I couldn't not talk about Johnny.

2425
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:18,890
No name.

2426
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:22,910
If you know anything else about, if you were like a backstreet fan at the time and you could point

2427
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:26,550
me to any more info about Johnny known it because we like our rock star alter egos.

2428
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:27,070
Those count.

2429
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:29,090
Those are theme parks, Mr.

2430
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:31,750
McPhisto and Chris Gaines.

2431
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:33,190
And now if there was enough for a Johnny

2432
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:38,870
no name episode, I wonder if you follow like sort of any of the non Timberlake careers right after

2433
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:41,610
the boom or the like part of a boy band.

2434
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:43,990
I bet everybody's got an interesting project.

2435
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:44,690
They tried

2436
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:46,250
like to break them out of the mall.

2437
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:46,730
Yes.

2438
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:49,430
Not that it's always going to be as rich and good as Johnny

2439
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:53,830
no name, but I bet, I bet there's something like one guy tried to open up a popcorn store or

2440
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:56,270
something like just random random as well.

2441
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:59,150
Not necessarily alter ego cookbook or two in there

2442
01:32:59,150 --> 01:32:59,550
somewhere.

2443
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:00,130
Yeah.

2444
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:02,830
Everybody had some idea of like, well, what do we do now?

2445
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:04,210
Maybe not even realizing

2446
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:07,290
that like, I just give it like 10 years and then we'll just do this forever.

2447
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:08,310
Chris Kirkpatrick

2448
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:10,970
started shitting on the American flag.

2449
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:11,850
Yeah, sure.

2450
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,210
You wanted to be a performance.

2451
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:15,230
Our idea.

2452
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:21,710
There would be a series of troll movies that would need pop songs, you know, you'd have to clean up

2453
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:22,430
his act again.

2454
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:26,510
Anyway, so a lot of history at this place.

2455
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:27,050
Yeah.

2456
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:30,150
You know, if we're a lot of things

2457
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:34,870
that these city, what kind of environments you wonder like why, what is the real function of

2458
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:35,070
this?

2459
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:41,210
But this is a legitimate concert venue that allowed artists like Johnny no name to work

2460
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:42,190
something out.

2461
01:33:43,070 --> 01:33:45,870
So, you know, none of this pointless.

2462
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:47,570
I love the dumb building.

2463
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:49,090
God bless you in your

2464
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,130
awful architecture.

2465
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:53,610
And maybe just one little closing note.

2466
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:57,330
Apparently, what could have been,

2467
01:33:57,430 --> 01:34:03,490
I think in 1990, probably Robert Earl went and met with Disney and he said, do you want a hard rock

2468
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:03,930
cafe?

2469
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:06,430
And Eisner said, why would we do that?

2470
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:09,290
We could do our own rock and roll themed restaurant.

2471
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:15,410
And then at least according to this editorial voice, Eisner lived to regret that decision.

2472
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:21,430
He viewed it as like he in a way that like I don't think a modern CEO and certainly modern

2473
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:22,510
politician does not do.

2474
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:25,210
Eisner said, you know, we thought we were the experts.

2475
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:25,910
No one could do it

2476
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:26,690
as well as we could.

2477
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:27,930
I was guilty of this.

2478
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:28,810
Let's all do it.

2479
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:30,570
Let's do it all ourselves attitude.

2480
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:35,710
And making a mistake once is painful, but there has to be room for failure or no one will ever

2481
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:36,450
take chances.

2482
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:38,770
But they never did a rock and roll restaurant.

2483
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:41,130
The great man gives us more guidance.

2484
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:43,830
They never really got the restaurant.

2485
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:46,550
You could enter from either side quite right.

2486
01:34:46,610 --> 01:34:46,950
Well,

2487
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:49,630
they have it, but it's just that rain fires cafe.

2488
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:51,210
I don't think you're going to enter the park

2489
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:51,550
through there.

2490
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:52,230
Can you?

2491
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:53,070
I never tried.

2492
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:53,650
I don't know.

2493
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:55,470
Oh, isn't that just fully outside?

2494
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:55,690
I think

2495
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,570
it's outside.

2496
01:34:56,710 --> 01:35:00,370
And if you're coming from the park, if you're leaving the park, though, you can get in.

2497
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:01,790
Is that it?

2498
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:06,550
I think that maybe you can't enter from, I think maybe I'm wrong.

2499
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:08,170
It's not like,

2500
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:09,870
yes, see, we're not really sure.

2501
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:10,690
We're not on.

2502
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:12,530
So it's their fault for not even making it clear

2503
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:12,630
to us.

2504
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:15,570
You should know that if it worked, we would know.

2505
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:16,350
Yeah.

2506
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:17,410
And you know what?

2507
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:18,850
I'm a big Eisner fan,

2508
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:19,470
of course.

2509
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:25,130
But now that I've heard that Eisner said no to Earl, that he spit in his face and,

2510
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:30,230
and that Earl went on to work with the universal geniuses to create

2511
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:32,050
Earl's did you call it Earl's limbo?

2512
01:35:32,110 --> 01:35:33,670
Whatever your phrase was, was perfect.

2513
01:35:34,070 --> 01:35:35,410
Let's call it Earl's limbo.

2514
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:35,770
Yeah.

2515
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:36,070
Yeah.

2516
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:37,730
Or Earl's purgatory.

2517
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:38,850
Is that better?

2518
01:35:38,910 --> 01:35:39,190
No,

2519
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:40,430
heavier bow is better.

2520
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:41,030
All right.

2521
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:46,170
He went on, he crafted Earl's limbo and gave us one of the,

2522
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:47,870
our favorite things in theme park.

2523
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:53,790
In this case, in this episode, in this round, it's Earl takes

2524
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:56,170
Eisner by a knockout punch.

2525
01:35:56,770 --> 01:35:57,070
Yeah.

2526
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:59,610
I hate to say, I hate to admit that, but yeah, that's true.

2527
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:00,290
Yeah.

2528
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:00,690
Yeah.

2529
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:01,650
Hooray.

2530
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:03,110
I did it.

2531
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:07,350
Now to go feed some hungry construction workers.

2532
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:08,770
It would be funny to pit,

2533
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:13,650
just like look at the list of victories and defeats for both man.

2534
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:14,530
Yeah.

2535
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:14,810
Yeah.

2536
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:15,050
Yeah.

2537
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:15,590
Like,

2538
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:15,910
I don't know.

2539
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:20,610
I guess Eisner, I guess ultimately there's the defeat of the entire brand going down.

2540
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:21,490
That's true.

2541
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:25,290
And the defeat of Bucatubepo's food being dog shit.

2542
01:36:25,330 --> 01:36:27,130
There's a recent interview with

2543
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:33,090
Eisner, like in the last couple of weeks, that's, I saw somebody post, um, where he's, I got a football

2544
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:36,030
game or whatever, the one he owns or his owns part of it.

2545
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:37,630
So that gave me a little extra hope

2546
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:41,890
that maybe one day we can sit him down and ask him what he's doing.

2547
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:42,750
Interviews.

2548
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:43,670
If he, if he'll

2549
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:49,190
do an interview to promote the football franchise, that is very lucrative for him.

2550
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:50,290
That's right.

2551
01:36:51,010 --> 01:36:52,450
Maybe there's a chance.

2552
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:54,050
Um, all right.

2553
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:55,310
Well, I guess that's it.

2554
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:56,210
I think we made it and,

2555
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:58,290
oh my gosh, there it is.

2556
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:00,310
The sector stone is appearing.

2557
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:02,450
Uh, I see it.

2558
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:04,730
I, oh my God, it's a,

2559
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:10,150
it's a brick with John Lennon's calcified pee on it.

2560
01:37:10,150 --> 01:37:10,870
Oh, wow.

2561
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:11,650
Wow.

2562
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:12,330
Wow.

2563
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:14,230
Like the, like the splat

2564
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:15,610
hardened and stayed there.

2565
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:19,570
Oh, and is that also Pete Best's calcified pee as well?

2566
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:21,110
Wow.

2567
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:22,050
Original

2568
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:22,710
Beatles drummer.

2569
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:23,790
Wow.

2570
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:24,230
Wow.

2571
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:25,990
Two separate pee pockets.

2572
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:27,710
That makes it a very rare brick.

2573
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:28,170
Very

2574
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:28,450
rare.

2575
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,890
Well, this is one of the finest items in our collection.

2576
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:32,730
We'll have to put it in the VIP

2577
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:35,190
attic where only the vibe hosts can go.

2578
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:38,610
Um, and I guess with that you survived podcast, the ride,

2579
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:43,030
the city walk, Orlando saga, multiverse of madness here on the second gate.

2580
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:43,810
Thanks to Aaron Garner

2581
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:44,250
the art.

2582
01:37:44,530 --> 01:37:49,310
Thanks to our own Mike Carlson and Zach Reno for the totally rock and theme music

2583
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,290
multiverse of madness merchant in the T public store.

2584
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:54,630
Uh, keep it tuned here to the second gate

2585
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:56,850
for the full saga experience.

2586
01:37:57,290 --> 01:37:58,550
Uh, and you know what?

2587
01:37:58,810 --> 01:38:01,070
Tomorrow there's a little extra treat for

2588
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:01,190
it.

2589
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:02,770
We don't even have to go that far.

2590
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:06,070
All you gotta do is step outside the restaurant, go all

2591
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:11,030
the way down the side or walk out the CBGB's room and there's one more little treat.

2592
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:12,090
Thank God it

2593
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:12,870
wasn't in this one.

2594
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:14,590
I would have really crowded it up.

2595
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:17,750
It needs a lot more time, but here's the

2596
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:17,910
catch.

2597
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:23,910
You would also have to take a little walk through the doors of a cool place called club three,

2598
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:26,270
even cooler than CBGB, you might say.

2599
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:27,010
I would say.

2600
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:29,510
So if you want to hear and really to get the full

2601
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:32,030
saga, you're going to want to want to unlock that last sector.

2602
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:33,890
So just not should not shit up to

2603
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:38,550
that level right here on the Patreon and you'll also get all the other ones at club three where

2604
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:43,010
our motto like Hard Rock Cafe is also love all, serve all.

2605
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:45,250
Love all, serve all.

2606
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:45,790
That's right.

2607
01:38:46,150 --> 01:38:47,050
We stole it from them.

2608
01:38:47,050 --> 01:38:47,970
Don't tell them.
