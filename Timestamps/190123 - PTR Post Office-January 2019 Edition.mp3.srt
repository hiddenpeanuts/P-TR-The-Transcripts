1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:25,672
podcast, right? Second gate. Um, this is going to be a mailbag episode.

3
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:28,792
We just started talking about something and I feel like we should record it.

4
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:33,452
Uh, tomorrow we're recording here as Jason Sheridan is here.

5
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:39,012
We're back from the holidays. My name is Mike Carlson. Uh, we're talking about,

6
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:41,692
um, tomorrow is like the last day of the holidays at Disneyland.

7
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:44,872
And it's the first day, all the pet, not all the passes, I think,

8
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:47,232
but most of the passes are unblocked again,

9
00:00:47,232 --> 00:00:51,232
cause there's that two week period between or around Christmas and new years

10
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:54,312
when only the elite, which are passes. We don't even,

11
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:58,712
we don't want to spend that extra $75 to go for those two weeks.

12
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:03,272
You mean the, the does the signature, there's like a 365 kind of, yeah,

13
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:07,732
signature plus I think is the one that has those two weeks. Okay. Uh,

14
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:09,472
and that's everybody. So that's for,

15
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:13,132
there were two weeks there with where annual pass holders only in that elite

16
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:14,112
club could go.

17
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:17,732
But tomorrow is the last day of the holidays and when passes are unblocked

18
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:20,632
again. So it's going to be insane. Yeah. And I'm,

19
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:23,592
I'm going right is what, uh, we figured,

20
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:28,252
I booked a nice little Napa Rose for Aaron and I, uh,

21
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:32,532
and which maybe we just go down and only do that and don't even get on a ride.

22
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:36,552
Uh, but Mike, you were just saying you were trying to get down.

23
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:38,752
I was saying, Lindsay, do you want to go?

24
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:40,872
Cause I kind of want to go on small world holiday,

25
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,292
which I hadn't been on until we went a couple of weeks ago. And I,

26
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,152
I was like, wow, this is great. I haven't been on this.

27
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:47,292
I feel like in a couple of years.

28
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:50,852
We all remarked that it was like, wow, this, this is really good.

29
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:52,492
Yeah. I almost like it. Fuck.

30
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:57,632
Everyone else in the boat was mad at us because we're going fuck me.

31
00:01:57,632 --> 00:02:01,892
Oh my God. The song. All these cute little shit heads.

32
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:05,192
And also, and then we'll do it on a full episode, but I was like,

33
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,912
I was like, oh, this is so great. It goes in and out of small world.

34
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:10,952
And then what jingle bells would, yeah, jingle bells. And I was like,

35
00:02:10,952 --> 00:02:12,692
that's great. If the ride went in and out,

36
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,652
I think people would be less annoyed by the song,

37
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:15,832
which I'm not that annoyed by the song.

38
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:18,872
The in and out of a different song. Yeah. But like a different,

39
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:22,052
my little or something. Camp town races.

40
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:26,092
Skip to my little. My Bonnie lies over the ocean. My Bonnie lies over the sea.

41
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,212
It's a long way to Tipperary though, which plays on main streets.

42
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:32,032
And I love, I love long way to Tipperary.

43
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:37,032
That's a, as kids say now, that's a bop.

44
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:39,552
Oh yeah. I guess. Should they say that's a bop?

45
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,692
Your book ends of, you know, cool phrases,

46
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:47,512
but also are from 1902. Yes. I don't understand how you work.

47
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:51,872
Man, I fucking love all those tragic ass world war one songs.

48
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:53,692
I'll be home for Christmas.

49
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:55,032
When we need a current,

50
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:58,712
the small world dolls need to be singing a current song about like harmony and

51
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:02,132
hope, which of course is fight song. It should be in between.

52
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:05,492
It's a small world and this is my fight song.

53
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:09,812
His fight song will never go on it again. That's it for me.

54
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:12,192
I think it's, yeah, it's a little older. I mean,

55
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:17,312
if we could get that DJ snake song that's only played at city walk in there.

56
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:20,532
And if we could, if they could reprogram, I don't think it'd be that hard,

57
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:25,292
but we get some of the small worlds kids doing the floss dance or any of the

58
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:25,932
fortnight dance.

59
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:30,032
Can the small world dolls dab? Is that in their programming?

60
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:34,932
I mean, they can't as it is, I mean,

61
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:38,652
they could get Rolly Crump to go back in there and design some dolls that could

62
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,692
dab, but.

63
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:42,712
So that tells me he's not, I don't think he's into dabbing.

64
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:47,492
A psychedelic expert is not a dab guy. Yeah. Or maybe he is.

65
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:50,652
Who knows? We'll have him on the show and ask. But I was talking,

66
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,492
I was saying, I tried to get, I was like, Lindsey, we should go last day holiday.

67
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:59,692
And I was just telling Scott and that's when I hit record on the podcast because

68
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:00,112
I was like,

69
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:03,892
it kind of excites me to go on an insane day when I know the park is going to be

70
00:04:03,892 --> 00:04:05,892
a capacity. And I don't know.

71
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,332
Why in the fucking world you're out of your mind? What?

72
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,152
How can you justify that?

73
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:13,492
I'm trying to think how I can justify it there.

74
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:17,432
I think there's some something fun to me about with my checking brain.

75
00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:21,292
I think there's something fun to me about navigating the chaos.

76
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:25,972
I think there's something because I like Comic-Con. I like an insane crowd.

77
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:27,212
It doesn't bother me at all.

78
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:31,532
I've been to Comic-Con with you several times now and I'm like as fast as I can

79
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:35,912
get to something calm off the show floor to your end too. You know,

80
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:39,332
yeah. You, I know you're a fan of sneaking off to Joe's crab shack.

81
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:41,832
On the other side of the convention center,

82
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:46,692
which is oddly not populated for it being the biggest event.

83
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:49,372
We will do a Joe's crap shack episode on this.

84
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:55,052
Joe's crack counts as a themed experience, but you, I don't,

85
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:58,392
I don't get you like I, if I had never went on the floor at Comic-Con again,

86
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:02,012
I'd be a very happy man. I don't, I don't know how you can deal with Comic-Con.

87
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:05,912
I don't know why you would a full capacity. That's,

88
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:09,512
you remember when we went right after labor day and you,

89
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:13,692
we were in the park for a total of 40 minutes on the way to the angels game

90
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:16,952
with Monday. Yeah. So it was insane. Yeah. It was insane.

91
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:18,792
And you still after that,

92
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:22,972
you still are into going at peak capacity.

93
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,412
Yeah. Well I've been, we've talked about this, that,

94
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,732
that Disney day that was 24 hours was the worst day ever.

95
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:32,132
And Disneyland was like closed essentially to new people.

96
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:35,352
And we went to California adventure. And then we just like,

97
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:37,332
I don't know. I think it's fun.

98
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:40,772
I'm trying to analyze myself here because I'm not exactly sure, but like, I like,

99
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:41,312
we like hung,

100
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:44,612
we found a little spot to hang out in when it was just full like California

101
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:48,772
adventure was almost filled to capacity. There is something I like. I don't,

102
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:53,052
oh, it's not that I just like it like this, but there is something fun.

103
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:58,032
Maybe I think it's like a challenge and then I do enjoy sneaking away from the

104
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:01,052
crowd for a while. Maybe there's something psychological about that. Like it's,

105
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:04,112
I'm trying to find my own Joe's crab shack at Disneyland.

106
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:05,992
Where is it going to be the rest of it?

107
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:08,272
The answer is it's here. It's where you live.

108
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:11,952
That's your home or a nice restaurant with no one in it.

109
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:13,832
I do remember going, I went,

110
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:16,392
I met you down there for one of those 24 hour days,

111
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:21,192
but I left LA at like midnight or 1am and like got coffee at

112
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:24,652
7-eleven and like got down there at two or three. And at that point,

113
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:29,052
it had calmed down, but you all seemed shell shocked. Like you all,

114
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:31,072
you were still going, of course.

115
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:31,432
Yeah, of course.

116
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:35,832
You did seem a little bit like you were somewhere else when I looked in your

117
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:36,272
eyes.

118
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:41,492
I've had a mic line in my head for a while and I think now is the time to say it,

119
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:46,152
which is that I think that the only way that you would enjoy a relaxing

120
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:50,512
beach vacation is if there was an app that got you better beach than everyone

121
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:50,852
else.

122
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:55,312
Now. Yeah, that is, I like the idea of that. If I could figure out like,

123
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:58,052
well with this thing, I actually get 3% more shade than,

124
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:02,092
I do that does. Yeah. Now you're not wrong about that.

125
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:03,992
Do you think it's the collective experience?

126
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:09,112
Cause a thing I like and it becomes more and more rare as time goes

127
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:14,732
on is I do like watching like live broadcasts

128
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:19,052
as they're like the Superbowl, like knowing that like, Oh, every,

129
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:22,932
everyone quote unquote is watching this or even though it's a live music,

130
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:26,972
like this is a thing. This is happening live. People are seeing it live.

131
00:07:26,972 --> 00:07:31,452
I do think that is novel in a time when everything is on demand.

132
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:35,152
That's a reason to go to Disneyland when it's crowded.

133
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:37,532
No, I'm just trying, trying to, I'm trying to think of, yeah,

134
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:41,692
psychologically logically part of a mass experience.

135
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:45,132
Yeah. I think what the 24 hour Disney day, especially that's what that was.

136
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,272
Cause I think I like saying I was there when they did that thing.

137
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:51,572
That was like a fun energy and there was,

138
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:56,232
that feels like an event and it feels like a story you can tell. Yeah.

139
00:07:56,232 --> 00:07:58,332
I think there is something. I mean, we were in the,

140
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:00,212
I'm trying to think of the last like concert, the last,

141
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:03,352
Scott and I went to Kanye West a few years ago. Oh yeah.

142
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,992
And it's in the pit down.

143
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,692
It was the one where he has the flying stage over the audience.

144
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:12,312
And that was super exciting though, though very stressful when like it,

145
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:17,192
the flying stage moves and then everybody moves backwards or forwards to try

146
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:20,352
to get in the right position. Yeah. I know I didn't be right under it,

147
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:23,192
but why not be right under it? It's going to happen at some point.

148
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,372
I didn't understand all that ducking and weaving.

149
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:31,972
I thought you would just post up in one spot and just let the stage just observe

150
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:34,592
this. I would think part of that would be like, Oh,

151
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:37,352
sometimes I can see it. Sometimes I can't. Yeah.

152
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:40,272
Like I think it was really weird. Everybody's scrambling to get out of the way,

153
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:43,532
but you're right. Yeah. That was like crowded and sweaty, but super fun.

154
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:47,052
And sometimes it did. Sometimes it can be right. And like that, yeah,

155
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:50,232
that's obviously a very specific, there's, you know,

156
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:53,972
it's two hours long or whatever, but here's my point. Of course,

157
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:55,632
a crowd at your,

158
00:08:55,712 --> 00:08:59,252
you're in a giant crowd for the once a year Comic-Con or for,

159
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:03,232
or for Kanye West or for the Rolling Stones or whatever it is,

160
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:07,232
you're at Disneyland always. No, I know you also want,

161
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:12,492
so now I'm in a Kanye level crowd to get onto big thunder mountain.

162
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,032
I, that's what I don't get.

163
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,852
It's a good question that I don't know. And again,

164
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:17,912
Jason's the only one in therapy,

165
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:21,872
so maybe I won't know the answer until that happens and we really explore it.

166
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:26,132
But I guess I like, yeah, I don't know.

167
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:30,872
I really don't have a good answer other than it seems like a fun challenge for

168
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:34,292
checking. And I like,

169
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:38,712
I like that. I don't know. I do like being in a big sea of humanity. I think,

170
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:42,472
I think I kind of like it. And yeah, I guess I'm used to it.

171
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:45,372
I've been trained on the floors of Comic-Cons my whole life.

172
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:45,912
I like,

173
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:50,612
I like the feeling of being anonymous in a large or like a hotel space,

174
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:55,432
like I like hotel spaces because there's kind of an anonymity sort of there and

175
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:57,712
an expectation of privacy. Yeah.

176
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:00,572
So I guess I don't have the greatest answer for why,

177
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:03,712
but was will Lindsay's response to this pitch? I said, well,

178
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:07,452
it's going to be like a very crowded. I go, we could also go, you know,

179
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:10,712
a few days later and it'll be much less crowded. And she's like, well,

180
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:14,952
let's do that. Makes sense to me. Of course with me, I was like,

181
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:19,092
let's go both. Let's do both. Why not? Well, look, I'm going down there.

182
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:22,272
Sure. Yeah. That's why I'm doing it. I don't think we're going to end up going.

183
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:25,832
I forgot about the, but, and you know what? You, you are correct.

184
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:29,892
I'm finding my little island of with the, with the,

185
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:34,312
with the Napa Rose. That's my, wait, what'd you call it?

186
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:37,912
The, you're talking about the wine specific restaurant?

187
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:45,852
Yes. Yes. Yes. How dare I enjoy some wine with my wife?

188
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:50,472
What a weirdo Scott is. I didn't say that.

189
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:54,272
I didn't say that. You, you really get the, all that came from you.

190
00:10:54,272 --> 00:11:00,092
So it's my, so I'm, uh, I'm going inward on some level.

191
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:04,732
I think it's weird. Well, I don't know. Jason's interest.

192
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:09,292
My mother does. I was over the holidays. Like, Oh, I'm just saying,

193
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:13,592
it's interesting. It's, uh, you know, just interesting.

194
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:16,972
It's like a Trumpy like people are saying, uh, right.

195
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:23,652
Shouldn't be calling your mom Trumpian. No, no. Uh, anyway. Yeah.

196
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:25,412
I'm going to fucking great time. Yeah.

197
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:29,672
It's a wonderful restaurant. I've been there once. Super jealous.

198
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:32,852
Hold on one second. Uh,

199
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:36,472
I'm hoping he's not just going to show up because now he has a, I'm going to cut

200
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:40,932
this up. Okay. Uh, obviously he just wrote running late. Sorry. Overslept.

201
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:43,652
And then I just wrote, Oh, you know, we can, we let's reschedule.

202
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:45,512
We have another one scheduled for in a bit.

203
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,412
So let's just figure out another time, but he hasn't responded.

204
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:50,232
Oh, like is he just going to show up?

205
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:54,212
If he does, we can try to delay Doug. Yeah.

206
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:57,852
So I'm just wanting warning you guys. Okay. That's what's happening.

207
00:11:57,892 --> 00:12:00,752
I'm hoping he just pops in. He's in the shower and they'll go, Oh yes,

208
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:03,772
let's reschedule. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm hoping that's what happens. Okay.

209
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:07,372
And he lives next door and I don't know that.

210
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,332
Yeah. So that's what's going on. Anyway,

211
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:15,372
keep going. Yeah. Right. Um, so we were talking about your,

212
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:18,472
you just said you're, I think we were kind of done on that topic.

213
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:23,032
We were just, there was a good segue there. Okay. Sure. Sure. Um, so Jason,

214
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:26,012
you were saying, uh, your mother does that. Um,

215
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:30,352
you were also telling me like you think it was yesterday, uh,

216
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:33,812
about your gifts for the holidays. We were sort of catching up about everything.

217
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:36,232
I have some things to share about what I got for,

218
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:39,352
for like theme park related gifts, but let's start with you.

219
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:41,552
You were wearing Wolverine socks and I said, Oh,

220
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,152
there was X-Men socks and you pull it up and they were like Wolverine claws.

221
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:48,252
And I was very fascinated because you said something very specific that you told

222
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:52,592
your mother not to buy you that she buys you every year. Oh yeah. Okay.

223
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:57,652
So like we haven't really given a holiday update, like what our holidays were

224
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,632
like. So in addition to the mailbag, this is kind of like, yeah,

225
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:03,692
how I spent my Christmas vacation. Um, I,

226
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:08,872
my wording was something along the lines of, of telling that I told my mom, mom,

227
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:11,252
please no, uh,

228
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:19,192
novelty boxers here because at some point my mom started giving me every year at

229
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:19,592
Christmas,

230
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:25,632
like a Simpsons boxers or Marvel comics box or Star Wars,

231
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:29,692
was there ever Disney turtles? I don't think there was.

232
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:31,352
And I believe this is,

233
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:39,452
this went for about five or six years because I have about five or six pairs.

234
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:43,952
And so she did not.

235
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:47,132
So this year she instead opted for novelty,

236
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:50,692
but like shifted to like novelty,

237
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:55,192
saw like men's, you know, thin, I don't want to say dress socks,

238
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:59,112
but like, um, you know, patterned socks.

239
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:05,332
So yeah, I got a Wolverine pair and I got a Mickey Mouse pair insist,

240
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:10,592
which I had a pair of already, but she insisted they're slippers socks. Now,

241
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:14,512
I have, I didn't know the art to tell her. I don't think there were slippers.

242
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:16,952
I believe they are like knee length,

243
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:21,932
like skate socks like that you would wear if you were wearing shorts and vans

244
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:23,212
and we're skateboarding.

245
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:28,512
But slippers socks were a popular in my family. Uh, when we were younger,

246
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:33,432
they were like thick socks that had like the, the warmth of slippers,

247
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:38,212
but then like rubber grips on the bottom, but they were just like heavy socks.

248
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:42,432
Uh, I have not worn slipper socks for many years.

249
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:47,152
I have never heard the term slippers. I had a feeling this was going to be a thing.

250
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:51,132
Sounds familiar. I can sort of picture what one is.

251
00:14:51,152 --> 00:14:54,212
I picture like the socks you put on that are temporary socks.

252
00:14:54,252 --> 00:14:57,152
If you're trying a shoe on like just like a very,

253
00:14:57,152 --> 00:15:01,252
like imagine wool socks. Imagine like a foot,

254
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:05,112
like fleece lined socks kind of, but with like rubber grips,

255
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:09,052
grip padding on the bed. Oh, yes. Yeah. I see. I know what those,

256
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:10,532
I didn't know that was the term for it.

257
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:12,512
I think we had those when we were very young.

258
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:16,632
Yes. So, but you, you know, with your parents,

259
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:21,632
sometimes you're stuck at an age. Sure. Yeah. You don't get beyond that.

260
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:24,252
An age in the age being your late twenties,

261
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:28,652
early thirties where your mom has been in a long streak of buying you boxers.

262
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:32,852
Yes. Now my dad, a little more on point. My dad,

263
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:37,792
who knows about T public now for us, got me an alien encounter.

264
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:42,352
T-shirt from alien. Very on point. Got my brother a people mover T-shirt,

265
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:45,672
cause my brother always loved the people we were growing up. Very on point.

266
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:50,872
God bless those people just doing blatant copyright infringement on T public.

267
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:52,612
It always makes me laugh.

268
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:57,312
By the way, there's, isn't there, so people are, there's a shirt of the poo,

269
00:15:57,492 --> 00:16:01,292
the girl from our, from our live show,

270
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:03,432
the painting that we got for the crafts.

271
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:08,152
Which is not us. That account is not us. We make no money on a shirt.

272
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:09,832
We don't make money from it.

273
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:13,312
Nor does the actual artist who should be making money from it.

274
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:17,412
That's true. So the actual artists make money from the sale to the,

275
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:20,212
to the us there and therefore the crafts. Very good question. I mean,

276
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:24,332
I think I bought it on an eBay, like art reseller,

277
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:28,712
collectible reseller. So it's possible it was bought from them.

278
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:34,312
It wasn't from an account that was entirely a double mint babes hugging Disney

279
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:39,532
characters in a three percent sexualized manner. No, it was not that.

280
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:43,492
So yeah, I don't know the answer to that. That's too bad. Cause you know,

281
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:48,812
yeah, you get like, you know, King John being, uh,

282
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:58,612
some, some tennis radigan from great mouse detective and a nice young lady.

283
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:02,892
King Louie. Yeah. So kind of a reach around.

284
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:08,372
I wish I do wish it was a full, a full lineup. Yeah, that would be great.

285
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:10,332
I mean, I think we've just called for fan art.

286
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:17,932
You got to be like, that was pretty top tier illustration that babe and poo

287
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:23,092
so it's, um, yeah, somebody's got to really step up the art game. Uh, that looks,

288
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:26,192
like that was like a beautiful, it was like a still from a story book.

289
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:29,892
It was really nice. Yeah, it was great. Yeah. Boy do I wish if we found out there

290
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:33,492
were like 12 of them, what a day that would be. Yeah. Oh my God.

291
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:38,272
It was part of a set or a period. The artists. Yeah.

292
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:41,732
It was a, you know, he had his landscape period and then he had his, uh,

293
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:44,452
Disney characters with sexy babes period.

294
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:46,572
Yeah.

295
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:51,112
Wild cleavage meets, uh, some overachiever characters,

296
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:54,492
some overachiever and the listeners are, is going to do it all.

297
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,412
That is a calendar. We got a calendar now.

298
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:01,632
I only ask for separate drawing one-off drawings of Jason.

299
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:05,652
So we're not asking you to draw 12 different drawings. That's a lot of work,

300
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:09,232
but boy, would I be happy to have the, the cat to see the calendar.

301
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:12,972
Would we love it? Yes. Yeah. Disney babes of 1974,

302
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:15,132
2020 calendar.

303
00:18:16,392 --> 00:18:22,932
So I did have more Christmas treats. Oh, you do. Well, my,

304
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,432
my mom and stepdad got back from Orlando recently.

305
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:28,312
So I got some Orlando stuff and that,

306
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:33,092
that was a similar thing to the, the side. Like my mom gave me a hoodie.

307
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:37,672
I had like an older version of like Mickey on, on the like breast pocket and on

308
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:41,592
the back. And that was, that was good. But then I also, and I have,

309
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:45,732
I will bring this over. I didn't, I couldn't fit it in my suitcase.

310
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:48,492
So they were going to, they were sending, shipping me some stuff back.

311
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:55,172
And it is a small plastic bowl that says Walt Disney world on it and has a

312
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:59,232
bunch of characters on the bottom, including Duffy himself.

313
00:18:59,232 --> 00:19:04,812
Wow. I have no idea what I'm expected to do with the small plastic

314
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:09,992
bowl. I think maybe what I am planning on is it's the perfect size for a couple

315
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:13,032
scoops of ice cream. Don't you?

316
00:19:13,392 --> 00:19:17,132
Odd question. Like what am I expected to do with this? But whatever you want,

317
00:19:17,152 --> 00:19:17,952
it's a bowl.

318
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:22,732
I and I had said like go easy on the chachkies too,

319
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:26,652
cause my mom likes to go at teaking sometimes just every now and then some

320
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:28,592
Disney, Disney McDonald's toys.

321
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:33,732
Just a clutter or a weird Christmas stuff you don't really want sitting around.

322
00:19:33,952 --> 00:19:36,572
But is there a bowl you've ever seen where you weren't like, you know,

323
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:38,392
a couple scoops of ice cream would fit in there?

324
00:19:38,392 --> 00:19:39,612
No. You know what I like?

325
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:44,492
I too a good trick with ice cream portion control is to use coffee mugs.

326
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:48,252
Do you standardize coffee mugs? Cause that can only hold like a couple scoops.

327
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:52,112
How many can you get in there? It's still a five.

328
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:54,772
How tall can you stack the scoops?

329
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:58,272
Well, come on. I don't want to be a practical,

330
00:19:58,272 --> 00:20:02,572
I am a balance in 14 all long ways right outside of a,

331
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:03,332
yeah.

332
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:08,292
The answer is it depends on if you are using a traditional scooper or if you're

333
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:12,952
using one of those slab kind of scooper, you know, those flat guys.

334
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:13,832
Okay.

335
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:17,832
I imagine the bigger the scoop, the like heartier and sturdier it is.

336
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:21,532
And you know, they could get smaller as they go. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

337
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:25,832
There's a number of ways you can do the stack. The Jason stack.

338
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:31,092
I'm so now it's in my head. How you eat ice cream is a giant tower.

339
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:34,392
Jughead eats it like that. I assume.

340
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:40,012
The main way is regularly. Sometimes the answer is daily.

341
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:46,032
If sluggo could afford ice cream, he would eat it like that. Uh, if,

342
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:51,972
he would, he's poor kid. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, does Dagwood, Dagwood eats a big sandwich.

343
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:54,792
Dagwood eats a big sandwich. Who knows if he has room for ice cream.

344
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:58,852
For seven scoops on top. Yeah. And I, here's the thing though,

345
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:02,252
and I'll throw it, throw it back to me. I am the one,

346
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:06,072
I've never seen you do a double scoop cone with sprinkles. That's my thing.

347
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:09,932
So I, I'm actually the scoop man of the two of us.

348
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:13,852
I'm the stacker is what I'm saying. You mean out and about? Yeah. I've never,

349
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:16,092
you probably have gotten a double scoop before.

350
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,532
I think so. I usually just, I,

351
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:23,232
I usually don't necessarily want that much, like whatever these smallest,

352
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:29,212
like we have an ample Hills now in Los Angeles and their kid size is like a

353
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:34,492
good amount on a coat. Like that is enough for me. Uh,

354
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:38,992
ample Hills. I got accidentally got three scoops in a cup once and I was like,

355
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:43,052
this is too much. Oh, I got the flight. I demolished a flight myself.

356
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,312
Six scoops of ice cream. Smaller scoops.

357
00:21:46,512 --> 00:21:51,272
Yeah. I lit up like saucers, which they were just put in a saucer.

358
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:54,092
They should have ample Hills should do the flight, but stack them.

359
00:21:54,092 --> 00:21:57,012
So you have six scoops on top. Like a cartoon. Yeah.

360
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:59,572
And I got to say my too much.

361
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:03,632
So my throat kind of hurt by the edge. It's too much sugar.

362
00:22:03,632 --> 00:22:05,192
Jason Sheridan's sugar throat.

363
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:10,552
The thing that you would get as a child often. So getting sugar throat is a okay,

364
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:15,312
but having a nice wine based dinner with your wife is insane asylum.

365
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:18,232
Territory. No, I just said it was interesting, Scott.

366
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:22,912
There's a lot of implication and interesting sugar throat.

367
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:26,232
There also could have been like a 2003 new metal band.

368
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:31,592
Sugar sugar throat. Just on the bill with like disturbed or

369
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:34,452
like it out. That seems like it makes sense. All right.

370
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:37,292
I'm going to show you what I got for Christmas. My sister got this for me.

371
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:41,652
Oh my God. Oh my God. I guess it's, I'm holding it upside down.

372
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:45,192
I've always wanted one of the, I've literally always wanted one of these.

373
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:49,652
It is a kitchen. It's a tea towel cabaret tea towel.

374
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:52,872
And it has like most of the characters on it.

375
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:59,052
And I think she got it on Etsy. And I'm not, yeah, Jason is jealous.

376
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:03,952
What about it specifically? Yeah. So it's like a, it's like a, it's a,

377
00:23:04,052 --> 00:23:07,712
like sort of a tick tack toe, but with more squares. Right.

378
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:12,252
And it's got all your care, very various characters. I'm looking today.

379
00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:16,232
Does it have, where's Mr. Dairy Goods? Is he not on here?

380
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:21,792
Is he food? Is he food rocks? Yeah. Is he through rock? Yeah.

381
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:22,712
Maybe you're right. He's food rocks.

382
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:27,692
But all of the various members of the, of the kitchen cabaret band and,

383
00:23:27,692 --> 00:23:31,972
or bands are all represented in pretty sharp colors.

384
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:35,492
It's pretty vibrant. You get the couple of them twice, the banana twice.

385
00:23:35,852 --> 00:23:39,872
There's some repeats for sure, but like the broccoli is only on once.

386
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:44,372
And thank God, not those cereal sisters who scare this shit out of me. Yeah.

387
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:47,592
No, that's good that they're not there, but it's a, it's a,

388
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:51,412
this is a very specific present for a very specific man.

389
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:54,772
My sister knocks it out of the park. Also, I don't have it yet.

390
00:23:54,772 --> 00:23:58,672
Cause she was saying there was a shipping problem. She bought me and she made sure,

391
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:01,772
she said it's got tags on it. So she doesn't think it was ever worn.

392
00:24:02,352 --> 00:24:05,832
And a vintage Epcot center hats, cause I'm a hat guy.

393
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:09,972
She knows I'm a hat guy now. So she bought me like a classic.

394
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:11,632
She should get a scare guy to deliver it to you.

395
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:14,172
She knows about the haunts too. She knows about the haunts,

396
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:17,172
but she, so I saw a picture of it and I'll,

397
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:21,212
I'll debut that on the show too whenever I get it.

398
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:25,432
So she knocked it out of the park with park specific gifts for me.

399
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:29,652
That's great. I don't have a lot of, I got that nice Walt Disney's Disneyland,

400
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:31,792
the, the Tashen. Oh yeah. Yeah.

401
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:34,712
Which I haven't really been through a ton, but that's very nice.

402
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:36,132
But I don't think I have,

403
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:41,612
other than that my parents got converted some money to yen for me and Aaron as

404
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,932
we are going to Japan this year. So that's, I guess,

405
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:47,692
Disney related. Yeah. That's where I'll be.

406
00:24:47,692 --> 00:24:51,072
A lot of my money to Iraq, Iraqi denar.

407
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:56,492
I have fallen for the scam that Mr. Trump is going to reinflate

408
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:59,032
and when Disney Iraq opens,

409
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:01,612
when Disney illusion open.

410
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:08,572
So, well that's basically, so our holl, so in summation,

411
00:25:08,992 --> 00:25:11,132
how are our holidays? Jason got a bowl.

412
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:14,432
Jason got a bowl and there's one quick thing. Yeah. You want it.

413
00:25:14,632 --> 00:25:16,072
That I would like to, you've,

414
00:25:16,072 --> 00:25:19,112
you sent me a couple of photos that we'll get to the mail bag right after this.

415
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,952
You sent me a couple of teaser photos.

416
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:26,612
It's something I've been asking for from you for years. Yeah.

417
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:31,192
And it sounds like you will eventually give me my Christmas wish of 2010 or

418
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:31,632
something.

419
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:35,952
The play I was in a 10, Kilroy was here. Yes.

420
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:40,412
I have it in DVD format and MP4 format.

421
00:25:41,132 --> 00:25:45,272
Oh, digital and streaming most of a day.

422
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:48,652
And I, I,

423
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:53,652
I was thought I was going to have to drag like Jerry,

424
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:58,532
you know, rig two VCRs and do it. And then my mom dropped.

425
00:25:58,532 --> 00:25:59,852
She's like, Oh,

426
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:04,632
I bought a VHS to DVD converter years ago.

427
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:10,672
Cause you kept asking about this and I forgot about it. So now it is not one,

428
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:14,372
it was not what I was expecting. It was just a DVD play.

429
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:18,512
It was a, like a VCR DVD combo thing,

430
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:22,152
but the DVD, but you can, they're both writable.

431
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:27,012
So you can write VHS to DVD on it, or you can write DVD to VHS,

432
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:30,012
which is interesting. So,

433
00:26:30,012 --> 00:26:35,592
so hooking that up to a TV and then running it took a while and then

434
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:40,032
duplicating the DVDs and create using disc utility to make a disc image,

435
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:44,772
to burn backup DVDs and then using handbrake to make MPEGs.

436
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:51,432
My god, a complicated conversion process as if restoring a classic,

437
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:56,572
uh, as if restoring a Hitchcock film or something. This is, uh,

438
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,132
incredible archival work.

439
00:26:58,312 --> 00:26:58,732
Yes.

440
00:26:58,732 --> 00:27:04,192
And as I finally received my Indiegogo reward of a digital copy of the other

441
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:09,232
side of the wind, cause I was a backer to that campaign four or five years ago,

442
00:27:09,232 --> 00:27:12,552
it was his last movie, uh, which then of course,

443
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:16,892
Netflix put up the final finishing funds and it's been on Netflix for months

444
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:20,372
where they finally got around to sending out Indiegogo rewards.

445
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,292
So I lost on that one.

446
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:27,492
We have the best digital copy of any media now.

447
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:33,872
Which I have not watched myself. Like I, I put sick cause you had to let it run.

448
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:39,052
You had to let it run real time. Uh, and then, uh,

449
00:27:39,052 --> 00:27:43,552
like the burns were quicker, but I was watching like clips and stuff,

450
00:27:43,552 --> 00:27:48,972
but I was also amazed at like, Oh man, the video production company who set this up.

451
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:56,072
I clearly put one of the microphones by where people are entering and exiting a

452
00:27:56,072 --> 00:28:01,732
plywood part of the stage cause you just hear a thunk thunk with characters walk

453
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:05,592
on stage. Uh, and also did not,

454
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,812
something is off with the lighting of downstage,

455
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:14,192
but still it is a three camera setup for children from middle school production.

456
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:20,172
So we will figure out how we're going to present this. You're a Nazi by the way.

457
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:22,032
I'm a British hypnotist.

458
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:25,792
I have a Nazi spy masquerading as a British hypnotist, USO,

459
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:26,912
entertainer.

460
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:31,872
Do you have it? Did you see any of yourself? Do you have any sense of,

461
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:35,252
is it how watchable is it? How, uh,

462
00:28:35,832 --> 00:28:38,872
recognizably you it is. Yeah, it's me.

463
00:28:39,312 --> 00:28:42,652
It's clearly me. And there's also,

464
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:47,032
I think Mike may have traveled back in time to be there because you can hear

465
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:52,912
people laughing at a 10 year old walking out and committing hard to this.

466
00:28:52,912 --> 00:28:54,212
You're getting laughs before you open your mouth.

467
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:59,252
Yeah. Probably also like it was intoxicating,

468
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:03,472
but also a little scarring of sets of reality.

469
00:29:03,472 --> 00:29:07,172
That time. Yeah. So,

470
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:08,052
I don't know. We'll see.

471
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:11,972
And also like seeing some of the full cat, it's like some of the musical numbers.

472
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:15,712
I'm like, Oh, in my mind, this wasn't so tinny.

473
00:29:15,752 --> 00:29:19,552
It's all wasn't so tinny. I didn't really have to sing solo at all.

474
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:24,892
So I'm not really singing as much only in like group sequence,

475
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,452
group numbers and stuff. So, but no,

476
00:29:27,452 --> 00:29:30,492
I think we should have people over to watch.

477
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:35,072
You mean all the patrons? Is that what you're saying? No. Like our friends.

478
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:38,992
I don't know. I guess we should upload it to the Patriot. I don't,

479
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,492
it's weird that 60 other people are. We'll see.

480
00:29:43,452 --> 00:29:45,052
We'll work on a distribution plan.

481
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:49,172
Clips of me. We have to get this footage and survey it.

482
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:53,992
Like when they found the sound to remaster the sound, if it's a little tinny.

483
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:58,872
Yeah. And is it a cut down or do you present it uncut as it was originally

484
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:03,292
intended? Yeah. Will pioneer drama services get angry?

485
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:10,192
I hope, I hope they come after us. Cause it'll only be good press for us.

486
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:15,232
By a drama turd publishing company. Yeah.

487
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,952
Controversy creates cash. So I have it. And I couldn't,

488
00:30:19,232 --> 00:30:22,132
I don't know that I could have predicted, although you're involved,

489
00:30:22,212 --> 00:30:25,212
since you're involved in Michael, I guess I could have predicted that just show

490
00:30:25,212 --> 00:30:29,412
just slowly became a spalding gray model log about my life.

491
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:34,672
To Cambodia sort of exercise my whole plan the whole time.

492
00:30:34,672 --> 00:30:40,972
And the audience is here for it. I think you'll see the theme park content,

493
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,312
slowly diminished to where you keep, don't even realize it happened.

494
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:48,092
And it's just entirely true conversations with Jason Truman show,

495
00:30:48,152 --> 00:30:55,192
Jason Sheridan with Jason. Yeah. Hey, speaking of the audience, uh, let's,

496
00:30:55,192 --> 00:30:59,152
we got questions pouring in. We asked for questions live. Uh,

497
00:30:59,152 --> 00:31:02,572
I'm going to start out with a real quick one. And then I have some,

498
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:05,892
some emails highlighted, uh,

499
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:10,392
friend of the show, Nick Weiger tweeted out and asked Ken Jason,

500
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,072
finish one of these himself.

501
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:16,072
And what he is talking about is apparently a new option at Walt Disney's magic

502
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:18,552
kingdom. It's called Ralph's family challenge.

503
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:24,252
Did you change his words? Cause he, cause I have, I have a tweet from Liger.

504
00:31:24,472 --> 00:31:27,992
It's by memory. What did he say? Cause Liger did a much more casual. He goes,

505
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:32,952
could Sheridan take this down solo? Okay. Yeah. His is funnier.

506
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:35,212
Nick is funnier than a, uh,

507
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:39,492
well that's not what I'm saying. Hey, no, uh, uh, could I, you know,

508
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:41,272
there's not a description of what all's in it,

509
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:44,752
but it is a trophy filled with ice cream. Uh,

510
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:48,212
Oh, it's got a wreck at Ralph in the middle of it. Yeah. Okay.

511
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:50,412
It says Ralph's family challenge.

512
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:55,572
For a family of three or four or five to take down. Let's, I mean,

513
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:59,252
it's hard to see the scope on exactly how eyeballing it.

514
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:04,132
It kind of looks like about the size of an ample Hills ice cream flight.

515
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:07,832
So I think the answer is yes, but my throat will hurt.

516
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:10,732
Strong risk of sugar throat, sugar throat. I mean,

517
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:13,472
here's a different angle. We'll post these angles. They're, they're,

518
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:16,452
they're clearly it's a, it's got a lot of depth to it. Jason,

519
00:32:16,592 --> 00:32:19,852
here, do you want to take a look here? So I still think you could do it,

520
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:24,312
but I think you're out for the day. I think I'm a, yeah, I think you're right.

521
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:26,872
It's smaller than a kitchen sink. I'll say that.

522
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:31,412
You're only making it to instead of the normal bedtime of 9 PM. It's a,

523
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:34,312
it's a 7 30 PM for you. Whoa, whoa. Take a look at this.

524
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:39,032
Look how tall this one is just poking out of the, it's a, by the way,

525
00:32:39,032 --> 00:32:43,492
it's a big trophy cup and then at least like six scoops atop the cup.

526
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:47,732
I think it's more indication of how many are down within it. And this is,

527
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:52,652
where is this available? Disney cruise? No, well,

528
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:58,092
I think it's in the magic kingdom now too. Okay. So the answer is a, for sure.

529
00:32:58,272 --> 00:33:01,892
Yeah. Yes. So if we discover it's in Disneyland,

530
00:33:02,152 --> 00:33:04,972
then we're going to have to go give it a try. Oh yeah. I don't think it is,

531
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:08,592
but yeah, we should. Yeah. Well, well, there has to be an equivalent to it.

532
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:13,492
And we'll do, that'll be an episode of can Jason put down 12,

533
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,912
12 scoops of ice cream, 10 candy bars.

534
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:20,412
Now I have to do talent challenges in addition to being vulnerable and open

535
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:21,552
about my childhood.

536
00:33:21,552 --> 00:33:25,332
It's all my plan is coming.

537
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:31,492
You got to do jumping jacks, run around the room, then improvise.

538
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:34,812
It's all part of the plan. Like the Joker, right? My God.

539
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:39,912
I am just like the other new bit that new is the Joker. It's landed good.

540
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:44,032
All right. So I have another email here. This one takes,

541
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:46,452
I know what he means. It's got a little bit of context.

542
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:50,772
Wabin Wu writes a big fan of the show and theme parks.

543
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:54,812
I have a problem. I'm not sure if you guys have ever had,

544
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:57,512
I go to Disneyland with my girlfriend every year,

545
00:33:57,652 --> 00:34:00,592
Buzz Lightyear Astro blasters used to be one of our favorite rides,

546
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:05,112
but in recent years I've gotten really good at the game where I score over

547
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:10,552
150,000 points every time. Now the problem is it's ruining the experience for my

548
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:14,612
girlfriend because she's not good at the game and she gets irritated.

549
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,992
Every time we walk off the ride and my score is 10 times hers,

550
00:34:18,412 --> 00:34:21,912
she's starting to not want to go on the ride anymore because of that.

551
00:34:21,952 --> 00:34:25,692
And I just feel really bad that I sort of ruined that for her at this point.

552
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:27,652
If I score lower to get on our level,

553
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:32,412
she would be bad too because she would just know that I do it on purpose.

554
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,552
Toy Story made it is starting to become an issue too, but not nearly as bad.

555
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:41,192
Is that a situation ever an issue for anyone looking forward to hearing back?

556
00:34:41,232 --> 00:34:44,832
And I'm going to start. Yes, I have had this problem before.

557
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:52,492
Yeah, my, my ex and I would always would go on these rides and I would smoke her

558
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:55,432
ass every time. So,

559
00:34:55,432 --> 00:34:58,172
that's why I was so intrigued by this question.

560
00:34:58,212 --> 00:35:01,032
Have you guys ever run into this?

561
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:03,572
I don't want to sound like chauvinistic,

562
00:35:03,572 --> 00:35:06,812
but I do beat Lindsay most of the time on these two rides. She's,

563
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:09,452
she beats me on other things, but on these two specific rides,

564
00:35:09,452 --> 00:35:13,292
I do feel like I win. She's usually like frustrated by it.

565
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:15,212
I don't know if she can hear me talking. She is upstairs.

566
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:18,712
I don't know if she's frustrated. I mean, she's frustrated by it,

567
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:22,012
but I don't know if it's like ruining the rides for her.

568
00:35:22,032 --> 00:35:25,932
So I don't think it's maybe as severe as what this gentleman is describing.

569
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:30,072
But I have to sit in like 15 minutes of stewing. Yeah.

570
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:30,812
And it's not like she's like,

571
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:32,852
I don't want to go on toy story cause you're,

572
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:36,292
you score 50,000 points higher or something like that doesn't happen.

573
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:41,712
But I wonder if I had a follow up questions for this person.

574
00:35:43,332 --> 00:35:46,892
Have you taught her all the secrets? Does she know the secrets?

575
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:50,352
Are you holding the secrets? I don't know. Yeah. Cause like,

576
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:53,172
there's this on Buzz Lightyear famously, there's the famously,

577
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:57,992
there's the secret target in the dark hallway that doesn't lit up and that you

578
00:35:57,992 --> 00:35:59,572
get a ton of points for that.

579
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:02,152
I'm wondering cause I realized there was, there was an addendum to this.

580
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:05,052
And he said he checked the last time he played and he,

581
00:36:05,052 --> 00:36:08,272
his score was closer to 500,000. Okay.

582
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:11,552
This says also bragging by the way, how good he is at these games.

583
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:15,672
This is really kind of a humble brag email that this gentleman is like,

584
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,952
I'm the best at Buzz Lightyear and Toy Story.

585
00:36:19,532 --> 00:36:24,332
But it's couched in the guys of like, this is a promise. What am I going to do?

586
00:36:24,412 --> 00:36:26,052
It's like, by the way, I'm really good at these games.

587
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:30,912
I think we buy, by, you know, after a while of doing this,

588
00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:34,872
it became more fun to see what the discrepancy is.

589
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,012
And I should say when I ride these rides,

590
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:40,312
cause I used to ride these a lot with my brother when my family would go down.

591
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:45,952
My brother is very good at video games or games in games of these type.

592
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:47,892
And he always owned my ass.

593
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:52,132
And so I just got so into like just trying to score points.

594
00:36:52,132 --> 00:36:56,372
But then that, that does kind of occasionally make it a joyless experience

595
00:36:56,372 --> 00:36:59,212
where you're just trying to rack up points and win.

596
00:36:59,912 --> 00:37:03,392
Well, first of all, I will say we just played that, like,

597
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:07,192
I forget what it was called those Jackbox games for and switch over the

598
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:10,892
holidays with my family and Lindsay and my mother both kept smoking all of us

599
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:14,252
at the games. So I'm, she's beats me on plenty of things. Anyway,

600
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:19,472
I would say, especially Midway Mania, Midway Mania,

601
00:37:19,472 --> 00:37:23,612
there's an element and I'm sure we'll get this on the full Midway Mania

602
00:37:23,612 --> 00:37:27,112
episode, but there's like a secret thing in most of the levels.

603
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:31,092
That's very worked together. Oh, so like, if you,

604
00:37:31,172 --> 00:37:36,012
I think I believe it's a few destroy all the lava stream balloons in the lava

605
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:41,052
level. Then all of a sudden stuff shoots out of the, of the volcano.

606
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:43,652
And then there's tons more balloons with tons more points.

607
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:44,712
And that's how you get a very high score.

608
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:47,272
Maybe this gentleman is doing that already,

609
00:37:47,612 --> 00:37:50,752
but I feel like Toy Story Mania, you just say, Hey,

610
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:53,412
we're working together to unlock cause that's every,

611
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:55,812
every world has a little unlocking thing.

612
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:58,532
If you really stress that you're unlocking together,

613
00:37:58,932 --> 00:38:03,032
it doesn't matter what individually points you get. You're doing something together.

614
00:38:03,232 --> 00:38:05,932
You're working together to make everything. Now it's possible.

615
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:07,352
He's already tried this,

616
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:10,912
but I think that that's a fun element now once you've done that right so many

617
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:13,932
times is that you go, Hey, I know if you do all and look it up online,

618
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:14,992
cause I don't remember all of them.

619
00:38:15,052 --> 00:38:18,532
But if you like knock all of the lava away and then another one,

620
00:38:18,572 --> 00:38:22,432
I think it's like if you get all the aliens off of that rocket ship at once,

621
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:23,632
so they keep popping up,

622
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:26,852
but if you can get all six or seven to shoot and then have it to be empty,

623
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,332
then the whole thing opens up and a whole bunch of other stuff comes out.

624
00:38:30,632 --> 00:38:32,112
Really? Yeah. It's very fun.

625
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:34,592
And I didn't know it until years in that that's what was happening.

626
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:35,192
Like,

627
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:41,192
so maybe the thing is to reduce the competition between the two and make it more

628
00:38:41,192 --> 00:38:42,992
us against the world. Yes.

629
00:38:42,992 --> 00:38:45,892
Maybe you're trying to be just to know that you're the,

630
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:49,812
you're like kicking the asses of the other cars. Right. She,

631
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:53,632
she's on your team as she is in your life relationship.

632
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:57,812
And it's time to acknowledge that in how you play. Yep. I think that's perfect.

633
00:38:57,872 --> 00:38:59,772
I think there's a perfect way to describe it. It's really nice.

634
00:38:59,812 --> 00:39:00,072
And you,

635
00:39:00,192 --> 00:39:04,312
and he will always have the pride of knowing that he smoked her as many,

636
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:05,192
many, many times.

637
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:10,052
And he can enjoy that in his own memory. But for the future. Yeah.

638
00:39:10,132 --> 00:39:12,012
That's fine. Wow. Well,

639
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:16,372
we got to give some relationship advice as a long with just remember it's

640
00:39:16,372 --> 00:39:18,572
supposed to be fun, you know,

641
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:23,112
Aaron is better at me than that. Better than me at Midway mania for sure.

642
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,192
What else? I'd like you're not like, um,

643
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:28,132
she doesn't really like that ride and we don't go on it together as much.

644
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:31,372
I'm I'm slightly better than her. It's not like, uh,

645
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:33,852
nothing's crazy. No, no, no. I got you.

646
00:39:33,952 --> 00:39:38,192
Really the big thing that gets you on that ride, the, your, your, the wrist,

647
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:41,332
pain at the end of it. Do you guys feel like adorable?

648
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,872
People have described that's again for the other full episode, but, uh, yeah,

649
00:39:44,892 --> 00:39:46,172
my wrist is killing. It kills me.

650
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:48,132
It feels like you have to carpal tunnel all of a sudden.

651
00:39:48,492 --> 00:39:52,212
And then for like 10 minutes after the last round, oh, it destroys you.

652
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:52,732
Flicking and flicking.

653
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:55,532
There's a way to do it where you're trying to just do your fingers like this,

654
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:58,132
which I know looks a little bit weird when I'm doing, I'm showing you like,

655
00:39:58,392 --> 00:39:59,852
you're supposed to just do it with your fingers,

656
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:03,412
but I find it's hard to keep that up. So I feel like in our private time,

657
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:08,092
we have to practice using just our fingers like this to save our wrists.

658
00:40:08,312 --> 00:40:14,272
How could one practice the motion for midway mania in their private time?

659
00:40:14,272 --> 00:40:17,212
It's a good application in your life.

660
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:21,092
Anyway, we'll say that for the full episode.

661
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:22,832
Yeah, we'll talk about that for the full one.

662
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:27,672
Do you have a, I have a, I have a call. I have a quick one.

663
00:40:27,752 --> 00:40:29,732
Somebody wrote in Tyler Holtz on Twitter wrote,

664
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:34,552
how many days is ideal to spend at Shanghai Disneyland? Obviously one park.

665
00:40:34,872 --> 00:40:37,492
You need two days for that. So that's quick.

666
00:40:37,492 --> 00:40:39,912
We don't have to, no one else has to weigh in two days.

667
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:40,672
Shanghai Disney.

668
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,512
Depends on how much you want to explore the hotels too.

669
00:40:43,572 --> 00:40:45,712
I'm never getting into a day mess again.

670
00:40:48,132 --> 00:40:53,352
Here's one sort of in the same vein as the Buzz Lightyear question.

671
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:57,392
If you were to propose your significant other in Disney world, where would it be?

672
00:40:57,952 --> 00:41:01,192
Disney world. So it's a whole Disney world property.

673
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:02,612
Disney world.

674
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:06,012
Let me say this. This isn't, this isn't Disney world.

675
00:41:06,012 --> 00:41:07,932
I'm going to get off with Molly Lambert.

676
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,712
Do we answer ashes?

677
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:13,072
Yeah, we're talking about where we'd get engaged to the afterlife.

678
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:13,752
Oh, okay.

679
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:14,972
You're getting aged to the ground.

680
00:41:15,032 --> 00:41:17,432
Yeah, you're thinking of death and not marriage.

681
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:20,672
Well, hey, hey, hey.

682
00:41:21,872 --> 00:41:22,872
How much different?

683
00:41:23,072 --> 00:41:25,152
Hey, save it for the dirty table at the cellar.

684
00:41:25,212 --> 00:41:26,092
Am I right, fellas?

685
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:29,532
The last bastion of free speech in America.

686
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:35,532
I wanted to try to figure out how to do it.

687
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:37,892
And I didn't at Disneyland, not Disney.

688
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:40,632
So I guess this is all I'll try to think of a Disney world answer as well.

689
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:45,492
But what I wanted to do was arrange.

690
00:41:45,832 --> 00:41:49,092
When I describe it, you will say, well, this there's no way this could have been arranged.

691
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:52,572
But Captain EO is very special to me and to Erin as well.

692
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:56,972
I thought, what if you could arrange like it's the last showing of the day

693
00:41:56,972 --> 00:42:01,892
and you somehow get some favors in with whatever

694
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:07,852
entity runs the captain of theater, Magic Eye Theater and say, like, I made a little movie.

695
00:42:08,012 --> 00:42:15,552
Oh, we play it in the and then I propose like, is there someone you could ask to do that?

696
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:16,812
And here's what happened.

697
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:19,692
I started thinking about how could you do that?

698
00:42:19,852 --> 00:42:21,412
Hmm. Got distracted.

699
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:27,112
Never actually asked anyone, realized it would be too complicated to do in doing so.

700
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:32,192
Forgot about, oh, I kind of need to propose to Erin in general.

701
00:42:32,532 --> 00:42:37,092
Ended up being way too late on doing that bad move on my part.

702
00:42:37,312 --> 00:42:41,832
Like the like my pursuit of this, which involves nothing other than thinking,

703
00:42:41,832 --> 00:42:44,572
maybe I should see if I can make a little movie.

704
00:42:44,632 --> 00:42:47,752
And I just got like distracted, forgot about it.

705
00:42:47,752 --> 00:42:50,372
Sure. And didn't pull the trigger. That was stupid.

706
00:42:50,492 --> 00:42:52,492
Our engagement ended up being extremely nice.

707
00:42:52,552 --> 00:42:56,172
But I was trying to like how you made a little like

708
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:58,632
you get into the theater in a different movie plays.

709
00:42:58,672 --> 00:42:59,812
How magical would that be?

710
00:42:59,812 --> 00:43:00,332
Yeah, that'd be amazing.

711
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:02,392
How was I ever going to sort that out?

712
00:43:02,492 --> 00:43:05,632
You would have had to go on high up in operations. Right.

713
00:43:05,812 --> 00:43:09,812
I think to ask because you would have need some managerial side because

714
00:43:09,812 --> 00:43:14,032
you know, front of the line cast members could have gotten in real trouble

715
00:43:14,032 --> 00:43:17,332
for playing anything, not just the one thing.

716
00:43:17,432 --> 00:43:18,532
Absolutely. Yeah.

717
00:43:19,072 --> 00:43:24,752
The answer is either like you really are tight with somebody high up or the answer is money.

718
00:43:25,012 --> 00:43:25,952
Yes, I'm sure.

719
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:30,412
Like, yes, there's the ability for them to create a viral video out of it.

720
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:31,612
That's the thing, Aaron.

721
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:34,132
And I want the least is for any thing.

722
00:43:34,452 --> 00:43:36,232
Our engagement to be viral.

723
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:40,032
Look, you're bringing that up.

724
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:43,252
I guess I was thinking now, like because I was at first thinking like practical.

725
00:43:43,652 --> 00:43:45,972
That is a little more impractical to me.

726
00:43:45,972 --> 00:43:50,472
Yeah. But still in the realm of practicality, I would have been a lot of the hustle.

727
00:43:51,052 --> 00:43:54,932
Yeah, tons of work and like something they don't ever do, probably.

728
00:43:55,152 --> 00:43:57,812
That's really different than in front of the castle.

729
00:43:58,232 --> 00:44:02,392
Yeah, right. So now my choice is going to be something that's even more impractical

730
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:03,652
in Disney World.

731
00:44:04,952 --> 00:44:08,232
When swinging Teddy Bear comes down from the ceiling in the country where

732
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:13,952
she's wearing a wedding gown and she has a ring and then the show like stops.

733
00:44:14,012 --> 00:44:17,352
And I guess there's maybe the new like there's a new like maybe a song

734
00:44:17,352 --> 00:44:18,992
playing that I've written or something.

735
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,592
I take the ring from Teddy Bear and then propose.

736
00:44:21,712 --> 00:44:25,412
I think that's the fantastical way I would do it.

737
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,572
You take the ring.

738
00:44:26,892 --> 00:44:29,112
So you get up on the stage and like.

739
00:44:29,272 --> 00:44:30,812
Yes, I get up on the stage.

740
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:34,612
I'm trying to think of the geography from stage to Teddy Bear.

741
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:38,812
How if I could reach and grab something off of her person, I might actually

742
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:41,452
be better to make the exception for you to do this.

743
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:46,572
Yeah. And you'll you're already talking to operations to get her fitted for a

744
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:49,552
wedding dress, also the dress myself.

745
00:44:49,552 --> 00:44:51,732
I'll make the dress for her.

746
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:56,132
And you have to find as soon as Lindsey leaves her, you got to like quickly.

747
00:44:56,932 --> 00:44:57,312
I'm sorry.

748
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,792
I mean, I'll measure her.

749
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:02,992
I think I'll go down there early and measure her and then make the dress.

750
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:05,352
Well, she has Chloe.

751
00:45:05,392 --> 00:45:11,512
You could go talk to you, get the sizes from whoever in 1971 first dressed.

752
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:15,772
Yeah. And I'm sure like Len Testa in those Disney World guides has Teddy Bear's

753
00:45:15,772 --> 00:45:18,712
measurements and one of the old guides, he probably lists all the country bears

754
00:45:18,712 --> 00:45:19,832
height and weight and everything.

755
00:45:19,832 --> 00:45:21,812
Hey, the post office can go two ways.

756
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:26,412
People can send us questions and we can send out questions such as what are the

757
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:29,432
size that what is the dress measurement for?

758
00:45:29,712 --> 00:45:30,592
With Swing and Teddy Bear.

759
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:33,392
Yeah, she's up there on the tree.

760
00:45:33,472 --> 00:45:37,692
Well, you just gave me an idea for one, which is that if we're having robot

761
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:45,152
shows involved in our proposals, I would have the Hall of Presidents begin its

762
00:45:46,312 --> 00:45:50,012
roll call and then and when it gets actually, why don't we get we can get all

763
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:50,712
the way to the end.

764
00:45:50,712 --> 00:45:56,712
We can have George Washington or Trump making a speech and then and then it's

765
00:45:56,712 --> 00:46:00,992
interrupted by so I'm talking about new animation, new voiceover, new robot

766
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,552
programming should be fine.

767
00:46:03,132 --> 00:46:09,432
It's in a it's all interrupted by James Buchanan, our bachelor president, who

768
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:13,232
sure who interrupts the speech and says, wait, I'm sorry.

769
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:20,032
I when my name passed, I thought about my life and my regrets and my biggest

770
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:23,832
regret was never locking down my truest love.

771
00:46:24,252 --> 00:46:27,992
And there's someone in the audience who would have the same regrets, worry to

772
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:29,332
let this moment pass.

773
00:46:29,352 --> 00:46:35,092
And then the floor is seated to me and then the and then I propose.

774
00:46:35,312 --> 00:46:36,872
She says, yes, obviously.

775
00:46:37,352 --> 00:46:39,552
And after that, you're going to say no, would you say no?

776
00:46:39,552 --> 00:46:44,212
And then God bless America plays the most dramatic song.

777
00:46:44,732 --> 00:46:46,092
Your guys is song.

778
00:46:46,372 --> 00:46:47,032
Yes.

779
00:46:47,932 --> 00:46:54,912
Jason, I spent a number of minutes sitting here trying to figure out the most

780
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:59,692
beautifully landscapes and just in the last 30 seconds, a bit like, oh no, we're

781
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:00,592
doing robot bits.

782
00:47:00,892 --> 00:47:01,012
Fuck.

783
00:47:01,612 --> 00:47:03,172
I don't know.

784
00:47:03,352 --> 00:47:08,292
I had always pictured like I would think you.

785
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:14,052
Apple Hills, Apple Hills next to the bottom of a family side, the family

786
00:47:14,052 --> 00:47:15,172
challenge ice cream.

787
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:16,472
Now see, they're Jason.

788
00:47:16,772 --> 00:47:21,372
I scream flights are more like, like it's a, it's a dish made for the flights.

789
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:24,392
Like now, Ample Hills out here in Los Feliz.

790
00:47:24,432 --> 00:47:29,892
Uh, it's just like one of those paper, the little paper trays that fries come in

791
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:31,892
now, six scoops in that anyway.

792
00:47:32,092 --> 00:47:33,172
So yeah, that could be fun.

793
00:47:33,432 --> 00:47:34,972
Um, I was dry.

794
00:47:34,972 --> 00:47:39,132
I would probably say on the grounds of one of the hotels down there are so nicely

795
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:41,812
manicured and have a lot of pathways and some things.

796
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:48,572
So, so maybe like a wilderness lodge or animal kingdom lodge, or I mean, I like

797
00:47:48,572 --> 00:47:52,332
the border, the boardwalk has a lot of cool little rooms and stuff, but I would

798
00:47:52,332 --> 00:47:55,252
want somewhere without an audience somewhere, a little private.

799
00:47:55,492 --> 00:48:00,552
I mean, Mike, you mentioned earlier on crowded days, finding little quiet areas.

800
00:48:00,552 --> 00:48:03,032
And I do think that is a big peel.

801
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,372
Uh, the thing I like a lot of the parks.

802
00:48:05,392 --> 00:48:07,812
So probably something along those lines.

803
00:48:07,892 --> 00:48:09,232
Oh, you know what, maybe a legitimate answer.

804
00:48:09,252 --> 00:48:12,192
If you could get, if you, if you could call and arrange like the nicest table

805
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:17,872
possible for fireworks at the top of the war, the contemporary California grill.

806
00:48:18,192 --> 00:48:22,372
And then you could maybe share like a champagne toast, but that'd be pretty

807
00:48:22,372 --> 00:48:28,032
fucking weird, don't you think it'd be pretty psycho to have champagne

808
00:48:28,032 --> 00:48:29,672
in a moment like that.

809
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:30,852
All right.

810
00:48:32,592 --> 00:48:33,732
Um, let's do that.

811
00:48:33,832 --> 00:48:37,232
See that is still a rest or I think restaurants that that is a bit of an

812
00:48:37,232 --> 00:48:41,892
audience, so that's, that's a little, yeah, potentially, but if you, I mean,

813
00:48:41,972 --> 00:48:47,092
maybe you get the clap for the clapping after, but if you, if you do the actual

814
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:52,812
thing quietly or if there's private like Carthay has those private rooms that

815
00:48:52,812 --> 00:48:56,572
like are not, I think you can just request them if you have enough people to fit in

816
00:48:56,572 --> 00:48:56,912
them.

817
00:48:56,912 --> 00:48:57,532
Yeah, sure.

818
00:48:57,552 --> 00:48:57,932
Oh yeah.

819
00:48:58,092 --> 00:48:58,552
Yeah.

820
00:48:59,052 --> 00:48:59,432
Yeah.

821
00:48:59,232 --> 00:49:00,972
Let's do a couple of quick ones.

822
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:01,292
Sure.

823
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:05,172
Do you guys enjoy, this is from Twitter user Desi chainsaw fingers.

824
00:49:05,532 --> 00:49:08,552
Uh, do you and you guys enjoy Roger Abbott's cartoon spin?

825
00:49:08,992 --> 00:49:09,592
Yes.

826
00:49:10,432 --> 00:49:12,392
Uh, I don't really, I don't really do it ever.

827
00:49:12,512 --> 00:49:13,632
You, but do you enjoy it?

828
00:49:13,632 --> 00:49:14,252
Yeah.

829
00:49:14,372 --> 00:49:14,752
Yeah.

830
00:49:14,892 --> 00:49:16,292
But I don't, I don't do it as much.

831
00:49:16,432 --> 00:49:16,932
I agree.

832
00:49:16,932 --> 00:49:18,352
I don't do as much as a lot of other rides.

833
00:49:18,352 --> 00:49:22,272
Terrible line, but that's, that's even with fast pass at the line is a bummer.

834
00:49:22,352 --> 00:49:23,072
Claustrophobic.

835
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:24,132
I forget it's back there.

836
00:49:24,132 --> 00:49:29,032
I really do enjoy it when I ride it and I think it's a good level of theming.

837
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:34,092
And it's crazy to think that that as big as that movie was, we, we almost like

838
00:49:34,092 --> 00:49:36,252
forget that that ride is there.

839
00:49:36,252 --> 00:49:36,912
Yeah.

840
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:38,892
Uh, grossest thing you've ever seen it at Disney park.

841
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:40,212
This is from Daniel J Morris.

842
00:49:40,472 --> 00:49:43,752
Uh, just some bad bathroom, a gross bathroom.

843
00:49:44,012 --> 00:49:44,212
Yeah.

844
00:49:44,212 --> 00:49:48,712
Somebody else asked if we had any memorable, disgusting bathroom instances.

845
00:49:49,332 --> 00:49:51,352
I can't, nothing sticks out in particular.

846
00:49:51,352 --> 00:49:54,272
I think just like the high traffic ones.

847
00:49:55,272 --> 00:49:56,812
Um, I, this isn't gross.

848
00:49:56,912 --> 00:50:00,812
I guess this is more haunting, but, uh, Lindsay and I were leaving Disney and we

849
00:50:00,812 --> 00:50:02,812
was very late in the whole parking garage.

850
00:50:02,932 --> 00:50:06,212
There's only a couple of cars left in the middle of an empty parking garage,

851
00:50:06,352 --> 00:50:07,912
just an abandoned stroller.

852
00:50:08,152 --> 00:50:11,412
We were like, Oh, that's what's known as evidence.

853
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:15,592
Let's see here.

854
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:18,492
Uh, somebody asks, is it weird to go to Disneyland alone?

855
00:50:18,512 --> 00:50:19,372
This is Nathan Torres.

856
00:50:19,532 --> 00:50:24,872
Uh, does it just need some getting used to, uh, is it weird for the world?

857
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:25,432
Yes.

858
00:50:25,652 --> 00:50:28,312
But for me, no, I it's fun.

859
00:50:28,652 --> 00:50:34,052
Yeah, no, I don't think I, I for a long time hadn't gone alone just cause it's

860
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:38,252
such sometimes a burden to get down to Anaheim from Los Angeles proper.

861
00:50:38,392 --> 00:50:40,292
But, um, it is fun.

862
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,832
I mean, you can really follow your own flights of fancy.

863
00:50:43,732 --> 00:50:48,312
You can just do whatever you want because no one else is like, you don't

864
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:50,172
take anyone else's feelings into account.

865
00:50:50,512 --> 00:50:53,072
And D and decent place to just to go, go think.

866
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:56,852
And like, if you're going to go, Hey, take a walk and sort some stuff out in your

867
00:50:56,852 --> 00:50:58,692
head, why not do it at Disneyland?

868
00:50:58,692 --> 00:50:59,312
Sure.

869
00:50:59,392 --> 00:50:59,512
Yeah.

870
00:50:59,512 --> 00:51:00,192
Or get some work.

871
00:51:00,412 --> 00:51:03,712
I, the hotel, the public wifi is really good.

872
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:10,192
And park wifi is a little iffy, but the, um, it's, you know, if you work freelance

873
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:14,612
or whatever, like I know plenty of people who go down there to write stuff.

874
00:51:15,432 --> 00:51:20,772
Um, uh, van, our former, uh, former guest pot friend of the pod, uh, asks top

875
00:51:20,772 --> 00:51:22,092
three snacks in Disneyland.

876
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,492
I don't know if I have three.

877
00:51:23,632 --> 00:51:25,152
I just let's give her a favorite snack.

878
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:30,932
Maybe I'll say double scoop Gibson girl ice cream cone with cone that has

879
00:51:30,932 --> 00:51:34,412
sprinkles on it is always my favorite like treat to get at Disneyland.

880
00:51:34,652 --> 00:51:36,992
I'm not too creative here.

881
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:38,872
I do just like the basic carts.

882
00:51:38,912 --> 00:51:42,412
I like a churro and I like a Mickey bar.

883
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:46,932
Uh, and my dad was so fond of those Mickey bars and built them up before we went

884
00:51:46,932 --> 00:51:50,552
every time we can't wait to get one of those Mickey bars and I follow in his

885
00:51:50,552 --> 00:51:52,412
footstep is it the greatest ice cream in the world?

886
00:51:52,512 --> 00:51:56,472
Not necessarily, but I have like a lot of fondness for it and for that, whatever

887
00:51:56,472 --> 00:51:59,172
that shape that fake shell chocolate is.

888
00:51:59,512 --> 00:52:00,312
And yeah, I do.

889
00:52:00,312 --> 00:52:01,092
I do love the Mickey bars.

890
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:02,032
I like that too.

891
00:52:02,032 --> 00:52:06,192
Uh, my, I, my flavors are generally cookie dough and rainbow sherbet.

892
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:07,812
Interesting.

893
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:09,252
Hmm.

894
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:11,012
Jason's got so much to consider.

895
00:52:11,152 --> 00:52:13,732
Uh, I'm just trying to figure out how to do it.

896
00:52:13,732 --> 00:52:17,752
Um, number one, I'm going to say the, uh, I don't know what they're calling it right

897
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:17,932
now.

898
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:21,192
It's available at most of the, uh, candy counters and stuff.

899
00:52:21,192 --> 00:52:22,472
You can get it back in poo corner.

900
00:52:22,632 --> 00:52:27,032
I saw some, one of our listeners had posted about it recently and it's the

901
00:52:27,032 --> 00:52:33,192
peanut butter ice cream sandwich, but it's like a graham cracker, a thick layer

902
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:37,412
of peanut butter and it's all covered in chocolate and it's like a massive Hershey's

903
00:52:37,412 --> 00:52:39,872
peanut butter smore kind of thing.

904
00:52:39,872 --> 00:52:40,292
That's good.

905
00:52:40,292 --> 00:52:41,152
That's really good.

906
00:52:41,452 --> 00:52:48,912
It's, it's, it's easy to share, um, uh, cause it's a lot, but it's very satisfying

907
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:50,932
and not too expensive.

908
00:52:51,192 --> 00:52:56,852
Uh, I put that at number one, uh, number two, I would say this is kind of general,

909
00:52:56,852 --> 00:53:02,432
but, uh, any Sunday, like each Sunday varies by quality, but I think of a

910
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:06,472
Sunday as an event, like ice cream, I scoops of ice cream, a little utilitarian.

911
00:53:06,472 --> 00:53:10,172
Clearly I eat that plenty at home, but a Sunday is a real treat.

912
00:53:10,712 --> 00:53:16,292
So like daily event, but like, you know, I had that, so that Christmas Sunday

913
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:20,912
when we went down that I raced to get the jeer deli Sundays are very good.

914
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:22,652
Oh, I just did one of those the first day.

915
00:53:22,652 --> 00:53:23,672
Yeah, that was, that's fantastic.

916
00:53:23,672 --> 00:53:24,272
Really good.

917
00:53:24,272 --> 00:53:24,752
Those are good.

918
00:53:24,752 --> 00:53:26,372
Uh, good quality stuff.

919
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:30,312
And then number three, I would say, um, and I'll have this as a meal

920
00:53:30,312 --> 00:53:33,352
sometimes the hot link corn dog at corn dog castle.

921
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:38,972
Uh, I really like it's, it takes the elevates the corn dog cause it does

922
00:53:38,972 --> 00:53:40,892
have a nice spice to it.

923
00:53:40,892 --> 00:53:46,652
Um, I wish they had it at the corn dog cart, uh, but I will accept that.

924
00:53:47,052 --> 00:53:48,612
And the different, yeah, different corn.

925
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:52,112
You can just get the regular corn dogs, but if you don't want the chips or

926
00:53:52,112 --> 00:53:55,772
apple slices, just get the corn dogs, all the carts, a little less money.

927
00:53:55,772 --> 00:53:58,612
Well, that was quick.

928
00:53:59,612 --> 00:53:59,712
Yeah.

929
00:53:59,712 --> 00:54:01,892
The moment you've been waiting for your own life.

930
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:03,312
This is my shallow.

931
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:04,892
This is my star is bored.

932
00:54:04,892 --> 00:54:07,792
Owned it.

933
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:09,572
You got your moment and you owned it.

934
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:12,232
Um, here's an email to podcast thread at gmail.com.

935
00:54:12,412 --> 00:54:17,632
This is from Francesca's jumpsuits are in and they're 25% off.

936
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:22,932
Uh, so apparently according to Francesca, she's got 30% off Bogo and 25% off

937
00:54:22,932 --> 00:54:26,192
dresses seems like rompers, a pretty good deal as well.

938
00:54:26,232 --> 00:54:27,612
You had to really search for that one.

939
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:29,532
Cause I remember archiving that this morning.

940
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:32,652
Cause I think it was the first thing I saw when I opened my eyes.

941
00:54:33,232 --> 00:54:34,632
This was the notification.

942
00:54:35,312 --> 00:54:37,092
We now get Francesca's emails every day.

943
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:41,472
And Francesca's is one is just a boring store at city walk where I bought

944
00:54:41,472 --> 00:54:44,852
Carly Rydgipson pun shot glass.

945
00:54:45,232 --> 00:54:49,012
Uh, so we get those emails forever, but we're nobody, nobody's shutting them off.

946
00:54:49,072 --> 00:54:49,952
I notice.

947
00:54:50,572 --> 00:54:51,452
No, I know we could.

948
00:54:51,632 --> 00:54:52,392
I think it's very funny.

949
00:54:52,532 --> 00:54:54,032
I think it's very funny to get them.

950
00:54:54,092 --> 00:54:55,612
Let's all go get some rompers.

951
00:54:55,812 --> 00:54:57,932
Let's just shut up and do it.

952
00:54:58,172 --> 00:55:02,192
There was very brief period where they were trying to make romp him as a thing.

953
00:55:02,192 --> 00:55:09,572
I guess rompers is kind of a bit of a without an H it'd have to be romp.

954
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:13,012
Um, someone asked where they should, they're going to Disneyland and they want

955
00:55:13,012 --> 00:55:14,892
to take a photo with their podcast, right?

956
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:16,172
Shirt in the park.

957
00:55:16,172 --> 00:55:19,032
And they're asking where we would like them to take that photo.

958
00:55:19,132 --> 00:55:19,832
Hmm.

959
00:55:19,832 --> 00:55:22,012
Uh, this is user Tim at shut up, Tim.

960
00:55:22,372 --> 00:55:23,672
So what do you guys think?

961
00:55:23,692 --> 00:55:26,912
What's the best place to take a photo with?

962
00:55:27,972 --> 00:55:30,232
Or what's something that we want?

963
00:55:30,272 --> 00:55:30,892
I don't know.

964
00:55:31,012 --> 00:55:32,492
I mean, I, we can go a lot of different angles.

965
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:35,912
I don't like if it's just scenic, I think it's always the, uh, from the war,

966
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,132
like the wharf, right to the car's land.

967
00:55:38,272 --> 00:55:39,972
That's always like one of my favorite photo ops.

968
00:55:40,552 --> 00:55:43,472
I mean, it's nice that people do this at all.

969
00:55:43,652 --> 00:55:44,912
We love seeing these pictures.

970
00:55:45,152 --> 00:55:50,352
So anywhere in the parks, uh, recently, some people, poor people had, I survived

971
00:55:50,352 --> 00:55:54,592
the city walk saga t-shirts that they took a picture in, but in downtown

972
00:55:54,972 --> 00:55:58,412
Disneyland Orlando, and that just delighted me so much.

973
00:55:59,692 --> 00:56:04,432
Um, maybe it's, uh, what are we all fond of?

974
00:56:04,432 --> 00:56:05,032
Yeah.

975
00:56:05,372 --> 00:56:10,392
I specifically, I was, my first thought was like you and can you take a photo

976
00:56:10,392 --> 00:56:13,112
with Rosita at the new tropical hideaway?

977
00:56:13,972 --> 00:56:15,012
How many people are we talking?

978
00:56:15,512 --> 00:56:19,292
One person that you mean wants to, I think it's just one gentleman with a shirt.

979
00:56:19,512 --> 00:56:19,812
I don't know.

980
00:56:19,812 --> 00:56:23,392
I'm not sure he doesn't specify if the whole party has a, okay.

981
00:56:23,552 --> 00:56:24,392
I'll say this.

982
00:56:24,472 --> 00:56:30,852
If you see any obscure characters walking around, that's always, I mean, it's just

983
00:56:30,852 --> 00:56:35,272
fun to get pictures with like, we have a picture with the full cast of Robin Hood.

984
00:56:35,552 --> 00:56:35,692
Yeah.

985
00:56:35,752 --> 00:56:38,112
Well that was like a limited time thing.

986
00:56:39,012 --> 00:56:39,972
Uh, any of you, you know what?

987
00:56:40,072 --> 00:56:42,052
Do you pick your favorite fake rock?

988
00:56:42,912 --> 00:56:45,092
Oh, take a photo in front of it.

989
00:56:45,352 --> 00:56:48,392
We don't, we don't want to tell you what fake rock to take, but you

990
00:56:48,392 --> 00:56:51,112
choose you think, think hard about it though.

991
00:56:51,112 --> 00:56:54,532
So go through the park all day and go, what is my favorite of all these fake rocks?

992
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:56,692
And take a photo with that in the background.

993
00:56:56,972 --> 00:57:00,532
And it could be, yeah, it could be touching it if it's touchable or it could just be

994
00:57:00,532 --> 00:57:04,032
pointing at it way in the background, but yeah, yeah, customize it.

995
00:57:04,152 --> 00:57:05,092
Customize it to you.

996
00:57:05,112 --> 00:57:05,412
Yeah.

997
00:57:05,412 --> 00:57:07,352
So it's a little bit of you, a little bit of us.

998
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:11,812
Thank you for even considering taking the photo with that shirt on.

999
00:57:12,652 --> 00:57:15,532
Um, uh, I got a couple more here.

1000
00:57:15,872 --> 00:57:19,132
Uh, someone asks, what is each of your favorite secret piece of magic

1001
00:57:19,132 --> 00:57:20,452
in the Disneyland parks?

1002
00:57:20,612 --> 00:57:21,092
Hmm.

1003
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:23,992
Uh, that's a good question.

1004
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:28,872
Um, I feel like Carthage still feels like a little bit of a secret to me, even

1005
00:57:28,872 --> 00:57:32,692
though it's not everyone knows about it, but it's still like the line at Carthage

1006
00:57:32,692 --> 00:57:35,952
is always still fairly short for just the lounge, not for the restaurant itself.

1007
00:57:36,392 --> 00:57:41,412
So like, I always still kind of feel like we're in the like couple percentage

1008
00:57:41,412 --> 00:57:43,592
of people that go there regularly.

1009
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:45,632
So, and it's small enough, it's very intimate.

1010
00:57:45,952 --> 00:57:49,932
So it always kind of feels like our little special place in a way.

1011
00:57:50,052 --> 00:57:50,292
Yeah.

1012
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:50,732
Yeah.

1013
00:57:50,732 --> 00:57:57,612
Well, everybody get off my ass, but the Napa wine zone, uh, I'm sorry for

1014
00:57:57,612 --> 00:58:02,472
being the way that I am, but I, but like even more so than, than Carthage,

1015
00:58:02,592 --> 00:58:04,192
like people are not up there.

1016
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:04,392
Yes.

1017
00:58:04,472 --> 00:58:09,172
That's second level, uh, where you can have a glass or a flight or

1018
00:58:09,172 --> 00:58:10,472
where it is really nice.

1019
00:58:10,812 --> 00:58:11,332
Like, yeah.

1020
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:16,812
And you don't, you, you can like have views where you see, uh, the

1021
00:58:16,812 --> 00:58:20,172
guardians or cars land in the background a little, but if you want to just

1022
00:58:20,592 --> 00:58:24,212
like shut off and it's a little like pastoral and you forget you're in

1023
00:58:24,212 --> 00:58:25,372
the park for a little bit.

1024
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:25,972
Yes.

1025
00:58:26,032 --> 00:58:27,292
That is, that is.

1026
00:58:27,532 --> 00:58:30,572
And I like that nobody, it's not a big old line to get up there.

1027
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,192
Like there is for, uh, um, the lamp lighter.

1028
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:35,092
Yeah, right.

1029
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:36,052
That's a huge line.

1030
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:36,472
Generally.

1031
00:58:36,792 --> 00:58:37,552
No, that's crazy to me.

1032
00:58:37,732 --> 00:58:42,992
And Carthage is pretty manageable that line usually, but it is when like

1033
00:58:42,992 --> 00:58:49,312
Chili's has figured out the system for like, okay, we'll text you to come back.

1034
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:51,472
Disney hasn't adopted that yet.

1035
00:58:51,472 --> 00:58:53,612
Lamp lighter maybe doing that now.

1036
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:54,892
A little, I don't know.

1037
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:55,652
Yes.

1038
00:58:55,712 --> 00:58:59,052
There's, I don't, I forget if there's texts or not, but they might have some

1039
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:01,992
sort of system of coming back, but I think it was last time I was there.

1040
00:59:01,992 --> 00:59:03,052
It was a bit confusing.

1041
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:07,552
Um, when I went to that a couple of months ago, when I went to that, that

1042
00:59:07,552 --> 00:59:11,112
wine terrace, um, I, I did think it was a little confused.

1043
00:59:11,212 --> 00:59:14,092
I think it was because it was an hour before it closed or so.

1044
00:59:14,112 --> 00:59:17,972
So they didn't really have anyone stationed outside and it was a little

1045
00:59:18,452 --> 00:59:20,952
confusing in that sense, or maybe they were understaffed.

1046
00:59:20,952 --> 00:59:24,192
I remember when I've tried to go in the past and maybe this was before.

1047
00:59:24,592 --> 00:59:26,952
Like all the newer DCA stuff opened.

1048
00:59:26,972 --> 00:59:28,512
It was just so packed up there.

1049
00:59:28,512 --> 00:59:30,452
They're like, come back later.

1050
00:59:30,752 --> 00:59:34,332
But I think recently it's hasn't been that crowded.

1051
00:59:34,432 --> 00:59:35,092
Okay.

1052
00:59:36,292 --> 00:59:36,612
Yeah.

1053
00:59:36,812 --> 00:59:37,952
Um, what have we got something?

1054
00:59:38,172 --> 00:59:41,192
I mean, there's, we, we got a lot of emails that we didn't, we have, we

1055
00:59:41,192 --> 00:59:44,932
didn't actually like go through them, uh, before we just put out the, the, the

1056
00:59:45,032 --> 00:59:46,812
request and we just are doing it.

1057
00:59:46,832 --> 00:59:47,292
Uh, we'll fuck it.

1058
00:59:47,332 --> 00:59:51,512
We'll do it live, uh, to quote Bill O'Reilly, but the, um, you know, if

1059
00:59:51,512 --> 00:59:53,612
you asked a question, we'll, we'll get around to it.

1060
00:59:53,652 --> 00:59:55,552
Some of these are like, are like complicated.

1061
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,832
We want to take a little more time with them.

1062
00:59:56,852 --> 00:59:57,932
I'll throw this one out though.

1063
00:59:57,932 --> 01:00:01,452
Uh, it's been Murphy, uh, dear Jason, Scott and Michael.

1064
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:04,952
I know it's been a few months, but the people must know what are y'all's

1065
01:00:04,952 --> 01:00:07,892
thoughts on flows V eight cafe changing their menu.

1066
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:14,172
If you ask me losing the Turkey dip is beyond, beyond all caps egregious.

1067
01:00:14,172 --> 01:00:14,572
Yeah.

1068
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:15,352
Ben Murphy.

1069
01:00:15,472 --> 01:00:16,232
That's a great point.

1070
01:00:16,252 --> 01:00:20,612
Cause this is like the fourth or fifth generation of flows menus.

1071
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:25,532
I mean, I liked it when it was, when it first opened, it was like, pick your

1072
01:00:25,532 --> 01:00:30,092
protein and your sides that it was like, you know, home cooking sort of thing.

1073
01:00:30,092 --> 01:00:35,112
And then they kind of adapted those into sandwiches, which they used to have the,

1074
01:00:35,112 --> 01:00:36,172
the roast beef sand.

1075
01:00:36,252 --> 01:00:40,052
They, there used to be this roast beef sandwich that was covered in like a

1076
01:00:40,052 --> 01:00:44,112
white cheddar cheat, like a real cheese sauce and like caramelized onions.

1077
01:00:44,152 --> 01:00:47,932
And for the longest time it was at the Fiddler, Pfeiffer and practical on

1078
01:00:47,932 --> 01:00:52,012
mainstream, and then they just stopped serving hot food there, but they came

1079
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:55,272
back at flows and I was very excited and it was still good.

1080
01:00:55,592 --> 01:00:58,372
Sometimes it would have it at, um, Jolly holiday too.

1081
01:00:58,412 --> 01:01:03,992
And then it kind of faded away, but, um, flows now is kind of a bummer for lunch

1082
01:01:03,992 --> 01:01:04,692
and dinner.

1083
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:05,632
Yeah.

1084
01:01:05,852 --> 01:01:07,632
I can't disagree with that.

1085
01:01:07,632 --> 01:01:11,952
Uh, I had, we, we had a little breakfast there not long ago, which was pretty

1086
01:01:11,952 --> 01:01:15,652
good, but I didn't have any context for if that has changed or I don't know if

1087
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:20,772
that's changed, but what a, like a month prior we had a dinner ish meal there.

1088
01:01:21,212 --> 01:01:25,712
And I think I got like a tuna sandwich, which I'm a big tuna fan, but it was

1089
01:01:25,712 --> 01:01:30,632
very lackluster, lacked the personality of the meals, the meals used to have a

1090
01:01:30,632 --> 01:01:32,052
real personality to them.

1091
01:01:32,232 --> 01:01:37,092
Um, and it's gone and it's a bummer cause it's, it was fun to get, uh, like

1092
01:01:38,052 --> 01:01:38,452
Thanksgiving meal.

1093
01:01:39,012 --> 01:01:42,032
So like, like a bunch of whatever turkey or something.

1094
01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:42,372
I don't know.

1095
01:01:42,472 --> 01:01:46,032
I did a very, it was just a very specific menu and now it's very generic and the

1096
01:01:46,032 --> 01:01:47,792
food I had wasn't even that good.

1097
01:01:47,952 --> 01:01:50,352
It wasn't bad, but yeah, it's a bummer.

1098
01:01:50,992 --> 01:01:55,292
We should probably wrap up, but it's, I just saw this one and I, it's hard to

1099
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:55,712
resist.

1100
01:01:56,112 --> 01:02:02,052
I think you have to, uh, John Rhodes asks what theme park animatronic would you

1101
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,812
most like to have as your significant other?

1102
01:02:05,172 --> 01:02:09,752
If you currently have a significant other, they will leave you in this scenario.

1103
01:02:09,772 --> 01:02:12,132
So don't consider them in your analysis.

1104
01:02:12,132 --> 01:02:12,792
Fair enough.

1105
01:02:13,032 --> 01:02:14,432
Keep up the good work, Johnny.

1106
01:02:15,192 --> 01:02:17,132
Uh, yeah, he's right about that.

1107
01:02:17,132 --> 01:02:21,412
So there's no way you present, uh, uh, there's no way you make a, you know, I

1108
01:02:21,412 --> 01:02:25,572
was thinking we could bring a third in to our relationship and that third could

1109
01:02:25,572 --> 01:02:26,272
be a robot.

1110
01:02:26,432 --> 01:02:30,512
There will be some clicking noises, but I'm sure it'll just be white noise at a

1111
01:02:30,512 --> 01:02:31,032
certain point.

1112
01:02:31,032 --> 01:02:32,272
It was just made in the background.

1113
01:02:32,272 --> 01:02:33,932
Get used to it.

1114
01:02:34,092 --> 01:02:38,972
Um, so I mean, there could be an answer for third and girlfriend.

1115
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,572
You know, you could do both if you want.

1116
01:02:40,692 --> 01:02:43,752
I think he's outlining the, he just wants our current.

1117
01:02:43,912 --> 01:02:44,212
Okay, fine.

1118
01:02:44,232 --> 01:02:44,992
Then we'll just do that.

1119
01:02:44,992 --> 01:02:51,252
You know, they leave, they leave, we leave for, I mean, I'm, I'm playing the

1120
01:02:51,252 --> 01:02:52,572
field so I can clear.

1121
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:52,932
Yeah.

1122
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:55,132
So I have no negative repercussions from this.

1123
01:02:55,452 --> 01:03:02,012
There's really, you know, there's not so many female animatronics, not to say

1124
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:05,672
that it, uh, that it has to be, uh, it's, it's all up to us.

1125
01:03:05,692 --> 01:03:08,512
And, and as I said, James Buchanan is on the table.

1126
01:03:08,512 --> 01:03:14,872
Um, but, um, that's the reason he stayed a bachelor.

1127
01:03:15,252 --> 01:03:15,572
Yeah.

1128
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:19,492
I mean, there's the problem is it's like with country bears, it's swinging Teddy

1129
01:03:19,492 --> 01:03:24,292
bear, uh, and you can't go with the, the three, the bear sisters because they're

1130
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:26,232
like children, that would be weird.

1131
01:03:26,272 --> 01:03:27,112
I got one.

1132
01:03:27,112 --> 01:03:28,072
Go for it.

1133
01:03:28,912 --> 01:03:32,432
Technically, what kind of an, uh, Lyoda.

1134
01:03:33,212 --> 01:03:34,312
Oh, madam, the older, yeah.

1135
01:03:34,492 --> 01:03:38,112
I love, uh, I love a confident woman.

1136
01:03:38,332 --> 01:03:42,132
I love a woman who's like good at her craft and her job.

1137
01:03:42,132 --> 01:03:46,832
Who's better at summoning the spirits from places beyond than Leo.

1138
01:03:47,432 --> 01:03:48,492
Well, sorry.

1139
01:03:48,572 --> 01:03:49,832
Also good at her job.

1140
01:03:49,912 --> 01:03:50,752
I can only assume.

1141
01:03:50,832 --> 01:03:55,112
I don't know what she's, uh, it could all be nonsense on her clipboard, but

1142
01:03:55,852 --> 01:04:02,352
Spaceship earth, uh, scientists, uh, scientists, uh, with all yellow outfit

1143
01:04:02,352 --> 01:04:05,692
and, uh, Afro, yeah, she's pretty rad.

1144
01:04:05,752 --> 01:04:06,752
That's a really good one.

1145
01:04:06,832 --> 01:04:11,812
Best style of any animatronic anywhere.

1146
01:04:11,872 --> 01:04:16,412
And clearly smart unless she's just taken notes for somebody else.

1147
01:04:16,612 --> 01:04:17,312
But I don't know.

1148
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,572
I think, I think if you saw the other side of the clipboard, she's like

1149
01:04:20,572 --> 01:04:21,652
cracking something major.

1150
01:04:21,772 --> 01:04:23,632
She invented the iPhone.

1151
01:04:24,472 --> 01:04:25,112
That's her.

1152
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:29,732
She has the early prototype of the iPhone and then it was stolen from her.

1153
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:32,012
Um, you see, there's a lot.

1154
01:04:32,152 --> 01:04:32,232
Yeah.

1155
01:04:32,232 --> 01:04:32,872
The you're here.

1156
01:04:32,872 --> 01:04:35,492
You're picking the few humans that exist.

1157
01:04:35,612 --> 01:04:38,112
Like I just mentioned Rosita too, but I shouldn't mirror.

1158
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:39,372
I shouldn't date a bird.

1159
01:04:40,272 --> 01:04:43,592
I like her as I want to find this for her, but I was thinking about,

1160
01:04:43,592 --> 01:04:45,692
Oh, you're smart one.

1161
01:04:46,312 --> 01:04:47,452
There is smart one.

1162
01:04:47,832 --> 01:04:48,712
Female.

1163
01:04:49,072 --> 01:04:50,032
Well, but did we, you know what?

1164
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:51,672
Jason's communicor robot.

1165
01:04:51,812 --> 01:04:52,132
Yeah.

1166
01:04:52,232 --> 01:04:53,152
That's smart one.

1167
01:04:53,152 --> 01:04:57,752
Much like the raw, the robot in Rocky four, which they change the gender of it.

1168
01:04:57,752 --> 01:05:02,172
So the theory is that Paulie uncle Paulie changes the gender of the robot.

1169
01:05:02,372 --> 01:05:06,472
This is all true by the way, Rocky buys Paulie a robot in Rocky four.

1170
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:11,712
Uh, I don't know exactly why, but then Paulie changes the gender of the, of

1171
01:05:11,712 --> 01:05:15,032
the robot mid movie in order to have sex with it.

1172
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:15,752
That's a fear.

1173
01:05:15,932 --> 01:05:16,232
That's a thing.

1174
01:05:16,232 --> 01:05:19,092
I mean, he, it for sure changes like the way it talks.

1175
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:21,212
And then it's like, hello Paul.

1176
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:25,052
Like he starts out much more like deeper voice and then it's much more like up

1177
01:05:25,052 --> 01:05:28,632
here and then the theories online or at least that Paulie has been having sex

1178
01:05:28,632 --> 01:05:29,212
with the robot.

1179
01:05:29,212 --> 01:05:30,452
It doesn't say that in the movie.

1180
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:32,732
John Taffer connection to that robot.

1181
01:05:32,852 --> 01:05:35,512
Did you see this was going around like in December and November,

1182
01:05:35,512 --> 01:05:36,212
going around the internet.

1183
01:05:36,272 --> 01:05:43,072
There's a video that robot was apparently the like center attraction at a giant

1184
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,812
nightclub in Philadelphia.

1185
01:05:45,032 --> 01:05:45,532
Whoa, really?

1186
01:05:46,052 --> 01:05:51,192
And it was like a UFO would open up and this robot would come out and kind of

1187
01:05:51,192 --> 01:05:55,532
dance with the crowd and John Taffer is narrating this video and even going like,

1188
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:58,912
I was managing this club and this robot was a star.

1189
01:05:59,132 --> 01:06:02,072
Like we packed this robot was a star opening night.

1190
01:06:02,112 --> 01:06:04,052
People wanted to see this robot.

1191
01:06:04,152 --> 01:06:05,572
People lost their mind.

1192
01:06:05,752 --> 01:06:06,952
He, you know, he's always selling.

1193
01:06:07,132 --> 01:06:08,532
He's always talking about his customers.

1194
01:06:08,712 --> 01:06:10,372
He's like, and they use that robot.

1195
01:06:10,472 --> 01:06:12,072
We got, we lent them that robot.

1196
01:06:12,312 --> 01:06:14,252
They use that robot in Rocky four.

1197
01:06:14,252 --> 01:06:16,252
Oh, so it was existed already.

1198
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:16,412
Yeah.

1199
01:06:16,712 --> 01:06:18,612
Existing club attraction.

1200
01:06:18,732 --> 01:06:20,352
So Stallone was at the club.

1201
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:21,092
To that club.

1202
01:06:21,372 --> 01:06:24,792
And we got to get the movie.

1203
01:06:25,672 --> 01:06:26,372
Wow.

1204
01:06:26,412 --> 01:06:26,672
Really?

1205
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,432
I didn't know anything about that.

1206
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:28,812
Huh?

1207
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:30,772
Can we Disney world?

1208
01:06:30,892 --> 01:06:35,092
Like there was so many different female stars on the great movie ride.

1209
01:06:35,212 --> 01:06:36,152
Yeah, I was going through there.

1210
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:37,292
I'm on now.

1211
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:39,432
They're all thrown in the wood chipper.

1212
01:06:39,432 --> 01:06:42,972
Uh, so I mean Poppins or Ripley.

1213
01:06:43,732 --> 01:06:44,512
Oh Ripley.

1214
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:45,832
Oh, Janice.

1215
01:06:45,852 --> 01:06:46,072
Yes.

1216
01:06:46,152 --> 01:06:47,672
The morning we were.

1217
01:06:47,672 --> 01:06:49,052
Yeah.

1218
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:51,352
A Quentin Tarantino favorite, I believe.

1219
01:06:51,392 --> 01:06:52,032
Oh, interesting.

1220
01:06:52,572 --> 01:06:54,772
Early crush of Quentin Tarantino's.

1221
01:06:55,932 --> 01:06:56,832
Uh, yeah.

1222
01:06:57,232 --> 01:06:59,132
But is there an animatronic Janice?

1223
01:06:59,272 --> 01:06:59,812
Yeah, you're right.

1224
01:06:59,832 --> 01:07:00,192
That's right.

1225
01:07:00,312 --> 01:07:01,232
She's just sticking to that.

1226
01:07:01,332 --> 01:07:01,872
We are sticking.

1227
01:07:01,912 --> 01:07:03,032
We should stick to the question.

1228
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:03,732
You know what?

1229
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:07,952
Um, I'm just, I'm looking at a list of, uh, animatronic rides and animatronics.

1230
01:07:08,212 --> 01:07:14,932
The, the, like the daughter in, um, uh, carousel progress in like 90s mode.

1231
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:15,512
Oh yeah.

1232
01:07:15,652 --> 01:07:16,032
Yeah.

1233
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,052
Still might be like 16, 17.

1234
01:07:18,132 --> 01:07:18,632
I don't know.

1235
01:07:18,632 --> 01:07:19,792
I don't know if that's defined.

1236
01:07:20,592 --> 01:07:21,692
She's in a turtleneck.

1237
01:07:21,952 --> 01:07:22,192
That's true.

1238
01:07:22,332 --> 01:07:23,172
She could be 21.

1239
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:23,572
Yeah.

1240
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:26,232
That indicates that she's in college at least.

1241
01:07:26,452 --> 01:07:29,652
I mean, I think the, which makes it fine.

1242
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:33,552
To stop this conversation soon or somebody's going to walk into a hole.

1243
01:07:34,872 --> 01:07:39,072
The red head from pirates of the red, the original, well, I was met the

1244
01:07:39,072 --> 01:07:40,012
red with the big hat.

1245
01:07:40,012 --> 01:07:41,912
Oh, well she didn't talk.

1246
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:44,672
Uh, would you ask her to keep the hat on?

1247
01:07:45,152 --> 01:07:48,252
I, it's such a, she looks so great in that hat.

1248
01:07:48,252 --> 01:07:49,992
I mean, so you're just picking her.

1249
01:07:49,992 --> 01:07:51,872
Well, my concern, I didn't say her first.

1250
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:54,952
Cause I think I had a moment where I went, well, she's out of my league.

1251
01:07:54,952 --> 01:08:00,572
You were giving yourself some chicken or something.

1252
01:08:01,892 --> 01:08:04,192
Without a more robot love story.

1253
01:08:04,412 --> 01:08:08,912
Hey, if we have to go with the non-human, if we could challenge ourselves,

1254
01:08:08,912 --> 01:08:15,112
yeah, what about the, uh, nine I real Pearlman's, uh, oh yeah.

1255
01:08:15,972 --> 01:08:16,512
Oh wow.

1256
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:16,932
Yeah.

1257
01:08:16,972 --> 01:08:17,792
Oh, I forgot about.

1258
01:08:18,372 --> 01:08:24,252
Grip onto her and she like ride her through the future.

1259
01:08:24,252 --> 01:08:25,172
Uh, sure.

1260
01:08:25,412 --> 01:08:27,452
That was panoramic times of France.

1261
01:08:28,132 --> 01:08:28,372
Yeah.

1262
01:08:28,952 --> 01:08:30,012
Um, easy one.

1263
01:08:30,012 --> 01:08:31,332
Uh, Ariel.

1264
01:08:32,132 --> 01:08:34,392
Does she, I guess she's more cartoony.

1265
01:08:34,432 --> 01:08:35,052
Yeah.

1266
01:08:35,092 --> 01:08:35,752
She's a robot.

1267
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:36,232
Yeah.

1268
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:38,472
Although she might be too young to.

1269
01:08:38,632 --> 01:08:43,072
Although I think, for sure she's a child bride in the, but also nine

1270
01:08:43,072 --> 01:08:45,072
I could be two years old.

1271
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:46,432
That's a good point too.

1272
01:08:46,432 --> 01:08:49,272
And I guess when it, even though she sounds like an adult,

1273
01:08:49,412 --> 01:08:50,692
ex machina kind of.

1274
01:08:50,712 --> 01:08:50,792
Yeah.

1275
01:08:50,952 --> 01:08:54,412
I'm going to just to be safe, I'm going to pick, uh, what's the wife

1276
01:08:54,412 --> 01:08:56,012
and carousel progress's name.

1277
01:08:57,172 --> 01:08:57,892
John's wife.

1278
01:08:58,212 --> 01:09:01,632
Does he ever say, how dare you break up that marriage?

1279
01:09:01,912 --> 01:09:05,852
I'm going to break up John's marriage because your real relationship is ending

1280
01:09:05,852 --> 01:09:06,852
in this scenario.

1281
01:09:06,972 --> 01:09:07,292
Yeah.

1282
01:09:08,112 --> 01:09:10,492
Doesn't mean John in the toilet.

1283
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:12,072
I'm going to drag John down.

1284
01:09:12,272 --> 01:09:14,692
First of all, he doesn't pay attention or you've seen the ride.

1285
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:18,372
He's always, he's, he's confused about things, stuff going on.

1286
01:09:18,552 --> 01:09:19,732
He doesn't take care of her.

1287
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:20,552
Like he should.

1288
01:09:20,632 --> 01:09:23,232
He's extremely dismissive of his whole family.

1289
01:09:23,232 --> 01:09:24,312
That's what I'm saying.

1290
01:09:24,312 --> 01:09:25,312
Good luck in there.

1291
01:09:25,552 --> 01:09:26,292
The oven blew up.

1292
01:09:26,312 --> 01:09:27,432
Who gives a shit?

1293
01:09:27,892 --> 01:09:29,632
Like that's John's attitude towards everything.

1294
01:09:29,692 --> 01:09:31,232
So he doesn't deserve that wife.

1295
01:09:31,432 --> 01:09:33,152
So I, I'm going to choose the wife.

1296
01:09:33,472 --> 01:09:37,652
He was in that rat race commuting to the city to make a

1297
01:09:37,652 --> 01:09:39,372
asbestos and agent orange.

1298
01:09:39,752 --> 01:09:44,192
I'm surprised you didn't pick the wife on carousel of progress

1299
01:09:44,632 --> 01:09:48,152
because yet that is yet another character that friends of ours have

1300
01:09:48,152 --> 01:09:52,372
texted you and I and said, Oh, Jason is John from the carousel progress.

1301
01:09:52,372 --> 01:09:57,512
So I would imagine that you, I would thought you were going to pick her

1302
01:09:57,512 --> 01:10:00,072
just because like you kind of self identify as John.

1303
01:10:00,612 --> 01:10:01,152
I guess.

1304
01:10:01,192 --> 01:10:04,032
Well, then in theory, I already go home to her.

1305
01:10:04,172 --> 01:10:06,132
Well, but then is that's my relationship.

1306
01:10:06,412 --> 01:10:09,212
I'm breaking up my existing relationship with an animatronic

1307
01:10:09,212 --> 01:10:10,572
for a different animatronic.

1308
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:13,672
Or at least the grandma, you could go with the grandma.

1309
01:10:13,712 --> 01:10:16,132
And it doesn't say if it's John's mom or not though.

1310
01:10:16,132 --> 01:10:18,672
I think I've got the funnest combo between us.

1311
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:19,092
Okay.

1312
01:10:19,092 --> 01:10:21,692
Jason and the Navi river shaman.

1313
01:10:21,692 --> 01:10:23,492
Oh yeah.

1314
01:10:24,172 --> 01:10:24,892
Oh wow.

1315
01:10:25,132 --> 01:10:27,152
Navi river shaman celibate though.

1316
01:10:27,312 --> 01:10:28,452
Are they pledged?

1317
01:10:28,512 --> 01:10:29,072
No way.

1318
01:10:29,112 --> 01:10:29,612
Stories.

1319
01:10:29,972 --> 01:10:32,252
She'll plunge her hair.

1320
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:35,872
If you were to for to fornicate, she takes the hit, like it's all hair

1321
01:10:35,872 --> 01:10:37,372
connection and it's a different thing.

1322
01:10:37,432 --> 01:10:38,392
So they're not celibate.

1323
01:10:38,592 --> 01:10:42,792
I'm saying my spot destroyed, destroyed my spine with your hair sex organ.

1324
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:44,492
Yeah.

1325
01:10:44,832 --> 01:10:47,372
Well, that'll that I wonder if they'll do something like that in one of the

1326
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:52,032
sequels where a human and Navi come together, not just in an avatar.

1327
01:10:52,032 --> 01:10:55,152
And hopefully it cripples him and it cripples the human.

1328
01:10:55,152 --> 01:10:55,792
Yeah.

1329
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:58,712
Maybe like praying mantises making love.

1330
01:10:58,972 --> 01:10:59,452
Yeah.

1331
01:10:59,612 --> 01:11:01,312
And it murders the other one.

1332
01:11:01,312 --> 01:11:01,632
Yeah.

1333
01:11:01,732 --> 01:11:02,312
Spiders.

1334
01:11:02,312 --> 01:11:02,852
Geez.

1335
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:08,652
Well, thanks to Johnny for destroying our relationships and leading to a

1336
01:11:08,652 --> 01:11:12,072
scenario where Jason is a sexual death.

1337
01:11:13,672 --> 01:11:15,532
Yeah, that's what it is.

1338
01:11:15,852 --> 01:11:16,032
Yeah.

1339
01:11:16,032 --> 01:11:16,292
Boy.

1340
01:11:16,512 --> 01:11:17,932
Well, that was a mad cab.

1341
01:11:17,952 --> 01:11:19,632
We have got, we got too many.

1342
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:21,732
We were like, Hey, now we have so many.

1343
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:23,072
Yeah.

1344
01:11:24,092 --> 01:11:24,272
Yeah.

1345
01:11:24,272 --> 01:11:26,072
If you didn't hear your question, don't worry.

1346
01:11:26,092 --> 01:11:27,192
We'll get around to it.

1347
01:11:27,192 --> 01:11:31,452
And thanks so much for writing the podcast, the right post office.

1348
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:33,072
Uh, this is a blast.

1349
01:11:33,192 --> 01:11:34,712
Really fun to get people's questions.

1350
01:11:34,952 --> 01:11:35,192
Yeah.

1351
01:11:35,632 --> 01:11:37,832
Uh, look how much you learned about all of us.

1352
01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:39,392
That's three creeps.

1353
01:11:39,392 --> 01:11:40,392
We're weird.

1354
01:11:41,852 --> 01:11:44,032
I guess what you signed up for though.

1355
01:11:44,072 --> 01:11:44,312
Yep.

1356
01:11:44,312 --> 01:11:47,072
You knew what you were getting into, what you're patronizing.

1357
01:11:47,352 --> 01:11:51,372
Uh, thanks so much for your continued subscription to podcast.

1358
01:11:51,552 --> 01:11:54,752
We're at the second gate, uh, and check us out on Twitter and you know all that.

1359
01:11:54,992 --> 01:11:57,852
If you get too much of us as it is, tweet at me.

1360
01:11:57,912 --> 01:12:03,892
If I forget to post a picture of that little bowl, if you're dying to see that

1361
01:12:03,892 --> 01:12:08,232
little bowl, you are going to win the day that comes out, you were going to blow

1362
01:12:08,232 --> 01:12:09,672
that's going to break the internet.

1363
01:12:11,192 --> 01:12:11,752
Break Ralph style.

1364
01:12:11,752 --> 01:12:12,812
Uh, all right.

1365
01:12:12,852 --> 01:12:13,992
Hey, thanks for listening everybody.
