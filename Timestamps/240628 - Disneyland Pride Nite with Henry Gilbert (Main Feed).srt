1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Warning!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The following podcast may include

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Leather Daddy Aliens

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oddly understocked

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Rainbow Food Stuffs

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And the serving of a C-Word

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That doesn't stand for what you think

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Henry Gilbert from Talking Simpsons

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Brings us a special trip report

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
From Disneyland Pride Night

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
On Podcast The Ride

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Music

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And you know something? You can't spell

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Podcast The Ride without Pride

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm Scott Gardiner

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, that makes you think, right Mike Carlson?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It does make me think of all the letters that are involved in the name

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Kind of the primary

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's been in front of us the whole time

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We've never thought about it

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Jason Sheridan

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, and we're only giving

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're only putting out two episodes

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In all of June

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Just as this event gets two nights

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Out of a whole month

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, I think if listeners think back

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They will note that we only put out those two episodes

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Because we wanted to

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In order to line up with the Pride

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Event. How else do we show our support?

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It doesn't sound right but it is right I guess

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If Jason said it

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go check, go check, you'll see

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So today we're talking about

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Disneyland Pride Night

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A fairly new event

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A recently held event

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
As we record this and as you're hearing it

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Just a couple days later

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
An event that was just attended by our guest

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Who is in town on Podcast The Ride

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
For the first time in person

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
For the first time solo

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
From Talking Simpsons and what a cartoon

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey, hello

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Clarabelle the cow super fan

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alright, let's see

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Bust those Clarabelle moves

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I know the listeners can't hear it but

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh look at it, wow, he's going wild

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It is so Clarabelle-esque

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That would go viral on TikTok

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If we posted it but we weren't filming

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thanks for joining us

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Henry, it's good to see you

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's great to see you guys too

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We recorded in person

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
On the Talking Simpsons

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Podcast like 6 years ago

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
When you guys

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You like rented a little

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Airbnb by Warner Brothers-ish

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So it's been that long

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Since we've seen you in person

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've been a

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
At home podcaster

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Remotely for so long

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I feel like you guys are still on

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A screen away from me and I can't

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Physically touch you

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well that's the thrill

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Anything can happen, we can all get up and

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Touch each other whenever we want

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's true

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Make something happen

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I poke Jason a lot during recordings

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have the bruises

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
To show for it

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Even just doing two episodes this month

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He's like upped his poking

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If we say it enough

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If we say it enough

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh yeah it'll work

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So yeah

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
While you're in town giving

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Non-screened podcasting a try

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Which we're happy about

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But you've done

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A ton of theme parking

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In addition to Pride Night

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We were talking a little bit before we started

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You've been at theme parks

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
More than we have recently

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Anything from your travels you want to shout out?

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Man I've done so much

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I had been a Californian

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
For 17 years

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And now I've moved to Seattle

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And I was in the Bay Area

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But it was nice back then to know

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh an hour flight and I'm right here

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And can go to a theme park

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And my husband and I are big

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Theme park people

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But we hadn't been

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In a while

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We did go to Tokyo Disneyland

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
In January

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We spent Christmas Day at Tokyo Disney

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's a smart use of Christmas

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's good

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It was great

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This was our first big trip in a while

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And we did

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The Mickey's Runaway Railway

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Man what a good ride

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That was so good

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah that seems pretty

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Universally acclaimed

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Other than by my 3 year old

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Who was really

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Terrified by it

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Imagine that tornado sequence

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In the eyes of a 3 year old

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
When you're just afraid of the dark

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In general

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He held it together then we got off

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And just erupted

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It was an effective and immersive ride

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Because he thought it was really happening

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
A lot of dark in it for sure

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That is true

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And the line is like

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
As a person who does animation podcasts

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The line is so full of little details

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That are so cool

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Also I'm a huge goofy movie fan

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There's like 3 or 4 posters

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That are just goofy movie references

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Like the

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Freaky Friday one

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And the High School Musical parody one

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They're just like characters from goofy movie

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That is so cool to see

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Which themselves are more recent references

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You gotta like that they are

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Acknowledging the last 25-30 years

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Of Walt Disney pictures

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And not just kind of like

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's Mary Poppins and then it's nothing after that

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah though I also felt

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Old in the line because there was like

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There was a lot of people in their 20s

158
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
At pride night there

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And when they're in the line

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And see the Mickey's Playhouse

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Show

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Which was like came out

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There's a Mickey's Playhouse section of it

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Which came out when I was like in my 20s

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And then they are looking at it and going

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh my god that's my childhood right there

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wanted to die

168
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Some of these get rough

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
These generational switch

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Goofy movie is no longer the like

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Cool hip reference anymore

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's more for the 30s and 40s

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Mike this is news to me

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't want to say it

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't want him to say it

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But I'm just saying that used to be like

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh you know what's actually good is Goofy movie

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And that's what the hip young people were saying

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Something with Pauly Shore in it is no longer considered hip

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry to say it to the audience

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If you haven't thought about it

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Think about it now

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh but outside of Disney

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I went to Universal

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
To do the 60th anniversary

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Tour which is a lot of fun

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's really good though it makes it

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It makes that last bit of the Fast and Furious ride

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Like it's like the last

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Because basically they have a few updated

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Things and a bunch of cool updated videos for it

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And then they have a stop down to like

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Get photos for like the

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Gram like all of these you know

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Like oh pose with they put the

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You know the big Bruce the shark like

You can pose with it like you used to

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In Orlando you know and

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And here's Dominic Toretto's car

200
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And get in King Kong's hand

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Is it just one zone

202
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's the like get out take pictures zone

203
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah yeah basically you do earthquake

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Which that was cool that earthquakes

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Open again too

206
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And then refreshed although that

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Bums me out because it doesn't look like 1987

208
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Anymore yeah it's sad it looks like

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Like 10 years ago BART

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Station now instead of like 70s

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
At least it's not current I just

212
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't want it to be current that's my main point

213
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You were happy there's like a Cinderella

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Man poster yeah yeah yes

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The theme parks are meant to be at least

216
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
A little bit out of date yeah yeah

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I like our guide presented as

218
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Now this is

219
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I think it's studio 15 he's like studio 15

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Now this used to have the earthquake ride but

221
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We've changed it now and it's we're

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Shooting something else here and now

223
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey wait a minute uh oh uh oh

224
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Like so that's good

225
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The tour guide was great

226
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Like he I really

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Look I don't want to get into sexuality though

228
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is the pride episode but he was

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He called himself a southern bell

230
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
When he was describing how much

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He loves like being in the western set

232
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So I was like he seemed like a very

233
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Feminine guy was having a good time

234
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And uh it was I

235
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Love that in the tour guide oh that's nice

236
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's good but but yeah you get

237
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You have a stop off to get your

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Instagram pictures and then

239
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You get back on and then the only

240
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Thing they got left is the fast and furious

241
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Part and I'm just like god I wish I could just get off

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Now and just save

243
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If they gave you the option yeah would you like a golf

244
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Cart to take you the rest of the way

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Skip what you know is coming oh and Ted

246
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Ted has a new sign

247
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's like we celebrate 60 years

248
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Of the tour oh wow

249
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I was like oh my god Ted's got a new sign

250
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Wow wow

251
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Malamute Stacy isn't he

252
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wow yeah I feel like we oh go ahead

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was just gonna say it's in the same spot Ted has always been

254
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think yeah Ted's in the same spot but now

255
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He's got a sign what was celebrating

256
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
60 years of the studio tour

257
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sure there wasn't a new Ted

258
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No I don't think it's a new Ted but yeah

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You know what's been a nice thing

260
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Maybe you guys have noticed this because we

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
All live pretty near Universal

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Studios and just kind of

263
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
A fun little like

264
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A dash of color

265
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In the surrounding areas right

266
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Now is that sometimes it happened to me right before

267
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I came over I was at a coffee shop and a bus

268
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Went by and the bus

269
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A lot of buses around here are decked

270
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Out like the glamour tram

271
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Like full bus wrap

272
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Of the red and white

273
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And like it was parked this morning

274
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
In such a way that I couldn't even see the front and there was a

275
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Minute where I kind of bugged out like

276
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Is that did the tram get loose

277
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Is it lost is it out on the street

278
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But it's not and the

279
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You know and our beloved Kara beloved

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Woody Woodpecker you'll see on it

281
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Just brightens up the town

282
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You know yeah it was really

283
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Great and I also did the

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Warner studio tour which I'd never done

285
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Before which is fun you get to see all

286
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The things back when Warner Brothers like made movies

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Instead of like shelving them and not releasing them

288
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Tax write offs

289
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Although they should I mean how cool would it be

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
To see the like and in there are the

291
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Is the shelf that

292
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Coyote versus Acme is sitting on

293
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There it is you want to see it do you want to help us

294
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Destroy it we got hammers

295
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This is the Lee C drive

296
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The orange rubbery

297
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hard drive that used to contain

298
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The screener copy

299
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There's like an urn full of the back girl hard drive

300
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Just to have sitting on a shelf

301
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And they're like that's the remains of back girl

302
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Unreleasable

303
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It was fun

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Though the right though they really

305
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You can see how they market it towards

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Like the international folks who are coming

307
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There because they're like it's like

308
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Half friends they're like there's

309
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
An entire like here's we built a central

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Perk you can take pictures in and

311
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Here's like the friends fountain and a

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Couch that they've and

313
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Though they have to admit like this

314
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Isn't the real fountain we

315
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Had to move the fountain from where it

316
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Used to be and this is where we put it for

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The reunion special

318
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And all that oh yeah

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And then also like a ton of Harry Potter stuff

320
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But I'm just like no thank you and then

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And then though I think

322
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think the Warner studio tour is stealing

323
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Valor because they have

324
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Like a whole Lord of the Rings section there

325
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And I'm like now come on like that is a new line

326
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thing you guys didn't green light this

327
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Like that is not

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They released it though technically like I

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Know the association they

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
They released the Hobbit movies and

331
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I mean new line was owned by

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Warner by the time return

333
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Of the king came out so it's not like they don't

334
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Own it but I I'm a real

335
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Stickler about that

336
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Like with Fox stuff are you like

337
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Disney doesn't own alien oh man

338
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
On pride night I I was

339
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Saying to my husband they play a song

340
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
From they play

341
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is me from the world's greatest showman

342
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And I was just going like this isn't a

343
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Song this is a song

344
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I saw a video of that

345
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I was like wait hold on

346
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah I guess yeah like

347
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Doing the math in my head I

348
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Mean well and it's like oh now it's I guess a

349
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
20th century film like

350
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's the branding for it but yeah

351
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It was but yeah the Warner tour the most

352
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It was also fun you get to hear

353
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Different patches of people in the group like

354
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Ooh and ah and stuff where she'd say like

355
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Our tour guide said this is where

356
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is where like 800 episodes

357
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Of the Gilmore Girls were filmed and some parts

358
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Were going like ooh and then then the Big Bang

359
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Theory section and then the and then

360
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I love that she was like a big

361
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Trekkie the and she

362
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Is like now there's no the only Star Trek

363
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Thing here I can name is that the

364
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Episode Next Generation with

365
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Data in the Old West was filmed here

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Like for a fistful of data I think

367
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's called yeah fistful of data yeah

368
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Is there Old West

369
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Stuff there I'm sure

370
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well she was saying it used to it got torn down but she's

371
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Like this was the Old West section

372
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And it what this is where that was filmed

373
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think every lot

374
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Because like all in the same

375
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Neck of the wall pretty close to each other

376
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Disney Warner Brothers

377
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Universal and Universal still has some Old

378
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
West Disney's is all gone Disney's

379
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
All offices I didn't know until

380
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Right now that Warner had Old West and

381
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Got rid of like so much real

382
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Estate in the Burbank

383
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Toluca Lake whatever you want to call it

384
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
North Hollywood area was once

385
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Western sets valuable land

386
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But every studio needed

387
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The way that was the thing because that's something I had to say on the tour was it

388
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Six points Texas was

389
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Where because there were six different streets that you could

390
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Film six different westerns at the same

391
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Time and can you imagine

392
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Are there six westerns being filmed at the same

393
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Time on the globe today

394
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Kevin Costner's

395
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Rust

396
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Kevin Costner part one Kevin Costner part two

397
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Kevin Costner part three

398
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Is Yellowstone a western?

399
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Sure let's go with it

400
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They got cowboy hats

401
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Well they got the 1893 the spin off

402
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh yeah the Harrison Ford so that's

403
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There's one

404
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No yeah I mean the

405
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I feel like they film western

406
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Movies about westerns like

407
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Once upon a time in Hollywood that's what they used the western

408
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Set for

409
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So there still have to be sound stages

410
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Towering over the western set

411
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's got to be kind of a double set

412
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I wonder if the tour at Universal is the reason

413
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That stuff is still there because it's almost like

414
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There's an incentive to have a

415
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Western part just to say oh that's the

416
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Western part of the tour it's also sort of perfectly

417
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You know if you haven't been on

418
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The tour you don't know the area like

419
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Big swaths of the back lot are

420
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Kind of are turning into studio space they're

421
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Like tidying it all up right if it

422
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Land it used to be switching back

423
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And forth between sound stage and theme park

424
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And now it's kind of like theme park

425
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Stuff goes over here

426
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Studio stuff is over here sound stages are

427
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Over here

428
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But yeah I think maybe the western stuff has survived

429
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Just because it's like in the middle

430
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's like protected but they probably

431
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't think they need the flash

432
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Flood a lot

433
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Like for filming day to day I don't think

434
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's getting a lot of use they probably

435
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Would be happy to rip it out but

436
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's sealed in the bubble

437
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I feel like movies and

438
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
TV shows are using the crash plane set

439
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
More than the

440
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Than the old west

441
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I do see that where people do try to

442
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Reappropriate that here and there

443
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Like on CBS like procedurals

444
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And stuff I feel like I think maybe

445
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Will Trent is combing through the

446
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Wreckage like looking for stuff

447
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Sure yeah

448
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh and the

449
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Saddest thing on the Warner tour

450
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That they actually showed us was like

451
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And here's the they could

452
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Show us an empty sound

453
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Stage that we wouldn't be interrupting

454
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Anything and when they got out of there

455
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And you know what was filmed here

456
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The Conan show

457
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The TBS Conan show

458
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's just empty now

459
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's just really nothing ever went in there

460
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
At least currently nothing is in there

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's also weird that like

462
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Cause I remember wondering like

463
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
When will this show end and when will they

464
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Like turn off the lights on

465
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The place where I worked and where I have like a lot

466
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Of fond memories and the answer is

467
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It was just like abandoned everybody just dropped their

468
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Pens and papers one day during

469
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The pandemic they were just out

470
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And then it went home and then it was done

471
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
At Largo for a little while

472
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And nobody ever went back to that studio

473
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Or did anything there

474
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Just a weird unceremonious

475
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And bizarre

476
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Conan's show endings besides the first one

477
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
None of them are

478
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
None of them are done with the proper heralding

479
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well that's sad

480
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's sad to hear I'll try to bounce back

481
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Well here's a happier memory there actually

482
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
For when we sat on the friend's couch

483
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's get the friend's couch picture wasn't that important to us

484
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But then the

485
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Tour guide pointed out oh and you know over there

486
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Those steps up to a bank

487
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That was used in

488
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The Batman 66 show every

489
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Time he went into City Hall he ran up

490
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
These stairs

491
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I could like sit on there sometime

492
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
When I had like constant back lot access

493
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Like I'm just gonna take a sandwich

494
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Over to the Batman steps that was

495
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That was a good deal

496
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It also reminded me how one time I saw a golf cart

497
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Tour go by once

498
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
When Conan was outside the studio

499
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And I watched him just give

500
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Scarily what anybody

501
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Would want if you were on the tour which is

502
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It like stopped at a stop sign and he said

503
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Hey everyone it's me

504
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Conan O'Brien from television

505
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Your eyes don't deceive you take a look

506
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Take it all in take photographs

507
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And it almost like

508
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Was probably purposefully too much

509
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He's like can I be so willing

510
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
To participate in this that it's scary

511
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And it was very fun to watch that show

512
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You freak them out

513
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah there's a lot of

514
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Like a lot of the sound stages are Batman and Robin

515
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like if you go and look at

516
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The like little plaque and stuff

517
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
They used like everything and I think they used Universal too

518
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And it says like

519
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What I love about it is it's like Casablanca

520
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And then 70 years later

521
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Whatever 50 years later Batman and Robin

522
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No yeah there's

523
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Our tour guide

524
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Said like and this is where Chris

525
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
O'Donnell drove the stolen Batmobile

526
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Down the streets

527
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There was also the tour

528
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Guide had another very funny part where she said

529
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And you know this area this is where Austin

530
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Powers gold member

531
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Filled like she had like a pause

532
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Pregnant pause

533
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Bring everybody down we're like oh gold member

534
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's still good kind of good

535
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Strong cast

536
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Britney's in it

537
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We got to see the alleyway where Spiderman

538
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Did his upside down kiss that was also

539
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Where Purple Rain's cover was

540
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Photographed

541
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I didn't know either of those

542
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh that's fascinating

543
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There's so much Hollywood history

544
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I love all the little

545
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Trivia like that's I've really come to love

546
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Tour guides on these trips now

547
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Like who are ready to be

548
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Asked a really dorky question about

549
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Like was any of the Matrix shot here

550
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Which is what I asked and she's like

551
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I guess some I don't know like

552
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Now I'm saying

553
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Like she had lots of good answers and now I'm saying

554
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The time she had no good answer

555
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Hard to know everything

556
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Try to keep as much in your pocket as you can

557
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There is a very

558
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Ominous thing by the

559
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Warner Brothers lot right now which is

560
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There is like a three

561
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Story vertical billboard that always

562
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Had the big summer release

563
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The big release

564
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Barbie and the last time

565
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I drove by it was just white

566
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It was just nothing

567
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And it's like that's a little

568
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Too on the nose

569
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
For this company if you stare closely

570
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's actually it's just really fine

571
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Print and it's all of the details of

572
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The tax write off forms that says

573
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh yeah they had to post it somewhere

574
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Legally they had to post it

575
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Technically you are looking at the

576
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Poster for Batgirl

577
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's one of those things where you select all

578
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Text and you turn it white

579
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But it's on a white background

580
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Stare close

581
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's there

582
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What a fun

583
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's something we need to do in the near future

584
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Well that's great

585
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Great travels but it seems like the main thing

586
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Or at least the kind of unique thing happening

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
During your trip specifically

588
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Was Disneyland Pride Night

589
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Which you went on

590
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There were two nights of it you went on Thursday

591
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You said

592
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I went on Thursday yeah so the Pride Night

593
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
NITE

594
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We had been

595
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Thinking about going

596
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So it started last year I mean there's a whole

597
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
History to it but yeah it started

598
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Last year this official Pride Night

599
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
At Disneyland and our friends

600
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Went to it and our other

601
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Gay friends and they

602
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Who are big theme park people including

603
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Nick and Alan who I bet are listening to this

604
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So hey Nick and Alan

605
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But they told us

606
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
How much fun it was and

607
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That we were like okay we gotta

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Go next year and

609
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Also it coincided with my

610
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Husband's birthday so it was kind of a fun

611
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Fun birthday trip

612
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And we're such park people

613
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That we're like alright let's

614
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We can now see the differences that we

615
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Watched enough park contents

616
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Of the

617
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Influencers and what not to know

618
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Like the terminology now but so

619
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah we went

620
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You could get in as early as six

621
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But the stuff didn't

622
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Start till nine and so it's one of those like

623
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Official like wristbanded events

624
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And everything but

625
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
They kick everybody out all the just the regular

626
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Day riff raff

627
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And this is Disneyland Park

628
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Only there's not a California

629
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Venture no no it's only California

630
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Venture which I would it's the

631
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Most heterosexual California venture probably

632
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Is that that six to nine moment

633
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
When all the gays are in Pride

634
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Night

635
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And there's no Orlando

636
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
One yet

637
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Not yet yeah I mean you know

638
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's a big thing

639
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I mean it's Florida so

640
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah and I

641
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Personal background here I can make fun

642
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I can make the Florida's racist

643
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Jokes because I grew up in Florida I was there

644
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Lived there from ten to twenty five

645
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So I can make these jokes I'm not just an outsider

646
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And I imagine stolen

647
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Valor

648
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I think it started at Disneyland

649
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Paris though I think they did an official

650
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Pride night first

651
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And then California was

652
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Decided to get on the you know the

653
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Rainbow Bucks bandwagon

654
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And do it but

655
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Well that's a question are you were you like

656
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
A little cynical going

657
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Is it a mix were you more

658
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Cynical or more excited

659
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah I mean boy yeah it's

660
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So yeah as a gay man

661
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
To preface things no but

662
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
No I mean obviously

663
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm tired of like rainbow capitalism

664
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And people put a rainbow on a thing

665
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And they sell it to you because they know gay people

666
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Spend money like of course like

667
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm very cynical about these things I'm

668
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm a pretty left wing cynical guy

669
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yet I do love the

670
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Parks and I

671
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Like to buy things and they

672
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Have like and there is some level

673
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Of like ironic detachment

674
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I brought to it too but

675
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There is something about

676
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Feeling wanted to buy the corporation

677
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That on some level

678
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I can't fully divorce myself from

679
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
They're like oh Disney wants

680
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Our money now like that's a form of

681
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Acceptance like that's nice

682
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And being open

683
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
To getting money

684
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
From a type of person they don't reject

685
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Our money is as gross and

686
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Disgusting you know it spends the same

687
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Like yeah I mean it's different

688
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Than yeah like I don't know you know

689
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You know Keurig

690
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Putting out like turning their

691
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
K into

692
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Rainbow color like you don't need you don't

693
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Care necessarily about there's things

694
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That seem a little more cash in but

695
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Disney like I guess you probably want

696
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It to all coalesce into

697
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Something because it's part of your childhood

698
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
No matter how cynical you get or

699
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Like are any of our opinions about the

700
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Company today well yeah we

701
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Are tied up in these stories it's part of our

702
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Childhood no matter what it's also like a struggle

703
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Because like the corporation itself

704
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Is always almost always

705
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Evil and just wants money

706
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But the people in charge of

707
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Disneyland I'm sure there's a bunch of people that are excited

708
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
About it and are gonna like oh that's what's

709
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
A fun cupcake we could make like

710
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
People who do the little projects

711
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And who do like who are like

712
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't know like now there's a press you can do a

713
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Cool display in this main street window

714
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Like that's the weird relationship

715
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We know there's people in there who aren't

716
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Evil and who mean very well

717
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Sure no and the general

718
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Vibes are so fun that night I mean

719
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Especially like there are so many people

720
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I was watching videos from people

721
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Who went the previous year and

722
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Like they were in tears going like thank

723
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You Disney for for recognizing us

724
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And then accepting us this is so beautiful

725
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Thank you and you can't

726
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Not be touched by that like even as cynical

727
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
As I can be sometimes and

728
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The general vibes are just really great the whole

729
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Time like everybody is so excited to be

730
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
There and get their pictures taken with

731
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Every possible thing and everybody

732
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Dressed up and they're wearing their like rainbow

733
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Clothing or

734
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Red shirts as well which has like a real

735
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Historical background to it

736
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That it

737
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's hard not to be but occasionally

738
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I will have moments like

739
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That way that's pride representation

740
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Why does this like I have a list of things

741
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Like that doesn't seem like

742
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Pride representation to me

743
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But okay like there's

744
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
There is there is cognitive dissonance

745
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But it's a fun time though no

746
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I wish they allowed any alcohol

747
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
In it I guess I could have gone into

748
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Ogas to drink but that's the one thing that didn't make it

749
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Feel like a up till 1 a.m.

750
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Pride night thing to me

751
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Of like I can't drink at all like

752
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That was my

753
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm wondering yeah like well I mean

754
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I guess they don't want to change the rules but

755
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Would it be worse though at California Adventure

756
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Just because it doesn't feel as big of a deal

757
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Because you're not having this event

758
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
In the main part yeah

759
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The fairy tale perk yeah that's true

760
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It does mean more

761
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
To do it have the rainbows on the castle

762
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And down main street and everything

763
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It does mean a lot more than

764
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The California Adventure yeah

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So they lit up the facade of

766
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The theater in Hollywood that they only

767
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Use sometimes

768
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Like the sound stage that hasn't

769
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Been anything for 22 years

770
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Has my back that's great

771
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The confusing looking bear rock

772
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Formation has a rainbow on it you can kind

773
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Of see the thing that I assume is a bear

774
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
From its name but it doesn't always look like a bear

775
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It supports me whatever it is

776
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It is a bear and

777
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Tonight we're also going to use the

778
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Other definition of that term

779
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Well I'm humble with that

780
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That sounds good

781
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It made me sad that

782
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
As it always does but the country bear

783
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Jamboree has been gone

784
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
For so long that like

785
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
That would be all the bears would go there

786
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Like that would be just so beautiful like when I

787
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I was looking up history of like

788
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
The gay days at Disney stuff

789
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
In prep for this and like

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
There's a great video it's like from 2010

791
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
From gay days in Orlando

792
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And those are the unofficial

793
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The unofficial gay days yeah

794
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I was going to ask about that

795
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Have you ever gone to either the

796
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Anaheim or Orlando because they are at both

797
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Places now the gay days

798
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
No I have not but I have a funny

799
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Story about that with that history

800
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Of it so yeah so

801
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The gay days in Orlando like I

802
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Believe 1991 is the first

803
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Unofficial start of it and

804
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It was you wear a red

805
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Shirt you attend Disney and wear

806
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
A red shirt to indicate you are

807
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
An LGBTQ person who is there

808
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
To celebrate it is a it was started

809
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
As you know a stealth thing or

810
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Not exactly stealth but like and obviously

811
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Not sanctioned by Disney

812
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
That's why of all the pride

813
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Shirts they had I bought a red shirt

814
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Oh acknowledges that history too

815
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yeah and I know they made I am

816
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Certain whoever made the shirt

817
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Said we have to have a red shirt because

818
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Like we want to recognize

819
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Unofficially that thing but sure

820
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Sure but so at 90 so I

821
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Never got to go to Magic Kingdom even though I

822
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Grew up in Jacksonville Florida

823
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
We didn't go to Magic Kingdom

824
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Until like I was like

825
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
16 or 17 but we almost

826
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Went as

827
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Part of an end of year

828
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
School

829
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Trip like end of year school trip and it

830
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Was going to be the first weekend

831
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Of like the first Friday of June

832
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And then some

833
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Nosy parent or

834
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Teacher discovered that

835
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That was gay days that had lined up with

836
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Gay days and so they canceled

837
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It so I here I was excited to finally go

838
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
To Magic Kingdom like I finally

839
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Get to go and then

840
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Homophobia cancels it they're like

841
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We're not bringing a ton of school kids to gay

842
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Days no no no like

843
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
They cancel it we go to Busch Gardens

844
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Instead which for me

845
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Like I do not like roller

846
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Coasters that are unthemed and it was

847
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Like just it had nothing for

848
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Me it was like you took away the thing

849
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I liked and instead put me in a place where I'm

850
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Incredibly nervous and anxious that somebody's

851
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Going to make me ride a roller coaster that scares me

852
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
As a kid yeah

853
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Oh that's hard so yeah you lose

854
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Disney world you don't get to

855
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And at this point in time

856
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Where are you at on your

857
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm like 10 then so I don't even I'm just

858
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Learning what a gay day is even

859
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Like I suppose this was

860
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Another of those I remember as a little

861
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Kid like or when

862
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I was nine or so I think my mom

863
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Rented Philadelphia on VHS

864
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And I had to ask her like

865
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Well wait why are people mad at Tom Hanks in this

866
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Movie and she had to explain

867
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What AIDS and homophobia was

868
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
To me I didn't understand

869
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So I was this was another of those

870
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Like oh people don't like

871
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Queer people and they don't want to be

872
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
At Disneyland because of that or Disney

873
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
World because and then you don't

874
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Get to go and then I get

875
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Confused about your feelings about all of it

876
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That like now it's like school telling you we're

877
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Not going because it's bad to be this

878
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
What a night what a double nightmare

879
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I can only imagine what a lady

880
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
In the 90s especially thought

881
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That was at Disney yeah

882
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
What a nightmare she thought oh yeah

883
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I mean they I'm sure they thought

884
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Like there's like live sex acts

885
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Happening down Main Street in Magic Kingdom

886
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If you go on gay days at the very

887
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Least it's just like

888
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Everyone is buff and in

889
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Thongs you will walk around

890
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
At least you will not see a shirt

891
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
All day yes at

892
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The least I my

893
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Family ended up at gay days

894
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
In 95 or 96

895
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Because we just happened to be

896
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
There in June and

897
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I don't know I was 10 or 11

898
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And I had no idea

899
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
What to make of it because

900
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah I had seen like

901
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I think I had seen Philadelphia

902
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
At that point because

903
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I was like hey we live by Philadelphia

904
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I want to watch this movie

905
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's going to be a romp

906
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
There will be some song

907
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Like I love LA

908
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Philadelphia city of

909
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Freedom city of cheese steaks

910
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Why isn't

911
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Why isn't the movie about our town

912
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Happier so I

913
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Didn't I didn't really

914
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Know what to make of it

915
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But it was probably a good like

916
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
For you know

917
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
A little 10 year old from the suburbs

918
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Go like oh it's just a big tour group

919
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
They're just doing everything like

920
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We are yeah yeah yeah

921
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It's just gays who like theme

922
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Parks and we're trying to I do think

923
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It was it was done you know

924
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
In opposition to Disney a

925
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Little bit though then when you look at the

926
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
History of like Disney and

927
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Gay stuff in the in the 90s

928
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Let's just say that like they

929
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
They were both trying to

930
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
They had you know Howard

931
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Ashman among many who were

932
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You know these prominent gay men who

933
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Prominent gay men who did major stuff for Disney

934
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
But then also they have

935
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
All of the conservative

936
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Christians back then saying

937
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Oh Disney's trying to make your kids gay

938
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Like and and so Disney's

939
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Trying to they want to like

940
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Still in the early 90s

941
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So yeah they were so

942
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Read old news articles and it's the same

943
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Shit even on the gay days

944
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Wikipedia it says controversy

945
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And I was like what is it and there was like

946
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
One or two sentences about

947
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Like oh the travel

948
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Company was doing the Orlando one

949
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
They ended up canceling the one year because they

950
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Started doing gay days and they didn't want to be

951
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Disrespectful and compete but most

952
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Of the section was about religious

953
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Cranks just being homophobic

954
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah well and also

955
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Like they had in Disney

956
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
In the 90s was one of several

957
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Corporations that did like

958
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You know extending medical

959
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Benefits to partners

960
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
To life partners and so

961
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Just that was a

962
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Talking point of like they're recognizing

963
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
This and they like making a part

964
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Of their business they're hiring these people

965
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Like yeah so Disney

966
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So having gay days

967
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Unofficially there wasn't helping

968
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
If I'm thinking like a

969
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Disney PR person I'm like well this isn't helping

970
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Us not look like

971
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
A bunch of homosexuals

972
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Here having gay days

973
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's like even it feels like

974
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
They're sanctioning it even though

975
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
They don't even though it's not really

976
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It also seems like as years went on it was like

977
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Oh yeah we don't participate

978
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
In this wink wink and then but they

979
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You know of course you organize it

980
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Officially through a Disney person

981
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
At some point but yeah

982
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What a strange thing I mean it's

983
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't know it shows you how far it's

984
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Come that they have a sanctioned event

985
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Anywhere and well and then

986
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Last year even with all of the

987
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
DeSantis stuff with him

988
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You know like using Disney

989
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And queer

990
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
LGBTQ stuff as

991
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
His main talking point like

992
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Gay days was a huge

993
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Like it was getting more pressed last year

994
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Than it had in a while because like wow so

995
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You're still doing this even with DeSantis doing

996
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
All this stuff like are you scared

997
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
To come to Florida for this you know

998
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Destination vacation thing and

999
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And the people they interviewed representing

1000
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The gay days group and planning

1001
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Stuff they're like oh yeah we're not going anywhere

1002
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
They're not going to scare us

1003
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Away and then my funniest

1004
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The funniest one in the clip I saw

1005
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Was this bearded gentleman who was

1006
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Explaining all of the gay

1007
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Day stuff bald in a beard

1008
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And he's like yeah you know I love going to gay days

1009
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Me and a bear group we go down to

1010
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
This and see this stuff and then the

1011
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Reporter goes like now bear

1012
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
What does that mean and then the

1013
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Guy goes like

1014
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Well

1015
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Where's the sharing

1016
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah

1017
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah it's funny that like

1018
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I mean looking back

1019
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Now just how

1020
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The success that DeSantis had

1021
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
With this as a talking point as

1022
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
His primary pillar the way this

1023
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Mobilized the country really shook

1024
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Us up and reminded us of our American

1025
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Value he rode it all the way

1026
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
To maybe

1027
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
A double digit in one

1028
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Election one time primary

1029
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah

1030
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Primaries maybe tops like

1031
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And certainly he's on the short list of the

1032
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
VP right like

1033
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
He's gotta be

1034
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
They aren't saying his name on the news but you know he's in

1035
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Trump's head we got the guy wearing the weird

1036
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Shoe lifts we got the woman

1037
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Who kills dogs they're all still

1038
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
On the VP list

1039
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
No yeah

1040
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The country bear thing I was mentioning

1041
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You can find I think it's

1042
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
On YouTube you'll find it it's I think 2010

1043
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
At the country bear

1044
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Jamboree it was

1045
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's labeled as like huge group of bears

1046
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Like as in the gay

1047
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Community bear group they are

1048
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
They're in the audience watching it and it's

1049
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Them singing along with everything like

1050
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
They love I'm

1051
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Sorry I don't know the names of all the characters

1052
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Like you guys would

1053
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm upset go ahead

1054
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
The guy that turns me on turns me down like they are

1055
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Loving that song like they

1056
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Though based on the audience

1057
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Reaction I think their favorite was Big Al

1058
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm gonna say

1059
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You can watch a video

1060
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Of the like

1061
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Of the response yeah the audience reaction

1062
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Singing along and when Big Al comes up it's like

1063
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Wolf whistles like whoo

1064
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Like yay they were so

1065
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And it was funny at the end of it

1066
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The cast member

1067
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Presenting it was like we thank

1068
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You so much you guys were such

1069
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Big fans thank you we love having

1070
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You guys there like they were being

1071
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Very nice but not

1072
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Not recognizing the level

1073
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Of gay irony to

1074
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
This attendance of country bear

1075
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Jamboree vocalizing the common elements between

1076
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
This excited crowd

1077
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
There is some very good niche

1078
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Programming on gay days

1079
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Of just like yeah bears go to

1080
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Country bear Jamboree

1081
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Women who love women

1082
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Go to this restaurant teen

1083
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Meetup go to this restaurant

1084
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You know and it's all

1085
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's so fun it's so

1086
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Like the gay days look so fun I want to

1087
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Go like now I never win as a

1088
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
As a kid and then I've like

1089
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But I am a real this is

1090
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
After moving to California

1091
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I am so much more a California parks

1092
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Person than an Orlando parks person

1093
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Though maybe it's just like Florida

1094
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Weather reminds me of being like an

1095
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Unhappy teenager and so like

1096
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Just feeling it it makes me unhappy

1097
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
How does this square Jason

1098
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I feel like Florida weather reminds you of

1099
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The happiest you've ever been or will

1100
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Ever be

1101
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Not teenager

1102
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Okay it

1103
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Reminds you of the only times you were happy

1104
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
As a teenager yeah that's true

1105
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Well

1106
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The weather in California and the East Coast

1107
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Had been very similar the last

1108
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Few weeks

1109
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Just less humidity or some

1110
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
More humidity than we used to have

1111
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Due to our changing

1112
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
World

1113
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
No Jason I as a side

1114
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Like your love of Islands of

1115
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Adventure I totally vibe with that

1116
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Because like one of my the first

1117
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Trip my family did to

1118
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Universal was I

1119
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Want to say 94 95

1120
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But it was when the welcome center

1121
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Was there for previewing the

1122
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Stuff and that when I saw

1123
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Like I was excited just to write all the

1124
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You know especially back the future so excited for that

1125
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But when we went that welcome center and saw

1126
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I saw there was a spider-man right there I was

1127
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Like wait when when is this when is this like

1128
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I was and the four years of

1129
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Waiting until that was the longest

1130
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Four years ever sure and

1131
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
This is a brag that only matters on

1132
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
A podcast like this but like I

1133
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
My mom won

1134
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
A radio contest to

1135
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
We got to go to Islands of

1136
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Adventure April 99 we got

1137
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
To go and like preview

1138
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I got to ride spider-man before like

1139
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Anybody and all the other stuff too but

1140
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Sure yeah myself

1141
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Oh and then Jason's seething

1142
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Jealousy is just a subtle tension

1143
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Through the entire rest of the episode

1144
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It just probably whacks the Island

1145
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Skipper tour books

1146
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The spider-man did

1147
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Breakdown a lot that day not on

1148
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Us but it did break down a lot

1149
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It is

1150
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The past being

1151
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
What I feel like people don't remember

1152
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
How much

1153
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Every big new like

1154
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Technological breakthrough ride

1155
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Breaks down a lot

1156
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I remember we were waiting in

1157
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Spider-man's line for like three hours or more

1158
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah

1159
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And even though I love

1160
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Being in the Daily Bugle I'm like

1161
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's starting to even stretch my

1162
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Love of being in the Daily Bugle

1163
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I've read all the file cabinet names

1164
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I've explained to my family

1165
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So much the differences between Ben

1166
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yurick and Charlie Snow and

1167
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Randy Robertson versus Robbie Robertson

1168
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Every member of the Daily Bugle

1169
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Staff I've listed it for them

1170
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's their I'm sure great amusement

1171
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yes I know what every reporter

1172
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Makes I know their yearly salary

1173
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And benefits

1174
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Can I call out

1175
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The thing this is fascinating

1176
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
In a

1177
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You know where things were back then

1178
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You brought up the red shirts

1179
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And that's how everybody identifies each other

1180
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
With these events but I read how

1181
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You know in order to

1182
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Basically back in the 90s

1183
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Disney employees had to

1184
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Be ready with all sizes

1185
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Of white shirts to

1186
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Hand out to regular guests who

1187
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Happen to be wearing red shirts

1188
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That day

1189
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So that you don't dare

1190
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Associate with

1191
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Could not be included in the group

1192
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Wow I had heard that

1193
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
That's amazing

1194
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I mean I know I've gone to a Target

1195
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Wearing a red shirt and going like

1196
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I look like an employee here

1197
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's like blue polo in a Best Buy

1198
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You gotta watch out

1199
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
No that's funny

1200
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
To think of some you know

1201
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Disney family just they're like

1202
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Well we're red today for our big trip

1203
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That's how we won't miss each other and then

1204
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
They realize that somebody whispers

1205
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
In there like that's the gay thing

1206
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Oh no

1207
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And then they just strip

1208
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I'd rather be naked

1209
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Alright sorry kids

1210
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Trip ended in 15 minutes

1211
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
On the Warner tour I did

1212
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
They have a clip package

1213
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Of all the things that were filmed there and

1214
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
They did have a section of it that's like

1215
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Ellen saying like and I love filming

1216
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Here it's great and we all

1217
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Just like snickering to each other

1218
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
She loved it yeah

1219
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It was a great time on the Ellen set

1220
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Famously happy yes

1221
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But yeah well

1222
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It's also come a long way

1223
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Disneyland wise

1224
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Because there's all of the

1225
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Disneyland

1226
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Well first of all that

1227
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I think it's any sort of

1228
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Like

1229
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Private event it started in 78

1230
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I was looking up a lot of it was from

1231
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Diznet.org just to give them

1232
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Credit but in 1978

1233
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
There was a private party organized by somebody

1234
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
named Scott Forbes

1235
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Who was the owner of a gay bar and

1236
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They like they basically did it

1237
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Without saying here's what it is it was like

1238
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
A bunch of restaurants

1239
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Came together booked Disneyland

1240
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Out for a private party which was more common

1241
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Back then and it was set up

1242
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And done before

1243
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Disney without ever any indicator

1244
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That it was like a

1245
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Off the page gay day basically

1246
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So it was set up that way

1247
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
In this sort of like piecemeal way

1248
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And then it was booked and like great alright

1249
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Checks have cleared good now what's this event all about

1250
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And they figured people figured out what it was

1251
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And then there was this like you know

1252
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
In this still somewhat homophobic climate

1253
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Some Disney people are saying

1254
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Wait a minute that can't happen we can't

1255
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Do that there can't be one of those

1256
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And others are saying why not

1257
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And then it's the struggle to like

1258
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Find a reason like well

1259
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It'll be a debaucherous

1260
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Affair won't it

1261
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Why what do you well don't when they

1262
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Get together don't they all

1263
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
What what do you mean what do they do

1264
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's gonna be cleanliness

1265
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That's it that's the issue

1266
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The park will end up too and then

1267
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The next morning some of this is

1268
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Recounted by Bob Gurr that

1269
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
He said the next morning after the party was over

1270
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
The manager was ready for extra clean up work

1271
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Extra it's gonna be extra

1272
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And then our head of custodial came

1273
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And said who were those people they said

1274
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Why what's wrong there's no trash

1275
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
This is the cleanest we've ever had

1276
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
The park

1277
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That's wonderful so this seems like

1278
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
A key moment of like

1279
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh just get in here and I don't know

1280
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
There was no end to that that sentence

1281
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And then and also

1282
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Retail sales were four times

1283
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
What they usually are for a private

1284
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Party so I think from that point on

1285
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Things kind of changed in terms of those

1286
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Relationships well you know

1287
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Another part of that gay history I was reminded

1288
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Of by one of the

1289
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Friends I went with was the

1290
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
The homosexual fast dancing

1291
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
History

1292
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
This phrase

1293
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah which is you know

1294
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm not the Videopolis expert

1295
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Here but yeah when they one of the

1296
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Controversies of Videopolis

1297
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Or Videopolis was that

1298
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Same sex dancing

1299
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Was like prohibited

1300
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
They're like wait boys can't dance

1301
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So even if it is not obviously

1302
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
There are friends who just it's a group

1303
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Of girls dancing together but that would still

1304
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Break the rules and two

1305
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Men were

1306
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Ejected from the park for

1307
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
What was described officially as

1308
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Homosexual fast dancing

1309
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And this I think

1310
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I think that was a freestyled phrase

1311
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
By a security guard that was straight

1312
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Off the dome what a memorable

1313
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That then is used in court

1314
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Proceedings yeah and also told

1315
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
This is a family park we do not put up

1316
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
With alternative lifestyles here

1317
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Put up with ejected

1318
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That's great that's thrown out

1319
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah that is and this is 1980

1320
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Just to put it in the timeline

1321
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It is always insane

1322
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Some of this stuff where it's like

1323
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Hey did you not just think

1324
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
To go down the hallway

1325
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And ask Eric the gay man

1326
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Who works here like so is

1327
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
This a thing is this a thing

1328
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
We should be concerned about

1329
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And he would just go no

1330
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That's a thing you just made up

1331
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I think that was the thing

1332
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You made up a thing to be mad at

1333
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I think in 78 some

1334
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Of the feeling was like well I don't

1335
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Know a bunch of gay people in

1336
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Disneyland and then a lot of employees

1337
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Are like yeah

1338
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Maybe it has always been

1339
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
That way familiar with the creative

1340
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Industries in America

1341
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Well especially like I

1342
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Was really feeling that on pride night of like

1343
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
If you not I'm sure there

1344
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Are lots of heterosexual cast members but

1345
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
If you like are an adult who

1346
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Loves Disney who also is like great at

1347
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Dancing and performing and

1348
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And you want to it's like your dream

1349
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
To work at Disneyland it is possible

1350
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
You are an LGBTQ

1351
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Person like you're not

1352
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
You're likely gay

1353
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And so with that trending

1354
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Towards it like there definitely was a

1355
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Feel of like on the night cast

1356
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Members were really enjoying

1357
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It and feeling like extra

1358
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I felt an extra energy from them

1359
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Getting to perform on pride night

1360
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Watching those videos even it's like

1361
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Everyone seems like in the parades it's very

1362
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Excited which yeah same thing I was

1363
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Saying before we were like I bet

1364
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Even if the corporate over the corporation doing

1365
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Like everyone in the parade is like this is cool

1366
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Like you can feel something there

1367
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I also just to close the loop on

1368
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
This thing I guess I'm realizing that particular

1369
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Thing if it was 1980 then that's pre-videopolis

1370
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But then years down the line

1371
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Basically like they Disney lost

1372
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That and they had to pay the legal fees

1373
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And apologize to

1374
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Those two who got kicked out

1375
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And then

1376
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Like not long after

1377
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
They ejected more people

1378
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I was like wait what happened there was that lawsuit

1379
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Well no that was just that applied to the two of them

1380
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Wait a minute what so you've set up a

1381
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Situation where there are only two

1382
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Men who are allowed to dance you didn't

1383
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Think that was like that like set a precedent

1384
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That you had to follow for no no that was

1385
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
That we gave two men a

1386
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Special ability that no one else has

1387
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And then the policy becomes like

1388
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Okay well no that was about

1389
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Fast dancing slow dancing is still

1390
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
An issue and that came to a head

1391
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
With a different lawsuit

1392
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
In videopolis era

1393
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So it took two rounds

1394
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Of this throughout the whole

1395
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
80s

1396
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I just rewatched the

1397
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Defunct clan video on it

1398
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And his history talks about it a bit

1399
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I think he's like well by that point

1400
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Videopolis was on its way

1401
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Out anyway and so they're like

1402
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
They're like yeah we'll just stop

1403
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
If we're gonna have to allow

1404
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Same-sex dancing let's just have no more

1405
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Dancing let's just kill the thing

1406
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Let's just end it and if this is

1407
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
What it's come to

1408
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
No it's yeah I

1409
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I mean also on the gay days thing too

1410
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Like I think the fun of it

1411
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Or one of their coolest things I saw

1412
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
On their promotion of it like

1413
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
By the gay

1414
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Days representatives is there are

1415
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
There are tons of families

1416
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
With you know two moms two dads

1417
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Like that with with their kids they want

1418
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
To take them to Disneyland and feel

1419
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Welcome instead of having to

1420
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Be like oh well this is I'm

1421
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000

1422
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Uncle or I'm the aunt

1423
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Or whatever I'm her roommate

1424
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
All of these things like you can

1425
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Actually like have fun as a

1426
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
As a family then too like it

1427
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And I have to remind myself that like

1428
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I obviously

1429
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
America is very homophobic very

1430
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Still but that

1431
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
The progress made just in like

1432
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Ten years of just like seeing like

1433
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Like gay parent

1434
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Like gay parents with their kids or also

1435
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Like LGBTQ

1436
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Of like kids and teens

1437
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
At this event being welcome at it like

1438
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That was not my childhood growing

1439
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Up at all and I I'm

1440
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Jealous of these kids on a certain level

1441
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Like like man you you guys

1442
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Not not in like the old man way of like

1443
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I had to go through all this stuff you didn't

1444
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
But just I'm

1445
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Like boy I wish I I wish I had that

1446
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Childhood yeah the chart of like

1447
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
How fast like gay marriage

1448
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Was accepted by at least like sixty or

1449
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Seventy percent of the population I forget what the number is

1450
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But like it goes so fast up

1451
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Like I it is pretty shocking

1452
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Like to go like oh yeah all of a sudden

1453
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Just a couple years this massive

1454
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Change kind of happens yeah it's almost like

1455
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Some of these crazy opinions

1456
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That come down as edicts are

1457
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Minority opinion

1458
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Extremely minority

1459
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
We can look forward to a lot

1460
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
A lot more minority opinions governing

1461
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Everybody yeah

1462
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That was

1463
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Last fall

1464
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
When we went and

1465
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Hit up some of the parks and

1466
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Did our shows in Florida

1467
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
When I was flying back

1468
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
A dawn on me I was like huh

1469
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I didn't talk about

1470
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Politics with anyone

1471
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
The entire week we were in Florida

1472
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Because anyone we met who lived there

1473
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Was just going about

1474
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Their life they were just doing

1475
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Their thing they were just going to work and going

1476
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Home and going to the grocery store

1477
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Like yeah it's

1478
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I met a ton of DeSantis super fans

1479
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I don't know where I don't know what you were doing I guess

1480
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
They were yeah they were they were all at Aventura

1481
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Every time I got in an elevator it was at

1482
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Half like half of the room was DeSantis at our

1483
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Live show I don't know if you noticed that

1484
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
DeSantis supporters that's weird

1485
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
They like when we do

1486
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The impression of him actually though

1487
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Because we actually capture

1488
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
What they like about him he's a foolish figure

1489
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It was all the people in the audience

1490
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
With the very sweaty faces

1491
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
They purposefully make their

1492
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Faces extra sweaty

1493
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
In homage to their king

1494
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
They have a little bottle they keep squirting on

1495
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm getting a little dry

1496
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
The thing I

1497
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Watch for in like how

1498
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Conservative is this like

1499
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Airport I'm going through is

1500
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I count like Punisher t-shirts

1501
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
That's the one like especially in Vegas

1502
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
That's the one I'm like Punisher or

1503
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I guess just like any like

1504
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Iron sights or like Target thing

1505
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But definitely the Punisher shirts which

1506
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Maybe as a comic nerd

1507
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That is why my eyes drawn to like

1508
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
A fellow comic oh wait no

1509
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
That used to be

1510
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Such an easy like

1511
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Comic convention or Islands of

1512
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Adventure Suvid like

1513
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Now the Punisher shirt that on

1514
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
The back says Islands of Adventure

1515
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Like oh that's less of a keep

1516
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I don't think anyone needs

1517
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
That keepsake anymore

1518
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I would think people now think the Punisher logo

1519
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Has always had the blue stripe for

1520
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
The blue stripe

1521
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Oh that was how it was designed in 1971

1522
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Sure

1523
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Stanley approved that in 1971

1524
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You must be a fan of John Romita

1525
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Senior and Ross Andrew

1526
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I had to consult with him

1527
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
It's the first time he's been called John Romita Senior

1528
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
His names mean nothing to me

1529
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I know Scott you're much more

1530
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Of a Steve Ditko guy

1531
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And that's Big Divide or you're a Romita Senior

1532
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
He likes

1533
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Romita Junior though

1534
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
He does like him

1535
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Titan yeah

1536
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I in terms

1537
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Okay well this is we were starting to

1538
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Allude to this area but like

1539
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Performers

1540
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I think really bringing it

1541
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
At pride night this was a big thing

1542
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
This was very much noticed

1543
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Last year this made it out if you were

1544
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Not at the events themselves

1545
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
This really like spread around

1546
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Online Disney fandom and Disney

1547
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
TikTok

1548
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Just like

1549
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Just the suited character performers

1550
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That just like

1551
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And even regardless maybe of like

1552
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Any prior like associations

1553
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Of their sexuality it's just like well

1554
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Part of it is the dancing is

1555
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Just fire it's crazy

1556
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Did you find this to be true?

1557
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Absolutely like that was

1558
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Those videos last year were a big reason

1559
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Of why we wanted to go like if

1560
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It was just regular performers

1561
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And then you know like a rainbow

1562
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Cookie we were like eh we don't need to go to that

1563
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But no it really was like

1564
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
The difference you see in the performers

1565
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Because like yeah they and this year

1566
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Even more like I think they saw the response

1567
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And they pushed it

1568
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Even farther like as

1569
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
In like cause you could totally feel

1570
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
How did they get disapproved?

1571
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Like you I was thinking like

1572
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Okay they got disapproved but not that

1573
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Like they played

1574
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Songs like they played I Will Survive

1575
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
There which you don't normally

1576
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Hear at Disney but there's no

1577
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Swears in it or they played you know

1578
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Shania Twain's Damn I Feel Like a

1579
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Woman except it's the man

1580
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I feel like a woman

1581
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Wait I didn't know that was it damn

1582
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
In the album

1583
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I don't have the full album

1584
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Still the one

1585
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Is the album still the one?

1586
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I don't know the name of the album

1587
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
The performers are feeling

1588
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And this year a huge

1589
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Improvement too was that

1590
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I also think I do think the RuPaul's

1591
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Drag Race has helped like

1592
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Expand what mainstream

1593
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
People view gay culture as in

1594
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Accepting it and there were

1595
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Like straight up drag

1596
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Style outfits on performers

1597
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
In the cavalcade

1598
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Right in the cavalcade they had I believe

1599
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
They didn't have this last year this year

1600
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I believe it was five different

1601
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Women dressed in

1602
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Drag style outfits that

1603
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Were basically it was like this was on Drag

1604
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Race the challenge would have been build

1605
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
A costume based on each of the

1606
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Lands like your frontier land

1607
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Your tomorrow land and they were

1608
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Dressed up as it and they all like they

1609
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Look so great like the Adventureland

1610
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
One was like it was like green

1611
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
With a big orange hairdo

1612
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
To you know

1613
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
The bird the old

1614
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Oh that's cool

1615
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It was great they were all and they were having so much fun

1616
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And the performers in the

1617
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Character costumes really especially

1618
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The queen of

1619
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Disney pride is Clara

1620
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Belcal like she

1621
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
She rules it whoever is

1622
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
In the Clara Belcal

1623
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Mascot costume is a great dancer

1624
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
They know what they are doing

1625
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
With their dance performance that it is like

1626
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
These are moves Clara Belcal does not dance to

1627
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Any other day of the year

1628
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I don't think

1629
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
That really does feel like a

1630
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Like if I had come in and said like

1631
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Oh of course Clara Belcal is a queer

1632
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Icon that would be

1633
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Such a confusing joke

1634
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
But reality no

1635
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
She's awesome she is so

1636
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Fun and she is like the queen of Pride

1637
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Night this is fascinating new mythology

1638
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And really quickly come on over

1639
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
As the album my apologies

1640
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I was very disrespectful to

1641
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Shania to Mutt Lang

1642
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Come on over

1643
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
But not the Christina Aguilera

1644
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Song come on over come on over baby

1645
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
These are unrelated

1646
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Oh and Aguilera was

1647
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Represented there that they played her version

1648
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Of reflection

1649
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
The fireworks the opening

1650
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Welcome fireworks

1651
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Oh that's smart

1652
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Clara Belcal though this is fascinating because

1653
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Clara Belcal is a character I think

1654
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
With no prior

1655
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Facets of any

1656
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Kind and I think it's right I mean

1657
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Like let's all remember something

1658
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
That Clara Belcal did in one of the cartoons

1659
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Or that she's done in the parks

1660
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
This is a pretty like it was a blank

1661
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Canvas and how fun

1662
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
That they use this canvas

1663
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
In this particular way

1664
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
They had a newer suit I think because they had

1665
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Put her in a more recent cartoon

1666
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
She had been back with Horace Horsecaller

1667
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Because I definitely have a photo with the two of them at like

1668
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Thanksgiving we went to at Disneyland Hotel

1669
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
That's awesome like eight or nine years ago whatever

1670
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
So like I feel like she was there but yeah

1671
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I don't know that she had such a

1672
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
There was not that strong personality

1673
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's an implied

1674
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Relationship with or marriage to

1675
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
This is a

1676
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Cow-Horse relationship

1677
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Okay I have a lot of opinions

1678
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Because I had to

1679
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Look I looked this up to confirm it for me

1680
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
To me mentally yes

1681
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Clara Belcal and Horace Horsecaller they are

1682
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
A couple like Mickey and Minnie right

1683
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Clara Bel and Horace they're a couple

1684
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
But because Horace Horsecaller

1685
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Even more than Clara Bel is like not

1686
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
At the parks and have been diminished so much

1687
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
That for branding

1688
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Purposes she is usually they are

1689
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Not officially a couple or anything

1690
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
But she is she is put together

1691
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
With Goofy yes it is Goofy

1692
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And her I'm you know I just Google

1693
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Image her she almost like you almost

1694
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Could just map Goofy's face on

1695
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
To her yeah they work as a pair

1696
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
But to me Goofy is a single

1697
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Father of Max

1698
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
He's not with Clara Bel or he's

1699
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Dating like another dog person

1700
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Like the his girlfriend in the

1701
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Extremely Goofy movie like

1702
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
He's and he's stealing Horace's gal

1703
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
In and by getting with

1704
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Clara Bel like also Clara Bel can be an

1705
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Independent single woman she does not need to be

1706
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Defined by dating a guy

1707
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Well it's unfortunate that Horace never

1708
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Like manned up like they were

1709
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
In a situationship for so

1710
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Long so Goofy

1711
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Goofy was going to step in

1712
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You know and then other certain

1713
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Continuities his wife is

1714
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Dead there are multiple Goofy

1715
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Storyline like I need this

1716
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I've been sad for years

1717
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I'm so lonely to start

1718
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Over now that Max is

1719
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Out of the house

1720
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I got nobody he yuck

1721
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
My yucks are sad

1722
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Don't look at them

1723
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Yeah I found yeah

1724
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
On one of the videos I found a picture of the two of them

1725
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And I went oh interesting okay

1726
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
At the good night

1727
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Wave good night on the steps thing

1728
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And Clara Bel

1729
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
My husband shared me a picture of it we were

1730
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
At a different area

1731
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
So we missed the good nights at 12.45

1732
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
He showed me the video of like when Clara Bel

1733
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Got there to wave good night chance

1734
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Clara Bel Clara Bel

1735
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And she's like

1736
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Bashful doing the bashful

1737
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
But then Goofy is like

1738
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Like comforting her like it's

1739
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Yeah yeah you like almost like it

1740
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You deserve it and I was just like oh it shouldn't be

1741
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Goofy doing this it should be Horace

1742
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Was Horace nowhere to be found?

1743
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I didn't see him anywhere he was not listed

1744
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
On the character list or anything

1745
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Do they even have that suit?

1746
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I told you they did I met him

1747
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
But they are using it today I see

1748
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I see

1749
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Last year from the videos Clara Bel was just like

1750
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
In the mix but this year

1751
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
On the cavalcade she

1752
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Was presented as like she was

1753
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Santa Claus at the end of the Macy's parade

1754
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Like she was the last one

1755
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And like and Clara Bel like they

1756
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Didn't have Mickey's in the middle of

1757
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
The parade waving at people like Clara

1758
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Bel is at the end because they know

1759
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Everybody loves her

1760
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
This is like a populous movement this is

1761
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Like People's Joker this is like

1762
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Fully just done like a

1763
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Grassroots that it's like

1764
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I don't know

1765
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
How it happened last year but does it not

1766
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
See I don't think that there were meetings

1767
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
In Disney about like

1768
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
We're pushing Clara Bel

1769
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
We need to get a great dancer for Clara Bel

1770
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I feel like whoever was Clara Bel was

1771
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Just like this is my night

1772
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I feel like somebody who's

1773
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I think anonymous

1774
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Made it happen that's just a guess

1775
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And if that is what happened that's really cool

1776
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I wonder could we get the name could somebody out in the

1777
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Audience give us the name

1778
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And would they get in trouble if the name

1779
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I wonder if Disney policy just in general like

1780
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Would that be bad? This is like how onion writers

1781
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Don't get the credit

1782
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You just have to live you have to have the

1783
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Satisfaction if you know that you did it because I would love

1784
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
To know but is it yeah

1785
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Is it like a met where like the

1786
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Audience is just so into it and

1787
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Then backstage or like

1788
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It's like in wrestling where like an audience

1789
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Will hone in on

1790
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
A specific wrestler backstage or like

1791
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
The movement of the crowd sometimes

1792
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
If the crowd is certainly up in a certain

1793
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Mood they could just like buoy somebody

1794
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah on a night I do

1795
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Think I I know that

1796
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Wrestling stuff too you have

1797
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Like one you pick out one guy like oh

1798
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
We all love Zack Ryder tonight or whatever

1799
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Yeah like

1800
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
We love him every night yes

1801
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Matt Cardona yes we love him yeah but

1802
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
But I do think for

1803
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Claire Belkow there was a feeling of like

1804
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
She never gets a spotlight she is

1805
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Kind of like the odd duck of

1806
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
The group yeah you know she's got her

1807
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
She is her character is like you look

1808
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
At her giant shoes like she is supposed to be

1809
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Awkward like goofy too and

1810
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
She's she is kind of like

1811
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Or like from Archie comics

1812
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
They have a similar thing with Ethel

1813
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
The girl normally coupled

1814
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
With Jughead that she's supposed to be

1815
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Like the awkward girl with big teeth and everything

1816
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And like she

1817
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Was supposed to be like this is the

1818
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Ugly girl like in quotes

1819
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
That's the and so when you have that kind of history

1820
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Then the gay fans

1821
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Are like oh no we love you like

1822
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You know nobody loves you enough we

1823
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Love you like there's that that feels

1824
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Like a very like traditional like

1825
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Just gay tradition

1826
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Of you know we lifting someone up yeah

1827
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Uplifting the the misfit of the

1828
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Group who even though Claire Belkow

1829
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Is nominally a straight woman

1830
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
As far as like if we're if we're guessing

1831
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
At the sexuality of the Disney characters

1832
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
A heterosexual cow with

1833
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
A relationship with a heterosexual horse

1834
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
As far as it had been taken

1835
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Minnie is bi

1836
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
This is eight years ago Thanksgiving

1837
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
There's the new or horse horse collar

1838
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Outfit. He's kind of scary. Yeah he is

1839
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And I would say that Claire Belkow

1840
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Is a little bit like kind of

1841
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
It's not the best photo of her either

1842
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Stiffer, weird. Oh yeah

1843
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
They've like friend lead her up

1844
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I feel like in animation

1845
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Sometimes people hone in on it cause each

1846
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Each of them have

1847
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Interesting character designs

1848
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And that can be enough to buoy

1849
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Something I was saying as we're guessing

1850
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
About other characters. Minnie is bi

1851
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And she should not be bringing

1852
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Her straight boyfriend Mickey

1853
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Okay this is a discourse

1854
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Going around. Mickey should stay

1855
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Home. Yeah. He should not go to

1856
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Chapel Rowan shows. He should

1857
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Not go to Disneyland after

1858
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Dark Pride night. You don't want

1859
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
We don't want Mickey there at all? No one

1860
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Mickey no. Back of the line Mickey

1861
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
This is what 19 year olds are

1862
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Man about on Twitter. You get

1863
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Every other night Mickey

1864
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I own the place okay

1865
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I'm not allowed

1866
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
In my own living room

1867
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Well that's

1868
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You know the no kink at pride stuff

1869
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
That's why Horace isn't there. His horse collar

1870
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Is seen as kinking

1871
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I never knew the collar

1872
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Was kinked. He won't take the

1873
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Collar off. He refuses

1874
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Yeah I mean

1875
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
He shouldn't. I agree

1876
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
The last cool Claire Belkow thing though

1877
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
We didn't get to see her waving good night

1878
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
The rest of the group and getting her flowers but

1879
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Based on the timing it must have been

1880
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Right afterwards they walk her

1881
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Through there's the final people at

1882
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
1am we're there at like 12 55

1883
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
1am they're clearing out and there's the

1884
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
DJ on Rivers of America

1885
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Right in front of the entrance to

1886
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Pirates and he's playing his last

1887
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Songs and when he starts

1888
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Up a dance club remix

1889
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Of when you wish

1890
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Upon a star like this dance remix

1891
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Then Claire Belkow comes in

1892
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And like actually I've got to show you guys

1893
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
The picture if we're showing pictures here

1894
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
My husband sees Claire Belkow

1895
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Walking towards here to get

1896
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
To do her dancing and so we

1897
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Stop her for just a second and like that's me

1898
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
With Claire Belkow. You got a moment

1899
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
The excitement on my face that's the most

1900
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Excited I was all night. Oh my god Claire Belkow

1901
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And then she

1902
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Danced to the full remix

1903
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Of when you wish upon a star

1904
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And the brilliant

1905
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Person who ever was working there

1906
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
In charge of this. At the DJ booth

1907
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
They had a spotlight. They shined a

1908
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Spotlight on her as we're encircling

1909
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Her and then a spotlight on her halfway

1910
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Through the song and she's dancing to

1911
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
The song and it's just amazing

1912
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
She does the full dance routine and then

1913
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Heads off for the night so that was like our last

1914
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Big moment. It was so

1915
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Great. That is like a magical moment

1916
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Really. It really was. This is one

1917
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Of the cooler. I would say

1918
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
The last few years have been fraught with

1919
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Not fraught. I feel fine about it

1920
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But there's been a lot of Disney parks

1921
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Complaints from us. Oh sure.

1922
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I'm hearing all this. I'm like this is

1923
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Some of the coolest Disney parks

1924
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Stuff in a minute. Yeah. Because

1925
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It does feel so like

1926
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Populist and so like a new

1927
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Generation taking over the mythology

1928
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And like doing something new with it

1929
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It felt like natural. I feel

1930
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
If they

1931
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
It's gonna be a hard line with

1932
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Disney I think for how

1933
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Much they embrace it or not because

1934
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
If it gets too corporate then it

1935
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Maybe this is also my wrestling sensibility of like

1936
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Oh wait this is what the

1937
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Booker wants now? I don't know anymore

1938
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
You start turning on it

1939
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
If it starts to feel

1940
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Unnatural and not organic from

1941
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
The fans but I would

1942
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I would love Clarabelle to get like

1943
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
She's the gay icon of the

1944
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Of the main characters

1945
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Of the Disney family

1946
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Instead of just being like we need a

1947
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Third girl in this picture we've got Daisy

1948
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And Minnie but a third character

1949
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Who else is girl?

1950
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Do we have another one?

1951
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I don't remember. Does girl exist?

1952
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
More? Does more girl exist?

1953
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It's like how in Looney Tunes stuff you only see

1954
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Petunia Pig when they need like some

1955
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
We have to have one other girl right?

1956
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
What do we got here?

1957
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Let me bring up another

1958
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I mean I think this occurred

1959
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Last year but it seemed more

1960
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Prominent this year and this is something that you mentioned Mike

1961
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I feel like

1962
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
In terms of virality this time

1963
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Around Stitch

1964
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
There's been some Stitch stuff

1965
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Stitch has a

1966
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Leather costume

1967
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Which I feel like I've seen in other

1968
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Media. He wears it somewhere

1969
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Yes. It's not completely invented

1970
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
For this. But it lines up nicely

1971
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
But it does line up nicely

1972
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Specifically I think it's

1973
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
The hat and jacket that Marlon

1974
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Brando wears in the movie

1975
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
The Wild One

1976
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Which is if you don't just for the

1977
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
List it's kind of the precursor to the bike

1978
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Riders. Just to put it in

1979
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Current pop culture. There wouldn't have been bike

1980
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Riders without the Wild One. I can't

1981
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Believe that's the name of that movie

1982
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Branding wise

1983
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I thought it

1984
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Was about a bunch of teens

1985
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Who rode bikes around their neighborhood

1986
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And then I found out it's a greaser movie

1987
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I did right before I came here

1988
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Saw a clip of

1989
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
The promotional tour

1990
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And they had a bunch of

1991
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Motorcycles on an all white sound stage

1992
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And I think they gave the cast disposable

1993
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Cameras and they were just kind of

1994
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
In slow motion goofing

1995
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Around the motorcycles

1996
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And I was like I don't think

1997
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
This is the tone of this movie

1998
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm confused

1999
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
That's a great viral stunt

2000
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But you know just like The Outsiders every generation

2001
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Needs their like

2002
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Homoerotic-ish

2003
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Like 50's biker movies

2004
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Sure yeah and The Outsiders I believe

2005
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Just won the Tony the musical version

2006
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Produced by

2007
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Angelina Jolie I think

2008
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Wow I had to say that

2009
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
You say that in a bunch of bike guys

2010
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
What? Homoerotic

2011
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
What? What do you mean?

2012
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
That never occurred to me

2013
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
But no if I had to say

2014
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
If it wasn't for Clarabel Stitch would be

2015
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Number one of the night for us

2016
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Oh so you had a Stitch

2017
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Encounter then

2018
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
My husband

2019
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Loves Stitch

2020
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Loves Stitch so much like he is a gay

2021
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Icon to us too like I think he's

2022
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
His gay popularity has felt

2023
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Like a long time

2024
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
For him because I think it's

2025
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
A mix of things one the Hawaii

2026
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Setting like is like Hawaii

2027
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Hawaii was one of the first American

2028
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
US states to legalize gay

2029
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Marriage, marriage equality I should

2030
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Say so there's that

2031
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Stitch is he's a weird

2032
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Little monster with his own like

2033
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Found family kind of thing

2034
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
So like I think that is also attractive

2035
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
And on top of that one of the two directors

2036
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Dean Dubois is

2037
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
An openly gay man of the

2038
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Leone Stitch movie so you have

2039
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You have all that in the mix I think that makes

2040
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Stitch have a lot

2041
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Of gay fans I think

2042
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Wow huh so

2043
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Stitch at the last

2044
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Last year and this year it's listed on

2045
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
The events here as the Ohana

2046
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Family dance party

2047
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And it's a great

2048
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Setup they have this DJ there

2049
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Who is really having a good time he's

2050
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Keeping the energy up the whole time like the

2051
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
The dance performers are sorry

2052
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
The costume performers they cycle in

2053
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And out like for about 30 minutes each or so

2054
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
He was doing it the whole

2055
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Night from 9.30 to 1

2056
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
The whole time

2057
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Stitch was? No no the

2058
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
The DJ partnered with Stitch they

2059
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
There's a new well I'm sure it was the

2060
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Same Stitch every time but

2061
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
No there was time for a new Stitch

2062
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Performer to cycle out every like 20

2063
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
30 minutes but the DJ

2064
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Was spinning tracks and dancing around the

2065
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Whole time and getting the energy up and

2066
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
DJ Tetris

2067
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Is that right? I have the

2068
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Undercovertourist.com

2069
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I haven't seen DJ Tetris

2070
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
It names DJ Tetris

2071
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Now that could have been last year could have been a different

2072
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
There's the one DJ I know at Disney is DJ

2073
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Wendy Walker who does a lot of the

2074
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Different things and we've seen her a million times

2075
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
At different like she's DJed

2076
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Everywhere and only after I was around

2077
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
We ever went to was that like 80s night and she

2078
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Was there too so I wonder if she was doing something

2079
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I'm sure she was I just don't know where

2080
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
DJ Tetris that sounds right

2081
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
He was he was great it was at the Tomorrowland

2082
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Terrace so right by the

2083
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Galactic Grill

2084
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Which is where I had like colorful

2085
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Churros I will say they gotta

2086
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Get their food stuff figured

2087
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Out next year because this happened last

2088
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Year it happened this year not that

2089
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
They ran out of all themed food but

2090
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
They had three things that were literally like a rainbow

2091
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
They had a rainbow trifle

2092
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
At Jolly Holiday I want to say

2093
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
They had they had a rainbow just

2094
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Slice cake at another one

2095
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And they had

2096
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Oh and they had like

2097
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
A rainbow churro thing they all sold out

2098
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Immediately like you could if you didn't mobile

2099
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Order it at nine o'clock on the dot you were

2100
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Not eating any of this stuff

2101
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Oh jeez

2102
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I saw they had switched the gray stuff

2103
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
To the rainbow stuff

2104
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
The rainbow stuff gone immediately

2105
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
That sold out really quickly

2106
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
From what I was reading

2107
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Gray stuff is kind of good too so I bet rainbow

2108
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Which I don't get why how do they not get

2109
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
This is the second year and the

2110
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Second night of the second year and

2111
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The tickets for the event sold out

2112
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Immediately like we were lucky we have an

2113
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Annual pass friend who bought our tickets

2114
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
On the early annual pass window

2115
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And when it sells out

2116
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
That fast how do you not make

2117
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Enough rainbow stuff

2118
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
To at least last till ten

2119
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Like how do you not make it

2120
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
It's literally called stuff

2121
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Like you're making it in vats

2122
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
But yeah the Ohana dance

2123
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Party was really great

2124
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Because I think too they

2125
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
There is a general sense for Disney

2126
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I think when they're like well if we don't have

2127
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
A gay or queer character

2128
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
If the story is

2129
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
We're one family

2130
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Everybody's a family

2131
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
If that's the message that's gay enough

2132
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So that makes Ohana

2133
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
We round that up to gay

2134
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
And so he started in his Elvis

2135
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Costume dancing to songs

2136
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Even some current stuff and also

2137
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Brittany danced to Toxic and then

2138
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
And then this

2139
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
This is me guessing at why

2140
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
They programmed it but then Angel

2141
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Comes out Angel the Stitch's

2142
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Girlfriend and that to me didn't feel like

2143
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That Disney was trying to say Stitch is not gay

2144
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Here's his girlfriend Angel right here

2145
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And they

2146
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Angel get booed

2147
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Some of her characters are allies

2148
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Throwing stuff at Angel

2149
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
So and then Angel dances

2150
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Some and it's fun and she's you know a big

2151
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Pink character that's fun to see on gay

2152
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Night and so starts in Elvis

2153
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Angel comes in and then

2154
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
After Angel dances then

2155
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Back comes out Stitch and that is

2156
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
When he's in his biker outfit

2157
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Which we called Stitch of Finland

2158
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
But yes I definitely

2159
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Think that the planners

2160
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Looked at here's all our Stitch

2161
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Costumes these are approved to walk around

2162
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
The park it's already been signed off on so we

2163
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Don't have to get new permission and there just

2164
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Happens to be one who looks like a gay 50s

2165
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Biker so let's have him come

2166
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Out and dance to stuff and

2167
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Yeah it but this was

2168
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
The darkest point for me at the night though

2169
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Because I missed

2170
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I came back I my husband

2171
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Stayed at the Ohana dance party for like

2172
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Two hours that was his main thing

2173
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
He wanted to see he wanted to see every dance

2174
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
But he told me oh if you want to see something

2175
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You can go but I'll tell you what I saw in a sec

2176
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
But before I did that when I

2177
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Left I didn't come back

2178
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And he tells me he's texting me like

2179
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
If you can get back here right now get right now

2180
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I get like five minutes after that

2181
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And he's like oh you missed him dancing

2182
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
To eye to eye from

2183
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I was like oh that burned

2184
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
That burns to miss eye to eye

2185
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
But when I got there

2186
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
He it was the gayest

2187
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Moment of it I would say because it was

2188
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Stitch of Finland dancing to

2189
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I will survive

2190
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Okay yeah yeah

2191
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I was like okay this only has gay connotations

2192
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
The clip that went viral

2193
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Was him dancing to Rush by Troye Sivan

2194
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Yes yeah my husband got a

2195
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Footage of that too the dance

2196
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Which I learned that Troye did you know

2197
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
That Troye Sivan was a child actor

2198
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Didn't I send this to you that he was little Wolverine

2199
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
He's little Wolverine

2200
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Wolverine origins

2201
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Wolverine oh that's fascinating

2202
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Since he's so successful I don't feel bad making

2203
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Fun of a child actor now but like his

2204
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I felt so bad from rewatching the scene

2205
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Of like when his claws pop out and he has to

2206
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Like look up to the camera go no

2207
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
It's really funny it's so bad

2208
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I have a little bit of a proposition

2209
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
You know we haven't

2210
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Brought this up yet

2211
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Was all this Stitch talk but we are

2212
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Graced as always

2213
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
By one of the great Stitch

2214
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Impersonators

2215
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Mr. Jason Sheridan

2216
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Is Stitch in the room with us right now

2217
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Can we speak to Stitch

2218
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I've just messaged you

2219
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
The lyrics to Troye

2220
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Sivan's Rush

2221
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Do you think you might be able to grace us

2222
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I'm so sorry I am not familiar

2223
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Oh I don't know the melody

2224
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
No I think this is a

2225
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I think this is a spoken word piece

2226
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I know the melody because I listen but Jason

2227
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Just spoken word I think is the best way to do it

2228
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Because last time you just said you'd heard of

2229
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Troye Sivan so you've gone further

2230
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I like the album a lot

2231
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
How about it

2232
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I didn't say I'm just saying I thought

2233
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
No let me say it Mike

2234
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
It's very hip

2235
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Jason I think any part of it

2236
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I think anything that strikes

2237
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I'll just do

2238
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Chorus

2239
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
That seems to repeat

2240
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I feel the rush

2241
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Addicted to

2242
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Your touch

2243
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I feel the rush

2244
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
It's so good

2245
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I feel the rush

2246
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Addicted to your touch

2247
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Ohana means family

2248
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Wait how did that get in there

2249
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
That was great

2250
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Can I maybe ask

2251
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Me verse 2

2252
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Oh sure

2253
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Here we go

2254
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Past your board in the heat wave

2255
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Recreate the sun

2256
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Take me to your feeling boy

2257
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
You know the one

2258
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Kiss it when you're done man

2259
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
This shit is so much fun

2260
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Pocket rocket gun

2261
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Well now I'm intrigued

2262
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
When I first heard

2263
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
That song I thought the line was

2264
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I feel the rush

2265
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Addicted to your touch

2266
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Which is a better rhyme with rush

2267
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
But it was not the line it's touch

2268
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Wait it's not better

2269
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Rush touch it's worse

2270
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
It's spelled the same

2271
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
But it's just a little different

2272
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
You think it's a better line though than touch

2273
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
It might be a better line

2274
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Rush touch is a better rhyme

2275
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It's better for me and I think it's better

2276
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
A better line

2277
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And by the way there's no more hip way

2278
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
To say butt than tush

2279
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Well I thought it was funny that you were saying tush

2280
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Wow 2024

2281
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
We're bringing tush back

2282
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Which we should do on this show

2283
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
You know what I'm the first one

2284
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
To say I'm done with seats

2285
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
We're calling it tush

2286
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Tush is the new seat

2287
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Fine

2288
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
The thing that made me miss eye to eye though was that

2289
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
The one list on characters I wanted

2290
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
To see was

2291
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
In Galaxy's Edge

2292
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
C-3PO was going to be there

2293
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And I was like well this is the closest to a gay

2294
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Thing for Star Wars

2295
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
And I wish it was at Star Tours

2296
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
But it was at Galaxy's Edge

2297
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
And it was empty Galaxy's Edge

2298
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Because nothing was running

2299
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Most of the rides were closed down

2300
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Only the big oldies

2301
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Were like Space Mountain Star Tours

2302
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
But the new stuff not running

2303
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Rise was not running

2304
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Was Millennium Falcon running?

2305
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Well okay but in Ogas you could walk in

2306
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Ogas was a walk in

2307
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And you probably could have gotten just a seat at any time

2308
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
How empty Galaxy's Edge

2309
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Completely empty except for the few

2310
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
People who were there to get pictures were like

2311
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
The Mandalorian and Grogu were also

2312
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Walking around and this is when I learned

2313
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I don't know if you guys have ever been told this in

2314
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Galaxy's Edge with trying to meet a

2315
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Character there but when

2316
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
C-3PO came out we were looking

2317
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
At the cast member of like

2318
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So where's the line cause that's how everything

2319
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Was aligned this night and the cast member said

2320
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
There's no lines in Galaxy's Edge

2321
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So just you know when you can get in there

2322
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And I was like there's no lines at Galaxy's Edge

2323
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
For character meets so it was just

2324
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
You just kind of had to like shove past

2325
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Like I feel like it's my turn

2326
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
This person got their time with 3PO

2327
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
So I'll get my picture with them like so

2328
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
But yeah it was just it was a free for all

2329
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
It's just kind of a happening there

2330
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
That happens when Chewbacca comes out

2331
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
And you just turn around and Chewbacca's

2332
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Right there like giving you a hug

2333
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Also it's irritating to me

2334
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
That that suit is

2335
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Just sitting backstage at Disneyland

2336
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
And he doesn't come out during

2337
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
The regular day ever

2338
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
They have it it's just sitting right back there

2339
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Bring them out! It's a perfect

2340
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
3PO costume like

2341
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Which you'd want to see

2342
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Cause then it's really reflecting everything

2343
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Around you they also really

2344
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Should dye the Chewie suit rainbow colors

2345
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
There was that Christmas toy they made of a wookie

2346
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I think that was like Christmas colors

2347
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Oh really?

2348
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
There was a life day robe

2349
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Christmas ornament

2350
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah I think there was actually a dyed

2351
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
For a man I just remembered

2352
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
But of course they can't have too much fun at Galaxy's Edge

2353
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Can't have too much fun

2354
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
It's not about fun

2355
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I do have a list of the characters

2356
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And when you look at Galaxy's Edge it is funny

2357
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Cause it's like Mandalorian Grogu

2358
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Ah Ahsoka

2359
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Okay yeah they have television show

2360
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
See 3PO

2361
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Yeah

2362
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
That's the closest to recognizing

2363
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
This is the game though my friends I was with

2364
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
They were like well then it should be R2 with him

2365
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It should be the gay couple

2366
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
But no it was just 3PO

2367
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
By himself

2368
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And yeah

2369
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I was very happy to see 3PO there

2370
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
And he was by the garage

2371
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Where the land speeder is and everything

2372
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
So also he's like

2373
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Behind the gate too

2374
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And of course he only says canned phrases

2375
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Like the guy ahead of me

2376
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Did say a funny thing like

2377
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Well it looks like you just had an oil bath 3PO

2378
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
You're looking great and he's like yes thank you

2379
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I think is the canned reply

2380
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
That can apply to anything

2381
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Do you think he was ever

2382
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Do you think he ever had eyes for BB8

2383
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
In that run in the time when R2D2

2384
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Was like under the sheet

2385
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
For most of the first movie

2386
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
For most of the movie

2387
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
He was too sad to run

2388
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
That's right 3PO

2389
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
He'll never know

2390
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
He can't wait a decade for R2D2

2391
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
To wake up like he's got a life to live

2392
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Frankly I don't know when this is going to happen

2393
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
The second he's back I'm back with it

2394
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Another situation shit

2395
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Maybe that's why 3PO got his red arm

2396
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
He was trying to dress up

2397
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Oh yeah very good point

2398
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I had a question about specific

2399
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Characters

2400
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Did you meet

2401
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
This is one of the most specific characters

2402
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
That's been brought out in the parks

2403
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
But it has storyline that makes sense

2404
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Ethan clad from strange world

2405
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Yeah okay

2406
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Let's talk about Ethan

2407
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
So strange world is a movie

2408
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I haven't seen either I don't think many people have

2409
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
But he is

2410
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
They made it very

2411
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Tough to see or to know it existed

2412
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Pretty well reviewed

2413
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
From what I read about it

2414
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Visually looks very nice

2415
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
But Ethan is officially one of the

2416
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
There's a joke that there's always

2417
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
The first gay Disney character they've promoted that

2418
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Like a dozen times

2419
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
But he is canonically a gay man

2420
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
In the movies

2421
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I believe it is a step

2422
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Higher than

2423
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Two women hugged each other in the background

2424
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Of Rise of Skywalker that's the first gay

2425
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Star Wars character

2426
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
So he's there

2427
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Also this was in Tomorrowland

2428
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
This is where they put all the canonically gay

2429
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Adult characters

2430
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
And these characters are not

2431
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Princessy characters they were in Tomorrowland

2432
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
He was there as was

2433
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Fastos everybody knows Fastos right?

2434
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Fastos

2435
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
From the eternal

2436
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
He was

2437
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Brian Tyree Henry's character

2438
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
And he was also the first

2439
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Major gay Marvel hero

2440
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
He has a husband in the movie they kiss on screen

2441
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Which you don't see in many Marvel movies

2442
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
It was a very intentional move in that

2443
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Movie because they're like this always gets

2444
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Cut out of Marvel movies or they're always

2445
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Scared of having a gay thing for international

2446
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
They always hide behind like well international

2447
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Audience is a little scared so

2448
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
But Fastos is gay in it and so

2449
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
But also Fastos takes responsibility

2450
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
For like the bombing of Hiroshima in the movie

2451
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Which is kind of a doubter with the first gay

2452
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Marvel character like yeah

2453
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
So there's pluses and minuses to

2454
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Fastos there's good things and bad things

2455
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Very confused cause like

2456
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Oh Brian Tyree

2457
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Henry

2458
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Brian Tyree am I getting the name right?

2459
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I think that's it right yeah

2460
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
He's a very good actor

2461
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Chewookie Young White

2462
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Who is the voice of Ethan

2463
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Clad very funny guy

2464
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
But yeah there's

2465
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Some of these characters

2466
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
These movies you're like wait when did

2467
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Yeah that did come out

2468
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And the third of the canonically queer

2469
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Characters there for the photo op in Tomorrowland

2470
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Was America Chavez

2471
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
From

2472
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I do remember America Chavez

2473
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Yes Multiverse of Madness

2474
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
America Chavez is a canonically

2475
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Gay character queer character

2476
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
In the Marvel comics

2477
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
They put her in the movie and the extent

2478
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Of her queerness in that movie is

2479
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
If you look really closely she has on

2480
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
A rainbow pin on her jacket

2481
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And she also does have

2482
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Two moms in the movie just like in

2483
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
The comics but you see your two moms

2484
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
For five seconds and then they die on screen

2485
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
In the movie that's the extent

2486
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
This is what

2487
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I've been saying Disney

2488
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
What Disney has done in the last

2489
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Five ten years is they've pioneered the

2490
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Subliminal gay kiss

2491
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
The gay kiss where the shot

2492
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Is faster than the speed of sound

2493
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And you need

2494
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
To load the characters with some of the most

2495
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Upsetting trauma

2496
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Imaginable

2497
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Responsible for Rochma

2498
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Your moms definitely died

2499
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
We showed them dying on camera more than your

2500
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Pin on camera

2501
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
These two women are part of a montage showing how

2502
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Lightyear was foolish with time

2503
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
How he let his whole life

2504
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Pass him by I think there were two women in there

2505
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
So I don't think about it we're moving on

2506
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Forget it it's in the past

2507
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
But Ethan he is this

2508
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Interesting thing of like well

2509
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
As far as characters are going to have there

2510
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
They either have to be canonically

2511
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Queer or it's

2512
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Mickey and pals wearing rainbows

2513
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Or it's evil queens

2514
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Those are the three like they had the villainous

2515
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Is there like they had the

2516
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Queen of hearts the evil

2517
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Queen from Snow White Maleficent

2518
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Of course Maleficent like you can see her having

2519
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
A big gay fandom but

2520
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
The queen of hearts she was great

2521
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
We this was another of our silly photo

2522
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Ops they you know the

2523
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
The stationary teacup outside of

2524
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
The teacups right

2525
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
They had for photo ops

2526
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
They put a little sign above it that says like hashtag

2527
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Spill the tea

2528
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
So we're like well we gotta

2529
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Get a picture in this stupid thing

2530
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Once again Disney with the

2531
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Phrase ology of 2018

2532
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
But then when we sat in it then we heard

2533
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Somebody like shouting and we're like whoa what's going on

2534
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
But it was the queen of

2535
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Hearts screaming like get out of my way

2536
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I need to get to wonderland

2537
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
That's cool

2538
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
She was a face character that night she was

2539
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Really having fun

2540
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So the evil queens were having a good

2541
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Time though yeah the official

2542
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Gay characters of Tomorrowland like Ethan

2543
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And Festos they were just very much

2544
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Like yeah you know I'm just

2545
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Here and let me name my

2546
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Male partner character from the movie

2547
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And so you know that I'm gay

2548
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And hey isn't this nice get a picture with me

2549
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Like yeah it was just a casual chat

2550
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
With Festos but though

2551
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Another queer friend of mine pointed out

2552
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Like you know where was

2553
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Mulan in this if we're gonna have

2554
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Like you know they're gonna play reflection or where's

2555
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Loki who is a gender fluid

2556
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Character in a magical

2557
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Sense like where's where's Loki who's

2558
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I don't know about MCU

2559
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Loki how queer he was I didn't

2560
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Watch season two but I feel like he

2561
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Is written to not not to be straight

2562
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
But I mean he's he has that like magical

2563
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
God thing like of all gods

2564
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Are queer anyway I don't think a heterosexual

2565
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
God seems weird to me of like

2566
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
All the Greek gods fucked each other right

2567
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I think so

2568
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
But yeah where was

2569
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Loki where was where why was

2570
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Mulan represented there

2571
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Or or the big one I was

2572
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Like wait shouldn't Timon and Pumbaa be here

2573
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Like come on like or

2574
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
At least Timon like but that

2575
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
That felt like the line for Disney

2576
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
That they're like well we don't want like

2577
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Mulan a princess here

2578
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
To represent it though though I will

2579
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Take you know step that back a little bit because

2580
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
They did have a frozen section

2581
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
They did have Elsa

2582
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Olaf

2583
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Kristen Bell's character

2584
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Anna

2585
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Anna Elsa Anna

2586
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Olaf and then

2587
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
The another blink and you're missing

2588
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
This guy technically is gay character

2589
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
The owner of the

2590
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
The

2591
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Bath house or steam room the

2592
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I'm saying bath house

2593
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
The bath house in frozen

2594
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
No it's the remember in the middle of frozen

2595
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Where they they stop over the guys like he's

2596
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Selling stuff they're like a rest stop

2597
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Yeah yeah yeah yeah that guy

2598
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Yes yeah he's he's there

2599
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
And in the background of that shot

2600
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
It's him with a with what seems

2601
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
To be his husband in a photograph so

2602
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Technically a gay

2603
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Character

2604
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So he's there for

2605
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
He was there for photo ops too so

2606
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
You're like person the logic

2607
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
All night of who's there and why

2608
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
And you're like somewhat satisfied

2609
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
But like

2610
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Could be more I mean maybe this is the progress

2611
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
That's made over the you know we're only

2612
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
In year two of this but maybe by year ten

2613
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
And beyond we're just we're

2614
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Kind of fully identifying

2615
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
A lot more characters yeah

2616
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I know there was I also

2617
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
On there was another one I wrote down

2618
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Like oh this is where they felt like they were really

2619
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Stretching their Disney history of like

2620
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I notice this anytime I watch those

2621
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Documentaries on the history

2622
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Disney on the official one on Disney plus

2623
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Which usually have been taken down for tax purposes

2624
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
You can't even watch them now but

2625
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
They always have to even when it's a Marvel

2626
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Thing that Walt Disney had not one thing to do

2627
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
With they have to show a clip of like

2628
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
And Walt Disney also sort of felt

2629
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
This way about things like

2630
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Like are in the star I remember

2631
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
On the star tours one they did

2632
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
They have to start with George Lucas

2633
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Actually was there the first week of Disneyland's

2634
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Opening as a kid he went there I was like

2635
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
So this is how it connects to Walt Disney

2636
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And so at the start

2637
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Of the big fireworks

2638
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
At nine thirty over the

2639
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Over the castle they play a

2640
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Clip of Walt and I'm like what

2641
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Possible clip of Walt could see it

2642
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Sounded all inclusive to gay people

2643
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And it was

2644
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
To all that come to this happy place

2645
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Welcome and so they play

2646
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
That clip I was like I guess

2647
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
That could sound

2648
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
That's inclusive sure

2649
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
But it's like I've

2650
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I'm not even saying I think Walt Disney

2651
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Was like an especially homophobic

2652
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Person but as a man of his

2653
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Age then I would have to think

2654
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
He weighed in particularly

2655
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
He would just like I'm sure he's no more

2656
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Homophobic than the average man

2657
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
American man back in the fifties

2658
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Which would be extremely homophobic

2659
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Your base register

2660
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
No long hair fellows

2661
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
No suspicious facial hair

2662
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Think you're a gal

2663
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Exactly yeah but so when they

2664
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Played that clip I was like oh they had to check the

2665
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Box of like show

2666
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Have some way to portray that this is

2667
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Connected to the long lineage from

2668
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
The opening day when Walt was here

2669
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I guess if you if you think

2670
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Of that speech as the

2671
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Constitution of Disneyland and if

2672
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
We're going to be literalists about like

2673
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
It is all who come

2674
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Disneyland is your land

2675
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
And there's no I kind of like using

2676
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
That as a wedge

2677
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
To say well look look what he said

2678
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Let's interpret that as

2679
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
We have to be accepting

2680
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
It's the Bible you're reinterpreting it every

2681
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Few hundred years that's what

2682
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Walt said now we reinterpret it

2683
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And other people are like well

2684
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
But he was giving that speech to a group

2685
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Of as far as we know all heterosexual

2686
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Men so he only meant it's your

2687
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Land so that

2688
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Only applies to them there I found my

2689
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Way to justify there's traditionalists

2690
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
With Walt and then there are the progressives with Walt

2691
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Who reinterpret his language

2692
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Well that's what I was hoping was because there

2693
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Were so many I think

2694
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
The user I watched

2695
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
A video Patrick Dougal there

2696
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Was so many

2697
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Remixes and stuff being

2698
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Played I thought they were

2699
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Going to read when I started to hear that clip I'm

2700
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Like oh that's going to be great they're going to

2701
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
They're going to scratch over welcome

2702
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
They're going to remix like

2703
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Well well well but they would never

2704
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Do that they it's

2705
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
So on such a high

2706
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Pedestal but it would be very funny

2707
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
To start remixing like

2708
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
The beat drops during a walk

2709
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
If the DJ had done that during

2710
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
The Ohana dance party that he shut it down

2711
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
They'd have cut the lights

2712
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Like no that's too far

2713
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I think the crowd but that's a thing where it's like

2714
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
The crowd would have lost it

2715
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I just was like what are

2716
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Other Walt Disney quotes is there anything else

2717
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
We can interpret and I think I found one

2718
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Right here this is the one I just don't know if you ever

2719
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Said it on tape I love Mickey Mouse

2720
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
More than any woman I have ever known

2721
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
If you need

2722
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Something

2723
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
That's perfect

2724
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
They should have AI recreated

2725
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And play it loudly in the parks

2726
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
They'll never stop using AI Walt if they

2727
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Start oh yeah I did have one other

2728
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Bit of food I wanted to mention too I was

2729
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Going over my notes like other stuff I did it was

2730
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
The what the

2731
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Kids today would call the rainbow glizzy

2732
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
But it was the a loaded

2733
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Corn dog was

2734
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
So the little red wagon was

2735
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Selling it was selling regular corn dogs

2736
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Too but it was the

2737
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Rainbow corn dog which

2738
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Let me find that here

2739
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Is that just relish and

2740
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Ketchup and mustard

2741
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And some

2742
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Peppers on it too so yeah they had

2743
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
That too and also I had

2744
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
The rocky road funnel cake at

2745
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Hungry Bear which was good and

2746
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Which was just like a scoop of rocky

2747
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Road ice cream on top of the funnel cake though

2748
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
The pride rainbow

2749
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Funnel cake unfortunately sold out

2750
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Which is too bad that sucks all the

2751
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Rainbows went immediately like and

2752
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I also I am normally not the type

2753
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
To buy the $27

2754
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Cup to put things in

2755
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
But my husband was like we gotta get the pride cup so

2756
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I even mobile ordered it and

2757
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Then when I got the hungry bear they're like

2758
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I'm sorry we're out of the pride cup we sold

2759
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Them all out you gotta like

2760
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
But they at least gave me a refund

2761
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
But they're shooting themselves

2762
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
In the foot this is strange

2763
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Did you by any chance stumble into

2764
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
The golden horseshoe with the line dancing

2765
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
No I did not see the line

2766
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Dancing unfortunately I missed out

2767
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
On that there was too many

2768
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Too much stuff to do

2769
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I missed out on the

2770
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
There were singers

2771
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
About a 20 minute singer thing in front of

2772
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
The small world where they're

2773
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Singing a lot of like Disney hits

2774
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Including like reflection in front of it too

2775
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Another one they counted as like

2776
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
A gay song

2777
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Was the one

2778
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Two worlds one family from

2779
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Tarzan

2780
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Yeah that was among the musing too

2781
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I saw a photo op that was yeah

2782
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
That's folding in Tarzan and like

2783
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
You could stand under a scroll

2784
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
That's a Tarzan quote which is I won't pretend

2785
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
To be something I'm not

2786
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Which is kind of a strange Tarzan

2787
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Which is of course about being like a man

2788
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Surrounded by apes

2789
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Same thing being an ape man

2790
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Is kind of the journey

2791
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Queer people go through all the time

2792
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
They're raised by apes

2793
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It's very strange

2794
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I don't know if sexuals are often broodish

2795
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
So yeah

2796
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Yeah

2797
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
No I mean I guess

2798
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Tarzan as well it is a story of like

2799
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Oh my adoptive father doesn't love me kind of thing

2800
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Like I guess you could like see that

2801
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
And his mother loves him and his dad's mean

2802
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Like sure fine but yeah

2803
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Sounds close

2804
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Oh and then yeah

2805
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
But the This Is Me song using that World's Greatest Showman song

2806
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
It did I grumble

2807
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
About it being a fox song

2808
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Though I did see other parts people say

2809
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
This is a big moment

2810
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Because they're playing a fox song

2811
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
At Disney

2812
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
On Main Street

2813
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
And apparently that was like a first

2814
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
When they did it last year

2815
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
They did it again this year but last year

2816
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Apparently was the first playing of a fox song

2817
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
It's hard to conjure

2818
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
What other fox songs are

2819
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
What else is now in their

2820
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Arsenal

2821
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
There's not like a predator song

2822
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Sound of Music

2823
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Any Sound of Music song

2824
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Don't Ray Me

2825
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Yeah they aren't really making music

2826
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Could we have Sound of Music in Disney Forward

2827
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Sound of Music Land

2828
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Oh yeah you could be in the hill

2829
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
You can track this vehicle go up the hill with her

2830
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
It'll speed you around

2831
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Yeah that's not bad actually

2832
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
That is good

2833
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
When we did The Simpsons

2834
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
With all you guys here in person

2835
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And there was a Planet of the Apes reference

2836
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
With the music

2837
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
That's when it hit us like oh wait Disney owns that now

2838
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
That's a fox song

2839
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
They can do an apes ride

2840
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
At California Adventure

2841
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I wouldn't think they do the apes ride at Disneyland

2842
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
There's an apes ride

2843
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
At the Fox Studios Malaysia

2844
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Park with the weird

2845
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
That still has the fox license which was left in this

2846
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Weird limbo of can we still

2847
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Do it but they have a full

2848
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Somewhere between I forget if it's trackless or not

2849
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
It's Rise of the Resistance

2850
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
It's Resistance-esque it's Transformers-esque

2851
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
And it's all about Caesar

2852
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It's kind of like the second movie

2853
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
That exists in Malaysia

2854
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
And nobody acknowledges it

2855
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Those apes will never age

2856
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
They're CGI apes you're not going to look at

2857
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
When you go on a ride now

2858
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And you're like well that's not what Dominic Toretto looks like now

2859
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Or whatever

2860
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Caesar is timeless

2861
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Daniel Redcliffe is a little boy forever

2862
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Yeah we're all every day

2863
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Watching a particular age

2864
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Of this very famous movie

2865
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
That is true

2866
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
The rainbow

2867
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I mean I love the corn dog in general

2868
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
It seemed like last year

2869
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Their churro choices were better

2870
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
They had like a sour cherry one last year

2871
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
This year was just I think it was like

2872
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Cake batter

2873
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
No it was cereal milk

2874
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Frosting with it and pineapple

2875
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Sprinkles which it was fine but

2876
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I kind of wish they had the sour cherry one

2877
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I think they have also they had popcorn

2878
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Lucky Charms in it

2879
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Yes yeah which I didn't get that

2880
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Because I watched that St. Patrick McDougal video

2881
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
You mentioned Jason

2882
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
He pointed out the like yeah

2883
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
All of the Lucky Charms

2884
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Or rainbow

2885
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Yes rainbow cereal bits

2886
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
He said they all just go straight

2887
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
To the bottom instantly

2888
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Like they just all fall

2889
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
That doesn't feel like that would work

2890
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Not very even distribution

2891
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
They need to work on that for next year

2892
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
The food is more interesting and fun

2893
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Than a lot of the Disney food

2894
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
It does sound like the operation

2895
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Side of it needs some fine tuning

2896
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Yeah I

2897
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I did want to try

2898
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
But I was like I don't want to overload myself

2899
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
But like the oh I had the

2900
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I did have the watermelon Mickey Beignets

2901
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
But that's because we love the Mickey

2902
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Beignets

2903
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
We went to the Mint Julep

2904
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Area and got that

2905
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It was one of the last things they were closing down

2906
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Though also you talk about Disney things breaking down

2907
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
We had bad luck

2908
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
That night on things breaking down

2909
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Like we

2910
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
On Mickey Runery where I had no problem

2911
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
And my husband and I

2912
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Split off from the group

2913
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
The rest of the group were like oh let's all do Space Mountain together

2914
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
But Space Mountain was like an hour long thing

2915
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
And we might miss the cavalcade

2916
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
So we're like no let's not do Space Mountain

2917
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
And then our friends who did it were like

2918
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
They made us switch cars, the car wasn't working

2919
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
So we had to get in a separate car

2920
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
We went on Star Tours together

2921
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I have never had Star Tours break on me before

2922
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
It broke like it did the first

2923
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
The first light speed jump

2924
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
It goes

2925
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
It like wrenched us forward harder than usual

2926
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
And then the screen

2927
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Went up and

2928
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
They turned out

2929
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
And they took us all off the thing

2930
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
And put us in another one like I've never had that

2931
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
That's good they just reloaded you immediately

2932
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
You essentially got the real life

2933
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Millennium Falcon experience

2934
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Yeah and my back hurt

2935
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
While I assume Han Solo's

2936
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Back must always hurt

2937
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Now you know what it was like to be him

2938
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And also the worst for our pals

2939
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Were we went on Big Thunder

2940
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Because I was like oh we got to do

2941
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Big Thunder at midnight I want to see nighttime

2942
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Midnight Big Thunder, but our other friends

2943
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Went on Pirates

2944
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
And they were stuck on

2945
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Pirates till after close

2946
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
They had to be

2947
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Escorted off Pirates

2948
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
We cannot move again

2949
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
That's how we got the Clarabelle video

2950
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Because we were waiting outside Pirates to meet up with them

2951
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
We were like well surely it's going to start now

2952
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And then it hits one and they're like

2953
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Everybody clear out and they're still

2954
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Stuck on Pirates

2955
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
You know where they got stuck and had to walk off from?

2956
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I think it was

2957
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I do think it was the big

2958
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Group area, you know the auction

2959
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Area

2960
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
That's where I want to walk off I think

2961
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
We got stuck there for like

2962
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
10 minutes once under the box

2963
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
That's almost about to drop on you

2964
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
We were under that box for like 10 minutes

2965
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Toward the end

2966
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
They got escorted off of it

2967
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
They missed a few things

2968
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
The transcendent Clarabelle moment

2969
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
They missed it, but then again I got to be jealous of them

2970
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Because at some point

2971
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Their group, they met

2972
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Harvey Gian from

2973
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
What We Do in the Shadows

2974
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Oh he's so great on that show

2975
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
He's great, he's

2976
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
A queer performer and his character

2977
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Is the greatest, I love him

2978
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I have a celeb crush on him

2979
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
And when I saw

2980
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Photos later that he was like

2981
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
He was there on the night with us

2982
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I saw that and then friends later said

2983
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Yeah we actually bit him and we

2984
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Got to take pictures with him

2985
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I missed that, so if the

2986
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Cost of being stuck, I don't know if I'd make

2987
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
The trade of like, I couldn't see the Clarabelle

2988
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Dance and a couple other things, but I could

2989
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Have met Harvey Gian if I was being

2990
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Stuck on the Pirates ride

2991
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I don't know, I might have made that trade

2992
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
He was in like a

2993
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Disney bounding even I think based on his outfit

2994
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
It was like a Donald-ish outfit

2995
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
He was white shirt, blue

2996
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Side cap kind of thing

2997
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Very knee high socks

2998
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
To represent Donald

2999
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
He's got it all on his social media you can see

3000
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Wow, so an accidental meet and greet

3001
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Yeah, I think that was the only

3002
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Celeb I knew of who was at it

3003
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
That night, but yeah

3004
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I was very jealous of my friends who got to meet him

3005
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Gavin Newsome was there last year

3006
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Oh, okay

3007
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
He tweeted about it last year

3008
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I don't know if he was there this year

3009
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
And I didn't, I got to see

3010
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I wanted to get the Andor part of the new Star Tours

3011
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
But it was the Ahsoka one

3012
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Which I only had to guess out of

3013
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I didn't see Ahsoka, I watched

3014
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Andor, I didn't watch Ahsoka, but

3015
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I know there's like space whales in it

3016
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So the space whales are very central to that

3017
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
New section of Star Tours

3018
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
That way the space whales further

3019
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
They apparently show up in a lot

3020
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Yeah, it's all connected to that

3021
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Rebel show and stuff

3022
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
It's such pure Filoni things

3023
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
As a Star Wars fan

3024
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Of a certain vintage

3025
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
To be told that Clone Wars

3026
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
And the related things matter

3027
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Like in the cartoons matter that I totally

3028
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Ignored, I was like, I don't like this

3029
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I didn't, I

3030
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Confused, there's too much to take in

3031
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I have been told these didn't matter

3032
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
All these characters from the Clone Wars show

3033
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
It's confusing to me

3034
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Imagine my feeling where my entire canon is

3035
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Star Tours, the rest of it

3036
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Like wait, so I gotta know about who these other

3037
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Who Han Solo is

3038
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Ugh, I'm exhausted

3039
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I'm out, I'm just saying

3040
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Rise of Skywalker, it seemed like they were

3041
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Looking for something and if you

3042
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Just put some space whales in there

3043
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Might have gone a little more smoother

3044
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
It would have fixed it

3045
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Well, I mean, sounds like

3046
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Sounds like a great evening

3047
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Sounds like a particularly fun

3048
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Just like, I don't know, like a pretty

3049
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Juiced up, good desserts, good performers

3050
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Just kind of like

3051
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Like a best Disney has to offer

3052
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Sort of thing, besides all the rides being

3053
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Open or working

3054
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Yeah, the cast members were, the vibes

3055
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Are great, I would, yeah, if you've not done

3056
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
It was my first time doing any of the

3057
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Dark, Disneyland dark events

3058
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And I'd say it was a lot of fun

3059
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I mean, it was like, I believe it was

3060
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
160 a ticket and it's good

3061
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
6pm is when you can start mixing in

3062
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
So you get 6pm to 1am

3063
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
And most of the stuff's

3064
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Running and you're there

3065
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
You're not doing this to ride Rise of the Resistance

3066
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Anyway, you're not coming there for doing that

3067
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
So you're not gonna miss that

3068
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
But yeah, the food, I just

3069
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
And even the, just the people at the

3070
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Churro carts were like, so excited

3071
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
They had like glow sticks and were like

3072
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Dancing to all the songs at the

3073
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Churro cart in Fantasyland

3074
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
So, oh, sorry, one other character I meant to mention

3075
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Was the, again, this is for

3076
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
People younger than me, Tinkerbell

3077
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
And her many Pixie

3078
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Pals from those direct videos

3079
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Pixie Hollow, yeah, the characters

3080
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
All the Pixie Hollow characters were out and they were being sassy

3081
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
They were also having

3082
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Some fun

3083
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Within reason of their characters

3084
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I don't think they were breaking any character rules

3085
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
But they were being a little extra sassy

3086
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Which was fun

3087
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
But yeah, I would say it's, I bet it

3088
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It certainly grows from here, especially because

3089
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I think the, you know, the finger thing

3090
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Means the money, like they made

3091
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
They made good, they made some bank

3092
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
On this night, and I think Disney can see

3093
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
It's worth it to get those

3094
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Rainbow bucks more in the next

3095
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Year, like I'm, the red shirt I bought

3096
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Is oversized for me, because they were out of my size

3097
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I had to buy a size up, like

3098
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Oh wow, you are decked in, you got

3099
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Several things, yes, I'm wearing my white

3100
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Pride night 2024 hat

3101
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
It's the official one

3102
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
And also the, I have

3103
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
My fanny pack as well

3104
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
That's a new thing

3105
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
They got you, they got you

3106
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
For my husband and I, we really are into

3107
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Fanny packs are our now walk around thing

3108
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
For the parks, like we just like having it side

3109
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
On the shoulder, it's our favorite

3110
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Thing though, he, my husband wore a

3111
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Stitch backpack

3112
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
From Tokyo Disney

3113
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Which is, it's stitch upside down

3114
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
So it's like he's like showing his butt to you

3115
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
As the thing, it's like

3116
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
That little rascal Stitch, like

3117
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
His tush, his tush, oh I'm sorry

3118
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
He's showing his tush to you

3119
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
It's 2024, it's tush

3120
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And that was great, while dancing

3121
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
The Stitch performer loves seeing anybody

3122
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Wearing a Stitch merchandise

3123
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Would pose extra and be like, do the heart

3124
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Signal and point at you, like it

3125
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
That's my tush

3126
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Look up all the videos of the dancing

3127
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
At least, and you can see how much

3128
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Fun the performers are having

3129
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
My gaydar was going off on all

3130
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
These performers who are like, oh you've got to be

3131
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
You've got to be some part of the rainbow

3132
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Having a great time, finally getting to

3133
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Not have to tamp down

3134
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Your, yourself for

3135
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
The family daytime performers

3136
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Not yet, not give like

3137
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
You know, just 40%

3138
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Which just reads like regular good dancing

3139
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
You can actually take it all the way up

3140
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
You can't serve as hard

3141
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
On a regular Disney day

3142
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
They were serving C-Word

3143
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
That night, Claire Bell was definitely

3144
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Serving C-Word

3145
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
C-Word is cow

3146
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I'm glad someone else said it

3147
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I didn't do my notes

3148
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
He said it on the way over in the car

3149
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
He said the word

3150
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
He just was saying, he said the phrase

3151
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
And he hasn't said it

3152
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
So I just brought up serve

3153
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
I know what it means

3154
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
But I was just trying to prompt Jason

3155
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
It means cow or it means Claire Bell

3156
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Yeah, she was serving cow

3157
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Jason should say the word on the show

3158
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
That is another of those like

3159
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I'm starting to feel old things of seeing like

3160
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
TikToks that just use the C-Word all the time

3161
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
That content is like

3162
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Wow, we just say this now?

3163
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
That's okay

3164
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
This was almost the biggest no-no perhaps

3165
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Yeah, and now it seems fun

3166
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Jason's in the car just yelling it

3167
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
At people

3168
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I'm doing the Claire Bell dance

3169
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
He rolled the window down and started screaming at people

3170
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I said Jason stop

3171
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I'm not doing it right

3172
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Are you out of the car?

3173
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
He's sort of throwing things at people

3174
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Hey, let me do a round of it really quick

3175
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
And he got a bullhorn

3176
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
He put the big bullhorn from the Dukes of Hazzard on the top of my car

3177
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
And he started shouting it

3178
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
He brought a horn and attached his own microphone to it

3179
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Yeah

3180
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Well, it's all the new words of 2024

3181
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
They're all in play

3182
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
For all of us

3183
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
But jeez, what a blast

3184
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
This is a very fun thing to thank you for doing this

3185
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
And bringing us a trip report

3186
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
It made me feel like I was there

3187
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Maybe I've got to do one of these in the future

3188
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
It sounds really fun

3189
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Henry Gilbert, you survived podcast The Ride

3190
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Thank you for joining us

3191
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
And making time in a trip that had that

3192
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
And a bunch of other park stuff and podcast stuff

3193
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Let's exit through the gift shop

3194
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

3195
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Thanks for having me

3196
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I always love

3197
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Being on Podcast Ride

3198
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
You guys are the best

3199
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I co-host the podcast

3200
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Talking Simpsons with Bob Mackey

3201
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Where we talk about The Simpsons

3202
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
In chronological order

3203
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And we are in season 4

3204
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Slash 14 right now

3205
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
We kind of bounce between the two

3206
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
To be classic and

3207
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
And keep going forward though too

3208
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
But yeah, we just

3209
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
I guess the most recent guest appearance

3210
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Of one of you guys with Scott was on

3211
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Our one about the EPCOT

3212
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Where they visited

3213
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Teacher of the year

3214
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Little Richard

3215
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
He got a lot going on on that one

3216
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
The show really hates EPCOT

3217
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
At least back then

3218
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
They don't hate EPCOT now

3219
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
They love it and think everybody should go there all the time

3220
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
But go to Disney Plus

3221
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
And you can find all of these scathing

3222
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
EPCOT jokes

3223
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
These jokes about EPCOT being boring

3224
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
The Simpsons almost is like all the

3225
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And all of that

3226
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
There's that one joke especially in Itchy and Scratchy Land

3227
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
About like Nazi supermen

3228
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Or superiors or something

3229
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
That was their equivalent of Walt Disney

3230
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Made that

3231
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
The Simpsons maybe

3232
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Takes credit for the only subversiveness

3233
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Anywhere on Disney Plus

3234
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
It's kind of amazing

3235
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
It's impressive yeah

3236
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
If you want to know all the history

3237
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Of every joke and every change line

3238
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
And all these things

3239
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Our job too I think is to explain

3240
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
When there's a Crystal Pepsi

3241
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Joke in there and people are very

3242
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Confused by what Crystal Pepsi is

3243
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
We will explain it

3244
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Yeah we do that every week

3245
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
And we are sponsored at

3246
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Patreon.com

3247
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Where we have a ton of bonus stuff

3248
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
That's also where we do the What a Cartoon podcast

3249
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Or we also cover

3250
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Futurama and King of the Hill

3251
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
There's just as in depth

3252
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
And each month we do a super long

3253
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Podcast about an animated feature film

3254
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
We just did 5 hours and 40 minutes

3255
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
On Mulan

3256
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Which led me to do a ton of research on

3257
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
The Orlando

3258
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Animation studio that was also a ride

3259
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Or an experience

3260
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Yes

3261
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Mulan was one of the ones when that was still up and running

3262
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
It was their major

3263
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
It was the first one done primarily in Orlando

3264
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I read stories of the

3265
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Animators saying

3266
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
It was like 7 day a week

3267
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Production crunch

3268
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
In the last 6 months

3269
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Being there until 11pm

3270
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Hearing people screaming on

3271
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Tower of Terror as you're going home

3272
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
From animating all day

3273
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
We haven't talked about that

3274
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
As much I feel like even though that is a fascinating

3275
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Thing and Loom's Large in my head is a

3276
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Kid going and being like oh they're making

3277
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
A movie in there

3278
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
That was such a good deal for me

3279
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
My parents had a tour group

3280
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Past and I like

3281
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
They let me wait and join up

3282
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
With the next one

3283
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Because I was like stuck I need to like keep looking at this stuff

3284
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I was so enamored with that

3285
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
That's the big one we've missed

3286
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
There's a great doc on YouTube now called

3287
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Beyond the Glass which is like a

3288
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
90 minute interview with tons of the animators who work there

3289
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
They have a funny story in there about

3290
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
How if a tour group would

3291
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Go by and there was a particularly attractive

3292
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Woman in the group

3293
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
One animator at one end of it would go

3294
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Swing and that would let other

3295
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
People know like a hot ladies

3296
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Coming through and they'd all

3297
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Say swing through the

3298
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Because they were working there when Wayne's World

3299
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Was relatively new

3300
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
And we finally had a sound

3301
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
To associate with a certain

3302
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Thing that our body could do

3303
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
That's what Jason was saying when we were in the car too

3304
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
That too

3305
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000

3308
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I'm going to break up the new situation

3309
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Goofy broke up Horace Scorescaller

3310
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I'm getting in there my hall pass

3311
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
My hall pass is Claribel

3312
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
My hall pass is a fictional

3313
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Animated character just starting to pile up

3314
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Jason can serve C word himself

3315
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000

3316
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000

01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Places that yanks yet

3331
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
We were talking about Max and all that earlier

3332
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Thanks Netflix for not yanking

3333
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Everybody's in LA

3334
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
No yank for that either

3335
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I love that show so much

3336
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000

Addicted to your tush
