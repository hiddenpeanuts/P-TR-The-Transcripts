1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,660
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,144 --> 00:00:23,844
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate,

3
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:28,284
which in a mere four months will have been open for longer than Hard Rock Park.

4
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:32,484
I'm Scott Garrett and you're joined by Jason Sheridan and Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:32,544 --> 00:00:33,844
Hi there, Mike Carlson here.

6
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:36,144
Eat shit, Hard Rock Park.

7
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,904
We're just gonna keep dunking and dunking.

8
00:00:39,224 --> 00:00:40,504
Just kidding, we love Hard Rock Park.

9
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:40,904
We love Hard Rock Park.

10
00:00:40,904 --> 00:00:45,844
We wish we could go back in time and that is what we would use the time machine for,

11
00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:47,104
just to visit that park.

12
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:49,984
We would go back, we would get Hitler and bring him to Hard Rock Park.

13
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:52,184
To enjoy it with us.

14
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:55,084
Melt his icy heart with the joy of rock music.

15
00:00:55,164 --> 00:00:58,944
Although I'm now feeling like we're out to have a time machine.

16
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:02,384
I think one of my first stops might be what we're talking about today,

17
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:08,284
which to me is like one of the most delightful, odd attractions in theme park history.

18
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:12,624
And it's not the best documented thing in the world,

19
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:17,104
but luckily our guest was going to recreate it

20
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:20,684
through information and audio fax.

21
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:24,724
For sure in this, our most thorough guest about any topic.

22
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:28,184
And I'm so glad you're here to talk about returning to the show.

23
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:33,504
For the second time, he's a writer, he's a DJ and a general purveyor of cool shit.

24
00:01:33,704 --> 00:01:34,604
It's Doug Jones.

25
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:36,564
Hi, thanks for having me back.

26
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:38,404
Yay, welcome back.

27
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:40,704
And our first guest on the second gauge.

28
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:44,784
Thank you for joining us across the Esplanade.

29
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:46,344
Much appreciated.

30
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,224
I'm so excited to be here.

31
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:52,444
But before we dive in, I know we have a lot to cover today.

32
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:52,804
Yes.

33
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:55,844
I just want to get a few things out of the way.

34
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:57,964
I had a feeling this might be the case.

35
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:02,584
Yeah, I was expecting Doug to call us out because generally when we get together or see you,

36
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:05,484
you have a couple things that usually you're like,

37
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:07,384
no, you said something was bad and it's good.

38
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,644
So I was wondering if that's what's going to happen now.

39
00:02:09,644 --> 00:02:13,044
If I feel like strongly enough, I mean, there's dozens of things,

40
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:15,944
but sometimes something bothers me so much.

41
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:20,724
I just can't shut up and I'll text you immediately.

42
00:02:21,744 --> 00:02:22,384
All caps.

43
00:02:22,484 --> 00:02:27,244
The last one was Pizzarizzo because I think I said I trashed Pizzarizzo because it doesn't

44
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:30,504
have so much Muppet theming, but you said, no, that's not true.

45
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:31,304
You have to look for it.

46
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:31,484
It's not true.

47
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,884
I have so much Muppet theming.

48
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:38,304
I mean, and it's on the chopping block.

49
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:40,904
This is important.

50
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:45,544
It's just when the seasonal operation, which means that things are not looking good.

51
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:47,784
I feel like you're trying to bury Pizzarizzo.

52
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:48,704
I kind of am.

53
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:49,644
Yes, that's true.

54
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:57,644
One of my favorite, as far as express quick service goes and themed.

55
00:02:57,784 --> 00:02:58,724
It's so well themed.

56
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:03,164
I wrote this down and this was a pizza riso was the thing you want to talk about.

57
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:04,304
Or is that just a side note?

58
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:07,004
I was going to get into that because there's something else I want to know.

59
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:08,244
No, I'm glad this came out too broadly.

60
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:11,504
I'll let you read your piece and then I have something to read as well.

61
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,124
Insanely about this issue.

62
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:21,904
In the monorail episode dated December 7th, 2018, Mike Carlson said, quote,

63
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:26,644
it's supposedly a Muppet themed pizzeria, but you walk in there and there's barely

64
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:29,484
anything that would let you know that it's Muppets.

65
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:36,424
I mean, the reference is not really a Muppet theme.

66
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:40,284
It's more specifically a riso the rat themed pizzeria.

67
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,044
And I sent you this photo that I was really excited about.

68
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,524
We were just there as recently as last October.

69
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,944
We spent the better part of an hour in there just exploring and admiring all the details.

70
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:58,864
You walk in, they've got the, there's Easter eggs in there.

71
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:04,264
The menu boards are like purposely, the little letters are like missile lines.

72
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,384
It looks like they're placed there by tiny rats.

73
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,264
That's a really subtle one.

74
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:12,524
But also there's this shelf that has a can of Wilkins coffee.

75
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:13,284
Anyone?

76
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:14,344
No, I don't know.

77
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:16,884
Is that, no, I don't want to guess and be wrong.

78
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,264
What is, what's, what's Wilkins coffee?

79
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:22,124
Oh, Jim Henson made like over 150 Wilkins coffee.

80
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:22,544
Oh, the commercial.

81
00:04:23,344 --> 00:04:24,764
Wilkins coffee commercial.

82
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:26,184
Little stuff like that.

83
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:28,664
We were just talking about like Ralph, the early days of Ralph.

84
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:34,184
And I feel like Ralph was in old coffee ads and like pre Kermit kind of like weird amorphous

85
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:34,804
characters.

86
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:36,464
Okay, gotcha.

87
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:37,024
That's a nice little nod.

88
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:38,004
He was a pre Kermit.

89
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:40,484
He was also a character, not just a brand of coffee.

90
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:41,244
It was Wilkins.

91
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,704
He looked a little like Kermit.

92
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:44,124
Yeah.

93
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:44,584
Oh, okay.

94
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:49,724
But my favorite thing, if I just had a, I don't want to spend too much time on this.

95
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:50,004
That's fine.

96
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:50,504
We have time.

97
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:50,924
Of course.

98
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,424
And we'll do a whole episode on it.

99
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:52,944
Pizza Rizzo.

100
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:53,184
Yeah.

101
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:58,244
But upstairs on the second floor, there's like a party room.

102
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:01,364
It's called Rizzo's Deluxe Supreme Banquet Hall.

103
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:04,484
And it's got a disco ball and a dance floor.

104
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:07,564
And they're like blasting like seventies music.

105
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:08,784
It's awesome.

106
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:10,864
We brought our food up there.

107
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:17,004
We watched like a group of British, like day campers have a hula hoop contest.

108
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:18,044
And it was delightful.

109
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:19,324
A hula hoop contest.

110
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:19,704
Yeah.

111
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:22,364
It was just such a good vibe in there.

112
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:28,084
I recommend even if you've been there before and you don't like it, try going in the disco

113
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:29,844
room and just hanging out there and tell me.

114
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:32,924
It looks like a banquet hall from like an Italian wedding.

115
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:33,644
Yeah.

116
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:37,404
I do like, I have seen pictures of that and I have to agree with you.

117
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,664
I like the level of detail.

118
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:39,124
It's fun.

119
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:44,204
It's a great, it's air conditioned and it's a great way to just relax and break up the day.

120
00:05:44,684 --> 00:05:50,164
So I texted Mike a photo of the marquee that's outside, which I think is just delightful.

121
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:55,064
And he kind of shook it off and said, oh, it's just a vague reference.

122
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:59,644
Can I just talk about this marquee and then I'll get over it.

123
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:00,544
We never have to.

124
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:00,724
That's fine.

125
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:01,984
No, no, please, please.

126
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:07,964
The marquee says somebody got married, which is, you know, the song from a mother's take.

127
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:08,804
Take me in that.

128
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:16,864
Join us for the wedding reception of Gil and Lil, daughter of Will and Jill, son of Phil and Bill.

129
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:18,464
These are.

130
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,684
Muppety kind of joke.

131
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:20,004
Yeah.

132
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:25,004
Well, it's, these are the names of the, the people from the adage agency where Kermit goes

133
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:26,884
to work after he has amnesia.

134
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:29,984
He has to get a new job and start his life over again.

135
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:30,984
Oh yeah.

136
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:33,144
And those are his new coworkers.

137
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,804
When he's like acting all stiff and different.

138
00:06:36,124 --> 00:06:36,564
Exactly.

139
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:42,564
And then they find him and he doesn't, you know, recognize his friends and he's got this whole

140
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:48,604
new life and, and you know, they miss piggy punches them in the face and then he snaps out of it.

141
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:51,324
Featuring DJ electric mayhem.

142
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:52,344
All right.

143
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,384
That's an easy one.

144
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:56,024
Playing the greatest wedding hits of all time.

145
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:59,624
B, Y, O, B and P beer and pizza.

146
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:01,744
That's a fun little joke.

147
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:03,444
All right.

148
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:04,464
But here's.

149
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:05,604
Is another thing.

150
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:06,564
Could I respond real quick?

151
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:07,104
Sure.

152
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:12,364
I will say as a theme park journalist, I did let the audience down because I realized now

153
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:14,024
I did not go to the disco room.

154
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:18,884
So that is an irresponsible comment for me to make overall about the theming.

155
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,904
If I did not get to experience the whole restaurant.

156
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,664
In my head, you, you walked in, you said this sucks.

157
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:25,624
He turned around and walked right back out.

158
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:26,844
You're not far off, Doug.

159
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:33,004
But I will also say what you're, what I'm responding to is I feel that the place feels

160
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,224
a bit cheap to me.

161
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:38,024
And if you were to go in and say, be our guest restaurant and what you're describing, like,

162
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,824
Oh, one of the meals is named after Robbie Benson, who did the voice of the beast.

163
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:45,504
I would be less thrilled than seeing where's my Rizzo robot.

164
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:46,704
Give me the Rizzo robot.

165
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,644
Give me a little more.

166
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:49,464
I understand.

167
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:50,304
I understand.

168
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,644
That's really what I'm getting at.

169
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:56,784
It would be amazing if we walked in to the disco room and there's an animatronic

170
00:07:57,364 --> 00:07:58,244
electric mayhem.

171
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,704
I mean, that's performing.

172
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:03,504
I mean, now I would love to see that too, but they're on a budget.

173
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:08,504
If you take into consideration what it was before, which was the toy story pizza planet,

174
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:10,504
it's definitely a plus up.

175
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:11,064
Yeah.

176
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:13,424
And that was a well rendered pizza planet.

177
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:13,984
No, yeah.

178
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:14,884
I didn't have the arcade.

179
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:15,404
No, no, no.

180
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:20,484
But there's an Easter egg within the marquee and I swear to God, then then we'll move on.

181
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:21,064
That's fine.

182
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:25,864
If you look very closely behind the letters, you'll, you'll see there's kind of like

183
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:31,244
fading in dust of what the sign used to read before it was a wedding reception.

184
00:08:31,484 --> 00:08:38,744
And it says pot otter memorial service with tribute performance by the frog town hollow

185
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:41,764
jumbly jug band and Emmett otter jug band reference.

186
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:42,404
Wow.

187
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,664
So it was a week.

188
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:44,404
That is good.

189
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,624
It was a wake for the wedding.

190
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:47,164
Wow.

191
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,484
Those are great references.

192
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:50,044
And I, yes, you're for sure.

193
00:08:50,084 --> 00:08:50,204
Right.

194
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:50,744
I missed it.

195
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:51,104
Yeah.

196
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:51,624
I missed that.

197
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:52,284
And you know what?

198
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:56,344
You're right that if we're, maybe we're finding that this is more of a budget issue

199
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:59,904
and that you're, you're mad at Disney for not being able to render an animatronic.

200
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:02,924
But if given the budget, these are clear Muppet fans.

201
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,764
Yes, they were doing, they did their homework.

202
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:05,544
They cared.

203
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:09,604
It's like, well, it's so sort of the theme of I, we, I should have approached it more

204
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:14,684
like we tried to approach Pixar Pier where we were like the animatronics, the Imagineers tried.

205
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:16,384
I'm sure they tried.

206
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:19,304
This is clearly a budget and the time issue.

207
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:21,124
These people love Muppets.

208
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:26,784
They try to put as much fun as they could do in here, but they just didn't have the robot money.

209
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:27,944
But okay.

210
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:32,164
At the risk of opening this wound wide up, wide open again.

211
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:36,884
And I don't, I really, I'd have no dog in this fight because I haven't been to the place,

212
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:42,204
but I'd be remiss knowing that you were coming in and with the fact that we got this email

213
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:45,604
four days ago, this just came up.

214
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:45,924
Really?

215
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:47,744
You on the way here to record.

216
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:52,604
This is from, I'm going to keep them anonymous so that a few does not break out,

217
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:58,244
but this is a person who works in the Jim Henson creature shop.

218
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:05,624
And this person emailed us about several things, but mainly to say first pizza Rizzo is not great.

219
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,804
Doug Jones is wrong.

220
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:09,944
You were called out.

221
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,024
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:14,504
And I just had to, I had to, it's so weird that we got the email.

223
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:20,284
Jim Henson company, then he knows what's going on behind the scenes and he's probably disgusted

224
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:21,364
by other things.

225
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:24,324
This guy probably goes beyond the theming.

226
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:25,124
I think so.

227
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:25,684
I think so.

228
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:29,884
Let me say his, I think it'll reiterate points to say he's probably mad.

229
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:32,864
He's not getting his salary that he wants.

230
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:34,304
Let's face it.

231
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,004
He's got another vote to pick.

232
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:40,164
Or this is somebody who knows me, who doesn't like me.

233
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:43,904
What if I were to tell you it's Walter, the Muppet who wears the suit.

234
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:45,964
Well, here's it.

235
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,944
It does wrap around to a happy ending.

236
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:48,444
I swear.

237
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:49,864
All right.

238
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:50,684
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:51,304
I'll shut up.

240
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:51,804
No, no, no.

241
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:52,164
It's okay.

242
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:54,384
It's you'll be happy with where it lands.

243
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:58,484
The theming is not to the level it should be this as there's only some Muppet characters

244
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:01,844
hanging on the wall and some funny and quotes signs.

245
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:04,764
Now, do you, I like the signs that you just presented.

246
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,364
I think that I'm over that.

247
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:06,884
Fantastic.

248
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:07,284
That's very nice.

249
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:11,404
Now I cannot speak to the quality of the food as I love theme park pizza.

250
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:13,204
So you will have to judge for yourself.

251
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:15,984
So I guess so even he defends the pizza itself.

252
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:22,484
Anyway, even though Doug Jones was wrong about this whole name, he is right.

253
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,404
Definitive right and wrong.

254
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,684
But at least you're getting a good one here.

255
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:29,124
He is right about Country Bears being a good movie.

256
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:33,084
It is not that faithful to the attraction, but it is very fun.

257
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:35,084
And I used to rent it from Blockbuster a lot.

258
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:38,744
And the animatronics were done by the Jim Henson Creature Shop.

259
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:39,644
That's right.

260
00:11:40,124 --> 00:11:41,304
So there you go.

261
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:42,884
You win some, you lose some.

262
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:43,284
All right.

263
00:11:43,284 --> 00:11:44,444
I'll feel better.

264
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:46,604
I'll win some, you lose some.

265
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:46,984
You're right.

266
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:50,084
But this was your other yet because I think that dovetailed into we were talking about

267
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,624
several issues you'd raised and one being Country Bears.

268
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:55,624
And that I feel like we maybe need to explore Country Bears.

269
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:55,964
Oh, yeah.

270
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:58,124
We're going to do even as a commentary or something.

271
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:01,444
We especially as such a huge fan as Mike is of Country Bears.

272
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:01,744
Yes.

273
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:05,484
And I think because I've dismissed the movie because I've only saw it in clips.

274
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:06,564
And I said, this isn't right.

275
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:08,624
And that's not fair too, maybe.

276
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:09,984
We'll see, though.

277
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:10,964
Well, we'll watch it.

278
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:11,404
It is.

279
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:19,784
It's if nothing else, a technical achievement because it's 2000, 2001 CGI was in full swing

280
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:22,084
and being used on everything.

281
00:12:22,764 --> 00:12:27,004
Yet they did it the old fashioned way because they know that's the way the fans wanted to see it.

282
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:32,664
These people are in costumes with people with remote controls, controlling their eyebrows

283
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,424
and their ears and their mouths.

284
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:37,384
They put all this hard work on it and no one went to see it.

285
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:40,604
So they were like, well, it's the last time we ever make a movie this way.

286
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:41,344
Again.

287
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:42,004
Yeah.

288
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:46,384
And now I think we should all feel bad.

289
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,344
I feel like you're trying to say.

290
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:48,164
I feel supported.

291
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:53,264
You haven't broken eye contact with me and I feel as if you're blaming me for the loss of.

292
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:54,084
It's all of us.

293
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:56,484
I didn't see the movie until this past year.

294
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:57,144
Oh, you really?

295
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:58,364
So it's a newer thing for you.

296
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:01,724
But I saw it based on people saying it's weird and it's strangely good.

297
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:06,704
Like when it came up in conversation, people spoke positively about it.

298
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:08,804
And I finally decided to see it for myself.

299
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:10,984
Can I program this at the Vista?

300
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,864
Do you think the Vista would let us do a Friday midnight?

301
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:19,304
One of the midnight movies where it's usually like, you know, a midnight movie,

302
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:21,004
sort of rocky horror thing.

303
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:22,984
No one will come to it.

304
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:24,904
I mean, maybe I guess if we're hosting it.

305
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:25,904
Oh, everyone will come then.

306
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:31,104
It's not come or I feel like we're like culty movies are getting, you know, I've,

307
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:34,504
I think I've been to more than one midnight spice world.

308
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:35,564
Like, is that right?

309
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,204
If that counts as like.

310
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:38,204
All right, well, let's do it then.

311
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:41,444
Then, you know, yeah, we have to stretch the boundaries of, you know,

312
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:43,524
I just watched I knew it at a culty thing.

313
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:47,044
I want to say how much I enjoyed Josie and the Pussycats.

314
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:47,444
Really?

315
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:50,724
I was skeptical of that actually having some good to it.

316
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:54,884
And I always heard there was this like subversive subliminal messaging thing

317
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,304
about the movie and I'd recommend that to nobody's seen it.

318
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,384
And I have not seen it.

319
00:13:58,384 --> 00:13:58,784
I haven't seen it.

320
00:13:58,784 --> 00:13:59,684
Because again, it's pretty fun.

321
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:00,564
Yeah.

322
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:01,324
Decent songs.

323
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:04,104
I'll also I'll say I've heard some of the songs.

324
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:05,164
Yeah, I always like the song.

325
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:05,684
Yeah.

326
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:07,784
You have another thing, too.

327
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:11,684
Let's let's let's dive in because I don't want to finally.

328
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,144
Look, yeah, I came prepared.

329
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:16,564
We knew this was going to.

330
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:21,564
But every time that you come on there, if there's anything that's that's burning with you,

331
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:22,524
please bring it up.

332
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:23,364
I'll write them down.

333
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:23,824
Yes.

334
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:26,184
Doug's correction.

335
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:27,164
You're Andy Rooney.

336
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:28,724
He has a segment within.

337
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:30,084
That's great.

338
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:32,704
And I love that Mike is canceled now.

339
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:34,024
Mike is canceled.

340
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:35,204
That's Doug's.

341
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:35,824
You're done.

342
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:36,664
I've got you.

343
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:39,724
I'm trying to get Kevin Hart moment.

344
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:40,644
No, hey.

345
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,044
Not that kind of cancel.

346
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:43,424
I'm impressed because.

347
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:44,764
More casual cancel.

348
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:48,344
I have to say, I'm really impressed that Mike got the odd or reference.

349
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:49,384
Yeah.

350
00:14:50,284 --> 00:14:50,384
Yeah.

351
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,004
It's a good one.

352
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:54,544
And if you if you want to if you want to laugh really hard in Europe,

353
00:14:55,184 --> 00:15:00,564
late watching YouTube videos, watch the Emmett Otters jug band Christmas blooper reel on YouTube.

354
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:01,564
I've never seen that.

355
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:05,184
They just like re-released the soundtrack, right?

356
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,644
Because of Paul, all Paul Williams songs are mostly Paul Williams.

357
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:08,464
That's right.

358
00:15:08,684 --> 00:15:09,024
Yeah.

359
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:10,724
And they just put that like really.

360
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,124
I just added it to my iTunes or Apple Music.

361
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:14,144
In fact, great.

362
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:14,804
There you go.

363
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:15,184
All right.

364
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:15,924
We're friends again.

365
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:19,664
Well, speaking of friendship,

366
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:24,184
Doug, you just wrote a really great article for OC Weekly, correct?

367
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:24,924
Yes.

368
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:27,384
Called A Tale of Two Waltz.

369
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:33,304
That's about the friendship between Walter Knott and Walter Disney

370
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:38,664
and the way that the ideas of Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland intermingled and went back and forth

371
00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:40,984
in the mutual friendship.

372
00:15:41,264 --> 00:15:44,384
And it doesn't seem like they felt competitive.

373
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:48,264
It seems like when Disneyland opened, it was like, well, this is going to bring more people

374
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:52,084
to meet and not like this will be this will be a good thing.

375
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:53,964
That's something that doesn't happen anymore.

376
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:54,724
Yeah.

377
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:59,364
Every every anyone in similar areas are natural and Disney and Universal.

378
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:02,264
Imagine Uber and Lyft saying, you know what?

379
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:06,764
Let's put our differences like that would just never that would just never happen now.

380
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:13,684
Well, now now the Universal and Disney World accounts have tweeted at each other bits recently.

381
00:16:13,684 --> 00:16:17,764
That's something like someone's like, I can't wait to go on Space Mountain at Universal.

382
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:22,424
And they're like, oh, yeah, Universal says, sorry, I think I think you met CC

383
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:25,424
did Walt Disney World and they're like, yeah, we'll take it from here.

384
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:27,904
Like, oh, oh, so that's fine.

385
00:16:27,924 --> 00:16:32,244
That's something potentially the same social media third party person.

386
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:36,304
Is tweeting at themselves, but still could be true.

387
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:36,624
Yes.

388
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:41,804
Anyway, I loved the article and I recommend anybody listening to look it up.

389
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:42,024
Thanks.

390
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:44,664
And you guys reminded me about that because it came up in

391
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:48,284
the episode where you're interviewing the season pass guys.

392
00:16:48,404 --> 00:16:48,704
Yeah.

393
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:54,704
And I was like, oh, yeah, like I knew some of the stuff that Disney really loved the

394
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:55,704
Calico Mine Ride.

395
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:59,264
And I was like, there's got to be more to this story.

396
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:04,984
And that's when I started researching and came up around that same time I was approached

397
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:06,944
by OC Weekly to write something.

398
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:08,264
It was just perfect timing.

399
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:13,284
I was like immediately I was at Disneyland when I got an email from them and I wrote

400
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:16,944
back from Disneyland saying, here's my idea.

401
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:18,824
Like, like 30 minutes later.

402
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:19,764
Oh, you just have it.

403
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:20,444
Oh, that's good.

404
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:20,744
Yeah.

405
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:20,984
Wow.

406
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:22,084
Geez.

407
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:25,804
And not even knowing like the depth of what you'd find because it really is like there's

408
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:26,804
there's so much to it.

409
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:27,544
I know.

410
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:29,844
I found a lot of good stuff.

411
00:17:30,244 --> 00:17:34,704
So including that, like I didn't this really fun detail about our beloved Tony Baxter

412
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:39,604
that he when the Calico Mine Ride opened, he left his shift at Disneyland.

413
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:45,824
He like snuck out to go experience this ride, which clearly down the line would become an

414
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:48,104
inspiration for for Splash Mountain.

415
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:48,564
Clearly.

416
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:49,044
Big Thunder.

417
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:50,444
And there's a photograph.

418
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:55,244
They found a photograph of him on the day of the opening of the Calico Log Ride.

419
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:55,544
Wow.

420
00:17:55,544 --> 00:18:00,304
Just like kind of standing up on a rock trying to get a better view than all the other

421
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:01,064
spectators.

422
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:01,984
That's crazy.

423
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:02,524
Wow.

424
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:03,624
Geez, man.

425
00:18:03,644 --> 00:18:04,264
That's cool.

426
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:05,604
He sees tread and true.

427
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:14,064
But as one of the aspects of the article is the well, the the Imagineer Raleigh Crump,

428
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:19,024
who is involved in today's topic, Knott's Berry Tales, who was that's a that's a case

429
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:21,964
of a Disney person breaking rank.

430
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:24,464
Oh, I think he was probably long gone from Disney by that point.

431
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:29,664
But like bringing a lot of stuff he wanted to do at Disney over to Knott's and not to

432
00:18:29,664 --> 00:18:30,664
give away too much.

433
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,564
But I just Berry Tales factored into your article in a great way.

434
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:35,544
And I'm excited to talk about it.

435
00:18:35,944 --> 00:18:42,044
Yeah, there's multiple Disney people working on Knott's Berry Tales and the people who

436
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:48,224
are not from Disney that worked on this ride ended up going right to work for Disney afterwards.

437
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:55,144
You know, because upon its opening in nineteen seventy five, construction and design broke

438
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:57,564
for the Walt Disney World.

439
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:58,964
I mean, for a hot.

440
00:18:59,224 --> 00:18:59,644
OK.

441
00:18:59,944 --> 00:19:00,164
Yeah.

442
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:05,364
So they a lot of these people who hadn't done much before went went right to work on

443
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:05,844
Epcot.

444
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:07,644
And oh, yeah, you said it.

445
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:09,324
You said it was Steve Kirk.

446
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:10,224
Is that correct?

447
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:10,944
That's right.

448
00:19:11,144 --> 00:19:15,344
Imagineer, a guy who would go on to create Kitchen Cabaret, one of the best.

449
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:16,404
Oh, geez.

450
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:17,864
You still have it out.

451
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:19,144
Mike Mike for Christmas.

452
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:22,744
Just like the tea towel, the infamous character tea towel.

453
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,104
Nice.

454
00:19:23,104 --> 00:19:24,204
That's beautiful.

455
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,444
Kitchen Cabaret Merch for Christmas.

456
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:34,184
It also create, you know, much further down the line, but design Disney Sea, which is

457
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:39,544
considered by some to be one of the greatest design theme parks of all time.

458
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:44,584
So this is where they got their start in in nineteen seventy four.

459
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:45,424
Wow, geez.

460
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:49,464
Now, I was a little caught off guard because we we Berry Tales had been mentioned

461
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:52,344
casually, like in conversation among us in the past.

462
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:56,004
It was mentioned when we were down at Knott's.

463
00:19:56,244 --> 00:20:01,504
Of course, I was not in the best way that day, but I was under the impression

464
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:03,344
I hung out with you the night before you recorded that.

465
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:04,044
Oh, yes, you were there.

466
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:04,864
I forgot.

467
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,384
Drinking.

468
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:10,944
Someone else was drinking.

469
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:14,364
I didn't really hang out with you that night.

470
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:16,004
Now that I think about it.

471
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:17,324
No, I think we said hi.

472
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:18,404
We talked for a second.

473
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:19,104
You didn't hang out.

474
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:20,704
You were over at the bar the whole night.

475
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:21,484
I.

476
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,164
Yeah, I.

477
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:23,444
I.

478
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:24,604
You were all talking to each other.

479
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:25,324
Getting out of the.

480
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:25,904
It's fine.

481
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:27,064
We won't get into that.

482
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:28,824
Yeah, we'll talk to friends who want us.

483
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,304
Yeah, that was very rude.

484
00:20:31,344 --> 00:20:32,224
You mentioned it.

485
00:20:32,224 --> 00:20:33,024
You brought it up.

486
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:34,184
I brought it up.

487
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:38,144
I didn't bring it up, but I think the the association with

488
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:43,044
the Berry Tales mentioned and the Raleigh Crump Association,

489
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:47,224
I was expecting more along the lines of one of our favorites,

490
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:50,044
the marvelous Marvel McFay, who was sold.

491
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:53,504
It was just a walk around character and a little stage show.

492
00:20:53,564 --> 00:20:58,984
I had no idea until we got your term paper and the video link

493
00:20:58,984 --> 00:21:03,084
and all these wonderful pictures that like this was a full dark ride.

494
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:05,104
I really detailed dark ride.

495
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:10,204
If I could quote your own article because you synopsized it in a wonderful way.

496
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:12,824
If you don't know this attraction and please.

497
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:15,644
While you're listening to this, look up a video, look at photos.

498
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:19,564
It's like you need some visuals to know why we're so excited about this thing.

499
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:25,324
But as you said, Doug, it is a wild, 100% original eight minute psychedelic

500
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:27,724
journey full of animatronic critters.

501
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:28,964
That says it.

502
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,664
And it's that's long for a for a dark ride.

503
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:32,684
That's very long.

504
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:33,344
Eight minutes.

505
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:36,884
So this is the this is such a big full experience.

506
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:41,804
And for really, we're talking about a guy who worked on the Haunted Mansion

507
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:45,124
and the Enchanted Tiki Room and it's a small world.

508
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:49,284
This is an opportunity for him to just really go for it.

509
00:21:49,364 --> 00:21:53,524
Nothing holding him back at his time at Disney.

510
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:57,384
There are so much hurdles he had jump over to get stuff actually made.

511
00:21:57,704 --> 00:22:01,504
Now, this is a unique situation where for the first time in his career,

512
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:04,684
he could do what everyone and he had no one to answer to.

513
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,124
And he really, really took advantage of that.

514
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:11,644
And it's also insane how quickly this ride came together in like

515
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:14,664
six months from one concept to completion, which is insane.

516
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:15,284
Jesus.

517
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:15,804
Wow.

518
00:22:15,864 --> 00:22:16,224
Wow.

519
00:22:16,484 --> 00:22:18,944
I would describe like just you had brought over you.

520
00:22:19,024 --> 00:22:19,784
What would you call this?

521
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:20,844
This the storybook, right?

522
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,544
Of the Knott's Berry Tales characters.

523
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:23,944
Yes.

524
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:24,884
Journey to the Fair.

525
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:28,844
So if you're not looking at a photo right now of this and you've never seen this before,

526
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:33,904
I would almost describe it like a very psychedelic color.

527
00:22:34,524 --> 00:22:36,784
They look a Berenstain Bear-esque.

528
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:37,264
Yeah.

529
00:22:37,864 --> 00:22:38,724
But they're like.

530
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,464
At least when illustrated.

531
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:40,624
Less so the robots.

532
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:41,364
Yes.

533
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:42,124
Yes, for sure.

534
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:45,984
But like, yeah, the picture, like the art for promotional use and stuff looks very thin.

535
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:49,764
But the robots look, I don't know how you would even describe it, but like it's like a kind of

536
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:56,744
a psychedelic-y Berenstain Bears with like a bear in an old straw hat or top hat and.

537
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:57,704
It's delightful.

538
00:22:57,704 --> 00:23:02,324
They're delightful characters that, you know, I'm just barely old enough to have gone on this

539
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:03,944
when I was a kid before it closed.

540
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:06,224
It closed when I was like seven years old.

541
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:08,564
So I love these.

542
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,244
I love this ride so much.

543
00:23:10,244 --> 00:23:11,864
I love these characters so much.

544
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,564
I thought this would become a huge thing.

545
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:16,824
Like all the other things I like.

546
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:22,704
I like, I just assume that everything would become a huge franchise and that soon we would

547
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:24,764
get TV, uh, cartoons and movies.

548
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:27,444
I love DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince.

549
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:33,064
I had that, there's the first cassette tape and I, you know, that became a hit TV show.

550
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:36,544
So I thought everything I like is going to become a hit TV show.

551
00:23:36,744 --> 00:23:40,184
Now this went away and I forgot about it.

552
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:45,944
I didn't think about this for like 20 years until suddenly it came up on YouTube.

553
00:23:45,944 --> 00:23:51,644
I watched the ride through like around maybe 2007 and my mind was blown.

554
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:54,484
Like I was like, Oh my God, I remember this.

555
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,084
I didn't, it was not a weird dream I had.

556
00:23:57,084 --> 00:23:58,764
This was an actual ride.

557
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:05,564
I had a similar thing with it where I think I've even said, Oh yeah, I went on this when

558
00:24:05,564 --> 00:24:06,444
I was really young.

559
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:09,884
Then you sent us information closed in 86.

560
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:11,764
I would have been one years old.

561
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:12,784
Wouldn't have happened.

562
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:20,724
Then I, you, I put, you only put the dots together because they, it became a, some of

563
00:24:20,724 --> 00:24:23,444
it became a walkthrough, which was still there.

564
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:25,624
The first time I went to knots in the early nineties.

565
00:24:25,624 --> 00:24:26,584
I don't know when that went through.

566
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:33,504
So that's, but I do have a very distinct fuzzy hazy memory, but I think what's weird

567
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:38,284
is as a kid, I had, I was like, I had mixed it up with it's like it's underground and

568
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:40,804
it's little critters working on something in my head.

569
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:43,584
They were either Fraggles or Smurfs.

570
00:24:43,964 --> 00:24:47,604
Like I've had this odd thing in my brain of like, wasn't there some Smurfs thing?

571
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:52,784
Well, there was, there was a Smurfs thing at Kings Dominion in Virginia, which I think

572
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:58,104
they did build at some of the other parks, but not for very long.

573
00:24:58,124 --> 00:25:06,004
Some Smurfs thing, but no, I know, but I for sure remember if I like the, the, if I could

574
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:10,044
crystallize my childhood memory, I pretty sure it involves the chug a chug machine.

575
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:15,344
I think I remember a crazy Rube Goldberg machine and a bunch of bears kind of like rotating

576
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:16,024
around.

577
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:21,364
So I know, and I, and so I feel if you went on this one, it was an actual ride in the

578
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:22,104
full thing.

579
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:25,964
It must've loomed very strong in the memory banks.

580
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:32,344
I mean, it's, it's the sights, the sounds that had a great theme song, the, it, it smelled,

581
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:34,684
the ride smelled like boysenberry pie.

582
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:43,024
So all every sense is triggered and, and, uh, where to begin?

583
00:25:43,204 --> 00:25:47,924
This there's, there's so much, uh, I, yeah.

584
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:48,164
Okay.

585
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:50,384
Well, so we are all right.

586
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:57,704
It's, it's 74 and Mary, Marion, not, uh, not's daughter, the daughter of the youngest daughter

587
00:25:57,704 --> 00:26:02,624
of the youngest daughter, which we need to acknowledge that a Marion is Marion is the

588
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,424
name of a type of Berry and it's spelled like a Marion Berry.

589
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:12,704
So they named her clearly after there's no way they were like, well, we, what if we called

590
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:13,364
her Marion?

591
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:19,084
Not choice to pursue the family business.

592
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:25,044
So we like be looming over her from day one and to create a ride where everyone else,

593
00:26:25,044 --> 00:26:27,704
all the names are also very, very based.

594
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:32,704
So, well, I don't understand, like there, there, maybe you can clear this up.

595
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:36,924
They had a giant space for a ride, but no ride.

596
00:26:37,284 --> 00:26:41,464
Like this was because with this, the positioning of this thing is really strange and it's a show

597
00:26:41,464 --> 00:26:41,704
building.

598
00:26:41,884 --> 00:26:44,984
It's still there to this day where the ride voyage to the iron reef is.

599
00:26:45,164 --> 00:26:50,604
And it's on, it's, it's all on the second floor of a massive show building, but that's what I

600
00:26:50,604 --> 00:26:53,164
can, they built it and then weren't, didn't know what to do.

601
00:26:53,204 --> 00:26:54,244
Why would you do that?

602
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:55,444
That's, that's odd to me.

603
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:57,084
They're taking a lot of missteps.

604
00:26:57,084 --> 00:27:02,524
I believe it was an arcade, but there's this area, that area, and it was one of the least

605
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:04,864
successful things they've ever done.

606
00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:06,504
It only lasted four years.

607
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:11,684
There is like this mountain where you climb onto the mountain, you go into a cave and then

608
00:27:11,684 --> 00:27:12,864
there's nothing inside.

609
00:27:13,104 --> 00:27:14,924
And he was just like, what is the point of this?

610
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:16,644
There's like, yeah.

611
00:27:16,684 --> 00:27:23,164
So they were kind of, they were really looking for something to do with that, that area.

612
00:27:23,324 --> 00:27:27,704
There's just people and like, you know, they look like what the gummy bears wear.

613
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:30,884
That's, that's an odd, like, and they're just people.

614
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:35,484
There's no, like, these are your new lovable characters, just somebody in a smock or whatever.

615
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:37,584
Yeah, very odd.

616
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:40,544
And there was, oh my God, just a mountain with nothing yet.

617
00:27:40,544 --> 00:27:45,384
So there's this massive area of the park with no real attraction to justify it and they want

618
00:27:45,384 --> 00:27:46,884
to drive traffic to it.

619
00:27:46,884 --> 00:27:47,344
Yeah.

620
00:27:48,364 --> 00:27:52,804
And thus, and, and, and also in this same snippet, I copy pasted from what you gave us.

621
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:56,604
That it is a 20,000 square foot show.

622
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:57,004
Huge.

623
00:27:57,184 --> 00:27:57,384
Yeah.

624
00:27:57,444 --> 00:28:01,524
And as you said, the dark rides in fantasy land are 10,000 square feet.

625
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:03,704
So this is twice as big as your Snow White.

626
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:06,604
So they have an opportunity to do something huge here.

627
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:12,044
And it just so happened, you know, one of the Disney Imagineering's biggest legend,

628
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:19,064
Rilly Crump has just gotten back from another project and didn't have anything going on.

629
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:20,224
Was he doing something?

630
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:24,244
Was he like making something in China that didn't happen or a Chinese themed attraction?

631
00:28:24,564 --> 00:28:25,264
Circus World.

632
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,464
Oh, Circus is what I thought.

633
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:27,084
Yeah.

634
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:27,324
Yeah.

635
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:29,644
It's his pre or post Marvel McFay.

636
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:31,024
Do you remember what year that was?

637
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:31,724
I don't know.

638
00:28:31,724 --> 00:28:32,784
I don't know.

639
00:28:32,784 --> 00:28:33,344
I'll look it up later.

640
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:38,584
But he's this like, yeah, we've talked about him before, especially if you go back to our

641
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:43,284
Haunted Mansion, like Origins episode, our star slowly stepped through part one of Haunted Mansion.

642
00:28:43,944 --> 00:28:44,124
Yeah.

643
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:48,824
He's so unique and psychedelic and responsible for Marvel McFay, who we really loved.

644
00:28:48,824 --> 00:28:54,024
Seems like he has a thing for deeply earnest characters mixed with psychedelic,

645
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:55,244
a mixed return of the century.

646
00:28:55,464 --> 00:28:56,744
And I found another thing.

647
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:01,004
Did any of you guys come across or have you heard in general of another

648
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:05,164
crump design thing called Tex Critters pizza jamboree?

649
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:07,644
I know I don't have any other.

650
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,084
I've seen that, though, but I don't know.

651
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:11,224
I don't know the story.

652
00:29:11,304 --> 00:29:13,584
There's not much more beyond photos, I don't think.

653
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:14,504
And not a lot of.

654
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:18,804
And it's even unclear to archivists of this stuff where there even was one.

655
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:24,684
I think there was a giant one in El Paso, Texas, that was like a proof of concept to do more.

656
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:27,364
It was part of like a mini golf kind of thing.

657
00:29:28,144 --> 00:29:33,964
But yeah, Texas is a dragon and joined by Foxy Roxy and Country Cowl and Skeeter,

658
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:34,584
the rattlesnake.

659
00:29:35,004 --> 00:29:41,584
And they're just like, and knowing this style, it's weird that we didn't know about this already.

660
00:29:41,964 --> 00:29:43,304
Well, like it's the most up.

661
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:46,584
We're all we're all rock of fire fans here.

662
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,324
We're all Chuck fans here.

663
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:52,264
So that he made, oh, my God, a pizza jamboree.

664
00:29:52,504 --> 00:29:57,144
And the other one more Raleigh Crump thing that I forgot about until I read an interview with him.

665
00:29:57,764 --> 00:29:58,464
Ernie Ball.

666
00:29:58,884 --> 00:29:59,964
He was the designer.

667
00:30:00,324 --> 00:30:06,124
If you get Ernie Ball guitar strings or other accessories, that psychedelic logo is Raleigh Crump.

668
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:10,164
Oh, Raleigh Crump is really like I think I probably said this on the Marmalade.

669
00:30:10,324 --> 00:30:16,324
He like feels like there's he's like some regular cartoonist mixed with like Jack Kirby,

670
00:30:17,704 --> 00:30:23,044
psychedelic 70s cosmic stuff like the color palette Kirby used and like new gods stuff

671
00:30:23,044 --> 00:30:24,944
and all the way far out stuff.

672
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,424
It's like the perfect blend of it.

673
00:30:27,524 --> 00:30:28,024
We got it.

674
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:29,164
We should get Raleigh.

675
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:30,404
We should figure this out.

676
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:31,164
He's still around.

677
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:31,804
We can do it.

678
00:30:31,884 --> 00:30:35,504
Yeah, he's done exhibits and he just that big LA Times.

679
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:38,504
Todd Martin's wrote that big LA Times profile about him.

680
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:38,764
Oh, good.

681
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:39,084
Yeah.

682
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:39,364
Okay.

683
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:41,264
So he's he's free.

684
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:44,544
He's given free rein essentially to do whatever he wants.

685
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:47,124
It's a pretty IP free park.

686
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:50,344
So it's on him to figure something out, though.

687
00:30:50,444 --> 00:30:52,744
There's also a lot of stipulations.

688
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:56,604
It seems like he keeps in a studio notes way.

689
00:30:56,664 --> 00:30:57,544
He keeps getting thrown.

690
00:30:57,584 --> 00:31:00,264
Do whatever you want, but it's got to be this and it's got to be this.

691
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:06,224
Yeah, he got a script that was just a very simple like a little boy and his donkey go

692
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:08,784
to the fair and that was it.

693
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:14,204
So he's like, okay, well, he started embellishing that script and adding things

694
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:15,464
and creating characters.

695
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:16,924
And then they test.

696
00:31:17,124 --> 00:31:23,584
There are some bears in his idea and they wanted to test everything with like a marketing

697
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:25,844
firm is like the bears tested very well.

698
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:32,424
So then suddenly all the human characters on the ride became bear characters and foxes

699
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,644
and rabbits and stuff like that.

700
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:38,764
And then I think at one point he was just all right, let me do my thing.

701
00:31:38,824 --> 00:31:43,304
No more testing like just telling them to go stop.

702
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:48,964
Well, I'll say he's also like, you know, I come from Disney and even with all the oversight

703
00:31:48,964 --> 00:31:50,904
of Disney, they don't test stuff.

704
00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:53,544
If Walt did whatever his instinct was.

705
00:31:54,344 --> 00:31:58,224
And they also they had the opening lockdown.

706
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,444
Is that is that correct?

707
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:03,444
They had the opening lockdown and it was going to be in an area called the roaring 20s.

708
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,424
They were going to re theme that as as they're developing knots,

709
00:32:06,604 --> 00:32:09,344
buried tails, that area turned into that.

710
00:32:09,364 --> 00:32:10,984
They came up with the roaring 20s.

711
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:12,404
So they're building bolt.

712
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:15,444
They're building the ride and the new area at the same time.

713
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:19,824
So it also then become important later on in the story.

714
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:20,524
OK, sure.

715
00:32:20,744 --> 00:32:26,884
He's going nuts on designs and empowering other artists to do great stuff and like

716
00:32:26,884 --> 00:32:31,904
well, things are going well, but I don't know if this is the point to talk about the disaster

717
00:32:31,904 --> 00:32:34,624
on the way to the opening of the ride.

718
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:39,384
The the little fire.

719
00:32:39,784 --> 00:32:40,304
Inferno.

720
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:41,264
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:47,044
Well, he he had hired this guy named Tommy O'Neill, who had a company called Fantasy

722
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:50,904
Fair that did all the window attractions at Disneyland.

723
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:53,704
OK, and said, I want you to be my guide.

724
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:55,144
I actually build this ride.

725
00:32:55,164 --> 00:32:57,964
And he said, I don't think I've never built a ride before.

726
00:32:58,084 --> 00:32:59,264
I don't know about this.

727
00:32:59,384 --> 00:33:01,424
Had to be persuaded a little bit.

728
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:02,984
They get them on board.

729
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:08,924
They need a bigger space because Fantasy Fair, his studio was in Hollywood on Santa

730
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:12,144
Boulevard, didn't have enough space.

731
00:33:12,444 --> 00:33:19,544
They bought like a warehouse in Glendale on San Fernando Road that was approximately

732
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:24,444
20,000 feet square feet, the same as what the ride would be.

733
00:33:24,664 --> 00:33:26,564
So they start building right there.

734
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:31,804
It got to the point where it was time to start moving stuff over into the show building at

735
00:33:33,164 --> 00:33:42,704
And they got worried because Fantasy Fair was a non-union endeavor and and not hired

736
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:47,704
union workers to to make over the roaring 20s area.

737
00:33:47,864 --> 00:33:53,184
So they said, let's wait till they're done with their work and then we'll move everything

738
00:33:53,184 --> 00:33:53,644
over.

739
00:33:54,004 --> 00:33:55,924
And Mary and not said, oh, no, it's fine.

740
00:33:55,944 --> 00:33:56,664
I'll talk to them.

741
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:58,104
There won't be any problems.

742
00:33:58,484 --> 00:34:01,784
Oh, and it's so it's the

743
00:34:01,844 --> 00:34:03,044
Union people.

744
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:03,584
Yes.

745
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:04,684
Set the bill.

746
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:09,704
Someone on the union side set the building on fire as to send a message to the non-union

747
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:11,604
and there were like five fires, right?

748
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:19,084
Yes. March 27th, 1975, when when they're just a few like getting very close to opening and

749
00:34:19,084 --> 00:34:22,324
they've already installed about 50 to 75 percent of their ride.

750
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:30,024
Fire breaks out and five different places and it's definitely arson and it's and they

751
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:34,044
never caught the person who did it despite the fact that she put up a reward.

752
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:42,264
It was definitely union people having a grievance with non-union people coming into their domain

753
00:34:42,264 --> 00:34:46,244
and they only got a six week extension to rebuild.

754
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:49,144
They wanted open on 4th of July, 1975.

755
00:34:49,544 --> 00:34:52,124
So they had to work like around the clock.

756
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:53,024
It's crazy.

757
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,024
I don't know how they do it.

758
00:34:55,364 --> 00:34:59,484
I mean, also, Marian, you don't talk, right?

759
00:34:59,484 --> 00:35:00,264
You pay.

760
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:03,284
That's how you solve those disputes.

761
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:07,464
Jersey expertise.

762
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:09,424
You got to pay them off.

763
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:12,824
Then they'll look the other way.

764
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:19,924
I don't know how it got done so fast without this, let alone with without a fire.

765
00:35:20,044 --> 00:35:23,904
Let's say that it was from concept to completion in six months.

766
00:35:23,964 --> 00:35:28,564
That includes the six week extension that they were given after the fire broke out.

767
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:32,904
The animatronics weren't so sophisticated, but they were animatronics.

768
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:33,984
Yeah.

769
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:39,264
I don't think, I think maybe the animatronics were the only things that didn't get burned

770
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,104
because those are the last things to come in.

771
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:43,964
So we're talking about the set pieces.

772
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:45,744
We're talking about the fake rocks.

773
00:35:45,804 --> 00:35:47,644
We're talking about the chug a chug machine.

774
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:49,924
Oh man, the beloved fake rocks got burned.

775
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:50,764
Fake rocks.

776
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:51,244
Yeah.

777
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:52,224
Geez.

778
00:35:53,464 --> 00:35:56,364
So they just pick up and keep working.

779
00:35:56,504 --> 00:36:01,244
They get a minor extension and then they, all right, let's keep blowing in.

780
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:04,504
And they're just, you know, they're just staying up to three o'clock in the morning

781
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:09,944
every single night, you know, bringing over a six pack of beer and a bag of hamburgers

782
00:36:09,944 --> 00:36:12,364
and just going for it.

783
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:14,784
God, that's how we get this show done.

784
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:19,644
I constantly have a greasy sack of hamburgers I just reach into.

785
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:24,704
It sounded like, yeah, the knots were like, no, we'll send,

786
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,624
people can enjoy the rubble.

787
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:31,424
They can enjoy the char if we're getting this open, even if it's ashes.

788
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:36,504
Yeah, so odd, but they keep, they keep going and it opens without,

789
00:36:36,804 --> 00:36:39,264
stop me if I'm ever missing anything, but.

790
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:42,464
And the ride opens the 4th of July, 1975.

791
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:46,204
And it's awesome.

792
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:51,464
It's successful on the whole new roaring 20s of air is amazing and

793
00:36:51,464 --> 00:36:54,524
attendance increases at the park by 52%.

794
00:36:57,004 --> 00:36:59,224
And let's talk about the ride itself.

795
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,284
Yeah, yeah, it's it's just it's it's magical.

796
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:04,324
It's so much fun.

797
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:05,024
It's delightful.

798
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:07,464
This storybook tells the story of the ride.

799
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:11,864
And I was saying before we started recording, what if you had what a delight to like ride

800
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:14,044
this ride and get off like, I want a souvenir.

801
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:14,924
I want to remember that.

802
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,304
And then you had this great story.

803
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:19,544
It's like a really solid, nice piece.

804
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:21,904
And like the argument is so delightful inside.

805
00:37:21,904 --> 00:37:26,204
Well, I imagine, Doug, you're saying like when you wrote it, you were like,

806
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:29,024
oh, there's going to be shows and TV things.

807
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:33,224
And like, I feel like any of the good, like exclusive theme park rides

808
00:37:33,224 --> 00:37:34,844
that have characters that are only in the parks,

809
00:37:35,524 --> 00:37:37,884
you're naturally like imagining the full world.

810
00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:41,904
It's opening up your imagination of like what else is going on in this universe.

811
00:37:41,904 --> 00:37:46,264
And so like this is a nice I mean, I'm assuming there's probably other versions of like,

812
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:48,904
maybe there was a Haunted Mansion book or something, but this is like you would take

813
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:51,164
here's a little more piece is a little extra.

814
00:37:51,224 --> 00:37:52,764
Like taking part of the ride.

815
00:37:52,844 --> 00:37:55,384
Oh, it's always nice to have something you could take home with you.

816
00:37:55,544 --> 00:37:55,804
Sure.

817
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:57,124
But this actually is like a narrative.

818
00:37:57,124 --> 00:37:58,624
This is a narrative at least.

819
00:37:58,644 --> 00:37:58,824
Yeah.

820
00:37:58,824 --> 00:37:59,584
I mean, it's similar to the ride.

821
00:37:59,824 --> 00:38:03,924
I was talking about the souvenir book that they sold called Journey to the Fair,

822
00:38:04,124 --> 00:38:04,804
Knott's Berry Tales.

823
00:38:04,884 --> 00:38:09,424
It's one of the few bits of merch that you could you could find from this ride.

824
00:38:09,584 --> 00:38:13,984
And you know, that Knott's style, it's like it's like a whole book that looks like the

825
00:38:13,984 --> 00:38:14,924
Knott's logo.

826
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:15,524
Yeah.

827
00:38:15,524 --> 00:38:24,044
That just like calming, curly Q kind of it like feels very it's just such Americana.

828
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:29,344
Knott's very much was like they were playing into the all the nostalgia around the

829
00:38:29,344 --> 00:38:32,204
bicentennial 70s by way of old timey.

830
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:35,444
Can we start by talking about the names of the characters?

831
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:36,884
That seems to make sense.

832
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:41,444
Because we're following a family of bears to a fair is the basic.

833
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,504
That's the basic tenet of the ride.

834
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:44,604
Yeah.

835
00:38:44,784 --> 00:38:48,084
So there's the would you even say patriarch?

836
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:48,924
That's the father.

837
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:50,844
What's the grandfather of a family's called?

838
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:51,764
Elder Berry.

839
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:53,024
Elder Berry is his name.

840
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:55,944
I was just looking for like what his title in the scheme of things.

841
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:57,464
What's the patriarch is?

842
00:38:57,724 --> 00:38:58,504
Poppa.

843
00:38:58,864 --> 00:38:59,064
Poppa.

844
00:38:59,064 --> 00:38:59,924
Let's call him Poppa.

845
00:38:59,924 --> 00:39:02,004
And then these are the adults, right?

846
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:03,404
These are the these are the parents.

847
00:39:03,644 --> 00:39:04,204
Is that right?

848
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:04,744
Yes.

849
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:05,304
Okay.

850
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:09,024
That's Flapper Berry and Raspberry.

851
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:12,044
And then the children.

852
00:39:13,044 --> 00:39:16,004
Girl sin Berry and Boy's sin Berry.

853
00:39:16,004 --> 00:39:18,784
And they make up the notson Berry family.

854
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,244
The notson Berry heroes.

855
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:26,424
And I was just trying to figure out is Jason Moore Raspberry or Boy's sin Berry?

856
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:29,184
Because I could see him both berries.

857
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:30,524
You know what I mean?

858
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:35,244
I guess I Sunday to wake up in your boys and Barry and Sundays to wake up in your

859
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:35,484
grasp.

860
00:39:35,844 --> 00:39:39,364
I think he's a Raspberry because Jason's a little bit of a stinker.

861
00:39:40,484 --> 00:39:42,264
I think that's the answer.

862
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:43,824
I'm looking for a little bit of a stinker.

863
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:45,224
I guess correctly.

864
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:45,884
Yeah.

865
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:50,744
Well, but also you share some traits in common with the villain of the tale.

866
00:39:51,244 --> 00:39:55,184
Well, you know, I am I empathize with crafty coyote.

867
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:56,604
Crafty coyote.

868
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:56,904
Yeah.

869
00:39:56,904 --> 00:40:02,044
He's trying to steal all the pies, all the boys and Barry pies throughout the ride.

870
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:03,944
So you are crafty, I guess.

871
00:40:05,624 --> 00:40:07,684
You're everyone in this story.

872
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,904
Very tales characters at once.

873
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:15,404
So we're in a world of bears and it seems like their lives are really guided and driven

874
00:40:15,404 --> 00:40:21,504
by the promise of the fair and by making boys and Barry pies to show off and sell at the fair.

875
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,444
Perhaps the win first place.

876
00:40:24,444 --> 00:40:27,884
Something to get guiding principle for the year.

877
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:31,144
It's such a simple story, but you know what's going on.

878
00:40:31,144 --> 00:40:36,784
You've talked in the past on the podcast about how so many Disney dark rides at fantasy land

879
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:39,804
are confusing because it's like, OK, I'm on the Snow White ride.

880
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:40,584
Where's Snow White?

881
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:42,264
Oh, I'm Snow White.

882
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:42,784
OK.

883
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:44,524
And then it's and then it ends.

884
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:47,824
So suddenly this this this ride is clear.

885
00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:52,344
It has a beginning, middle and end and a very satisfying ending.

886
00:40:53,124 --> 00:40:56,244
And you don't have to think you just you just enjoy it.

887
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:58,444
You just enjoy some mild peril.

888
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,104
It's never too scary.

889
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:00,524
Right.

890
00:41:00,684 --> 00:41:06,464
But the path to the fair has some trouble, but it all works out.

891
00:41:06,784 --> 00:41:07,664
Not a big problem.

892
00:41:07,944 --> 00:41:13,424
It's honestly I find the whole thing a little like it's kind of a proto Splash Mountain.

893
00:41:13,624 --> 00:41:14,184
Absolutely.

894
00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:17,904
Yeah, it's it's it's critters, it's banjo.

895
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:21,224
It's scary in the middle, but a big celebration at the end.

896
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,804
Because all the characters come together in the finale.

897
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:28,324
Because I'm like, when is America Sings open in the 70s?

898
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:29,524
And I feel like that's awesome.

899
00:41:29,684 --> 00:41:30,724
I'm 10 years after this.

900
00:41:30,724 --> 00:41:31,124
After this.

901
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:34,524
So this is before America Sings where all a lot of the characters from

902
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:36,204
America Sings ended up on Splash Mountain.

903
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:41,664
I wonder if that I like I wonder if there was some feeling of you guys kind of doing

904
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:44,484
a show with this this big like this country critter.

905
00:41:44,664 --> 00:41:47,024
Also post country bear jamboree.

906
00:41:47,024 --> 00:41:47,564
Right.

907
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:49,464
Oh, you're right.

908
00:41:49,684 --> 00:41:52,624
Oh, well, this is kind of the area everybody's dancing in.

909
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:55,304
Because people love country bears.

910
00:41:55,564 --> 00:41:56,784
That is a fact.

911
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:59,424
So we have our family.

912
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:02,084
We're going to head to the fair with them.

913
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:05,504
We're introduced to my favorite element, the chug of chug machine.

914
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:10,684
Like a good Rube Goldberg, which is so delightfully designed.

915
00:42:10,784 --> 00:42:15,604
I was you know, you were also not only did you send us a big list of

916
00:42:15,604 --> 00:42:19,064
big list of facts and notes about this attraction, you also sent us a video.

917
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:23,424
But you also said, please look at photos, because I think the video is not going to

918
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:24,564
give you the right idea.

919
00:42:24,564 --> 00:42:25,624
And you're absolutely right.

920
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:27,324
Because the video is a little murky.

921
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:32,024
This ride was not like at least in a way we can consume this right isn't archived

922
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:32,784
in the best way.

923
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:37,784
But I flipped through those photos to Erin and she was like, oh my god, like in love

924
00:42:37,784 --> 00:42:40,484
immediately, like seeing it lit and rendered nicely.

925
00:42:40,664 --> 00:42:41,904
Cutest design.

926
00:42:42,444 --> 00:42:43,084
So, so adorable.

927
00:42:43,524 --> 00:42:48,164
It's it's important to look at everything because the details that there's so many

928
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:52,784
details and but it's also important to remember that it was not lit up like that.

929
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:55,144
Like it is in the right through video in the right through video.

930
00:42:55,144 --> 00:42:57,604
They've got like the floodlight on the camcorder.

931
00:42:57,904 --> 00:42:58,164
Right.

932
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:05,244
Otherwise, it was pretty dimly lit and just neon, neon, neon, like everything glowed.

933
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:10,684
And that is as we go through, we'll walk everybody through the right through right now.

934
00:43:10,684 --> 00:43:15,684
So just keep that in mind that like everything was just fluorescent.

935
00:43:15,924 --> 00:43:20,124
Well, we should we talk about the Raleigh Crump fluorescent light thing, because this

936
00:43:20,124 --> 00:43:22,484
is one of the things that he wanted to do.

937
00:43:22,844 --> 00:43:26,464
Like Disney was very particular with the way the dark rides are done.

938
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:32,144
And Raleigh had always had this this lighting style he wanted to experiment with.

939
00:43:32,284 --> 00:43:35,144
And Disney just being stiff about stuff, wouldn't let it happen.

940
00:43:35,284 --> 00:43:36,584
And he had to pay it off here.

941
00:43:36,964 --> 00:43:37,444
That's right.

942
00:43:37,464 --> 00:43:41,104
He he always wanted to mix blacklight with incandescent light.

943
00:43:41,224 --> 00:43:46,264
And that's an idea he's kind of stole from the the Movieland Wax Museum right up the

944
00:43:46,264 --> 00:43:47,364
street in Bueno Park.

945
00:43:47,364 --> 00:43:48,104
Yeah.

946
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:51,104
And which, yeah, they were Disney was convinced it wouldn't work.

947
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:53,964
And he's like, there's a thing up the road that does it beautifully.

948
00:43:54,244 --> 00:43:54,704
Right, right.

949
00:43:54,704 --> 00:44:00,864
And isn't there this got to be something in Disney in the Disney universe that does

950
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:02,324
some amount of this.

951
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:05,164
Yeah, I'm trying to think like blacklight in general.

952
00:44:05,264 --> 00:44:08,264
What's that lighting style in in Avatar?

953
00:44:08,744 --> 00:44:09,564
The bioluminescence.

954
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:12,384
Oh, by the way, they're not afraid to use bioluminescent light.

955
00:44:12,544 --> 00:44:13,304
Yeah, it's true.

956
00:44:14,504 --> 00:44:15,124
I'm trying to think.

957
00:44:15,204 --> 00:44:18,184
I mean, there's like a little like there's like blacklight stuff on some of the dark

958
00:44:18,184 --> 00:44:23,624
rides on Splash Mountain has some dark some some regular lighting and blacklighting.

959
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:23,964
Yeah.

960
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,724
There's little pieces of it, but nothing, I guess, is as aggressive.

961
00:44:26,744 --> 00:44:30,644
This sounds like it was a very aggressive because he wanted you to be disoriented.

962
00:44:30,924 --> 00:44:32,204
Yeah, then we'll talk later on.

963
00:44:32,224 --> 00:44:36,424
There are parts where he specifically is messing with your eyes to give up.

964
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:39,564
He wants you to like rub your eyes because your eyes are fucked up.

965
00:44:39,564 --> 00:44:46,244
Yeah, that's something that Disney didn't never want to fuck up people's eyes on purpose.

966
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:47,564
Right.

967
00:44:48,804 --> 00:44:49,484
Well, that's important.

968
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:51,184
And then also this Raleigh Cross section.

969
00:44:51,184 --> 00:44:58,784
The thing where it's it's old timey mixed with 70s and but also like clearly there's like a

970
00:44:58,784 --> 00:45:00,004
stoner appeal for.

971
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:05,184
Yeah, that's what so the Jack Kirby comparison I keep going back to is because it's like

972
00:45:05,184 --> 00:45:10,724
he's a very it's a very classic cartoon style mixed with the time it was being created,

973
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:16,244
but being created by somebody who was an older man already at this point wasn't not super old,

974
00:45:16,304 --> 00:45:18,604
but like what a 40s maybe 50s.

975
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:19,144
Yeah.

976
00:45:19,144 --> 00:45:21,524
So like it's like it's old.

977
00:45:21,524 --> 00:45:27,964
It's clearly from like an old classic sort of style through this new druggy psychedelic lens,

978
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:30,024
which is what is so cool about it.

979
00:45:30,324 --> 00:45:35,524
OK, so where do we so we're the Chug Chug machine.

980
00:45:35,704 --> 00:45:37,784
We're hearing that we're smelling the boys and very.

981
00:45:38,044 --> 00:45:38,624
We're in the factory.

982
00:45:38,624 --> 00:45:43,084
They're making the boys and very and the jellies and the jams.

983
00:45:43,084 --> 00:45:44,244
Hard at work.

984
00:45:44,464 --> 00:45:46,304
You know, everything's spinning around.

985
00:45:47,004 --> 00:45:54,724
Uh, you've got the smoker 27, which is a reference to really he had his design studio

986
00:45:54,724 --> 00:45:58,364
designer 20s, uh, 27.

987
00:45:58,724 --> 00:45:59,744
OK, and.

988
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:02,004
And he was a smoker.

989
00:46:02,244 --> 00:46:04,304
Oh, OK, sure.

990
00:46:04,504 --> 00:46:07,764
Also like Jack Kirby, Jack Kirby famously showed on those big cigars.

991
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:08,324
Oh, yeah.

992
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:12,264
And when we say smoker, do we know what was really a weed guy?

993
00:46:12,364 --> 00:46:14,204
Like we would assume, you know.

994
00:46:14,284 --> 00:46:15,604
Oh, yeah, he's definitely.

995
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:20,724
While he was still at Disney, he was making drug related stuff on his own time

996
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:25,504
and like nudie stuff as well, stuff that he was hiding from Disney.

997
00:46:25,504 --> 00:46:29,744
And then I there's like a story where Disney comes from behind his back

998
00:46:29,744 --> 00:46:31,584
and he's like, oh, no, I'm fired.

999
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,484
And Disney laughs and pats him on the back.

1000
00:46:33,564 --> 00:46:34,624
He's like, keep up the great work.

1001
00:46:34,664 --> 00:46:35,544
I love it.

1002
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:41,104
And then later asked like, hey, that the the those those smoke box,

1003
00:46:41,104 --> 00:46:45,344
smoke paraphernalia artwork, can you send me some of that stuff?

1004
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,444
You were working on.

1005
00:46:46,644 --> 00:46:47,104
Wow, really?

1006
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,504
Yeah, I never heard that.

1007
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:48,784
Yeah.

1008
00:46:48,964 --> 00:46:50,964
Well, we all have to get high with Rolly.

1009
00:46:51,124 --> 00:46:51,964
I think that's the goal.

1010
00:46:52,084 --> 00:46:53,104
We do an interview with him.

1011
00:46:53,204 --> 00:46:55,164
And then we get high with him as well.

1012
00:46:55,184 --> 00:46:56,144
I mean, come on.

1013
00:46:56,544 --> 00:47:00,724
Yeah, that was I mean, that was one of the famously we were recording

1014
00:47:00,724 --> 00:47:04,524
this right around the time when Bob Iger put his foot in his mouth,

1015
00:47:04,544 --> 00:47:07,104
taking shots at Expedition Everest.

1016
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:09,864
But a few months ago, he got a lot of flack.

1017
00:47:10,004 --> 00:47:14,864
I thought undeservedly for like implying that Walt Disney was a bit of a lush.

1018
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:17,564
Walt Disney was a lush like it's called.

1019
00:47:17,564 --> 00:47:19,064
I call it space, babe.

1020
00:47:19,064 --> 00:47:20,524
Yeah, yeah.

1021
00:47:21,164 --> 00:47:25,564
So this chug a chug machine, which they is one of the things that completely

1022
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:31,264
burned down Christopher Crump, Rolly's son was basically this was his only job

1023
00:47:31,264 --> 00:47:35,904
was to build this amazing machine that just had like spinning gears and gizmos

1024
00:47:35,904 --> 00:47:36,804
and ping pong.

1025
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:38,784
There's a disco ball on top of it.

1026
00:47:38,784 --> 00:47:39,524
It's just incredible.

1027
00:47:39,744 --> 00:47:41,484
So that was completely lost.

1028
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:43,544
So it took him six months to make it.

1029
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:44,004
Oh, my God.

1030
00:47:44,004 --> 00:47:48,144
And then had me make it from scratch in six weeks.

1031
00:47:48,144 --> 00:47:48,564
God.

1032
00:47:48,924 --> 00:47:54,104
And then, you know, we go into the bakery kitchen where all these beavers are

1033
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:57,104
making some freshly baked boysenberry pies.

1034
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,164
And then we get our very first glimpse of our villain.

1035
00:48:00,164 --> 00:48:00,684
Yeah.

1036
00:48:00,684 --> 00:48:01,664
Crafty Coyote.

1037
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:07,644
No, he's he's he's reaching for a rack of pies trying to grab the one on the very top.

1038
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:11,804
And it was I believe that in the book and I don't remember if on the ride

1039
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:13,564
it says it's a cooling rack specifically.

1040
00:48:13,744 --> 00:48:19,004
It's just like a series of shelves for cooling pies, which is a piece of furniture

1041
00:48:19,004 --> 00:48:21,624
I assume Jason has in his.

1042
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:24,744
Is that true, Jason?

1043
00:48:25,964 --> 00:48:28,684
It does not maybe rack or two in the house.

1044
00:48:29,504 --> 00:48:31,004
A couple of different cooling racks.

1045
00:48:31,004 --> 00:48:32,644
I'll call you a pie lush.

1046
00:48:34,584 --> 00:48:37,184
That's fair.

1047
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:38,584
Well, I am what I am.

1048
00:48:40,344 --> 00:48:40,864
So.

1049
00:48:39,924 --> 00:48:45,604
And like I said, the smell of boysenberry throughout all of this delightful.

1050
00:48:45,604 --> 00:48:46,584
Oh, it's so fun.

1051
00:48:47,564 --> 00:48:47,624
Yeah.

1052
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:48,684
Crafty.

1053
00:48:48,764 --> 00:48:50,084
But now the threat is on.

1054
00:48:50,084 --> 00:48:50,324
Right.

1055
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:56,164
You're avoiding crafty Coyote at all because as you enter the frog forest, which I love

1056
00:48:56,164 --> 00:48:59,804
this guy, like I assume you can't see great in the video, but I assume it's all like frogs

1057
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,984
on wires that all like spring up at various.

1058
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:04,504
They're practicing for a jumping contest.

1059
00:49:04,504 --> 00:49:05,764
It's also at the fair.

1060
00:49:05,884 --> 00:49:06,284
Right.

1061
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:08,104
There's even a referee froggy.

1062
00:49:08,124 --> 00:49:09,764
He's judging them all.

1063
00:49:09,764 --> 00:49:10,544
That's great.

1064
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:12,864
And there's just frogs everywhere.

1065
00:49:12,944 --> 00:49:17,684
It's just like so dense and incredibly detailed and everything's glowing.

1066
00:49:18,564 --> 00:49:21,944
And and it's it's incredible.

1067
00:49:22,404 --> 00:49:23,684
This scene, there's so many.

1068
00:49:23,824 --> 00:49:25,444
I do wish it's really.

1069
00:49:25,744 --> 00:49:28,084
Hey, you made the point to us.

1070
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,584
Watching a video of the ride is not going on the ride.

1071
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:32,964
And clearly that is the case with this.

1072
00:49:32,964 --> 00:49:37,784
I do wish that we could experience this thing like with the with the lighting and then the

1073
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:39,464
sense the way it was meant to be.

1074
00:49:39,884 --> 00:49:42,224
Well, maybe we'll maybe we will someday.

1075
00:49:42,264 --> 00:49:43,024
We'll get to that.

1076
00:49:43,584 --> 00:49:44,364
Oh, good.

1077
00:49:44,504 --> 00:49:48,104
But now we head to the fortune teller camp.

1078
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:49,104
That's right.

1079
00:49:50,104 --> 00:49:54,004
Which is in an enchanted forest, kind of a continuation of the frog forest.

1080
00:49:54,044 --> 00:49:59,704
And we see fortune tellers and makeshift tents with 70 psychedelic floor prints on them.

1081
00:49:59,704 --> 00:50:04,364
We meet all kinds of interesting characters in this fortune teller camp.

1082
00:50:05,244 --> 00:50:11,544
Well, my favorite name of anybody is Zaz, Zaz the owl.

1083
00:50:12,284 --> 00:50:14,204
There's a couple signs of Zaz.

1084
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:14,824
Is that Zaz?

1085
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:15,544
That's Zaz.

1086
00:50:15,964 --> 00:50:16,104
Yeah, OK.

1087
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:17,084
Really like Zaz.

1088
00:50:17,324 --> 00:50:17,884
Yeah, Zaz is great.

1089
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:19,524
I thought he would look for the first time I was looking through.

1090
00:50:19,604 --> 00:50:23,024
I look like a little bit like a wizard, but I mean, it's a similar.

1091
00:50:23,904 --> 00:50:24,884
He sees things.

1092
00:50:25,184 --> 00:50:27,764
He does conducts floating music instruments.

1093
00:50:29,204 --> 00:50:30,124
That's cool.

1094
00:50:30,164 --> 00:50:32,924
There's a lot of cool effects in this.

1095
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,904
Sarah Skunk, who we meet, who's in a tent watching.

1096
00:50:36,484 --> 00:50:40,204
She's looking into her crystal ball, but she's not seeing into the future.

1097
00:50:40,424 --> 00:50:42,524
She's watching an old Western movie.

1098
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:44,004
That's a funny little gag.

1099
00:50:45,264 --> 00:50:49,504
We meet that Thelma frog, who's a palm reader.

1100
00:50:49,684 --> 00:50:54,724
We meet Wanda Fox, who is standing on the side, her magic teacups that are spouting

1101
00:50:54,944 --> 00:51:00,244
intensive steam and an animated projection turns the steam into a ghost.

1102
00:51:00,464 --> 00:51:02,704
And this is a very cool visual effect.

1103
00:51:03,264 --> 00:51:07,244
So like, keep in mind, this is this is the guy who worked on the Haunted Mansion,

1104
00:51:07,384 --> 00:51:11,624
which has a lot of cool visual effects before you even get on the ride when you're just

1105
00:51:11,624 --> 00:51:13,364
walking down through the queue.

1106
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:19,844
And here he is trying to to to outdo himself to or at least top top what he did on the

1107
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:20,464
Haunted Mansion.

1108
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:22,324
And in a pre digital era.

1109
00:51:22,324 --> 00:51:26,984
So you were these are effects that are tapping back into like turn of the century magic

1110
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:29,264
and right now projecting on steam clouds.

1111
00:51:29,264 --> 00:51:31,724
Yeah, that that YouTube video is really cool.

1112
00:51:32,664 --> 00:51:39,264
So he enlists this magician named Leo Benke, who is a guy who opened up the Merlin's magic

1113
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:41,724
shop at Disneyland and managed it.

1114
00:51:41,984 --> 00:51:44,084
It's not the current magic shop.

1115
00:51:44,164 --> 00:51:46,704
There used to be two magic shops at Disneyland.

1116
00:51:47,624 --> 00:51:49,204
Steve Martin worked at both of them.

1117
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:50,744
He talks about this in his book.

1118
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:52,604
He worked there was more than one.

1119
00:51:52,604 --> 00:51:53,464
He worked at both.

1120
00:51:53,464 --> 00:51:53,964
Yeah.

1121
00:51:54,204 --> 00:52:00,764
So he enlisted this this magician to help him like hash out these visual effects and

1122
00:52:00,764 --> 00:52:02,064
how they were going to pull them off.

1123
00:52:02,464 --> 00:52:06,424
And they're they're really cool, especially for nineteen seventy five.

1124
00:52:06,444 --> 00:52:08,164
They're pretty impressive.

1125
00:52:08,824 --> 00:52:10,324
We'll talk about more.

1126
00:52:10,524 --> 00:52:15,184
And there's more in in some of the upcoming scenes.

1127
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:22,144
As we leave the Fortune Teller camp, we catch a glimpse of Crafty Coyote who's sleeping

1128
00:52:22,144 --> 00:52:24,524
off a tummy ache from all the pies he's stolen.

1129
00:52:25,044 --> 00:52:25,484
Oh, right.

1130
00:52:25,484 --> 00:52:27,704
This was my favorite part of the ride.

1131
00:52:27,924 --> 00:52:29,564
This is my favorite.

1132
00:52:29,804 --> 00:52:35,084
I was starting to jug sent that and then I was writing an email like I got to think of

1133
00:52:35,084 --> 00:52:35,904
a good Jason joke.

1134
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:39,244
And you had already got an alert new message from Jason.

1135
00:52:39,444 --> 00:52:41,744
Yeah, you were right to it.

1136
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:47,224
Yeah, I, you know, had a Shake Shack burger and shake at lunch, starting to feel like

1137
00:52:47,224 --> 00:52:48,404
Crafty Coyote myself.

1138
00:52:48,504 --> 00:52:50,504
Oh, I've noticed you've been yawning like crazy.

1139
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:51,384
Oh, it's fine.

1140
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:52,464
No, no, it's great.

1141
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:54,384
No, the food you're not.

1142
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:55,804
I know you're not like checking out.

1143
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:57,884
It's just the food affects you.

1144
00:52:58,024 --> 00:53:00,044
You think it affects everyone?

1145
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,484
I know, but more so you.

1146
00:53:01,584 --> 00:53:03,424
So it was a hearty milkshake.

1147
00:53:03,744 --> 00:53:10,524
But give Jason credit as he currently is not he doesn't have his shirt open and displayed

1148
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:12,624
out and crumbs all over his belly.

1149
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:14,624
No, I'm just for once.

1150
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:18,824
Just hold up in a near fetal position looking at my iPad.

1151
00:53:19,944 --> 00:53:27,144
This scene with Crafty Coyote passed out to this to me is kind of like the the dog with

1152
00:53:27,144 --> 00:53:30,284
the keys in his mouth and from the jail cell pyres of Caribbean.

1153
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:34,344
This to me is like the iconic scene that you go home with.

1154
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:38,064
You're still laughing and thinking about it when you're when you're on your way home.

1155
00:53:38,204 --> 00:53:40,344
So then you enter the Thunder Cave.

1156
00:53:40,524 --> 00:53:43,424
With ominous signs telling to go back and beware.

1157
00:53:43,964 --> 00:53:49,084
And this is a part of the ride where it gets dark and the rocks are shining and they shoot

1158
00:53:49,084 --> 00:53:52,464
strobe lights on the rocks and into your eyes.

1159
00:53:52,544 --> 00:53:56,624
And this is deliberately meant to mess up your eyes.

1160
00:53:56,844 --> 00:53:57,684
Seizure, seizure.

1161
00:53:57,884 --> 00:53:59,604
You're going down a steep decline.

1162
00:54:00,064 --> 00:54:04,124
So you are actually going down onto the first floor at this point.

1163
00:54:04,584 --> 00:54:05,084
Oh, OK.

1164
00:54:05,144 --> 00:54:06,704
Oh, they do utilize that.

1165
00:54:07,184 --> 00:54:10,144
This is free nights and white satin ride.

1166
00:54:11,004 --> 00:54:11,964
I love it.

1167
00:54:11,964 --> 00:54:13,604
Disorienting dark ride.

1168
00:54:14,024 --> 00:54:17,344
There was a psychedelic ride before that.

1169
00:54:17,344 --> 00:54:18,124
Wow.

1170
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:18,604
Wow.

1171
00:54:18,824 --> 00:54:18,924
Crazy.

1172
00:54:19,704 --> 00:54:23,044
That's been which probably kids must have freaked out in that thing.

1173
00:54:23,204 --> 00:54:24,204
So it seems scary.

1174
00:54:24,324 --> 00:54:26,904
People must have had like an epileptic fit.

1175
00:54:26,924 --> 00:54:27,664
Must have.

1176
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,044
It must have because we covered up at the time.

1177
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:30,324
Right.

1178
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:33,824
And like there wasn't a name for the thing they were experiencing.

1179
00:54:34,044 --> 00:54:36,884
And they're allowed to sit down and give them a glass of water.

1180
00:54:37,144 --> 00:54:38,064
It'll be fine.

1181
00:54:39,024 --> 00:54:39,904
Have a smoke, kid.

1182
00:54:40,044 --> 00:54:45,184
All these spiders are just like start lowering themselves over your head,

1183
00:54:45,424 --> 00:54:47,304
like just barely almost within reach.

1184
00:54:47,944 --> 00:54:49,824
And I know I would freak out.

1185
00:54:49,984 --> 00:54:50,084
Yeah.

1186
00:54:50,084 --> 00:54:50,544
Oh, yeah.

1187
00:54:51,064 --> 00:54:52,704
Like bad trip waiting to happen.

1188
00:54:52,844 --> 00:54:53,084
Yeah.

1189
00:54:53,264 --> 00:54:53,684
Yeah.

1190
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:53,864
Yeah.

1191
00:54:53,864 --> 00:54:56,664
This is Raleigh going, hey, ease off actually.

1192
00:54:56,744 --> 00:54:58,084
Be careful with those drugs.

1193
00:54:58,244 --> 00:54:59,484
This is when you got the bad stuff.

1194
00:55:03,144 --> 00:55:07,824
So the spider tail leads you into the weird woods.

1195
00:55:08,344 --> 00:55:11,744
Weird woods, which your eyes will still be adjusting to.

1196
00:55:11,744 --> 00:55:12,324
Exactly.

1197
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:13,324
Weirder.

1198
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:18,444
This is all those messing with your eyes was so that everything in the weird

1199
00:55:18,444 --> 00:55:22,204
woods would look even weirder than it already does.

1200
00:55:22,564 --> 00:55:22,964
Oh my God.

1201
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:23,904
I'm sorry.

1202
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:24,944
Yeah.

1203
00:55:24,944 --> 00:55:28,884
I was just going to say like in that one Raleigh interview that came out recently,

1204
00:55:29,004 --> 00:55:32,004
he keeps like stressing how he wants Disneyland to be weird.

1205
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:35,344
Like the word weird is like his favorite thing, I think.

1206
00:55:35,404 --> 00:55:36,504
Disneyland weird.

1207
00:55:37,064 --> 00:55:37,564
Exactly.

1208
00:55:37,964 --> 00:55:39,524
He wants everything weird.

1209
00:55:39,524 --> 00:55:42,404
So the weird woods is like he's getting his wish.

1210
00:55:42,404 --> 00:55:43,844
I hear what he's saying.

1211
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:44,484
Of course.

1212
00:55:44,704 --> 00:55:45,024
Yeah.

1213
00:55:45,064 --> 00:55:45,404
Yeah.

1214
00:55:45,404 --> 00:55:45,884
Why not?

1215
00:55:46,044 --> 00:55:47,744
You know, yeah, it is a little odd that we are in.

1216
00:55:47,964 --> 00:55:53,904
I'm a defender of IPs more than I'm not, but I do, I don't know.

1217
00:55:54,904 --> 00:55:57,924
Like it does feel like maybe we've departed from the world where theme parks are.

1218
00:55:57,984 --> 00:56:03,504
Like this ride is going to be kind of this like this one artist's like singular.

1219
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:05,924
Like we're going to let him just go to town.

1220
00:56:06,344 --> 00:56:11,684
Like you don't hear about like this designer who did the hell out of this part of Avatar or whatever.

1221
00:56:12,364 --> 00:56:14,364
It's very, I don't know.

1222
00:56:14,864 --> 00:56:17,764
Like given artists free rein would be a nice thing to keep alive in the Disney parks.

1223
00:56:17,764 --> 00:56:20,284
There's so many quality check levels now.

1224
00:56:20,524 --> 00:56:27,584
Do you get the delight that comes from, you know, creativity being the,

1225
00:56:27,744 --> 00:56:29,144
or no, what's the phrase?

1226
00:56:29,604 --> 00:56:31,884
Necessity is the mother of invention.

1227
00:56:32,124 --> 00:56:32,684
Is that right?

1228
00:56:33,044 --> 00:56:34,044
That's a phrase, yeah.

1229
00:56:34,084 --> 00:56:34,724
That is a phrase.

1230
00:56:35,204 --> 00:56:39,464
But I feel like so often in theme, a lot of the stuff that lingers in theme parks,

1231
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:41,864
he's from like, well, we needed to do this.

1232
00:56:41,924 --> 00:56:45,104
We didn't have a ton of time or a ton of money.

1233
00:56:45,824 --> 00:56:47,204
And am I confusing things?

1234
00:56:47,264 --> 00:56:53,364
Is really crump the guy who did, who did make those like paper mache type animals in,

1235
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:54,404
in it's a small world.

1236
00:56:54,764 --> 00:56:55,224
I think so.

1237
00:56:55,224 --> 00:57:00,104
Because like, I'm sorry if I'm mixing up facts, but like Mary Blair ish design, but then it's all,

1238
00:57:00,204 --> 00:57:04,104
it's like her and his like the animals had to be done extremely quickly.

1239
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,064
Yeah.

1240
00:57:05,524 --> 00:57:12,424
He helped construct it, but the, the ride itself is from Mary Blair's designs and concepts.

1241
00:57:12,484 --> 00:57:18,184
She's pretty much like, they pretty much let her to go to town on that and do whatever she

1242
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,644
wanted with that with very little input.

1243
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:27,984
However, when the ride moved from the, uh, world's fair in 64, they packed it up in a

1244
00:57:27,984 --> 00:57:29,684
truck and moved it to Anaheim.

1245
00:57:29,844 --> 00:57:32,404
They had to create a new facade for the ride.

1246
00:57:33,084 --> 00:57:37,264
Uh, an exterior that wasn't at the world's fair.

1247
00:57:37,264 --> 00:57:41,864
And that's when they kind of brushed her to the side.

1248
00:57:41,864 --> 00:57:44,384
She had come up with a concept and they rejected it.

1249
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:50,544
So they went to Roli and they were like, Hey, can you design the facade of it's small world?

1250
00:57:50,544 --> 00:57:56,604
And he did it based on her designs so that it would all be uniform, have a uniform look.

1251
00:57:56,604 --> 00:58:00,584
Oh, he felt bad because she was really upset that they rejected it.

1252
00:58:00,584 --> 00:58:04,244
So he actually consulted with her as he was designing it.

1253
00:58:04,364 --> 00:58:05,844
He would call her on the phone.

1254
00:58:05,924 --> 00:58:07,044
He'd send her a sketch.

1255
00:58:07,204 --> 00:58:10,484
Like he drew a little, he asked her, I think, draw me a little clock.

1256
00:58:10,564 --> 00:58:11,744
Like, how would you draw a clock?

1257
00:58:11,744 --> 00:58:12,624
And she sent to him.

1258
00:58:12,624 --> 00:58:16,024
And then he would just, he just put that right in as the clock is the centerpiece.

1259
00:58:16,904 --> 00:58:18,344
Oh, we missed all this.

1260
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:18,724
Yeah.

1261
00:58:18,724 --> 00:58:19,464
Oh my God.

1262
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:25,324
Well, this is cause you know, uh, so next time you take a, a photo of the front of it's

1263
00:58:25,324 --> 00:58:29,364
a small world, hashtag Roli Crump, not Mary Blair.

1264
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:36,344
And then he's doing all this after they just like destroyed his tower of the four winds

1265
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:39,084
that used to be, uh, at the world's fair.

1266
00:58:39,084 --> 00:58:41,804
They did not opt to bring that to Anaheim.

1267
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:42,324
Yeah.

1268
00:58:42,944 --> 00:58:44,964
He, uh, he went at work.

1269
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:51,224
I mean, Disney passed away in 66 and that's, I think when he was like, you guys are, I'm out.

1270
00:58:51,984 --> 00:58:56,304
Like, uh, didn't like the direction that they were going in.

1271
00:58:56,864 --> 00:59:00,324
Uh, well, I think, you know, like, I think we've,

1272
00:59:01,184 --> 00:59:05,864
clearly our appreciation for knots has grown a lot while we've been doing this podcast and

1273
00:59:05,864 --> 00:59:07,244
the trip that we got to take there.

1274
00:59:07,264 --> 00:59:11,564
And it's occurring to me that for what we experienced about those mazes is that, you

1275
00:59:11,564 --> 00:59:13,884
know, those are like, those are seasonal.

1276
00:59:14,064 --> 00:59:18,664
They're not up all year, but like we were walking around those mazes with the guy who

1277
00:59:18,664 --> 00:59:20,484
did it and it was like, go to town.

1278
00:59:21,284 --> 00:59:24,444
And, and with the, so the, and I think in general, it didn't, weren't we talking to

1279
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:28,864
somebody else who, uh, one of the people we talked to, I feel like was a Disney expat

1280
00:59:28,864 --> 00:59:32,824
who is allowed to do whatever or who has much more free reign at knots.

1281
00:59:32,844 --> 00:59:33,884
And that's why they like working there.

1282
00:59:34,044 --> 00:59:38,184
So I think not to be very wise to keep going in that direction.

1283
00:59:38,184 --> 00:59:43,404
And like, it does feel like where that spirit is still alive of this massive, uh, uh, you

1284
00:59:43,404 --> 00:59:46,344
know, show experience is a guy's singular vision.

1285
00:59:46,344 --> 00:59:50,424
And like, you know, that might mean it's a little sloppy or weird in parts, but it's

1286
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:53,444
going to be like, like nothing you would experience anywhere else.

1287
00:59:53,444 --> 00:59:53,644
Yeah.

1288
00:59:53,644 --> 00:59:57,744
I mean, that more than even Disney, even the classic stuff that's original IP,

1289
00:59:57,784 --> 00:59:59,984
Disney is like multiple people.

1290
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:04,884
Like how to mention is multiple people's vision all put together in a nice cohesive package,

1291
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:09,264
but it does seem like this specifically, and then these, your mazes you're talking about,

1292
01:00:09,284 --> 01:00:14,324
like there's even more room at knots for like it just to be the auteur theory of, of the

1293
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:14,664
ride.

1294
01:00:15,084 --> 01:00:15,204
Man.

1295
01:00:15,364 --> 01:00:17,084
Oh, they have to keep their chances.

1296
01:00:17,504 --> 01:00:17,824
Yes.

1297
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:21,624
I mean, I'm sure there's of course always a million people that work on these things

1298
01:00:21,624 --> 01:00:26,524
and maybe some critical element was designed by not the person and you never find out

1299
01:00:26,584 --> 01:00:31,524
necessarily that that was, but it does seem like this is a little more pure role.

1300
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,684
Like you can really feel rolly everywhere.

1301
01:00:33,944 --> 01:00:37,704
When it's what the sense that I get about like the vague, what I could tell about the

1302
01:00:37,704 --> 01:00:43,344
spirit of the Garner Holt shop and what they've done on the, the Reed vamp of the Calico

1303
01:00:43,344 --> 01:00:47,564
mine ride and, uh, uh, and then hopefully what's coming with the rapid ride that these

1304
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:49,784
are more, these are more like a tour.

1305
01:00:49,904 --> 01:00:52,724
Yeah, maybe a tour theory.

1306
01:00:53,064 --> 01:00:54,184
Let's keep going that way.

1307
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:58,744
But you hear about, um, uh, like at Pixar, they always talk about how like anyone at

1308
01:00:58,744 --> 01:01:02,684
the company is allowed to give their thoughts on current projects and stuff.

1309
01:01:02,984 --> 01:01:06,884
So there's like, obviously there's pluses and minuses to all of that stuff.

1310
01:01:07,004 --> 01:01:10,644
If everyone's talented in putting stuff in, you can make a fun, like I got haunted mansion

1311
01:01:10,644 --> 01:01:17,484
is two separate men's philosophy mixed in with Rolly's weird, cool, like, uh, leota room

1312
01:01:17,484 --> 01:01:17,944
and stuff.

1313
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:23,304
But like it is, I guess you could fan as like, what is the Claude Coats version of it look

1314
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:23,724
like?

1315
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:26,484
What does a full scary haunted mansion look like?

1316
01:01:26,864 --> 01:01:27,664
Is it better?

1317
01:01:27,864 --> 01:01:30,584
Is the Mark Davis version better where it's kooky the whole time?

1318
01:01:30,764 --> 01:01:32,544
They're both sound pretty fun, honestly.

1319
01:01:32,864 --> 01:01:33,104
Yeah.

1320
01:01:33,264 --> 01:01:34,764
There's pluses and minuses to both of them.

1321
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:38,564
But the clashes between people is what really keeps things interesting.

1322
01:01:38,804 --> 01:01:40,584
That's what's interesting for that thing.

1323
01:01:40,884 --> 01:01:46,104
But this is the, yeah, this one specifically is cause it's so much of like, I can, I can

1324
01:01:46,104 --> 01:01:47,704
feel the man's voice in it.

1325
01:01:47,824 --> 01:01:49,604
I can feel the person who made it to voice.

1326
01:01:49,704 --> 01:01:49,884
Yeah.

1327
01:01:49,904 --> 01:01:52,224
And the disparate elements he's pulling together in his brain.

1328
01:01:52,224 --> 01:01:56,544
I also like we're still in the weird woods and the, the, you pointed out the sign that

1329
01:01:56,544 --> 01:01:59,064
says you are entering the weird woods population.

1330
01:01:59,064 --> 01:02:00,384
Scary.

1331
01:02:01,304 --> 01:02:07,324
Said that's, that's up my, I really like anything where the, the, the fact is wrong or like

1332
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:09,204
the wrong type of word.

1333
01:02:09,704 --> 01:02:13,464
This does, the weird woods does tie into what we were just talking about, the haunted

1334
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:20,104
mansion, because haunted mansion began with the museum of the weird, which was Rolly's

1335
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:21,564
weird idea that he had.

1336
01:02:21,744 --> 01:02:26,484
And everybody, all his coworkers, the other imagineers were saying, Walt won't like it.

1337
01:02:26,484 --> 01:02:27,644
It's too weird, Wally.

1338
01:02:27,784 --> 01:02:28,944
They're making fun of him.

1339
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,924
And then sure enough, Disney showed up.

1340
01:02:31,124 --> 01:02:35,044
He saw his little, he had already gotten so far along with the concept art and the models.

1341
01:02:35,944 --> 01:02:38,124
Walt was like, yeah, this stuff is pretty weird.

1342
01:02:38,864 --> 01:02:42,584
So like Rolly, like that, this is one of my favorite haunted mansion stories.

1343
01:02:42,664 --> 01:02:45,764
I don't believe you told this on the first of many podcasts.

1344
01:02:45,784 --> 01:02:48,224
Maybe we'll get to it the next three or four part.

1345
01:02:48,404 --> 01:02:49,104
Who knows?

1346
01:02:49,324 --> 01:02:49,324


1347
01:02:49,624 --> 01:02:51,184
But like 22, we'll get to it.

1348
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:55,604
He went home, dejected, came back to work the next morning and Walt was sitting in his

1349
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:58,384
desk wearing the same suit he had on from the day before.

1350
01:02:58,684 --> 01:03:02,844
And he's like, Rolly, I can't stop looking at your, your concepts.

1351
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:06,764
And you're just like, I didn't go to sleep last night because I can't stop thinking about

1352
01:03:06,764 --> 01:03:09,024
your, your, all this weird stuff.

1353
01:03:09,024 --> 01:03:16,744
Ended up like had changed his mind and ended up incorporating some of that from the Rolly's

1354
01:03:16,744 --> 01:03:17,844
museum of the weird.

1355
01:03:18,224 --> 01:03:21,284
So here's where he really got to take that idea.

1356
01:03:21,304 --> 01:03:29,404
He had, you know, years, years earlier and just go to town and make it weirder and more

1357
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:32,264
imaginative than he ever thought was possible.

1358
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:38,704
So we've got like evil looking purple trees, weird mashup creatures.

1359
01:03:38,704 --> 01:03:47,924
You got a llama giraffe hybrid and birds wearing hair, hair curlers and

1360
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:53,924
unidentified creatures with red beards and they're making something called weird

1361
01:03:53,924 --> 01:03:56,484
juice in a, in a glowing bathtub.

1362
01:03:56,784 --> 01:03:57,304
Yeah.

1363
01:03:57,484 --> 01:03:58,164
Weird juice.

1364
01:03:58,484 --> 01:03:59,884
I want, I want weird juice.

1365
01:03:59,884 --> 01:04:01,844
Yeah, we should sell weird juice.

1366
01:04:02,364 --> 01:04:04,924
What a, oh man, I would be the first in line.

1367
01:04:05,524 --> 01:04:11,044
Like they're, they're not butter beer is weird juice, but I don't want it in a bottle.

1368
01:04:11,204 --> 01:04:13,564
I want to like, they give me, they, I pay money.

1369
01:04:13,624 --> 01:04:16,364
They hand me a ladle and I, oh yeah.

1370
01:04:17,244 --> 01:04:17,804
That's great.

1371
01:04:18,024 --> 01:04:19,344
Keith, the ladle, their souvenir.

1372
01:04:20,404 --> 01:04:21,844
The big K at the bottom.

1373
01:04:22,104 --> 01:04:23,224
Oh, that's so fun.

1374
01:04:24,204 --> 01:04:30,544
We passed by crafty Coyote secret lair and we realized that he's from the weird woods.

1375
01:04:30,884 --> 01:04:31,264
Sure.

1376
01:04:31,964 --> 01:04:32,804
Oh, he's origin.

1377
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:33,704
Yes.

1378
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:34,824
Little origin story.

1379
01:04:35,584 --> 01:04:38,004
It's like if you drove by crime alley in a Bababoo.

1380
01:04:38,364 --> 01:04:40,684
Exactly.

1381
01:04:40,824 --> 01:04:41,784
Oh, so fun.

1382
01:04:42,344 --> 01:04:53,304
And yeah, then this takes us to our grand finale, which is, is far bigger than any of the,

1383
01:04:53,544 --> 01:05:00,644
this is like almost half of the, half of the space of the, of the, of the building is the fair.

1384
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:03,084
We reach our destination.

1385
01:05:03,704 --> 01:05:10,264
And, and this is just like sent, like sensory overload.

1386
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:15,964
There's just so much going on at this fair scene all at once.

1387
01:05:17,784 --> 01:05:21,324
We see, we see a bunch of bears in a hot air balloon ride.

1388
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:26,584
Dr. Fox is selling weird juice out of his medicine wagon.

1389
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:33,184
And he's claiming all the different ailments that it will cure warts, hang nails,

1390
01:05:33,584 --> 01:05:35,384
baldness, cure all.

1391
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:37,004
It says weird juice on there.

1392
01:05:37,824 --> 01:05:41,804
We see Wally the wirewalker, the tightrope walking rabbit.

1393
01:05:42,184 --> 01:05:48,264
We see a puppet show with, with, with bunny rabbits going on.

1394
01:05:48,264 --> 01:05:52,504
And the bunny rabbits that are marionettes are like juggling.

1395
01:05:52,504 --> 01:05:59,004
And that's a really cool, like visual effect to see a, a puppet juggling.

1396
01:05:59,004 --> 01:06:04,524
Uh, uh, Madam Wong bangs her gong and offers to read your fortune cookie.

1397
01:06:04,524 --> 01:06:08,544
Maybe this one would have had to change a little bit.

1398
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:13,884
Sounds a little racist, but she was, when I did my deep research, I, I, I,

1399
01:06:13,884 --> 01:06:18,564
I read that she was designed by Doris Young, a Chinese artist.

1400
01:06:18,564 --> 01:06:19,544
Okay.

1401
01:06:19,564 --> 01:06:23,364
That makes me a little bit more comfortable with this concept.

1402
01:06:23,364 --> 01:06:28,824
And I like that she actually bangs the gong, that it is a practical, like the machine

1403
01:06:28,824 --> 01:06:29,444
hits it.

1404
01:06:29,704 --> 01:06:30,504
Yeah, that's cool.

1405
01:06:30,504 --> 01:06:34,004
So we have a lot of callbacks here.

1406
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:34,764
Sarah skunk.

1407
01:06:34,904 --> 01:06:35,844
We see her again this time.

1408
01:06:35,844 --> 01:06:43,804
She's levitating Zazz the owl and, uh, and, uh, theta bears created a magic

1409
01:06:43,804 --> 01:06:44,904
card castle.

1410
01:06:45,344 --> 01:06:49,944
It's just like standing, a standing, a castle made out of playing cards,

1411
01:06:50,364 --> 01:06:51,244
not to be outdone.

1412
01:06:51,344 --> 01:06:55,944
The frogs have made their own miniature frog fair.

1413
01:06:56,264 --> 01:06:58,804
So they're getting, they're getting, they're getting in on

1414
01:06:58,804 --> 01:06:59,524
the fun too.

1415
01:07:00,204 --> 01:07:02,784
It's like a fair within the fair that we're already at.

1416
01:07:02,784 --> 01:07:03,184
Wow.

1417
01:07:03,564 --> 01:07:04,924
That's, that's an auteur fair.

1418
01:07:04,924 --> 01:07:05,304
Yeah.

1419
01:07:05,304 --> 01:07:05,804
You're right.

1420
01:07:06,744 --> 01:07:11,924
We see the Knotsonberry family who are posing to have their portrait taken

1421
01:07:11,924 --> 01:07:12,924
by a photographer.

1422
01:07:13,104 --> 01:07:18,004
It seems like they've just won first prize for best pies at the fair.

1423
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:24,004
Elderberry is wearing a zoot suit looking mad foul.

1424
01:07:24,004 --> 01:07:28,204
Yeah, that's the first time the twenties have really come up with this for me.

1425
01:07:28,204 --> 01:07:32,024
It seems a lot more agrarian beforehand, a little more.

1426
01:07:32,024 --> 01:07:32,444
Yeah.

1427
01:07:32,444 --> 01:07:35,124
We're not sure what's happening in the, in the urban areas.

1428
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:41,824
Maybe you missed us mentioned that the, uh, the mommy berries name is

1429
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:42,524
flapper berry.

1430
01:07:42,984 --> 01:07:44,044
Well, yes, that's true.

1431
01:07:44,424 --> 01:07:44,444
Yeah.

1432
01:07:44,444 --> 01:07:44,864
Good point.

1433
01:07:45,004 --> 01:07:45,164
Yeah.

1434
01:07:45,164 --> 01:07:47,384
We've reached past that.

1435
01:07:47,384 --> 01:07:53,704
Uh, uh, crafty, uh, coyote has finally been caught and lands himself in prison.

1436
01:07:54,544 --> 01:07:57,784
A boysenberry pie just out of his reach.

1437
01:07:57,784 --> 01:07:59,624
It was like, ah, son of a gun.

1438
01:07:59,624 --> 01:08:01,744
That seems cruel and unusual to me.

1439
01:08:02,004 --> 01:08:02,604
Unnecessary.

1440
01:08:02,924 --> 01:08:03,524
Well then yeah.

1441
01:08:03,724 --> 01:08:03,844
Very.

1442
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:07,904
I'd also like to point out of the, of the many visuals you sent us, one of the only

1443
01:08:07,904 --> 01:08:11,884
ones I, uh, uh, I've been able to put a saving in my document was the, the

1444
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:14,064
wanted poster for crafty coyote.

1445
01:08:14,244 --> 01:08:16,564
He's described as tall, thin and hairy.

1446
01:08:16,904 --> 01:08:20,484
The reward for his capture is 5,000 berries.

1447
01:08:20,724 --> 01:08:24,464
You get bait and berries and you get all his other names.

1448
01:08:24,464 --> 01:08:29,684
Sweet tooth, hairy Fargo fats, chubby cheeks, Charlie, purple tongue, Tommy,

1449
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:30,904
and red nose Nelson.

1450
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:31,924
Okay.

1451
01:08:32,184 --> 01:08:32,464
Yes.

1452
01:08:33,164 --> 01:08:36,924
I know people are, I did go by purple tongue Tommy for a little while.

1453
01:08:36,944 --> 01:08:38,944
That is also one of my alter egos.

1454
01:08:38,964 --> 01:08:39,904
That was you.

1455
01:08:39,984 --> 01:08:40,424
Yeah.

1456
01:08:40,484 --> 01:08:41,324
You bastard.

1457
01:08:41,624 --> 01:08:42,704
Give me my berries.

1458
01:08:44,024 --> 01:08:44,524
No.

1459
01:08:46,124 --> 01:08:46,344
Fair enough.

1460
01:08:46,564 --> 01:08:46,844
I tried.

1461
01:08:48,004 --> 01:08:49,964
Um, I would love this suit.

1462
01:08:50,224 --> 01:08:53,424
Um, and this is not, this is raspberry, this suit.

1463
01:08:53,984 --> 01:08:55,444
I would wear it.

1464
01:08:55,604 --> 01:08:57,584
I think it's like a sailor suit.

1465
01:08:57,584 --> 01:08:58,604
Maybe a little bit.

1466
01:08:58,604 --> 01:08:59,944
That's boys and berries.

1467
01:08:59,944 --> 01:09:04,984
Isn't this raspberry boys and berries suit is more for Jason boys and berries.

1468
01:09:05,084 --> 01:09:07,124
It is a sailor boy.

1469
01:09:07,124 --> 01:09:08,124
That's for sure.

1470
01:09:08,384 --> 01:09:08,704
Jason.

1471
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:10,424
You mean the father suit?

1472
01:09:10,424 --> 01:09:10,584
Yeah.

1473
01:09:10,584 --> 01:09:16,724
The father suit that the green, like a Christmas suit green and red and like a yellow stripes.

1474
01:09:16,724 --> 01:09:16,964
Yeah.

1475
01:09:16,964 --> 01:09:20,344
Like a yellow vest and this, uh, straw hat with the yellow flower.

1476
01:09:20,404 --> 01:09:21,064
Oh, I see.

1477
01:09:21,144 --> 01:09:22,444
That's, I like that a lot.

1478
01:09:22,584 --> 01:09:23,864
I may wear that.

1479
01:09:24,044 --> 01:09:26,184
Wear a straw hat with a yellow flower.

1480
01:09:26,284 --> 01:09:26,764
That's the question.

1481
01:09:26,784 --> 01:09:29,444
I mean, it would have to be something where it would be appropriate.

1482
01:09:29,464 --> 01:09:33,024
I wouldn't be suit man forever because like they didn't have to switch over.

1483
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:35,244
Like if I was wearing that now, it'd be inappropriate.

1484
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:39,464
But maybe if I'm going to find what, what would I be doing where I would go to functions

1485
01:09:39,464 --> 01:09:40,364
and I would wear this.

1486
01:09:40,364 --> 01:09:44,304
You get married in the, in a suit suit and a straw hat with a flower.

1487
01:09:44,504 --> 01:09:45,884
That might, well, this isn't a suit suit.

1488
01:09:46,004 --> 01:09:46,524
Oh, I'm sorry.

1489
01:09:46,544 --> 01:09:47,344
I'm mixing them up.

1490
01:09:47,544 --> 01:09:47,804
Not so.

1491
01:09:47,964 --> 01:09:48,004
Yeah.

1492
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:51,284
I think we're looking at flapper berry, the mommy.

1493
01:09:51,404 --> 01:09:52,524
Would I wear that too?

1494
01:09:52,524 --> 01:09:53,784
That's not a bad thing.

1495
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:59,124
I feel like if there was, if I was going to social fun, like if I was a Hamptons man,

1496
01:10:00,044 --> 01:10:01,384
that might be the perfect situation.

1497
01:10:01,424 --> 01:10:05,464
If I end up out in the Hamptons a lot with, you know, whoever's out there.

1498
01:10:05,664 --> 01:10:10,544
Seinfeld, Seinfeld, Spielberg, Russell Simmons, all the, all the friends.

1499
01:10:11,064 --> 01:10:13,024
Uh, I would maybe wear this.

1500
01:10:13,044 --> 01:10:16,464
I would wear this and I will do the full straw hat with the yellow flower.

1501
01:10:16,524 --> 01:10:19,864
But I guess like it would be inappropriate to wear around town.

1502
01:10:20,664 --> 01:10:21,384
It's a little.

1503
01:10:21,644 --> 01:10:27,384
I think the older you get, the older of a man you become, the more you can give yourself permission

1504
01:10:27,384 --> 01:10:29,304
to just dress nice.

1505
01:10:29,304 --> 01:10:31,604
And there doesn't have to be a specific occasion.

1506
01:10:31,664 --> 01:10:32,224
I agree with you.

1507
01:10:32,284 --> 01:10:34,304
I agree with that a hundred percent.

1508
01:10:34,384 --> 01:10:35,544
The sweetest episode.

1509
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:37,444
Doesn't have to be just for going to the fair.

1510
01:10:37,584 --> 01:10:38,084
You know, you're right.

1511
01:10:38,084 --> 01:10:39,804
You're giving me more confidence to do that.

1512
01:10:39,804 --> 01:10:41,124
Cause I believe that is true.

1513
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:44,984
If you feel good doing it, who gives a shit what people say.

1514
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:48,784
I'm starting, as I approach 40 is I started feel more and more that way.

1515
01:10:48,864 --> 01:10:54,104
I see other guys who are, you know, 20, 30 years, my senior just going for it.

1516
01:10:54,104 --> 01:10:56,424
And I'm like, wow, you've got the right idea.

1517
01:10:56,484 --> 01:10:57,584
That's what I want to be.

1518
01:10:57,764 --> 01:10:58,064
Yeah.

1519
01:10:58,264 --> 01:10:59,364
I just slowly get it.

1520
01:10:59,364 --> 01:11:00,904
It doesn't happen overnight, Mike.

1521
01:11:01,084 --> 01:11:03,184
It takes a while, but I just, Jason, I were at H&M.

1522
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:07,784
I almost bought this like flowery kind of jacket that was like, I was like,

1523
01:11:07,784 --> 01:11:08,504
I was a little too much.

1524
01:11:08,704 --> 01:11:11,564
I tried it on, you know, when I said the next day I didn't get it.

1525
01:11:11,564 --> 01:11:14,244
I went back and I bought that fricking jacket upstairs.

1526
01:11:14,244 --> 01:11:16,084
Yeah, we were there for a while.

1527
01:11:16,704 --> 01:11:17,584
But that's, you know what?

1528
01:11:17,584 --> 01:11:18,424
I'm wearing it now.

1529
01:11:18,704 --> 01:11:19,564
Trig yourself, Mike.

1530
01:11:19,584 --> 01:11:20,664
It's a statement piece.

1531
01:11:20,784 --> 01:11:21,664
It's a statement.

1532
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:24,944
It's going to be a huge step the day I buy my first leather jacket.

1533
01:11:25,184 --> 01:11:25,664
I think that.

1534
01:11:25,704 --> 01:11:27,344
Oh, is that what you're like kind of eyeing?

1535
01:11:27,424 --> 01:11:28,584
I'm thinking about it.

1536
01:11:28,604 --> 01:11:29,024
Okay.

1537
01:11:29,104 --> 01:11:29,484
Yeah.

1538
01:11:29,664 --> 01:11:33,724
I just want to, I don't want to be 60 years old and wearing my Nott's Berry,

1539
01:11:33,724 --> 01:11:37,244
Mary Farm t-shirt, you know, that's.

1540
01:11:37,424 --> 01:11:38,544
My C plus is in common.

1541
01:11:38,684 --> 01:11:39,304
My plus is my C.

1542
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:39,904
Yeah.

1543
01:11:39,904 --> 01:11:40,224
Yeah.

1544
01:11:40,224 --> 01:11:44,404
I want to get the most out of life when I'm in my final act.

1545
01:11:45,144 --> 01:11:46,524
Well, let's go.

1546
01:11:46,704 --> 01:11:51,204
We'll all check in obviously with each other in 10 years to see if I'm wearing this suit,

1547
01:11:51,604 --> 01:11:53,664
that raspberry and if you're wearing a leather jacket.

1548
01:11:53,984 --> 01:11:55,164
And if I'm wearing the boys.

1549
01:11:55,704 --> 01:12:01,584
And if you're wearing socks that say green treat.

1550
01:12:01,764 --> 01:12:02,404
My socks.

1551
01:12:02,784 --> 01:12:03,284
What?

1552
01:12:03,384 --> 01:12:04,184
That's the brand.

1553
01:12:04,564 --> 01:12:05,124
These two socks.

1554
01:12:05,124 --> 01:12:06,224
Oh my God.

1555
01:12:06,384 --> 01:12:07,404
These socks on the bottom.

1556
01:12:07,544 --> 01:12:08,704
Red green tree.

1557
01:12:08,804 --> 01:12:09,684
Red alert.

1558
01:12:10,024 --> 01:12:12,764
Jason's socks say green treat on the bottom.

1559
01:12:13,244 --> 01:12:14,824
Striped maroon blue and green.

1560
01:12:14,824 --> 01:12:15,604
Oh my God.

1561
01:12:15,624 --> 01:12:22,264
Not to be confused with the, with the fun socks that your mom gave you for this holiday season.

1562
01:12:22,264 --> 01:12:22,344
Right.

1563
01:12:22,664 --> 01:12:25,684
These are just different green treat socks.

1564
01:12:25,744 --> 01:12:26,404
Yeah.

1565
01:12:26,664 --> 01:12:26,924
Wow.

1566
01:12:26,924 --> 01:12:30,304
I haven't worn a sock that is not just a white sock in a long time.

1567
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,964
And I don't know, maybe like a wedding.

1568
01:12:32,384 --> 01:12:42,744
So I'm yeah, I'll wear a black sock to go with black shoes, but I haven't worn like a

1569
01:12:43,224 --> 01:12:47,324
sock that says my salad is wine.

1570
01:12:47,524 --> 01:12:48,664
What was the, what was that?

1571
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:50,124
My favorite salad is wine.

1572
01:12:50,364 --> 01:12:51,184
I think was what it was.

1573
01:12:51,344 --> 01:12:51,644
Yeah.

1574
01:12:51,644 --> 01:12:57,324
Or you know, a sock with yelling Vladimir Putin on it or the, with the wonderful things

1575
01:12:57,324 --> 01:12:58,664
available at the sock market.

1576
01:12:58,764 --> 01:13:01,064
I have a lot of colored colorful socks upstairs.

1577
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:03,484
Maybe I should give it a try.

1578
01:13:03,644 --> 01:13:05,404
I think maybe yeah, you should set a goal too.

1579
01:13:05,404 --> 01:13:07,644
Like we all have of what will you be wearing?

1580
01:13:07,824 --> 01:13:09,224
So branch out my sock.

1581
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:09,884
Yeah.

1582
01:13:09,884 --> 01:13:10,184
Okay.

1583
01:13:10,184 --> 01:13:10,644
So size.

1584
01:13:10,744 --> 01:13:12,924
So in 10 years, you'll be wearing some fun.

1585
01:13:12,924 --> 01:13:13,964
I don't know.

1586
01:13:13,964 --> 01:13:18,924
I feel like, I feel like weird socks are what people who do like dress like a pirate day.

1587
01:13:18,924 --> 01:13:21,044
You can go to Martin.

1588
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:26,244
You can find a lovely multi-pack variety of socks at Marshall's or TJ Maxx.

1589
01:13:26,424 --> 01:13:27,464
They got some great stuff.

1590
01:13:27,604 --> 01:13:29,424
Happy socks or whatever.

1591
01:13:29,724 --> 01:13:30,664
These are the brand.

1592
01:13:30,764 --> 01:13:34,344
I mean, they're all probably the same conglomerate that just has a million lines,

1593
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,524
but you can get some fun accent socks.

1594
01:13:37,744 --> 01:13:39,024
Do you have fun socks at home?

1595
01:13:39,544 --> 01:13:42,084
No, I have never gotten into that.

1596
01:13:42,424 --> 01:13:43,164
Not yet.

1597
01:13:44,384 --> 01:13:46,564
Standard black or white socks.

1598
01:13:48,164 --> 01:13:50,084
I am just, I don't know.

1599
01:13:50,084 --> 01:13:51,244
I don't know if they're for me.

1600
01:13:51,284 --> 01:13:53,904
I don't think that's where my clothing joy is going to come from.

1601
01:13:54,204 --> 01:13:55,784
I want to find it from somewhere though.

1602
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:57,444
I should set a clothing goal.

1603
01:13:59,364 --> 01:14:03,244
Plus is up a little casual t-shirt and jeans look.

1604
01:14:03,724 --> 01:14:04,384
What's up?

1605
01:14:04,504 --> 01:14:05,064
Oh, a fun sock.

1606
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:05,504
Sure.

1607
01:14:05,604 --> 01:14:06,424
Yeah, I hear you.

1608
01:14:07,164 --> 01:14:09,004
More jackets, maybe more like jackets.

1609
01:14:09,724 --> 01:14:10,204
Yeah.

1610
01:14:10,684 --> 01:14:16,284
Like not even the suit, but just like suit jacket types or more like a cool nylon,

1611
01:14:16,384 --> 01:14:17,264
nylon jacket.

1612
01:14:17,524 --> 01:14:17,884
Yeah.

1613
01:14:17,884 --> 01:14:19,604
Maybe more in the blazer zone.

1614
01:14:19,604 --> 01:14:24,944
Although I guess, you know, blazer can get you into like 80s standup territory.

1615
01:14:24,944 --> 01:14:28,424
That's true, but it's all combined with blue jeans and sneakers.

1616
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:28,964
Yeah.

1617
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:31,124
I guess I shouldn't dress like Jerry Zanfellow.

1618
01:14:31,124 --> 01:14:35,164
You got to pay the extra to take it to a tailor and make sure it's really properly fit.

1619
01:14:35,344 --> 01:14:37,004
And I think that the fitting can help.

1620
01:14:37,004 --> 01:14:39,384
I think whatever else you're wearing with it helps.

1621
01:14:39,664 --> 01:14:39,764
Yeah.

1622
01:14:39,784 --> 01:14:40,604
It all depends.

1623
01:14:40,724 --> 01:14:41,784
Oh, it's a fine line.

1624
01:14:41,964 --> 01:14:45,484
I think look how much the bears are making us want to.

1625
01:14:45,484 --> 01:14:48,144
The Knots and Barry family is our style guide.

1626
01:14:48,144 --> 01:14:49,424
Yeah.

1627
01:14:49,424 --> 01:14:52,784
We'll take a photo.

1628
01:14:52,944 --> 01:14:53,664
Our fit.

1629
01:14:53,664 --> 01:14:58,744
Our fit pick is just, just these guys, just the new look.

1630
01:14:59,664 --> 01:15:05,284
You know, you said a photo of like people dressing the bears and like this must have

1631
01:15:05,284 --> 01:15:11,264
been so fun for costumers to do to find crazy turn of the century clothes to put on these

1632
01:15:11,264 --> 01:15:11,964
bear robots.

1633
01:15:12,264 --> 01:15:16,784
The behind the scenes photos of the people like dressing the characters and building

1634
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:21,744
this stuff are amazing because they're the most 70s looking people you can, you can picture.

1635
01:15:22,304 --> 01:15:23,964
And in some, I have to send you guys more.

1636
01:15:24,104 --> 01:15:28,204
I only set you guys a couple, but then, and a lot of them, they're like smoking or drinking

1637
01:15:28,204 --> 01:15:28,624
a beer.

1638
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:32,544
Like it's kind of, it was just very, very laid back vibe.

1639
01:15:32,764 --> 01:15:33,244
Wow.

1640
01:15:33,244 --> 01:15:33,924
Hippie vibe.

1641
01:15:34,164 --> 01:15:34,684
So fun.

1642
01:15:34,684 --> 01:15:37,944
Yeah. You sent us the, the, um, a link to there.

1643
01:15:38,004 --> 01:15:43,104
There's a lights on ride through and you can kind of get a very general sense of the ride,

1644
01:15:43,104 --> 01:15:45,244
but there's no real soundtrack playing.

1645
01:15:45,904 --> 01:15:46,104
Yeah.

1646
01:15:46,224 --> 01:15:50,084
I hear a little sound here and there, but mostly you're the clicking of the robots and

1647
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:52,844
every now and then someone will walk for walk through the frame.

1648
01:15:53,224 --> 01:15:53,664
Yeah.

1649
01:15:53,664 --> 01:15:58,684
I think that video, the ride through video was taken after hours and it was not fully

1650
01:15:58,684 --> 01:16:04,124
operating with the music and everything because you don't hear the theme song

1651
01:16:04,144 --> 01:16:06,684
and that theme song is playing throughout the ride.

1652
01:16:07,724 --> 01:16:12,384
And that was written by a Disney guy, a 17 year Disney veteran.

1653
01:16:12,984 --> 01:16:15,284
Oh, well, yeah, a lot of Disney folks.

1654
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:17,864
I looked them up and, uh,

1655
01:16:21,816 --> 01:16:29,376
His name was Bob Bruner and he worked on, his credits include The Magical World of Disney, the TV series,

1656
01:16:30,236 --> 01:16:34,576
Gus, which was a favorite of mine as a kid, it's about the football playing horse.

1657
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:35,496
Okay, sure.

1658
01:16:35,936 --> 01:16:44,396
The boat nicks, that darn cat, Blackbeard's ghost, and he also wrote the theme song for the computer

1659
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:45,356
war tennis shoes.

1660
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:49,036
I gotta look up all these songs, I don't know what those songs are.

1661
01:16:49,096 --> 01:16:50,416
Another Disney guy.

1662
01:16:50,476 --> 01:16:53,056
Wow, allowed to cut loose to do his thing.

1663
01:16:53,296 --> 01:16:58,256
Well, and at the very end, we haven't talked about the final musical performance by the

1664
01:16:58,256 --> 01:16:59,256
Jazzberry Band.

1665
01:16:59,356 --> 01:16:59,996
That's right.

1666
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:01,136
They're great.

1667
01:17:01,376 --> 01:17:06,776
Another similarity to Splash Mountain, you see a band that come out of nowhere and just

1668
01:17:06,776 --> 01:17:13,996
performing and joining in on the celebration, and then we pass by the Knott's and Berry family

1669
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:18,876
one last time and they're waving goodbye and singing the theme song as you pull back into

1670
01:17:18,876 --> 01:17:22,736
the station and that's the end.

1671
01:17:22,836 --> 01:17:23,816
It's a perfect ride.

1672
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:25,116
What a delight.

1673
01:17:25,316 --> 01:17:31,776
So much style, so much original mythology not to be found anywhere else.

1674
01:17:32,096 --> 01:17:36,496
And how many rides are like this anywhere in the world?

1675
01:17:36,556 --> 01:17:43,316
There's so few non-Disney dark rides and because I was trying to think of a few, I think it's

1676
01:17:43,316 --> 01:17:45,556
probably why we like the ET adventure so much.

1677
01:17:45,556 --> 01:17:49,616
It's like not original mythology, although mostly because all that stuff's not in the

1678
01:17:49,616 --> 01:17:55,036
movie, but it feels very, you know, I'm so fond of that Hershey factory tour.

1679
01:17:56,216 --> 01:18:01,856
It seems like Efteling is overflowing with weird original rides like this and there's

1680
01:18:01,856 --> 01:18:08,296
not, I don't know, there's not a lot of this in America and Knott's had a real amazing

1681
01:18:08,296 --> 01:18:14,776
stab at it in the 70s and 80s in such a vibrant time style wise and so delightful.

1682
01:18:14,876 --> 01:18:18,456
Sadly, only an 11 year run and then that was it.

1683
01:18:18,596 --> 01:18:20,016
Yeah, it is so short.

1684
01:18:20,336 --> 01:18:20,816
Very short.

1685
01:18:21,036 --> 01:18:22,296
Had overlays though.

1686
01:18:22,716 --> 01:18:27,136
Had a very bizarre Halloween overlay which you can find video of on YouTube.

1687
01:18:27,256 --> 01:18:31,676
Yeah, it is bizarre because basically they keep all the foliage, they take all the characters

1688
01:18:31,676 --> 01:18:36,916
out, they keep all the foliage and trees and then just have teenage characters running

1689
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:44,396
around which I think kind of contributed to the ride getting run down and like it did

1690
01:18:44,396 --> 01:18:50,476
have a lot of upkeep and I think having the Knott's thing year, the Haunt thing year after

1691
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:56,456
year kind of started like at the same time that Haunt started, Berry Tales and Haunt

1692
01:18:56,456 --> 01:18:58,336
were both like 74, 75.

1693
01:18:58,816 --> 01:19:05,536
So they had the scary overlay year after year, every year that it was in operation.

1694
01:19:05,776 --> 01:19:08,776
I think that's one of the reasons it wore out so quick.

1695
01:19:09,256 --> 01:19:14,076
The only major refurbishment was in 1985, like right before it closed.

1696
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:17,636
By then I guess the writing was already on the wall.

1697
01:19:18,136 --> 01:19:24,196
And that was generation one scare actors because these teens do not give a shit.

1698
01:19:25,276 --> 01:19:30,876
The people doing it now are so committed and so into it and there was literally a kid

1699
01:19:30,876 --> 01:19:36,056
like waving his arms, they looked like they were sarcastically haunting you.

1700
01:19:37,836 --> 01:19:38,316
God.

1701
01:19:38,696 --> 01:19:47,616
So this thing shuts down in 86, reopens the next year as Kingdom of the Dinosaurs,

1702
01:19:47,756 --> 01:19:50,116
which I will say I was fond of that ride.

1703
01:19:50,216 --> 01:19:51,356
I think that was a great ride.

1704
01:19:51,356 --> 01:19:51,596
That's a neat ride.

1705
01:19:51,656 --> 01:19:55,376
So it's not as if it was torn out for some garbage.

1706
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:55,716
True.

1707
01:19:56,216 --> 01:20:00,316
And the same ride vehicles, which these little trolleys like with a little

1708
01:20:00,316 --> 01:20:03,336
light piece in the front and the same track.

1709
01:20:03,356 --> 01:20:04,156
Same track.

1710
01:20:04,396 --> 01:20:04,576
Okay.

1711
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:08,196
You go down the same tunnel.

1712
01:20:08,456 --> 01:20:11,836
That's kind of like a time travel tunnel in that case.

1713
01:20:12,116 --> 01:20:12,236
Okay.

1714
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:15,316
So at least it was replaced by something decent.

1715
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:18,376
People claimed that for the first year of Kingdom of the Dinosaurs,

1716
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:20,256
you could still smell the boys and Barry.

1717
01:20:20,496 --> 01:20:20,956
Wow.

1718
01:20:20,956 --> 01:20:21,536
How about that?

1719
01:20:21,576 --> 01:20:21,796
Delightful.

1720
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,336
That's so fun.

1721
01:20:23,656 --> 01:20:28,236
I have been to an apartment where there were smokers for years living there and you do smell

1722
01:20:28,236 --> 01:20:30,596
the carpeting smells like smoke for you.

1723
01:20:30,596 --> 01:20:31,056
Oh, yeah.

1724
01:20:31,556 --> 01:20:32,696
So I believe that.

1725
01:20:32,756 --> 01:20:34,356
It's just the building smelled like the berries.

1726
01:20:34,756 --> 01:20:35,316
Yeah.

1727
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:39,636
Unfortunately, King Kong's banana breath lost in the universal fire.

1728
01:20:40,196 --> 01:20:41,856
That fire can defeat the banana breath.

1729
01:20:42,156 --> 01:20:44,196
And for sure, no arson involved with that.

1730
01:20:44,236 --> 01:20:46,116
No, no, no, no, certainly a totally different thing.

1731
01:20:47,336 --> 01:20:54,956
But then it gets dicey because we were talking about, we've recently talked about

1732
01:20:54,956 --> 01:21:00,016
cranium command and how this was that buzzy the robot was taken and how strange,

1733
01:21:00,296 --> 01:21:04,316
how rare it is that a ride is just left sitting around with nothing to replace it.

1734
01:21:04,976 --> 01:21:10,236
That was one of the cases I could think of was that King of the Dinosaurs closed in 2004,

1735
01:21:10,596 --> 01:21:12,896
just sitting around for a very, very long time.

1736
01:21:13,296 --> 01:21:13,716
Over a decade.

1737
01:21:14,096 --> 01:21:15,016
God, wow.

1738
01:21:15,276 --> 01:21:16,356
And then to what end?

1739
01:21:16,476 --> 01:21:17,856
Were dinosaurs sitting in there?

1740
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:18,456
What was it?

1741
01:21:18,496 --> 01:21:19,316
Was it storage?

1742
01:21:19,596 --> 01:21:20,356
Who knows?

1743
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:27,396
But then eventually replaced by Voyage to the Iron Reef, which we went on together, correct?

1744
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:28,176
Yes, we did.

1745
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:30,216
Not Jason, but Doug and Mike.

1746
01:21:30,216 --> 01:21:32,996
Jason was played by the part of Andrew Grissom.

1747
01:21:38,176 --> 01:21:38,476
My understudy.

1748
01:21:39,616 --> 01:21:43,316
We're all collectively disappointed.

1749
01:21:44,396 --> 01:21:49,336
Yeah, now, so finally in the next generation is replaced by something a little rougher

1750
01:21:49,336 --> 01:21:55,356
because if you don't know that ride, it's a shooting gallery ride and kind of a 3D.

1751
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:56,756
And steampunk themed.

1752
01:21:57,716 --> 01:21:58,616
Steampunk.

1753
01:21:59,396 --> 01:22:04,636
I will say, though, that maybe it's an ode to the weird lighting.

1754
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:09,236
It is disorienting and your eyes have to keep adjusting into the weird 3D.

1755
01:22:09,336 --> 01:22:11,316
So there's a little nod to the past.

1756
01:22:11,516 --> 01:22:14,056
Raleigh Crump's note, I'm sure, is make people's eyes.

1757
01:22:14,056 --> 01:22:14,796
Fuck your eyes up.

1758
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:16,356
Fuck everyone's eyes up on it.

1759
01:22:17,536 --> 01:22:18,256
That's a bummer.

1760
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:25,216
I mean, look, you talk tours and bringing specific styles into the park.

1761
01:22:25,376 --> 01:22:26,336
That ride is that.

1762
01:22:26,336 --> 01:22:29,316
I just wish it didn't have to replace this.

1763
01:22:29,836 --> 01:22:36,256
For many years, this was this interesting dark ride zone in a park that doesn't really have them.

1764
01:22:37,496 --> 01:22:40,316
And I don't know, for it to become a screen ride.

1765
01:22:40,536 --> 01:22:43,556
I'm not always anti-screen ride, but no, no, no.

1766
01:22:43,636 --> 01:22:45,616
They got to be of a certain quality.

1767
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:46,836
They have to be pleasant.

1768
01:22:47,716 --> 01:22:52,096
Of course, we'll do a full Iron Reef episode trashing it.

1769
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:53,356
I'm sure very soon.

1770
01:22:53,376 --> 01:22:54,116
Very soon.

1771
01:22:54,616 --> 01:22:59,636
But yeah, I think we all got off and we were like, oh, like just not pleasant at all.

1772
01:22:59,816 --> 01:23:01,156
Am I making this up?

1773
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:04,356
But did somebody like cut their hand on the gun?

1774
01:23:05,596 --> 01:23:06,996
I don't think we did.

1775
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:13,156
I just remember the experience being bad as it possibly could have been.

1776
01:23:13,396 --> 01:23:14,636
The gun stabbed me.

1777
01:23:14,936 --> 01:23:21,276
There was a better non-screen version of this and it was still kind of chintzy in Tokyo,

1778
01:23:21,676 --> 01:23:23,136
at Tokyo Dome City.

1779
01:23:23,356 --> 01:23:24,776
I got to go there.

1780
01:23:24,996 --> 01:23:29,376
A sort of a voyage shooting game where you stand up on these vehicles and it's just all

1781
01:23:29,376 --> 01:23:31,876
slow moving like underwater robot things.

1782
01:23:32,116 --> 01:23:32,496
That's fine.

1783
01:23:32,496 --> 01:23:37,036
And it's a much better, it's still cheapy, but so much better than.

1784
01:23:37,196 --> 01:23:37,456
Sure.

1785
01:23:37,456 --> 01:23:40,356
I lost my mind when you were talking about Tokyo Dome City.

1786
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:41,296
Oh, Doug, my God.

1787
01:23:41,356 --> 01:23:41,676
Yeah.

1788
01:23:41,856 --> 01:23:45,676
You will never come, you won't come back when you go to Tokyo Dome City.

1789
01:23:45,776 --> 01:23:46,976
You'll live in Tokyo Dome.

1790
01:23:47,036 --> 01:23:47,176
Yep.

1791
01:23:47,496 --> 01:23:50,536
Doug will take up residence in the Tokyo Dome City Hotel.

1792
01:23:50,536 --> 01:23:55,976
There was the big New Japan wrestling show yesterday, or I guess two days ago there,

1793
01:23:56,176 --> 01:24:00,756
and all the wrestlers are posting photos outside of right by Tokyo Dome City because that's where

1794
01:24:00,756 --> 01:24:05,816
the show was at the Tokyo Dome and all the nostalgia floods right back.

1795
01:24:05,936 --> 01:24:08,336
I'm like, oh, there's the hotel and there's the like.

1796
01:24:08,736 --> 01:24:09,316
Oh, yeah.

1797
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:14,256
So I was getting a flood of Tokyo Dome City on my feed, Twitter feed the last 48 hours.

1798
01:24:14,336 --> 01:24:15,216
I can't wait.

1799
01:24:15,236 --> 01:24:16,036
I'm so excited.

1800
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:21,836
But the the ride did not disappear entirely.

1801
01:24:22,196 --> 01:24:26,036
As I mentioned, some of it was turned, a mild amount of it was turned into a walkthrough

1802
01:24:26,036 --> 01:24:28,576
and I got to experience that very, very young.

1803
01:24:28,656 --> 01:24:29,676
I wish I remembered it better.

1804
01:24:29,816 --> 01:24:30,656
The Berry Tales Funhouse.

1805
01:24:30,796 --> 01:24:32,176
So maybe that's how they justify it.

1806
01:24:32,176 --> 01:24:33,796
Like we know people love this ride.

1807
01:24:34,016 --> 01:24:35,636
Don't worry, it's not going away.

1808
01:24:35,636 --> 01:24:36,636
We're just moving.

1809
01:24:36,956 --> 01:24:42,496
But it was a very condensed version of Berry Tales and you didn't see all the characters.

1810
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:45,296
You saw maybe like 30 percent of the characters.

1811
01:24:45,356 --> 01:24:45,696
OK.

1812
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:48,296
None of them were moving and animatronic.

1813
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:55,956
And I when I watched that walkthrough on YouTube, I found it very disappointing.

1814
01:24:55,956 --> 01:25:05,656
And but 60 percent of the ride was taken home by this park employee named Dale Tetley.

1815
01:25:05,836 --> 01:25:08,416
So this is something I had a lot of fun researching.

1816
01:25:08,776 --> 01:25:11,936
I want to know who this guy was, what his story is.

1817
01:25:12,176 --> 01:25:12,496
OK.

1818
01:25:13,556 --> 01:25:19,616
I don't know how he worked it out, but he he he literally took it home.

1819
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:23,356
In fact, two years almost to the date that the ride closed.

1820
01:25:23,656 --> 01:25:28,036
So the ride closed and its last run was on Halloween 86.

1821
01:25:29,856 --> 01:25:37,996
Halloween 88, he threw a party in his friend's backyard in Arcadia and all the characters,

1822
01:25:38,316 --> 01:25:39,836
Sarah Skunk.

1823
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:42,776
The Crabby Coyote himself.

1824
01:25:42,936 --> 01:25:45,856
Dr. Fox made it a cameo at this party.

1825
01:25:45,876 --> 01:25:49,936
He set them all up in the same order that they appear on the ride.

1826
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:50,736
Oh, my God.

1827
01:25:50,736 --> 01:25:53,956
And in the backyard, he set up like a rideable train.

1828
01:25:54,276 --> 01:25:54,536
Wow.

1829
01:25:54,536 --> 01:25:58,516
He could get on and he tried to recreate the ride and his friends.

1830
01:25:58,696 --> 01:26:00,256
And I just think that that's amazing.

1831
01:26:00,416 --> 01:26:00,976
What a party.

1832
01:26:01,076 --> 01:26:01,776
That's so funny.

1833
01:26:02,696 --> 01:26:06,096
So it's like, where are these where are these characters now?

1834
01:26:07,776 --> 01:26:13,036
In 2007, they took, you know, long after the Berry Tales Fun House closed.

1835
01:26:13,696 --> 01:26:19,136
They're supposedly storing some of these knots and Barry family in the storage facility

1836
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:22,256
located underneath the wacky soapbox racers.

1837
01:26:22,436 --> 01:26:24,116
Another dearly departed.

1838
01:26:24,116 --> 01:26:24,456
Yeah.

1839
01:26:24,776 --> 01:26:27,976
Not that I enjoyed as a kid.

1840
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:31,696
Found their way into a toy store in Ghost Town.

1841
01:26:32,016 --> 01:26:32,436
Oh, yeah.

1842
01:26:32,536 --> 01:26:33,516
And they were just finally.

1843
01:26:33,636 --> 01:26:33,976
Yeah.

1844
01:26:33,976 --> 01:26:35,316
They played the music.

1845
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:41,336
They weren't animated, but you could see it was it was Elderberry and boys and Barry

1846
01:26:41,336 --> 01:26:42,956
and an unnamed raccoon.

1847
01:26:42,956 --> 01:26:46,456
That's fun.

1848
01:26:46,716 --> 01:26:53,936
So here's something I wanted to talk about, because there is the when I, you know, I forgot

1849
01:26:53,936 --> 01:26:55,316
about this ride for 20 years.

1850
01:26:55,676 --> 01:27:04,416
I in 2007, I started getting back into it and reliving it through YouTube and Internet.

1851
01:27:04,416 --> 01:27:11,496
There's like Barry Dash Tales dot net sort of fan fan a fan site.

1852
01:27:11,496 --> 01:27:17,336
This video that was on YouTube in 2007 was not the one that's on now.

1853
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:18,676
It was a different one.

1854
01:27:18,996 --> 01:27:23,096
And it was there's a very funny talk.

1855
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,576
You guys have talked in the past.

1856
01:27:24,736 --> 01:27:27,616
The people who shoot the videos talk over it.

1857
01:27:27,616 --> 01:27:34,436
I think this this has come up a few times before and say say things that are that are

1858
01:27:34,436 --> 01:27:35,476
worth talking about.

1859
01:27:35,796 --> 01:27:41,896
OK, this this this particular right through on YouTube had a voice that sounded almost

1860
01:27:41,896 --> 01:27:45,576
identical to the characters of Bob and Doug McKenzie from TV.

1861
01:27:45,876 --> 01:27:49,976
And we're talking about the characters played by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas.

1862
01:27:49,976 --> 01:27:54,836
There are a lot of comments on the YouTube channel that that supported this, that that

1863
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:58,256
they believe that that was really them, that they were there.

1864
01:27:58,256 --> 01:28:02,856
They were on the ride filming it and doing this little commentary over it.

1865
01:28:02,876 --> 01:28:04,056
Well, the video disappeared.

1866
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,856
I couldn't find those comments.

1867
01:28:06,376 --> 01:28:12,436
I did, however, find an article from the Orange County Register around the time that some

1868
01:28:12,436 --> 01:28:17,116
of the characters were moved into the ghost town that talked about this video and how

1869
01:28:17,116 --> 01:28:19,556
they theorized that it was actually.

1870
01:28:19,556 --> 01:28:19,936
Wow.

1871
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:23,636
Dave Thomas and and Rick Moranis.

1872
01:28:23,836 --> 01:28:25,436
Again, the video is deleted.

1873
01:28:26,976 --> 01:28:31,176
I spent a lot of time trying to track this video down and I found it.

1874
01:28:31,276 --> 01:28:33,836
Oh, so that's that's MP3.

1875
01:28:34,576 --> 01:28:36,196
I oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1876
01:28:36,376 --> 01:28:36,396
Shit.

1877
01:28:36,636 --> 01:28:38,416
Yes, you sent us a secret MP3.

1878
01:28:38,436 --> 01:28:40,216
Do not play before the show.

1879
01:28:40,256 --> 01:28:40,456
Right.

1880
01:28:40,536 --> 01:28:42,896
So I want to get I want I want to listen to it.

1881
01:28:42,896 --> 01:28:44,556
I want to see what you guys think.

1882
01:28:44,556 --> 01:28:48,416
OK, and then I'll tell you what I think this Bob and Doug McKenzie exactly.

1883
01:28:55,544 --> 01:28:56,164
Thanks for checking.

1884
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:11,040
Oh, oh!

1885
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:14,740
Thank you.

1886
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,700
No, I'm not that good, eh?

1887
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:22,480
This place is so freaky and I'm not sure about that.

1888
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:27,760
I don't know, I know you've been watching Jumping Frogs, Gabby.

1889
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,480
No, last time we're talking, we're talking about you.

1890
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:34,200
I don't know, we're in the Gypsy Cafe.

1891
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,640
I had an impression it was just a couple of funny guys.

1892
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:49,040
Just, you know, I guess for equivalent for, I was too young to see Strange Brew in the

1893
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:53,660
theater, but I saw Wayne's World and of course I haven't stopped quoting it to this day and

1894
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:56,160
talking like Mike Myers.

1895
01:29:56,780 --> 01:30:01,400
Well, at the very end, I was looking for any clues that can help me get to the bar.

1896
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:06,920
At the very end of that video, I don't know what character they're looking at, but one

1897
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:11,400
of them says, it looks like Evan, and then the other one says, yeah, hey, it reminds

1898
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,200
me of Evan.

1899
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,840
So I'm thinking, hmm, that could be a lead.

1900
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:24,440
I looked at the IMDb website for the movie Strange Brew and as it turns out, the associate

1901
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:33,120
editor's name was Evan Landis and that could possibly be, I don't know if you're laughing

1902
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,960
at me or laughing with me.

1903
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:43,080
But this could possibly be the Evan that they're referring to, which would validate the theory

1904
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:46,400
that it is in fact their actual Bob and Doug McKenzie.

1905
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:52,020
And Strange Brew made during the, while this ride was open.

1906
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:52,400
Yes.

1907
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:52,880
Could have.

1908
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,660
What year is Strange Brew?

1909
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:56,360
80s?

1910
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:57,280
1983.

1911
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:03,300
I don't know that, I don't know those characters well enough to judge off of that audio clip,

1912
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:08,760
but we do know people who worked with Dave Thomas before.

1913
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,120
I did a show with Dave Thomas.

1914
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,000
Yeah, could reach out.

1915
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:18,840
Hey, do you have any recollection of riding this ancient, this extinct ride with a video

1916
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,220
camera?

1917
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:22,100
I'm thinking that a character looked like your associate editor.

1918
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:29,520
Which somehow ended up on a DVD sold by the now defunct website Extinct Intractions.

1919
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:31,920
Let me play a clip of them.

1920
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,920
For real, these are the actual, because I haven't heard them do it in a while.

1921
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:40,700
Welcome to the Green and Green corner of Great White North and look at this.

1922
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:47,640
I'm Bob McKenzie and this is my brother Doug and this is Doug's new beer bottle.

1923
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:49,280
Oh take off, eh?

1924
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,660
It's a baby bottle.

1925
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,360
Although it's not bad, eh?

1926
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,660
It's like a condensed version of a Saturday night.

1927
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,440
You have a little beer and a little sip.

1928
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,100
Well, you be the judge.

1929
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,360
Now, you're laughing at me earlier.

1930
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,040
Now the look on your face says that you're not so sure anymore.

1931
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,620
Let's go back to the audio.

1932
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:10,500
Okay, we're in the Frog Forest.

1933
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,160
It sounds like some dude though.

1934
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,680
I don't think so.

1935
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:17,320
The key, who do they say looks like Evan?

1936
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:18,600
I don't know.

1937
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,420
There's no way to know who they're talking about that looks like Evan.

1938
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:22,660
But then we look up Evan.

1939
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,440
This is at the end, this is at the fair scene and there's so much going on.

1940
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:30,080
To the left, to the right, behind you, I don't know which character they're talking about.

1941
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:35,040
But then we look up Evan Landis and he looks exactly like Dr. Fox.

1942
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,480
Then we would know for sure.

1943
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the only way.

1944
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:42,660
So that's the final bit of proof that we need.

1945
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:46,300
We have to interview, in addition to Roly Crump, Evan Landis.

1946
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,700
If he's still around.

1947
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:50,720
If he's still around, if he's still working, let's find him.

1948
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:55,320
But how would he know that someone once referred to something looking like him?

1949
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:55,500
You're right.

1950
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:56,940
But wouldn't he?

1951
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:57,860
Yeah, you're right.

1952
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:00,960
So we got to get Dave or Moranis on the show.

1953
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:07,500
I just think you just, next time you see Dave Thomas, I don't know what the circumstances

1954
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,120
would be.

1955
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:13,360
But just say something really subtle like, would you be interested in some weird juice?

1956
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,480
And then see how he reacts and look on his face.

1957
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:20,500
Look on his face, we'll tell you all you need to know and just leave it at that.

1958
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:22,580
Can you give me some space, dude?

1959
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:24,340
That's what he says.

1960
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:29,920
We need to have Rick Moranis on and ask him only about this issue.

1961
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,940
And not talk about Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

1962
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:33,460
Did you ever go on the Knott's Ride?

1963
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,180
No, I did not.

1964
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:34,920
All right, see you.

1965
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:35,840
Thanks, Rick.

1966
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,240
We can do a match.

1967
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:39,700
His first appearance.

1968
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:40,960
Yeah, yeah.

1969
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:41,400
All right, bye.

1970
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,240
All right.

1971
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:45,920
But now, but then there's one final bit of...

1972
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,440
Yes, just when you think the story's over.

1973
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:53,040
And this took some very, very...

1974
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,300
A lot of digging.

1975
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,280
But one of the...

1976
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:03,300
He's now known as the biggest Knott's Berry Tales superfan, and he's one of my new friends

1977
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,340
this past week.

1978
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,640
His name's Albert Rodriguez.

1979
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:11,520
So he purchased, as you may have heard two years ago, there was the Knott's Heritage

1980
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,180
Auction.

1981
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,160
And they basically auctioned off everything that was left.

1982
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:24,540
This is the Elder Berry and a couple other characters and also some like...

1983
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:31,280
Like technical books, like books on how to operate the ride and something that was called

1984
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,800
a costume swatch book.

1985
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:39,340
So I guess has squashes of the characters costume pieces so that when you restore it,

1986
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,080
you can get it back to the same color.

1987
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:44,460
I need that, by the way, to recreate that suit.

1988
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:49,160
And one of the trolley cars, like everything they had left, they auctioned off.

1989
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:53,480
And this guy named Albert Rodriguez purchased the rest of it.

1990
01:34:53,720 --> 01:35:00,380
So now between him, that guy Dale Tetley, I mentioned earlier, and this other guy named

1991
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:05,840
Ken Stack, between the three of these guys, they've got about 90% of the ride.

1992
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:06,780
Wow.

1993
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:10,540
Like all of the components are in these three people's possession.

1994
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:13,360
I'm talking set pieces and props.

1995
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,680
And they even...

1996
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:17,420
I sent you guys a YouTube video of this.

1997
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,380
There's an effect.

1998
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,080
I think it's a Theta Bear where she...

1999
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:29,440
A candle raises out of its base, flips around a little mouse, pops out of the base, and

2000
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,620
then goes back in right before the candle come back in place.

2001
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,120
They have that and they've made it work.

2002
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:38,180
And they're uploading videos to YouTube of it working.

2003
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:39,980
Sounds familiar.

2004
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:42,260
It kind of sounds like the story of the rocket fire explosion.

2005
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:42,720
Yes, it does.

2006
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:44,700
So they're planning...

2007
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:49,300
They've put their heads together and they're planning on doing something with this.

2008
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:53,320
And it's a project called Kooky Trails.

2009
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:57,100
So I got a hold of...

2010
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:59,460
I sent Albert a DM through Instagram.

2011
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:02,980
I told him that I was from the OC Weekly.

2012
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:03,880
Oh, nice.

2013
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:07,640
I've only written one freelance article for them so far.

2014
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,040
That's fine.

2015
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:10,700
I've got another one coming out next week.

2016
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:13,800
I'm already abusing my credentials.

2017
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:14,480
That'll be...

2018
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,220
What's that one?

2019
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,280
What's the next piece?

2020
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:25,760
I'll just tease you by saying, it involves a murder in a hotel on Harbor Boulevard right

2021
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,080
across the street from Disneyland.

2022
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:27,800
Oh, man.

2023
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:28,880
I'm so excited.

2024
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,320
I'll just leave it at that.

2025
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:30,900
Look that up.

2026
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,580
So anyways, I used my credentials.

2027
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:38,020
I told Albert I needed him to call me as soon as possible so I can interview him.

2028
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:39,140
Oh, yeah.

2029
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:39,500
Which I am.

2030
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,420
This was informal.

2031
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,300
I'm going to formally interview him later.

2032
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:43,240
Oh.

2033
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:49,020
When this actually opens, I want this to be article in OC Weekly if they go for it.

2034
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:49,560
Yeah, absolutely.

2035
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:56,180
So Kooky Trails is kind of like they're taking all these bits and pieces and these characters,

2036
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:01,980
refurbishing them and modernizing the story a little bit and working it into...

2037
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:10,320
I believe they have also, I could be wrong, some characters from that Raleigh Crump pizza

2038
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:10,980
restaurant.

2039
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:11,660
What?

2040
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:12,720
Oh, really?

2041
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:17,880
They're going to just reunite all these characters under the same roof.

2042
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:22,280
He told me, but he didn't want me to say on there where it's going to be.

2043
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:23,360
Oh, wow.

2044
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:26,580
But he says it's planned to open in summer 2020.

2045
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:27,400
What?

2046
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:28,120
Oh!

2047
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:28,620
Yeah.

2048
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,720
So that's something we'll look forward to and something we're going to...

2049
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:37,380
He's hired a company called Adrenaline Attractions and you can look these guys up.

2050
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:46,020
They just created a ride in somebody's, like a Christmas ride in somebody's house.

2051
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,580
And they seem legit.

2052
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,940
And this is being constructed right now.

2053
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,560
This isn't just like, oh, we're going to do a Kickstarter.

2054
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:54,660
We're pitching our...

2055
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,740
This is actually...

2056
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:57,440
They're doing it.

2057
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,560
They're doing it.

2058
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,240
Wow.

2059
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:02,080
Yeah, they're constructing it right now as we speak.

2060
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:06,280
And in what other case, if Disney gets rid of a ride, that's the end of it.

2061
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:06,720
That would never happen.

2062
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:11,440
But it's not a situation that it is so, like it's just more tangible and more indie.

2063
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:14,040
Somebody, you can recreate a Notts ride?

2064
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:18,460
Unless the Buzzy Theft was to create Cranium Command in someone's living room.

2065
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,440
And they wanted the real Buzzy.

2066
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:23,020
I'm going to live inside a giant head.

2067
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,460
Buzzy Theft, I don't follow.

2068
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:25,880
Oh!

2069
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:28,500
Oh, Buzzy from Cranium Command was stolen a few weeks ago.

2070
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,820
I didn't hear about this.

2071
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:30,720
I'm out of the loop.

2072
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:31,280
Yes.

2073
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,560
I went to Palm Springs for a week and I missed all the important news like this.

2074
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:37,300
It's easy to dive into that.

2075
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:41,160
You were even so worried on vacation though about it, so we didn't want to tell you.

2076
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,080
We would have ruined the trip.

2077
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:42,380
Oh, okay.

2078
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:43,800
You would have been in tears the whole time.

2079
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,540
But yeah, Buzzy is...

2080
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:45,300
He was stolen.

2081
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:49,900
Or you would have gone full spotlight and gone down to Orlando and found him.

2082
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:51,180
You would have broken the story.

2083
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:51,320
Or...

2084
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,800
You're OC Weekly credentials.

2085
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,140
Or...

2086
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:55,740
Palm Springs is a pretty good alibi.

2087
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:57,720
Uh...

2088
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:58,220
Oh, man.

2089
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,180
I posted photos and videos.

2090
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,060
Also good alibis.

2091
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:03,820
Good alibis is all I'm saying.

2092
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,860
You didn't do it, Doug.

2093
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,100
The guy who does RoboLite put me up to it.

2094
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:14,780
He offered me $10,000 to steal so he could use it in next year's RoboLites.

2095
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:18,060
You're as crafty as that crafty coyote.

2096
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,100
Guilty.

2097
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:21,440
Oh my gosh.

2098
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:22,320
So there is hope.

2099
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,740
And what is the name of it again?

2100
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:24,980
Kooky Trails.

2101
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:25,600
Kooky Trails.

2102
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:31,060
We will be broadcasting live from the opening of Kooky Trails complete with live commentary

2103
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,700
from Bob and Doug McKenzie.

2104
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:35,680
By then we will have established contact.

2105
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,180
There will be Raz in it.

2106
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:38,760
There will be Raz in...

2107
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:39,860
Raz-berry.

2108
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:40,960
Raz-y-berry.

2109
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:42,140
No, it's Raz-berry.

2110
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:42,940
Raz-berry, yeah.

2111
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,600
Well, a big event...

2112
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,300
Well, all right.

2113
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,060
So 2020, a lot to look forward to.

2114
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:48,680
2020.

2115
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,240
Marvel and opening and Kooky Trails opening.

2116
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:51,800
Right.

2117
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:56,160
Your next preview center on the first podcast of 2020.

2118
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:56,800
2020.

2119
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:59,280
We'll have more information by then.

2120
01:39:59,600 --> 01:39:59,980
Yes.

2121
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:01,880
And we'll look forward to that full interview.

2122
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:03,580
This is the...

2123
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:08,920
I feel like starting at the beginning of this episode, now I feel like we've arrived at

2124
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,420
the fair with this conclusion.

2125
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:11,900
Mm-hmm.

2126
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:17,500
And we can also promise an exclusive interview with Theta Bear.

2127
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,020
Only we have it.

2128
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:24,040
Only with our stolen journalistic credentials from Doug.

2129
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:30,560
Can I promise the listener that I will wear a Raz-berry suit to the opening of this and

2130
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:35,140
Jason will wear her boys in berries suit, sailor suit to the opening?

2131
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,100
I think I can, is what I'm saying.

2132
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:38,780
This is, what do they call it?

2133
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,500
Mutually assured destruction.

2134
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:42,840
So like we have to do it.

2135
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:43,300
All right.

2136
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:44,820
The other will look very foolish.

2137
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:45,140
All right.

2138
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:49,440
So you and I will wear the outfit and Scott will wear some purple socks.

2139
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:49,480
Fun socks.

2140
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:49,900
Fun socks.

2141
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:58,120
You'll be in good company because the circle of friends that these guys know are all super

2142
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:01,960
well versed in the Knott's Berry verse.

2143
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:02,840
Is that a...

2144
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:03,700
Oh yeah, yeah.

2145
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:06,320
And they'll get the reference immediately.

2146
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:08,380
And we're looking...

2147
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:13,260
It does, I think I've said this on the Haunt episode that it not seems like they're ready

2148
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:15,780
to get back into the Knott's verse.

2149
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:16,260
Yes.

2150
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:23,320
It seems like the new overlay, or not overlay, the new redoing of the Rapids ride ties into

2151
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:23,940
mythology.

2152
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,100
They're going to add to mythology.

2153
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:29,420
They're going to bring back old mythology and maybe they're getting back on track and

2154
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:31,140
getting away from just thrill stuff.

2155
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,460
They know the fandom is there and they want to nod to it more.

2156
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:39,400
And actually, well then the best thing that we can do, what the Kooky Trails guys will

2157
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:45,560
for sure is if I show up holding a big open can of lizard lard, Theta is taking a big

2158
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,320
scoop out of a can of lizard lard.

2159
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,620
So that'll be the little...

2160
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:55,680
If we need to get in, I'd suggest that as a password so only people in the know get

2161
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:55,720
in.

2162
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:56,860
Lizard lard.

2163
01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:00,900
How does Theta Bear make her cards levitate through the air?

2164
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:02,660
Lizard lard.

2165
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:04,340
You may enter.

2166
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:06,660
Phew.

2167
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:10,040
We practiced so when it happens for real, we're all set.

2168
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:10,760
Wow.

2169
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,200
A new ride opened up at the...

2170
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:16,280
There was so much here that an entire new ride was hidden at the end.

2171
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:21,080
What a blast of a journey through Nutsberry Tales.

2172
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:23,840
Doug Jones, You Survived podcast the ride.

2173
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,900
Once again, thank you for coming back.

2174
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:32,160
Thank you for being our guide through and giving us so much...

2175
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,040
But stepping through this with so much detail.

2176
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:34,940
So much fun.

2177
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,600
Thank you so much for having me.

2178
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:37,720
What a joy.

2179
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:39,160
I'm so glad.

2180
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:46,700
Anytime you find a bear related theme park show or ride, please come back and show it

2181
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:47,860
because it's delightful.

2182
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:50,660
This was a good omen.

2183
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:56,640
On my way here driving through Burbank, or do you not want people to know where you are?

2184
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:57,560
We've already said that.

2185
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:00,680
We at least had a drive through Burbank to get here.

2186
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:01,540
Yes, great.

2187
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:02,120
Great cover.

2188
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:04,820
No, no, Mike lives in Bear Bank.

2189
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:16,280
I saw a bear, I swear to God, a bear float and it was from, you know, just a few days

2190
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:17,780
ago they had the Rose Parade.

2191
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:18,260
Oh, right.

2192
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:21,300
And it was a bunch of bears and a log cabin.

2193
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:26,280
I did not watch the Rose Parade, but the float looked amazing and it was just in a random

2194
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,460
parking lot on the corner.

2195
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:32,780
And people were getting out of their car and taking photos of it up close.

2196
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:35,580
And it just kind of blew my mind.

2197
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,240
I'm going to have to now go see what that was all about.

2198
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:38,540
Right.

2199
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:46,960
But this was just meant to be a very good time.

2200
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,240
Can we end with the lyrics?

2201
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:49,380
Oh, yeah, please.

2202
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:49,860
Absolutely.

2203
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:50,840
Make sense to me.

2204
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:51,380
All right.

2205
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,800
Welcome one and all.

2206
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:55,960
Y'all come have a ball.

2207
01:43:56,060 --> 01:44:00,900
Things are very fine riding on the old Knott's Berry Line.

2208
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:03,540
And I think that says it all.

2209
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:07,300
This was this episode was sweeter than a boysenberry pie.

2210
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:09,080
Thanks so much, Doug.

2211
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,300
Thank you, gentlemen.

2212
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,620
Thank you for listening to The Second Gate.

2213
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:13,760
See you next time.
