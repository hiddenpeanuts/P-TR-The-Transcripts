1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,840
There's a party going on right here.

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,720
A celebration that Disney bailed on after about 10 years.

4
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan, hi.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,540
Hi, I can't think of a bigger party than this episode

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,160
and discussing the new urbanism movement

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,360
in American architecture.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,000
Absolutely.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's gonna be, yes, all the ins and outs of a movement,

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,800
both visually and aesthetically,

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,480
and city planning, it's city planning today.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,840
Mike Carlson's excited about all this.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
I don't know that that all sounds like a celebration

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,440
as much as like an investigation, maybe.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,560
Yeah, okay.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,320
But you're not picturing like a conga line of lawsuits

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,880
due to faulty building materials.

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,760
Well, if you're saying I should picture

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,740
anthropomorphic lawsuits doing a conga line now,

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,160
now I am thinking of a party.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,480
Now you have put in a fun image into my head

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,460
of like legal papers dancing with each other,

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,680
and that's great, that's fun.

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,360
That's something I can celebrate.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,920
Thick folders, opening statements.

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,240
Yes, exactly, and they're dancing,

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,280
and there's a lot of like, you know, yeah, like,

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,560
I don't know what lawsuits, how they work,

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,680
but there's sentences that are very aggressive

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,640
in those folders, you know?

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,620
A lot of numbers, it's like long paragraphs,

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,760
but then there's also numbers along with every line of it

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,040
so that you can say, page 52, line 74.

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,560
Right, they cite, yes, there's like a, there's a key,

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,120
there's a, is that a key, is a key, is a,

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,160
what would you call that, an index, I guess,

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,000
an index is what I'm looking for.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,040
Could be. So that's fun.

40
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,760
Those are new. This is what my father did,

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,320
and I know nothing about it. Really?

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,440
Yeah, pretty much.

43
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,920
I remember, mostly what I remember is when somebody,

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,280
like somebody vaguely celebrity contacted him

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,520
about like, maybe, I believe he almost represented

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,800
one of the members of Mob Deep, the rapper Mob Deep.

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,200
Was there somebody named Prodigy?

48
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,120
Yes, Prodigy and Mob Deep.

49
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,080
Yes.

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,040
So I remember that that happened,

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,880
that he was on the phone with somebody

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,400
representing Prodigy from Mob Deep.

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,760
As for what this was, I'm sure it was something very dry,

54
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,320
and I don't think it ended up occurring, but.

55
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,880
Were you ever encouraged to go into the family business?

56
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,200
Absolutely, yes.

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,200
That's a big thing, that I broke from

58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,240
at least five, maybe six generations of doctors or lawyers.

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
Wow.

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,560
It was either doctor or lawyer for so long.

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,840
So for a long time it was said,

62
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,920
hey, now keep this in mind, the Gardener men,

63
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,200
and it's all Gardener too, like just that specific lineage.

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And I, by being a whatever I am, whatever pile of shit.

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,560
Whoa.

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,240
Kind of a big, like, you know,

69
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
they've always been very supportive of it.

70
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,360
But for sure I was told, like, you know,

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,640
you can continue a proud tradition.

72
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,440
At this point in time, just the fact that I passed it along,

73
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,400
that I didn't also end the lineage, feels pretty good.

74
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,240
Oh yeah, that's true.

75
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,640
I sure I broke from the tradition of understandable jobs

76
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,920
as opposed to the hodgepodge of creative nonsense that I do.

77
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,640
But at least I, yeah, genetic code was passed along.

78
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,440
Wow, so you started, yeah, maybe you've started

79
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,680
another five to seven year tradition of, again,

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,720
whatever it is you do, what you would say you do,

81
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
that'll be another five to seven generations,

82
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,080
and then it'll go back to being like lawyer, doctor,

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,920
or whatever.

84
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,440
Or just keep trading hands in this, like, centuries long manner.

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,520
Yes, exactly.

86
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,560
Yes, exactly.

87
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,200
It'll be, yeah, it'll be, yeah, multi,

88
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,600
it'll be a thousand year old stories people will tell

89
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,240
and like speak of your great, great, great grandfather

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,320
who broke the lineage and he became a comedy podcaster

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,360
slash TV writer.

92
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,400
There better be, podcasting had better continue

93
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,680
for five generations in a row.

94
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,480
I think it's got the, I think it's got the mojo.

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,320
I think it can.

96
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,880
By the time your child is grown,

97
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,960
there'll be all sorts of like new streaming services

98
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,760
and delivery methods just going belly up, you know?

99
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
Yeah.

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,360
He'll have the opportunity to multiple times

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,840
have a project disappear

102
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,600
because the entire platform disappeared.

103
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,520
Yeah.

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,360
At that point.

105
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,280
To have an entire, your podcast network fall apart

106
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,920
all of a sudden seven episodes into doing your podcast.

107
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,240
That's true, yeah.

108
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,200
Boy, this, you know what?

109
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,800
I think the doctor lawyer pressure is back on.

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,800
I think I'm rerouting him.

111
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,520
That might be a rare tangent

112
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
on a otherwise straight line.

113
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
That seems like a real safe bet

114
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
that that many generations of lawyers and doctors,

115
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,840
inevitably someone would go into the arts.

116
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,040
And yes, just like growing pains,

117
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,720
that's the Michael J. Fox one, right?

118
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,840
The parents are hippies and he's the conservative.

119
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,880
That's family tie.

120
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,520
Yeah, if it does continue, yeah,

121
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,960
if your next generation's going to the arts,

122
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,800
someone will rebel and go to.

123
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,680
There'll be an Alex B. Keaton coming

124
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,320
in the next few generations

125
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,440
is what Jason is trying to say.

126
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,280
Sure, oh boy.

127
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,120
Michael J. Fox's character.

128
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,840
Oh, I don't want it to be, let's let one pass

129
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,040
because young conservatives now,

130
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,680
I do not, I hope I'm not already raising one of those

131
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,720
without knowing it.

132
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,680
I don't know if you are that genetically.

133
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,560
I feel like you might be.

134
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,800
Dear God.

135
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,680
Yeah, I don't want to say I wouldn't be accepting

136
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,600
of anything.

137
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,560
I would say 99.9% of lifestyles.

138
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,960
I am a okay with an encouraging of young conservative.

139
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh boy.

140
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,120
Unless that unless what that is changes a lot

141
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,000
by the time he's grown.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,880
Yeah, young conservative in Southern California,

143
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,240
like, oh, that that's not going to be an easy road

144
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,040
to ho kid like that's not going to be.

145
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
You got to monitor the TV

146
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,000
because if he's watching like Gutfeld Jr.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
I've been a couple years, like that's going to be a big,

148
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
like you got to figure out a way to like cut that

149
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,760
out of the TV or like to blank to like stop channels

150
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,640
from being broadcast.

151
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,840
Whimsical, tell him, tell him the fun stuff you talk about.

152
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,600
Like don't don't explain to him Lexan capital

153
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,520
and private equity and all that.

154
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,240
This episode could be the gateway.

155
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,200
Unfortunately, there's a lot of stuff there.

156
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,400
Like I think conservatism rears its head.

157
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,240
Oh, sure.

158
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,080
Yeah.

159
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,120
This is where we pass from theme park stuff over to.

160
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,840
Yeah, there's a lot of icky stuff going on here,

161
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,840
but I think at the at the root of it,

162
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,280
just to be to be very clear,

163
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,080
which I don't think we were at the beginning

164
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,120
with all these tangents,

165
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,560
we are talking about Disney's town.

166
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
This is when Disney started a town.

167
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,240
Let's not dress it up more than it needs to.

168
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,320
It needs to be dressed up.

169
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,960
Disney had a bunch of acreage that they had not

170
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,520
the fleshed out or done anything with

171
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,240
on that Disney World property.

172
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,040
And what if we used it to do the grand experiment

173
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,560
of a planned community?

174
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,840
Do you guys remember when this was going on?

175
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,080
Were you tracking this circa?

176
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,440
Everything says 94.

177
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,160
I don't know exactly when people moved in

178
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,480
or the town square was up and right.

179
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,680
I feel like maybe not until 96, 97.

180
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,720
Was it like really in full bloom if it ever was?

181
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,640
Groundbreaking.

182
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,240
I do actually have those numbers.

183
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,600
Groundbreaking, spring 1994, first residents,

184
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,040
summer 96, and then the town center in November 96.

185
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,240
Now, I'm sure they used at least the groundbreaking

186
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,960
and the town center to hold like big.

187
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,320
There's footage of Eisner down there,

188
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,880
cutting ribbons and such.

189
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,960
Yeah.

190
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
And he's part of it.

191
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,200
There's a lot of Eisnerism going on here.

192
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,000
This, in fact, is one of the bigger swings

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
of a big swing in era.

194
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,800
That Disney decade, we're gonna conquer the world

195
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,120
and it's not just about getting some hit movies.

196
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,120
It's about true dominance of the globe.

197
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,720
I think in Eisner's mind, we do this once

198
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,560
and then maybe we do it like 20 times.

199
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,960
Maybe there's so many Disney towns by the year 2000.

200
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,560
Disney towns, yes.

201
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,560
I mean, it is a real like super villain plan

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,320
because it is what you're saying.

203
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,120
It does the sense of like, yes, one successful Disney town

204
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,200
and then maybe we'll own a city in every state

205
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,240
in every country.

206
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,640
Like, yeah, it's crazy.

207
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,280
I'm sure that's what they were thinking.

208
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,760
And it's so funny to read the analysis of it.

209
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,720
I mean, some of it's definitely,

210
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,440
there's been almost 20 years of articles about this place

211
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,840
every article, no matter what year,

212
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,920
makes sure to say Disney's town,

213
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,280
even if they had well sold it off.

214
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,120
And most of the articles use either Truman Show

215
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,240
or Pleasantville as a reference point

216
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,960
and a lot of them use the word creepy.

217
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't forget Stepford, Stepford's in there.

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Stepford's good, yeah.

220
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,920
Yeah.

221
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,320
And this is one of those scenarios

222
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
and I'm sure we'll keep coming back to this,

223
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,920
but it's one of those where I don't disagree.

224
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,560
I don't disagree with that point of view.

225
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,040
It is creepy and it's undeniably Truman and Stepford-esque.

226
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
However, on the other side of it,

227
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,120
I feel like the media had such a hard on for this place

228
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,160
and analyzing it and watching it fail.

229
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,440
Like, I was looking this up on the New York Times.com.

230
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,160
The New York Times wrote about this place,

231
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,000
like 20 times over the,

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
like so much ink was spent on celebration

233
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,520
and like just like salivating over every move of like,

234
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,200
like, ooh, a perfect utopia.

235
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,120
The mouse, the mouse is trying to build some houses

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,640
and just like everything it means

237
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,320
in the American dream and corporate whatever.

238
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,480
Like, I like, in other words,

239
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
this is one of those scenarios

240
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,200
where I don't like either side of it particularly.

241
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,520
I don't like the rooting for it to fail so hard.

242
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,440
I don't know if I like the thing either.

243
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
Yeah, I was watching footage.

244
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,880
There's a lot of videos on YouTube.

245
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,280
People have milked this as like,

246
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,760
what's the deal with celebration?

247
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,280
What's celebration like now?

248
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,680
Like driving through celebration.

249
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,440
And it, you know, I was gonna say,

250
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,760
it's all more complicated.

251
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,520
It's all very complicated because I don't,

252
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,040
yeah, from a distance, it looks kinda nice.

253
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,440
But like when you get down to the nitty gritty,

254
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,280
there's like, oh yeah, there's some stuff here

255
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,480
that's not great.

256
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,000
You know, there's some like misses for sure.

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,400
I mean, the new urbanism, you know,

258
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,480
that I mentioned earlier was a design movement

259
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,520
meant to like correct the ills of like car culture.

260
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,160
Like bringing it back to walkable neighborhoods,

261
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,200
like a town center and that sort of thing.

262
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,160
And it's going against like,

263
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,920
because the idea is that post-war,

264
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,000
that you go work in the city and you drive there

265
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,800
and it's the rat race, but you live in the suburbs

266
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,840
and that's far away and that's wrapped up in malls

267
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,160
and why there's malls is like,

268
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
well, we need something over here.

269
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
You shouldn't have to go all the way to the city

270
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,560
to be able to do something and communicate with people.

271
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,160
And then this new urbanism is like,

272
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,000
what if we started from scratch

273
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,280
and made houses near the town center

274
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,400
and it's all kinda one through line?

275
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,240
Yeah. Yes.

276
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,160
And it's, I think everyone agrees

277
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
there are good intentions involved.

278
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,200
But like with so much, once you start building enough,

279
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,880
enough money gets involved.

280
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,440
Like you've run into a lot of the same things

281
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,560
that cities and towns of all sizes run into,

282
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,040
which is, you know, economic disparities,

283
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,840
racial disparities, you know,

284
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,240
people work in the stores in the town,

285
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,960
they can't afford to live in the town,

286
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,760
but they work there, you know,

287
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,120
and you can't, they seemed like they were trying

288
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,200
to get ahead of that, but it so much was going on

289
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,120
and so much of course worked.

290
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,320
Well, it's like they,

291
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,440
But didn't, yeah.

292
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,520
They like identified all of these,

293
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,200
all the syndromes that you're saying,

294
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,840
they're like, now we know that these are the things

295
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,160
that usually happen.

296
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,440
And we thought about that.

297
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,560
And by saying that we know that they happen,

298
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,320
we will make it not happen,

299
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,200
but then it all kind of happened.

300
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,160
Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,480
It's like, there was, look,

302
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,800
there's plenty of Eisner Disney hubris here

303
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,520
of like, you know, we just kind of maybe can wish it away.

304
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,640
We can wish all the problems.

305
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,240
If we, if we enchant our wishes with enough dreams,

306
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,040
maybe all the problems that we foresee coming won't happen.

307
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,320
And if America believes in us,

308
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
believes in the magic.

309
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Yes. Then we, our city will be enchant, enchant,

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I have to say enchanted.

311
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm still trying to use enchant singular

312
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,040
and it's not working.

313
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,720
Yeah. And you're right.

314
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,360
People play that up too much.

315
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,200
And to them, I say, how often do you say enchant in a sentence?

316
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,160
This play this example.

317
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,920
Celebration, Florida will enchant you, I guess you could say.

318
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,040
Doesn't feel that weird, actually.

319
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,280
That's so bad.

320
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,080
No. Yeah.

321
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,160
But it's only in a highfalutin, you know, you don't say it day to day.

322
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,960
I guess maybe that's not what they want.

323
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,320
You should only be enchanted when it's a special occasion

324
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,080
and you're spending a lot of money to be enchanted.

325
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,280
Right. And it's a special type of person that would have to use that too.

326
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,440
Like if I go, if you go say like, ask me about Celebration, Florida.

327
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,160
Like, do you lie? Do you think it's good or so?

328
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,600
They asked me just a general question.

329
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,720
Oh, what do you how do you feel?

330
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,640
What are your feelings on Celebration, Florida?

331
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,800
I don't know. I think if you take a trip to Celebration, Florida,

332
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,480
it will enchant you.

333
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,480
It's not right.

334
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Yeah, it's not.

335
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,560
It would also work for like, it feels like movie critic

336
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,360
who's trying to get the quote used.

337
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,880
Like Cher and Christina Aguilera will enchant you in burlesque.

338
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,800
That's true. Yes.

339
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,600
Jean Shallot would say it or write it. Yeah, that's true.

340
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,200
So, yeah. So, yes, Disney,

341
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,720
Disney couldn't wish away the issues that were

342
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,240
everyone deals with when they're building things like this.

343
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,920
Yeah, not now, if you back this up all the way

344
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,720
and if you subscribe to this Patreon, then this is probably history

345
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,400
that, you know, but let's just go over it because the first notion of Disney

346
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,240
owning a town and especially owning a town in Florida was Epcot.

347
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,440
And Epcot stands for experimental prototype community of tomorrow.

348
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,360
It is a weird phrase that doesn't really describe

349
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,640
what the theme park is anymore.

350
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,960
But that's if you break down the phrase community

351
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,720
and an experiment and prototype, there's like what a community

352
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,360
could be if we try it out here.

353
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,440
So basically Epcot was going to be the name of the city,

354
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,880
which was almost like the basis of why Disney World was happening anyway.

355
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,440
We've talked about all this remarkably little.

356
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,360
Yes, I know. We early on, I think we were talking a little bit about it.

357
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,960
And it is something I would love to actually maybe step through

358
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,680
the actual Walt Disney special because I I watched that thing

359
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,640
in its entirety not long within the last 10 years.

360
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,720
And I mean, is it called a dream called Disney World?

361
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,800
Is that the one you mean? Or is it the one where he's

362
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,040
before he died?

363
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,920
Yes. So it's like one of the last pieces of footage of him.

364
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,640
And he's explaining the plan.

365
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,200
That is called the Florida Project.

366
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,280
It's called the Florida Project. That one, I believe.

367
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,160
Yeah, that whatever the like tin box, like the box about all the futurey

368
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,760
Tomorrowland space ones that is on there.

369
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,760
I believe it was a wonderful world at Disney and it was a Florida project.

370
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,200
Yes, that it was.

371
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,440
I think it was a wonderful world of Disney for sure.

372
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,720
And I was floored even knowing like the basic history of that stuff.

373
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,160
I was floored at the insanity of that plan.

374
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Not that it might it might have been a fine, interesting thing,

375
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,840
but just the idea that this theme park man who makes movies

376
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,440
is going to build Future City.

377
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,400
And I was watching it going like,

378
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,480
does it did anyone think this guy who did like they go like,

379
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,400
we got to this guy's got to get we got to put him in a little room like

380
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,880
like what are we doing here?

381
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,520
Walt, I bet that would have been where the brother drew the line.

382
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,800
We're rolling up in.

383
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,880
Yeah. Well, yeah, Walt is a creative room one and Roy was the money one.

384
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,760
And they fought over stuff.

385
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,440
And even Disneyland felt like it wasn't going to happen, but it is.

386
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,960
Maybe that would have been where like, OK, although he did, as we know,

387
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,560
he went through with buying all the land.

388
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,800
They did buy the floor and it just became a theme park place.

389
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,680
Well, I think the exchange was like Roy's like,

390
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
you got to put a Disneyland there.

391
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,400
OK, you got to put a Magic Kingdom there. Right.

392
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,800
Is it going to be able to be your city?

393
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,400
Yeah, we got to have something that's a guarantee.

394
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,280
It's really a theme park and a hotel.

395
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,560
It's interesting because we're seeing this with the with the very rich people

396
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,280
we know that are alive now.

397
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,480
Your Bezos is, of course, like they start to get crazy big plans.

398
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,080
You know, not just going to Mars and stuff, but colonies,

399
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,280
we're going to build a better world.

400
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
And exactly.

401
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,560
So that, I guess, is a normal thing for somebody who is very,

402
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,600
very rich and been like very successful for a while.

403
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,400
But almost everything's gone right.

404
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,840
Like, yeah, like, again, giant swings.

405
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,160
And they've more often than not worked out.

406
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,760
So why wouldn't you start dreaming this right?

407
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,720
Yeah. And if you if there is a lot of fine

408
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,760
print with the original Epcot plan that I've heard people talk about a little,

409
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,800
I think Sam get away as like a giant book just about what the plan was.

410
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,880
And there is stuff in there of like the residents will rotate out every few months.

411
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,200
Like they will be working for the company.

412
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,680
Yeah, we need to get all of that.

413
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,320
Yeah, the combs. That's like multi-operative.

414
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,040
It's like the trucks, the delivery trucks will be underground.

415
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,720
Yes, underground. These ugly ass trucks.

416
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
And that is in the special.

417
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,360
You couldn't really drive very close to like the center of the city is my memory.

418
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,560
It's like you could sort of drive on the outskirts of it.

419
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,560
And then the majority of people who live would take the people mover

420
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:17,720
into the middle of the city, which was undergroundish and climate controlled.

421
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,320
I think like there's climate control stuff and there's unseen parts of underground

422
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,000
for like, yeah, deliveries and maintenance and that sort of thing.

423
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,640
It was but like I watching that special, I was just like, this was on TV

424
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,280
40 years ago, like that was this wild.

425
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,920
This feels like something in a movie.

426
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,960
But families are watching this just going like, like, all right,

427
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,160
this is something that's going to be happy.

428
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,040
It's also pre landing on the moon and everybody knows we want to go to the moon.

429
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,080
All right. Right.

430
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,280
Just like this. What an optimistic time.

431
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,000
We're like, yeah, all right.

432
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,640
Walt Disney is going to build us a cool city and we'll land on the moon at some point.

433
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,360
Mickey's dad is getting into city planning. OK.

434
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,880
Mickey's daddy, excuse me.

435
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,160
Yes, thank you. It was really sitting there.

436
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,400
Yeah, I don't want to be an incorrect, inaccurate.

437
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,000
So, yeah, yeah, watch, watch that if you haven't.

438
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,320
But we should do that sooner rather than later.

439
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,080
There's a lot there. Yeah. Yeah.

440
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,560
Also, the weird notion that like, so, yeah, you'd live there.

441
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,600
You would live in a city that Walt Disney made.

442
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,080
But I think there's also the stipulation that you could not own.

443
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,800
You could only lease from the Disney company, which is pretty bad.

444
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,160
And it's not what Celebration did.

445
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,200
You right. Right.

446
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,560
They're what wanted to be a big landlord.

447
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,880
And the ultimate landlord.

448
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,160
And now everybody would love that today.

449
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,960
Everybody feels great about landlords today. Right.

450
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,920
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's the ultimate landlord.

451
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,160
Little elements that like are kind of unseen, like reading about

452
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,520
Celebration, I learned about Disney's two utility companies.

453
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,920
They own Smart City Telecom and the Reedy Creek Energy Services Company.

454
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,920
Sure. Well, you need it.

455
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,320
They do have an energy company. OK. Yeah.

456
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,240
And they they also have again, this is something that I should really dig into more.

457
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,000
I believe there's a little.

458
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,880
Mobile home park pretty close to the Magic Kingdom,

459
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,120
and those are the only residents of the Reedy Creek Improvement District,

460
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,200
and they get to vote on stuff in the area.

461
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,320
Really? Most of them are Disney employees.

462
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,520
It's mobile homes.

463
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,480
That's interesting that so that they have a voting block

464
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,960
and so that it like they can have all of these city things for their theme parks.

465
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,200
Is it a technicality?

466
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,480
I think it's a technical.

467
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,600
Yeah, there are some people that logistically live at Disney World

468
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,880
for this purpose, not the Golden Oaks, not the hyper rich.

469
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,240
Right. Right. The mansions down the road.

470
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
Mm hmm. Whoa. That's news to me.

471
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,320
That's really strange.

472
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,160
And so what is what magic you think of it being living at Disney World

473
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,880
and then that it's just a small mobile home park office service.

474
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,840
Could we get a mobile home and have a residence there

475
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,360
so we could participate in local elections?

476
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,160
I think that is also done by lottery.

477
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,760
Similar to the.

478
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,080
I think that is also there's an application process.

479
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,200
By the way, depending on the price, I would go in on a mobile home

480
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,240
with you guys for Florida and we could just split it.

481
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,480
We go around using it when we would go down there.

482
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,200
I think we should talk about that off air.

483
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,760
No. So when so it stays there.

484
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Yeah. But when we're there doing business,

485
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,040
we have we now have a guaranteed mode of transportation and and we sleep there.

486
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,400
We don't. There's no more paying for hotels.

487
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,320
Exactly. No more hotels.

488
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,200
And now we wield some political power in the area, which is what we all really want.

489
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,160
Sure. Paint it. Podcast the ride purple.

490
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,800
100 percent. Put our logo up so people know that it's us.

491
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,480
Can we drive it? Family.

492
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,600
Can we when we're not using it, we pay someone to drive it around the park.

493
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,720
The area in the parking lot.

494
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Exactly. Wow. Yes.

495
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,000
Now we're getting the same kind of business that like backpages.com does.

496
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,840
That's right. The like sort of porno things that leave trailers out on the street

497
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,320
as advertisements.

498
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,080
They will leave. We're missing that.

499
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,240
They will leave a trailer with our logo on it outside of Animal Kingdom all night.

500
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,520
And everybody who goes by it is going to want to listen.

501
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,360
Where and we and the roof to let's make sure we hit the roof

502
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,480
because people who fly drones over.

503
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,720
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

504
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,480
This is the Twitter account bio reconstruct when they're.

505
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,320
Right. Fine.

506
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,840
Whatever they do around.

507
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,800
Now we're getting an ad in there every time.

508
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,280
It sounds good, honestly.

509
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,080
Yeah, this might crack the whole thing open.

510
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,400
We become you guys.

511
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,120
You might. This, I think, is a term

512
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,080
maybe exclusive to the northeast of the United States.

513
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,840
Do you know about the term snowbirds?

514
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,160
No. Oh, yeah, I think I do.

515
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,320
But you go ahead. Like snowbirds are people.

516
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,920
You hear it a lot in the context of the Jersey Shore.

517
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,840
Snowbirds have a place in New Jersey.

518
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,400
They come up to for the summer when it's unbearable in Florida.

519
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,600
And then in the fall, they go back to Florida for the fall, winter, spring.

520
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,200
And so as the climate gets too hot, you like leave. Right. Right.

521
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,920
So we would be that.

522
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,880
But we're like almost always in Florida, though.

523
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,800
Yeah. We're birds who are really strong because you have to go California.

524
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,000
Bird bird. We're bird birds or we're like hot birds.

525
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,160
Are we hot birds?

526
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,240
Oh, man. I mean,

527
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,120
I think we're hot birds.

528
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,840
We're just three hot birds.

529
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,960
And it's some heat.

530
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,760
Yeah. So, yeah, that'll be what'll happen when we have our place down there.

531
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,360
This is what I when you.

532
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,400
When you'd say that for it, because I like as it came up in America,

533
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,360
things when like animals are presented as sexy and things are doing cancan dances.

534
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,040
The word I don't like thinking of it being hot.

535
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,360
Birds are supposed to be hot. That's where it loses me.

536
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,120
OK, well, this is I mean, bird means a female in English slang.

537
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,400
So we're not talking about that in Austin Powers slang.

538
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,040
But we're talking literal birds and we're talking literal heat.

539
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,960
There's no attractive element to it at all.

540
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,440
It's just a hot bird.

541
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,680
It's just a very warm.

542
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,120
It's an extra warm bird if you want to think about it like that.

543
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,880
OK, good, because I don't want to see

544
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,080
any artwork of a bunch of three

545
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,480
birds in like cancan uniforms

546
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,000
with like garters or whatever.

547
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,120
And those are supposed to represent us.

548
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,960
No, I would. Heaven. Heaven forbid.

549
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,560
We're seeing that. Hot birds are awful to me.

550
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,080
Big hot. Now you added big to it.

551
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,760
Now I don't know.

552
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,440
Now I can see why I don't like when they're like my feet tall.

553
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,000
I think giant birds. Do I like Big Bird?

554
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,480
Yes. Do I like Miss Finch?

555
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,720
The big bird was a different bird. Absolutely not.

556
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,280
Miss is no bigger villain in cinema to me than Miss Finch.

557
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,280
Yeah. Hannibal Lecter, Miss Finch.

558
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,080
And then I don't know, Darnell above Hannibal was like helpful.

559
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,120
That's a good point.

560
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,080
Yeah. To an investigation.

561
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,560
Miss Finch ain't never done no good for nobody.

562
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,640
Miss Chase Big Bird around in the terrifying film, Follow That Bird.

563
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,120
Were you guys also afraid of follow that bird?

564
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,080
To me, that's the most intense. Oh, my God.

565
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,440
Are you kidding me? Oh, you are.

566
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,600
Bird is a big big.

567
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,200
He was blue and I was like, he's so sad.

568
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,920
Like I was just so upset for him the whole time.

569
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,800
Also, movie doesn't have enough Ernie and Bird.

570
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,120
I was expecting if it's Sesame Street movie, I know it's called Follow That Bird,

571
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,440
but Ernie and Bird have very little screen time.

572
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,360
So they're flying a dual plane around a lot.

573
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,080
Flying like a World War Two plane.

574
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,240
I mean, not a lot. Not enough. Not enough.

575
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,640
But yeah, no, it's a it's a achingly sad movie with a very scary villain.

576
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
And yeah, it was unpleasant.

577
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,280
I didn't want to watch it like Patton.

578
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,520
That starts with an extended patent parody.

579
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,480
Yes, right. Right. Right. Yes.

580
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,600
Why is there this big American flag?

581
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,000
Am I being recruited into doing something by watching this?

582
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,760
That stopped me from watching it every day.

583
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,000
But I was terrified when I viewed it daily.

584
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,040
I would love to read.

585
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,160
Has anybody done like a history retrospective on that?

586
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,040
Because that is such an interesting choice to make that movie so dark

587
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,440
for being Sesame Street.

588
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,160
I would get it for the Muppets. It makes sense.

589
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,520
But like Sesame Street was never that sad.

590
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,640
I mean, I mean, I guess it kind of was.

591
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,560
But that would just felt so that movie just felt so bleak to me as a kid.

592
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Yeah. Yeah. Why did they make that?

593
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,360
It's about oh, Dreads of a Ken Quapus, who like directed a lot.

594
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,400
I think The Office and Larry Sanders and stuff like a lot of stuff

595
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,880
that is like kind of like muted and realistic,

596
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,880
I think is what you described to him.

597
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,920
So yeah, why? Why?

598
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,040
Why isn't the why isn't the Sesame Street movie, the first Sesame Street movie,

599
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,200
the most fun thing that ever happened? Why is it so?

600
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,440
I do like it. Let me let me be clear about that.

601
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,240
Yeah, sure. But no, yeah, it was I didn't want to.

602
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,080
I mean, I think I did watch it, as you're saying.

603
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,400
I probably watched it a lot, but I was.

604
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Yeah, it was.

605
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,120
It was. It should have been a big party.

606
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,840
That should have been a celebration.

607
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,960
Elmo in Grouchland, much more up.

608
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,760
You know, I never saw it.

609
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,720
Yeah, me neither.

610
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,800
I think that's the one with Mandy Patinkin.

611
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,400
Well, this guy went on to direct, though, the filmography is so strange.

612
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,960
Dunstan checks in.

613
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,960
I don't think a movie anyone's accused of being dark.

614
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,760
That's a fun monkey romp.

615
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,800
As far as I know, I think the beautician and the beast.

616
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,120
Wow. I believe her.

617
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,360
And I believe her friend,

618
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,000
sure, yeah, and Tony Danza's Noah for the Wonderful World.

619
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,520
Oh, wow.

620
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,080
We learned about that, that he made a weird Noah's Ark movie.

621
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,440
Yeah. Wow. This guy, this guy's got an interesting career.

622
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,880
Yeah. Genuinely good a lot of the time, but also very bizarre.

623
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,200
Freaks and geeks. Anyway, I heard talk about the filmography of Ken Quapitz.

624
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,920
Celebration, celebration, Florida.

625
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,200
So, all right.

626
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,960
So there's all the Epcot stuff that was like there was that dream of like,

627
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,840
maybe you don't just go and visit this place.

628
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,040
Maybe you live there and maybe we do it a little better,

629
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,720
just like we had Disney do everything a little better.

630
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,400
But it didn't come to pass until this Eisner era because Eisner was ambitious.

631
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,800
He was extremely ambitious.

632
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,200
The hotels are going so well.

633
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,440
It's a big thing you got to credit Eisner for is the hotel situation

634
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,640
exploding in Florida.

635
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,160
They built they built it all out so much during his reign and they were cool.

636
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,240
They looked cool. There was a vibe to him.

637
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,600
So you can see where it's a logical extension of like,

638
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,000
if people are liking to stay at Disney World for a long time,

639
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,680
more than they used to, then maybe you'd want to stay here forever.

640
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,760
Sure. Yes. No, it makes it makes total sense.

641
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,160
I assume. Yeah, I would assume like, you know, they talk about imagineering plans.

642
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,760
Like they dust off some old plans.

643
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,800
I'm assuming it's just sort of in the air still at Disney of like,

644
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,400
you know what, we could sort of do a version of what Walt wanted to do.

645
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,080
So it like lines up all with with all of that, with like

646
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,720
the expanded hotel situation there and just that being a lingering idea.

647
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,880
Hotels and shopping, because at the time there was

648
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,880
the company that builds Celebration and takes the lead is the Disney

649
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,560
development company that had done a lot of those resorts and shopping stuff.

650
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,520
And then eventually they get absorbed into

651
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,720
imagineering becomes one company with like

652
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,240
Disney development company and the existing imagineering infrastructure.

653
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,160
So, of course, you know, Disney doesn't have a lot of builders on staff.

654
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,680
So a lot of this stuff gets contracted out and then subcontracted.

655
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,360
And that comes into play later on.

656
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,440
I read a big thing by somebody who worked for the Disney

657
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,000
development company around this time on Florida Trend dot com.

658
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,320
I'll give them credit and some interesting piece of info.

659
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,760
And Mike, to your point about ideas getting recycled around imagineering,

660
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,720
when they started talking about this, about fleshing out kind of a city,

661
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,960
there were a few ideas that Michael Eisner himself brought to the table.

662
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,240
One was a concept for what he called the Institute,

663
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,080
a hands on summer vacation educational experiences

664
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,840
modeled after Chateau Quoi in upstate New York, which he visited a lot while growing up.

665
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,200
Now, we know about this. This ended up happening.

666
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,040
This was the Disney Institute, a thing that we need to talk about,

667
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,760
this weird place where you would take classes while you're in Disney World.

668
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,720
You would learn skills.

669
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,520
This was a complete another like completely Eisner idea

670
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,520
that still is sort of odd that it's there or not there.

671
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,240
I don't even know the status of the Disney Institute at this point.

672
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,520
I think the physical property of the Institute, a lot of it, was cannibalized

673
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,040
for the Saratoga Springs Resort next to Disney Springs.

674
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,080
I believe as an entity, there are still classes

675
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,840
you can sign up for and take.

676
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,480
But like is kind of a piece with a wide world of sports, right?

677
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,600
Like making Disney World a destination with something for everyone,

678
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,080
making it like Westworld.

679
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,360
What do you want to do on vacation?

680
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,760
You can do any classes, theme parks, golf, you know, like, what do you like?

681
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,320
We have it all.

682
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,800
Trying to dominate, like which it does with people who do the vacation club.

683
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,920
Like, can we get people to make this the only place they go on vacation?

684
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,800
Because it's not just one thing.

685
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,200
There's 20 things.

686
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,760
So Disney World vacation can mean, you know, so there's so many variants of what that is.

687
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,880
Can we prevent them?

688
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,200
Can we prevent them from seeing the world?

689
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,120
Can we prevent them from getting any culture outside of this world?

690
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,360
If they get a taste, if people know that there's like a cool cliff

691
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,880
you can see in Hawaii or a big gorge or whatever.

692
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,520
Yeah. Like beautiful.

693
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,560
Oh, then they'll stop coming to inland Florida.

694
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,600
It's super, it's super villain type thinking, I think it really is.

695
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,920
But they eventually got into that business, too, with the adventures by Disney.

696
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Of course.

697
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,240
The travel itineraries and the cruises around the world and that sort of thing.

698
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,640
It is super villain thinking of like, and then we must dominate this as well.

699
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,520
And we must do this.

700
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,920
It's like you guys are doing pretty well.

701
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,360
Do you really need to?

702
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,440
Do you really need to like get some money when people go to Hawaii?

703
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yes.

704
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,680
Do you guys want to just focus on maybe making the cartoons good?

705
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,640
We're fine. We made four good ones in a row.

706
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,600
I'm sure they will keep being this good for many decades to come.

707
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,160
What are you worried about? I'm thinking about the Institute now.

708
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,360
I want to make sure nobody goes to Chateau Quah again.

709
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Yeah. How about a couple of new robots?

710
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,800
No, who cares?

711
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,520
Doesn't matter.

712
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,920
There will be a new robot when a new president is elected,

713
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,520
and that will be the only time that is plenty.

714
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,400
That's fine.

715
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,880
That's it. Yeah.

716
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,280
Look, we got the biggest ride in the world coming.

717
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,600
It's called the Millennium.

718
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,000
All right, we can milk that.

719
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,560
We don't need to build new stuff.

720
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,240
We got the Millennium.

721
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,080
If they had taken all the money they put in all this crap and just put it in a ride,

722
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,280
can you imagine what both parks would look like right now?

723
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,880
It would be like 10 parks.

724
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,800
You would have to be there for like three weeks to do everything.

725
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,960
Yeah.

726
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,400
It'd be that would be heaven on earth.

727
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,560
No, no, we had to learn.

728
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,520
Maybe this is where I think we've chosen the path of being completely pro Eisner.

729
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,480
But you have to start going, all right, well, there's this and there's this.

730
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,480
And there's another one right after the Institute in this article I found,

731
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,680
which is Eisner had an idea for the workplace in capital letters,

732
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,080
a theme park type experience.

733
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,000
Why don't we just what is that type in there?

734
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:21,120
In which visitors could experience how products are designed and manufactured.

735
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,120
The idea was similar to how visitors in Hershey's chocolate factory in Pennsylvania

736
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,200
get to walk through Hershey's manufacturing process, but done the Disney way.

737
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,120
Now, this idea is now this didn't really happen in any sense in Celebration Florida,

738
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,480
but clearly he just copy pasted this over to California Adventure, where you were

739
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,080
going to learn, we're going to see the tortillas and the bread and the tractors.

740
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,400
We're going to see how real Americans work with their hands in the land.

741
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,720
Yeah, I mean, you start.

742
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,000
I I'm wondering when it started, but like, you know, that that trade website

743
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,360
publication, Blue Loop, it's themed entertainment, but also the museum industry

744
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,400
because museums started to become theme parky and theme parks started getting a

745
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,200
little museum at some point.

746
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:20,080
I mean, MCA who used to own Universal, like they were a big, you know, tour.

747
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,840
Like they had a lot of different tour, you know, their fingers in different tour based stuff.

748
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,520
So like there was there is crossover among this this stuff.

749
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,360
But the dates certainly change over time.

750
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,000
But the idea that this would be a priority that we need to put into place is it's not

751
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,920
like a ride that spins you around.

752
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,840
It's we need to have a place where people work and then you go and watch the people work.

753
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,360
I mean, this is almost what the tour what the MGM studios is in a way,

754
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,360
initially to which it has its place.

755
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,880
But like it did once that sounds neat.

756
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,160
And then you start like slashing budget items and then it just becomes all right.

757
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,520
We put three tractors up.

758
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,920
Kids can see the tractors and then they can leave.

759
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, I just it's yeah.

760
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,920
For a company that like makes movies you like and makes theme park, it just everything

761
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,680
feels like it's such a distraction when you're like if you would have built amazing

762
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,440
ride, like five amazing rides a year, that would be sustaining the business so strongly,

763
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,360
like as opposed to like having to like branch out and get a hockey team.

764
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,760
And I mean, I like the hockey team.

765
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,520
Don't get me wrong.

766
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:39,320
It's just maybe these maybe Eisner's like the recent maybe this all taught him to slow

767
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,000
down and to focus.

768
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,880
And he's only got his couple things now.

769
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,040
He's got his soccer team, which I assume is good and does well.

770
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,840
He's got Bojack Horseman, which I read is good.

771
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,680
Apparently, I've never watched it.

772
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,840
But supposedly in theory.

773
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,240
So, you know, he picks his he's got his little projects and it's not about taking over

774
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,920
the world. Maybe somebody told him this in therapy, but I try to take over the world.

775
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,520
You know, tops now he owns the top trading card like so he's got a.

776
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,800
Didn't something bad happen with tops, though?

777
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,640
The top lost the I think Major League Baseball contract.

778
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,040
Oh, no. Oh, I think there's a new company.

779
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,400
He was busy looking at two converti cuts, probably.

780
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,920
I know he's on top spreading himself too thin again.

781
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,000
My goal, we got to get him on the podcast and he can't reject.

782
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,560
We have to figure out a different way.

783
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,320
We got to figure out a different way to get him.

784
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,040
Yeah, we can be honest to the audience, right?

785
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,800
We did. We tried a way and then we hit it.

786
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,200
We made a little progress and then we got we got pretty close.

787
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,280
I mean, at least we got like communication.

788
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,480
Yeah. And we got an acknowledgement that he has seen the cut.

789
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,400
The whole cut.

790
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,680
We tried on Breck, too.

791
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,120
I think Breck, we've tried two ways and failed.

792
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,960
Yeah, we my count is correct.

793
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,720
I think that's right.

794
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,360
And I think we would just hit a wall with that.

795
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,040
There was no.

796
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,040
I got a warm, I got a nice warm response of like, yes, we liked that.

797
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,520
That was very fun.

798
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,160
That cut.

799
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,080
He is not going to talk to you.

800
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,360
He will not be talking to you three with the hijinks.

801
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,640
No, no, thank you.

802
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,840
But thank you for the little fun thing.

803
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,440
Memories that person.

804
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,720
That's what I mean.

805
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Yeah, there's other people.

806
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,000
Here's what we need to do.

807
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,040
I've got it. I figured it out.

808
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,400
And maybe we should cut it.

809
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,080
Now, I'll leave it in. I'll say it out.

810
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,000
Moves like bird if we don't want to play it.

811
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,920
That's true. And it's this is not live so we can cut it out if it happens.

812
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,440
And now I'm remembering that the original story of involves Bill Cosby.

813
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,040
But don't worry about that.

814
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,560
It's the Conan O'Brien.

815
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,440
It's the Conan O'Brien story about giving Bill Cosby a fake award

816
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,240
and getting him out to Harvard.

817
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,840
Yes, this is something he did.

818
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,640
Yeah. What's a way that we can meet Bill Cosby and remember this before this?

819
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,480
Before we knew it.

820
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,160
Yeah, before anybody who could have been Bob Newark.

821
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,680
Right. Yeah, should have been.

822
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,120
Although it would have been.

823
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,200
Although not really, because then it's actually better that he got pranked.

824
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,880
Retrospectively or retroactively.

825
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,480
So we maybe offer.

826
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,120
Well, you know, we're going to do a live show and we want to present him with an award.

827
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,920
He's going to win a prestigious podcast, the right award.

828
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,960
Maybe we don't call it that to keep it a little bit vague.

829
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,400
And we know what we can do.

830
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,600
We can give one to Garland.

831
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,800
We'll give one to Jeff Garland before.

832
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,760
We'll give one to some other people that might be a name he knows.

833
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,200
And then we'll say we'd like to also he should Michael.

834
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,000
I should be the recipient of our and I don't think it's a legend award.

835
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,320
I think it should be maybe something else.

836
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,480
But we can talk about that.

837
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,080
We've been too loose with legend.

838
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,280
Too loose with that.

839
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,920
But what does it cost to make a foundation like a front foundation?

840
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,000
Oh, we can do that for free, I bet.

841
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,480
Probably we slap it on like Vandellay Industries, essentially.

842
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

843
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,680
Front, you know, podcast, the ride, getting a foundation.

844
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,240
Foundations. Yeah.

845
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,080
And then we do we need to disguise it more than that.

846
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,120
And our name not be in it.

847
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,320
We probably should disguise it more than that.

848
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,160
I don't want to completely get him there under false pretenses.

849
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,240
But if whatever it takes.

850
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,280
The PPR foundation, like, you know,

851
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,640
that might be enough, just the initials, you know, is there some like something

852
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,320
to like, you know, I feel like investment firms are called like black rock

853
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,600
or something. I want to say fake rock, but then that's giving away.

854
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,080
Yeah, it's almost a little acknowledgement that can it be like fabricated rock?

855
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,600
Can it be like fab fab fab rock?

856
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,480
The Fabrock Foundation? Yeah.

857
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,320
Fabrock Foundation would like to

858
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,000
you might think that that's the name of like the founder of it.

859
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,880
Is William Fabrock.

860
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,040
I mean, why not?

861
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,160
And we'll dress Jason up like a founder, William Fabrock.

862
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,600
And we're all like old, like a white mutton chops on his face.

863
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,000
And he'll have like a top hat and a monocle.

864
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,000
Yes. Yeah.

865
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,600
The way real millionaires have to believe it.

866
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,160
And either knows a lot of millionaires and he knows how they dress for sure.

867
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,520
Exactly. So he's going to buy it.

868
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,560
He'll claim and sinker.

869
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,960
Well, put a couple of hundred dollar bills in Jason's pocket

870
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,560
and he'll be able to tell the outline of it.

871
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Oh, sure. Jason's jacket.

872
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,240
Michael, do you still have the house in Lake Arrowhead?

873
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Meet me at, you know, I believe we met at a restaurant.

874
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,440
We met at Chateau Quah years ago.

875
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,000
We met at Chateau Quah.

876
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,080
Oh, very good.

877
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,160
Very good to see you, Mr. Fabrock.

878
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,080
This is good.

879
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,760
Companies or seemingly fake companies come into play later

880
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,400
on in the celebration. Yeah, yeah, truly.

881
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,040
Yeah. Yeah. Look, what we're doing is what everybody do.

882
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,920
We're just more we have to come at it from the angle.

883
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,000
But like fake companies exchanging things is what makes the world go around.

884
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,480
Yes. So oh, OK.

885
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,920
So here's maybe a fun place to take it is that they

886
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,600
they start figuring out the place, but there's like they're

887
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,760
they kind of can't move forward.

888
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,560
They know that the tenants of what it's going to be

889
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,240
and it's going to be this vibe and striving for this Americana and whatever.

890
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,080
But they don't have the name.

891
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,880
And this is something we've gone a long time without talking about is the name.

892
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,200
The name, I think, is a lot of why people were making fun of it.

893
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,400
Rooting for it to fail.

894
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,880
It's a very silly name. It's a pretty stupid name.

895
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,080
Yeah, it's it's I'm trying to think if there was

896
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,240
it is out of their comfort zone of naming.

897
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,320
It's still a family, but it is a little bit out of the comfort zone.

898
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,200
And it is funny because like

899
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,520
I get the I get the conundrum of naming a Disney town

900
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,960
because it has to suggest some kind of fun or magic,

901
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,600
but it also cannot be like Magic Town or Magicland

902
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,160
or fairy dreams, fairy dreams.

903
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,480
Yeah, I can tell you some of what they were thinking about.

904
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,000
Oh, yeah, I didn't see that.

905
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,400
Is close. We're getting close to the to the words.

906
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,040
And in fact, just so I don't just end up reading a list here,

907
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,280
let me share the screen.

908
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,080
So this is this is pass one, what I'm going to show to you.

909
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,680
They went to some firm that gave them a list of names.

910
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,320
They went to a firm called Interbrand and

911
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,400
nothing says small town, simple folks in America

912
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,240
than the good graphic designers and mad men at Interbrand.

913
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,560
Yes, so Disney went to the mad men at Interbrand

914
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,480
and democoding the project Project America.

915
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,640
They test them, which is different than Disney's America.

916
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,480
Project America is not Disney's America.

917
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,480
And it's not in Project America is not the Florida project.

918
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,720
It's Project America. It's its own thing.

919
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,080
This play gave them all the qualities they wanted a town to be.

920
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,600
They ended up with one hundred and twenty two names,

921
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,120
which then got whittled down to 19, out of which

922
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,520
none were selected.

923
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,040
They did not like any of them. Oh, here.

924
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,480
Feel free to just call out any any that you like.

925
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,920
I'll just kick it off with Antares and Tarris.

926
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,880
So Duncan Future Tis this that was that

927
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,320
Iron City movie that we know Alita Battle Angel.

928
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,480
Oh, yeah. Take me to Antares and Tarris.

929
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,800
Solaris is on there.

930
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,040
Solaris is in there.

931
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,000
Solaris, Horizon, Horizon.

932
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,240
You already have that.

933
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,960
Horizons, Florida.

934
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,920
But then maybe they knew they were going to close the thing.

935
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,200
So now that name's up for grabs.

936
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,680
Horizon is almost called Horizons.

937
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,280
Horizon floor is cool.

938
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,240
Yeah. Odyssey, another Epcot thing, that restaurant.

939
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,120
Odyssey, Odyssey, Florida.

940
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,040
I like a lot of these.

941
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,360
I think I like some of these more than.

942
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,800
Yeah, for sure.

943
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,280
Meridian, which sounds kind of like, OK.

944
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,480
Crystal City. How about that?

945
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,040
Crystal City. Yeah.

946
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,360
Crystal City. Yes, I do.

947
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,360
You can't call it an unincorporated area or a census designated area.

948
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,120
You can't just call something in Osceola County. Osceola.

949
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,640
Come on. Maybe I can't.

950
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,080
Orange County as Orange. Right.

951
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah, it's weird. It's boring.

952
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,840
But you can't I think you can do it.

953
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,640
Gateway, Solis.

954
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,720
These are just like computer company names.

955
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,200
Jubilee is not bad.

956
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,800
Which one? Jubilee.

957
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,160
Well, Jubilee, I believe, may have made it

958
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:30,840
to the net.

959
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,080
That might be the only one that made it to the next round.

960
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,840
The last three feel so insane to me.

961
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,200
Golden, if you read it as one thing, golden Oberon Jubilee.

962
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,160
Golden gets reused. Golden Oaks, you know.

963
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,120
That was. Yeah.

964
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,600
The NAP's that again. Yeah.

965
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,600
That is a weed strain.

966
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,760
Golden Oberon Jubilee.

967
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,080
I was going to say it's like, is it was it like the name of a of a Epstein plane?

968
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,040
Also, it was like there was a backup golden Oberon Jubilee.

969
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,440
So I'll leave the screen up and I'll take you to the next one.

970
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,640
So then they're like, we better get a backup

971
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,760
because I don't know if interbrand down, if we can trust.

972
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,040
Let's let's get some other.

973
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,680
So they went to like an even hipper company in New York called Lippincott

974
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:20,680
and Margulies, who then gave them a list of two hundred and sixty four names.

975
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,400
Hey, we did this.

976
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,040
We did the clock is ticking.

977
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,520
We have to come up with something.

978
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,160
We cannot go through two hundred sixty four.

979
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,120
So they whittled it down to 10, around which time Michael Eisner

980
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,200
and Jane Eisner, his wife, appeared.

981
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,920
And they started like, let's let's get down to business Jubilee maintained

982
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,560
new century landmark, I guess, crossed over Hyperion, which comes up.

983
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,680
There's a lot of Hyperion's in Disney, in the Disney universe.

984
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,600
This I thought was interesting.

985
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,680
Disney Springs.

986
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,240
Come on now.

987
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,640
I'm really reused as a mall.

988
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,680
And it still is almost a silly name as a mall.

989
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,520
But like nobody, if you said you lived at Disney Springs,

990
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,440
you'd get pretty thoroughly mocked, I think.

991
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,560
I think so.

992
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,920
That said, Disney Springs does have

993
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:16,800
the vibe that you you the vibe of the new urbanism, where it's like it's shop.

994
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,280
It's almost surprising that it's not mixed use, that there's not,

995
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,000
you know, a post office and an apartment like condos.

996
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,120
Right. Sure.

997
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,480
The vibe seems right for that sort of thing.

998
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,520
That's true.

999
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,280
You get really silly then with Fantasia.

1000
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,720
Come on. Not it's not Fantasia, Florida.

1001
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,680
It's it's I mean, honestly, they wouldn't do it.

1002
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,760
They didn't do it that then.

1003
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,720
But it feels like maybe now if they were doing it, they would,

1004
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,000
because of we were talking about in the Genie episode how they just, you know,

1005
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,920
use one of the most popular characters to be like an app,

1006
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,080
to be a feature of an app that people might not like.

1007
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,560
It's kind of a risky thing.

1008
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,880
And it would be funny if they named the town that they eventually were going to leave,

1009
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,120
get rid of like they were going to eventually get rid of their stake in

1010
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,880
and call it one of their most beloved classic films.

1011
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,080
But also a big ambitious flop.

1012
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,120
Yes, that's true.

1013
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,120
Yes, you're right.

1014
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,560
Thing to call it in a way.

1015
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,160
Again, decades later with the Fantasia 2000.

1016
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,080
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1017
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,000
Which is also which is a very silly title.

1018
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,320
And then isn't the golf course Fantasia Springs?

1019
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,520
No. What's the what's the mini golf course?

1020
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,240
All right. Fantasia Garden. Fantasia Gardens.

1021
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,400
All right. So again, we got our words.

1022
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,480
We were recycling these words, but very distinct.

1023
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,160
This one is unmistakable.

1024
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,400
And boy, is it insane.

1025
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,160
Boy, do I kind of wish they had used it.

1026
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,600
I think you guys might be staring at it, too.

1027
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,840
Ameri town.

1028
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,720
Ameri, Ameri, starting a town called Ameri Town, Florida.

1029
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,360
Ameri town.

1030
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,440
I'm going to share the screen now because I have the town crest,

1031
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,080
I guess you would call it the town logo.

1032
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,480
This is an anniversary one.

1033
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,800
But the circle, I believe, is this is featured at the city hall like this.

1034
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,760
It's a little girl riding a bicycle being chased by a little dog.

1035
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,720
And there's a big tree and a picket fence like residents not pulling

1036
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,920
their pants down like the copper town.

1037
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,320
Like the copper town.

1038
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:23,600
It is very copper town, but it's also very like, yeah, Americana.

1039
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,720
Ameri town. Ameri town.

1040
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,000
It is very Ameri town.

1041
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,440
It looks like a very town to me.

1042
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,920
You know, somebody's written a pilot called Ameri town

1043
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,680
that like makes a lot of very obvious.

1044
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,040
Right. Right. Yeah.

1045
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,240
Oh, there's a dark side to this country.

1046
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,880
Did you know the suburbs aren't always pleasant?

1047
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,160
And that's the angle on every article about Celebration Florida.

1048
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,960
It's the dark side of the suburbs.

1049
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1050
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,560
I think that's it was just too meaty for New York Times writers

1051
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,480
to not hit all the fucking time.

1052
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,800
I mean, you can you can sympathize with it, though,

1053
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,160
because as soon as Margarita Village was announced, I mean,

1054
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,200
I'd be lying if we weren't kind of salivating at the idea of it being a big disaster.

1055
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,560
I mean, I was pretty happy with that outcome, although as people pointed out,

1056
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,000
we got there and it felt like, well, failure shit.

1057
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,360
It's a little bit point out to us.

1058
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,480
Yeah, it is doing well.

1059
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,200
They those those properties go for a lot. Right.

1060
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,360
Yes. Still scary.

1061
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,120
Still a lot of still a little sex trafficker vibes at those bars.

1062
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,960
Still very hard bars.

1063
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,520
The town center of Celebration, I wrote down that it does feel a little

1064
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,760
Margarita film. We got it.

1065
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,280
Yeah.

1066
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,360
What's the what's the comedy club?

1067
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,000
We're going to do a show at Bonkers, the cigar bar slash comedy club.

1068
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,320
We'll do a show.

1069
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,680
Yeah, it's called Bonkers.

1070
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,040
Yeah, we'll do a show.

1071
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,400
We'll do like a regular show somewhere.

1072
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,400
And then we will do like a later night show at Bonkers, I think.

1073
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,280
For like and then they start throwing their cigars at us,

1074
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,520
trying to like singe our cheeks.

1075
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,880
And then we and like hurry, get in the Harvey.

1076
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
And then we'll do a show at Bonkers.

1077
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,360
Hurry, get in the Harvey.

1078
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,120
And then like Jason's running a little behind.

1079
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,640
We got to grab him by the arms.

1080
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,800
They're like they're they're trying to pull at him.

1081
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,040
They take his pants off.

1082
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,360
We get him back on. But sans pants.

1083
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:20,440
Full Mickey's trailer vibes like the the rules of plot, the same rules of plot.

1084
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,680
Or Mike's driving it like goofy, like leaning all the way out.

1085
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:29,000
His arms are flopping like it's like swings all the way left, all the way right.

1086
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,600
Or or in trailer.

1087
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,360
Jason gets left behind and the people from Bonkers paint him blue

1088
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,600
and put him in a cage at Margarita Village.

1089
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,760
I used to do a podcast about him boys.

1090
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,120
Yeah, I'm just a little blue boy.

1091
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:53,440
I'm sitting here next to the electrical box connected to nothing.

1092
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,840
Because this expansion area has not yet been sold to buyers.

1093
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,680
My family now is nothing but loose wires.

1094
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,040
You guys are good at musical improv.

1095
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:08,760
Yeah.

1096
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,600
For a reason.

1097
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,080
That part was before we started recording.

1098
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,000
But yes, thank you.

1099
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,760
Yeah, no, I know it was before we started recording.

1100
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,440
I'm just giving the audience a hint.

1101
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,640
Anyway, I was going to say, oh, no, I've completely lost my train of thought.

1102
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,800
Shoot. Oh, well.

1103
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,720
Chuckle. No.

1104
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,000
Well, we were.

1105
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,880
No, it's not chuckle.

1106
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,040
I was talking about town center.

1107
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,440
Like they, you know, they were using a lot of like

1108
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:40,560
I saw the term neoclassical, a lot of, you know, old school looking house designs.

1109
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:46,600
But then with Florida vibes in the town center, you know, some pastels and such.

1110
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,440
And it is that Key Westy.

1111
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,720
It's like a key west that grew out of nowhere.

1112
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,800
So this is a whole when I proposed doing

1113
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,720
Celebration Florida as an episode.

1114
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,760
And I said, I told you guys, because I might try to go

1115
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,080
because I'm going down for this bachelor party and it's on the way,

1116
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,000
you know, from the airport to the weird way, South town that we're staying in.

1117
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,920
Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll go to Celebration Florida.

1118
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,000
And then I ended up sharing a ride with somebody.

1119
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,760
And I was also like, that's insane to do.

1120
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,680
Why would I do that?

1121
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,560
And the big thing that stopped me was I thought, well, you know what?

1122
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,320
I can make it a I can stop and then I can get

1123
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,320
I can load up on like beer and liquor.

1124
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,600
And then I can be helpful and bring that to the party.

1125
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,560
And so while I'm in celebration, I'll stop at the liquor store

1126
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,680
and I will get some basics.

1127
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,720
And then I looked around the town on Google Maps

1128
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,600
and I saw there is no such thing.

1129
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,160
There is no pharmacy.

1130
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,000
There's no like Walgreens kind of thing.

1131
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,160
There is weird. You can go to a boring strip mall that's outside of celebration,

1132
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,600
but technically part of celebration that has the chilies and our back

1133
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,320
steakhouse and all the shit.

1134
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,960
But there was no there's no like market there.

1135
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,520
Yeah, which is maybe speaks to something weird about this place.

1136
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,320
Like, what do you do?

1137
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,720
You mean the whole thing is about walkability.

1138
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:11,480
And yet there's not just like a place for me to go get orange juice or whatever.

1139
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,880
Yeah, I watched a YouTube video

1140
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,640
about someone that someone whose family had moved down there.

1141
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,800
And she's like, well, there is a farmer's market on the weekends

1142
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,520
and there's a strip of malls downtown with condos above them.

1143
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:32,200
But like if you want to get to Target or like something entertaining to do,

1144
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,480
you kind of got to track to Disney Springs or you got to go outside

1145
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,160
of the town. Well, the movie didn't work.

1146
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,040
There's a beautiful movie theater that has been closed since 2010.

1147
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,360
I like I'll use this moment if I had to talk about the movie theater.

1148
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,480
Yes, yes. Something which always.

1149
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,160
That's the thing I always wanted to see it.

1150
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,240
Oh, like I've looked up.

1151
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,960
I've done the walk around on Google Maps of like I would like to go down

1152
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,760
Market Street and see that movie theater.

1153
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,520
That movie theater looks really cool.

1154
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,400
Yeah, it's like the majestic.

1155
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,800
Yes, very much was designed like a golden age of cinema kind of movie palace.

1156
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,280
And that's a thing I think we haven't touched on yet.

1157
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,840
Like the town center, a lot of the big landmarks, your city hall,

1158
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,720
your post office is designed by world famous architects.

1159
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,760
And with the biggest ever to do it, huge, huge architects.

1160
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,040
The movie theater is designed, was designed by a guy named Caesar Pelly,

1161
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,840
I believe is how you say it.

1162
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,360
He designed all these skyscrapers all over the world.

1163
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:42,720
The Patronus Towers in Kuala Lumpur, the Sierra Center in Philadelphia,

1164
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,360
the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco designed this very distinctive movie house

1165
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,520
that closed in the fall of 2010.

1166
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,280
AMC has the lease still to this day as we're recording this.

1167
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,200
The last two movies showing there were Harry Potter

1168
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,680
and the Deathly Hallows, part one and Megamind.

1169
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,360
So there's a lot of urban legends that like the movie theater

1170
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,200
only showed Disney movies. That is not true.

1171
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:17,040
What is true is the movie theater was banned from showing explicit movies.

1172
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,320
So like they couldn't show like big hit, like they couldn't show

1173
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,720
the latest Tarantino movie.

1174
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,600
They probably couldn't.

1175
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,720
The Matrix movie is probably too violent.

1176
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,680
I read something that said in order to get the like

1177
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,480
then Pleasure Island movie theater contract,

1178
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:39,400
AMC had to agree to run the Celebration 2 screen.

1179
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,640
Two whole screens, which is nice and charming.

1180
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,200
But then like, yeah, yeah, wait, we got to run two screens

1181
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,080
and we can't do a lot of the biggest blockbusters available.

1182
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,680
OK, that seems like a pain for our company.

1183
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,360
And it seemed like the general vibe when they interviewed people.

1184
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,200
There's a big Business Insider article from 2018 about this movie theater.

1185
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,080
And they talked to people who work there.

1186
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,680
And it's like it wasn't a matter of how much profit we made.

1187
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,240
It was about how a matter of how much money we were losing that month.

1188
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:15,160
So again, with a lot of this stuff, you know, with with like

1189
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:21,640
re redone town centers or like, you know, mixed use, small slash apartments.

1190
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,120
Are you actually making money?

1191
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,600
Becomes a question as time goes on.

1192
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,200
So the movie theater, there is recent movement on it.

1193
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,640
A group of locals has like made an organization called the Front Porch Theater

1194
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,440
because AMC's lease is up in October 2021.

1195
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,520
And I think they're trying to take local control of it

1196
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:47,920
to use it as a movie theater and like space for performances.

1197
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,480
It used to host post church services and a high school graduation

1198
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,080
in the early days of celebration.

1199
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,960
But there is movement of like locals trying to turn it into something

1200
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,600
because it's been nothing for over 10 years now.

1201
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,000
Yeah, they've had they took the name AMC off of it,

1202
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,760
but have just chosen to let it rot.

1203
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,760
Like there's literally like the bath.

1204
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,400
One of the bathrooms is flooding.

1205
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,800
They're just letting that happen.

1206
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:18,680
But largely so that another company doesn't swoop in and take over the brand.

1207
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:23,040
Now, luckily for them, post covid, there is only AMC theaters.

1208
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,080
Every other brand is dead.

1209
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,680
So it's a good it's a good time that there is no competition.

1210
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,320
So maybe just give it back to the people.

1211
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,360
Regal absorbs some of the regal is still hanging on.

1212
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1213
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,200
Yeah, there's actually, I think, a regal in North Hollywood now, too.

1214
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,840
So, yes. Yeah, yeah.

1215
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,320
That's a bizarre dying mall.

1216
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,200
That's a like weird fake dead on arrival mall.

1217
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,800
I recommend it.

1218
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,800
Have they said the citizens who want to take this theater back, have they said,

1219
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,520
are they how are they going to police the smut from from being shown

1220
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,600
or being performed at this theater?

1221
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,440
I don't know, because it's unclear what's handshake agreements.

1222
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,800
And like there's certain like upkeep that Disney Disney

1223
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,600
made Lex and Capital, the private equity vultures

1224
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,840
who now own the downtown of Celebration Florida.

1225
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,840
They like made them agree to certain like you have to keep this style.

1226
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,040
You have to keep this thing. Right.

1227
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,680
They didn't seem like there was enough in there about like,

1228
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,200
you have to keep the building structurally sound,

1229
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,480
which you're saying it's unclear if there's a morality clause

1230
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,000
that's still in play as far as what you're allowed to show in the theater,

1231
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,440
in the actual town.

1232
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,960
Yeah, well, I would say,

1233
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,440
Mike, if you if you wanted to put yourself out there as a candidate

1234
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,360
to be the morality police for the celebration.

1235
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,840
Yeah, I can't promise they would give you a job.

1236
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,880
But, you know, this organization is kind of seems like kind of a homegrown.

1237
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,560
It might be something that they're they're looking for.

1238
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,400
Well, yeah, if we are, look, if we have residents

1239
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,280
like we talked about at the start of the episode,

1240
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,400
then that's going to be an easier transition from you're going to need.

1241
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,200
What's the thing if you have residents?

1242
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,040
What like what's going to let you move somewhere having a job?

1243
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,520
So if we can make this job happen,

1244
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,440
I have a reason to live in the RV in Disney World.

1245
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,040
And then I'll be like watching like community theater and taking notes

1246
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,000
and telling them like what they need to cut out of classic plays.

1247
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,040
I'll like tell them what kind of.

1248
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:24,960
Hey, at the end of this, Willie Lohman's OK, and he gets a good new job.

1249
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,000
That's right. And that part where he kisses his wife, that's out.

1250
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,640
I don't want to see any kissing on this stage. All right.

1251
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,040
It can be implied he can go off stage and we can hear a big smooch sound effect.

1252
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,680
But that's it. That's what I was.

1253
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,600
And then I go, everything else is fine.

1254
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,600
And if you want notes on your actual performance, I can give you those to you as well.

1255
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,880
Well, you can show Django Unchained.

1256
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,320
We're just going to maybe cut the parts with the violence

1257
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,480
and the slavery and the slavery that's that is the chain.

1258
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,800
So actually, there's not going to be change.

1259
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,000
You know, if you're called the movie Django Unchained,

1260
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,160
maybe you just want to see him unchanged.

1261
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,960
So what you can do is you can show the last several shots of the movie

1262
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,720
and that's that's good, right?

1263
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,880
You're you are seeing Django Unchained.

1264
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,200
And then I'll feel I'll I'll film ten minutes of myself kind of filling in the rest

1265
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,840
that will play at the top of the movie and then we'll show the end when he's free.

1266
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,960
Here's some more info about Django's horse and horses at large.

1267
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,680
And I'll give a sanitized version of American history as well.

1268
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,320
I'll clean it up.

1269
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:30,400
I yeah, that well, isn't Celebration Florida already trying to do

1270
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,560
that's what I'm trying to uphold the values of celebration

1271
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,560
by giving everyone a fake version of American history.

1272
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,800
I mean, because that is what they're going for a little bit.

1273
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,040
And I hear maybe this is a good path to play a clip or two that I have.

1274
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,320
So and we'll we'll get we'll get back to Lexan

1275
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,080
Capitol, the people letting it rot currently.

1276
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,680
But let's talk about let's talk about the neighborhood, about the the the the the

1277
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,640
houses and actually living there and everything, because they're creating

1278
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:08,000
this little idealized beaver, you know,

1279
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,680
like America that that never was.

1280
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,840
And this appealed to a lot of people.

1281
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,320
So many people applied for this thing that they had to do a lottery to,

1282
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,160
you know, to get our first, the founders, the founders of celebration.

1283
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,560
And here is a clip that I'm going to maybe do a clip or two from a special,

1284
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,800
a BBC special that is called the Town Disney built.

1285
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:36,560
And if you can imagine that a BBC documentary

1286
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:41,680
about Disney's town is dripping with judgment and hostility.

1287
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,240
Right. Just like the scary music, like, like,

1288
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,680
could you just like wave for the camera a little bit?

1289
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,120
And then they don't tell the people that they're going to frame it

1290
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,720
like Blue Velvet and put scary music underneath.

1291
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:00,280
Blue Velvet, surprisingly not referenced a lot, probably too niche, but too dark.

1292
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:05,160
Yeah. Well, later on in 2020, the start of 2020,

1293
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,080
there's some Blue Velvet going on. Sure, sure.

1294
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,200
But so here you'll hear a little bit at the beginning.

1295
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,480
This documentary follows the kinds of people who initially

1296
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,520
Celebration Florida appealed to.

1297
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,800
You'll hear a little bit of the the BBC hostility at the top.

1298
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,760
And then you'll hear like why this one family wanted to move there.

1299
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,200
So why are they leaving all this for a still non-existent town

1300
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,600
designed by a company better known for building fairy castles

1301
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,640
and white knuckle rides?

1302
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,040
First of all, that

1303
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,520
fairy car, fairy castles and white knuckle rides.

1304
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:45,040
Maybe a white knuckler that takes you through a fairy castle.

1305
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,480
How many idea?

1306
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,640
How many rides are white knuckle at Disney?

1307
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,640
Come on.

1308
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,080
Few. I mean, yeah, well, a lot of them were to me until like, I guess that's true.

1309
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,760
I guess about the house.

1310
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,920
Also, by the way, they these people are very enthusiastic.

1311
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,160
They're like, we're going to we're going to start a new life and leave the past

1312
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,520
behind. And then the documentary follows them to where they live,

1313
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,960
which is a really fancy gay community on a lake already.

1314
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,080
So they're like, we need to get we need to get out of Trash Town ASAP

1315
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,680
and get to where Disney is going to handle things right.

1316
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,560
And here's what they say about it.

1317
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,480
To see us go back to

1318
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,200
old town morals and values and

1319
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:31,360
a town where you feel safe and comfortable, you don't mind meeting your neighbor.

1320
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,440
And you can only hope that that's what what's going to come out of this.

1321
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,480
Don't mind meeting your neighbor.

1322
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,960
And this is a sinister clip.

1323
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:45,400
She's it really from the reporter all the way to the family who are,

1324
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,000
you know, the most get outy.

1325
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,920
You've just all in like the same khaki shorts.

1326
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,040
Yeah, like barely moving.

1327
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,280
There's something so odd about that clip.

1328
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,760
Yeah, yeah.

1329
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,840
The guy is like an insurance guy or something weird and boring.

1330
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,040
The yeah, it's you know, look,

1331
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,560
I don't want to judge this guy specifically.

1332
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,720
I won't even read his name.

1333
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,720
I buy.

1334
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,160
I don't maybe I want to, but I'm going to try to not.

1335
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,600
You're trying your best.

1336
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,240
What I'm some of the things that he says

1337
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:24,000
are a little just we just want to go back to when we know what we know.

1338
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,880
We know what he thinks.

1339
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:32,120
You know, probably it's a little similar to some presidential campaigns recently.

1340
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,440
Yes, it's it's icky, even if I'm it's all a big mistake.

1341
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,280
But yeah, like this whole traditional

1342
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,840
and you can meet your neighbor and not be worried.

1343
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,520
Did like fucking one family move next to this family?

1344
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,960
And that's exactly the first thing I thought is that a nonwhite family

1345
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,000
move next door and this guy was like, well, that's it.

1346
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,680
There goes the neighborhood.

1347
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,760
Yeah, I mean, it really is a villainous.

1348
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,960
That's another villainous speech that that man and the family

1349
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,160
looks like a little bit like Ron Silver.

1350
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,840
That adds to the vibe.

1351
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,520
I think of this guy.

1352
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,640
He is very much an early 90s movie villain.

1353
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,120
Yeah, yeah.

1354
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:20,160
And the woman looks the wife is like a more hostile than a white.

1355
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:24,280
It's they're all in sunglasses, including the unspeaking daughter.

1356
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,360
It's an unfortunate.

1357
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,120
And they just think vaccines are a personal choice.

1358
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,520
It's private, you know.

1359
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,520
BBC should catch up with him now.

1360
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,680
Now, how'd it go, guys? Yeah.

1361
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,480
Did you were you were you comfortable meeting all your neighbors?

1362
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,600
I it's it's so weird.

1363
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,800
And Jason, you were alluding to this at the top, the whole thing.

1364
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,840
They were like, this is what Disney knew was going to have.

1365
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,080
Like, OK, you start saying these kinds of things.

1366
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,480
And then do you get into the territory and like the level of house

1367
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,960
that we want to build, are we getting into a bad socioeconomic zone

1368
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,320
or only going to have certain types of people?

1369
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,520
And then people will complain that it's only certain types of people.

1370
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,840
So they tried to cut that off at the pass.

1371
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,360
Here's something I think from a New York Times article,

1372
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,600
like to combat this kind of thing, the company placed advertisements

1373
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:19,120
in newspapers and magazines that catered to blacks and Hispanics,

1374
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,760
printed brochures featuring minority members.

1375
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,720
And those efforts have been a failure.

1376
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,840
Even Disney officials say so.

1377
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,080
And we put an ad in jet.

1378
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,240
What else are we supposed to do?

1379
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,600
That does seem like, yeah, it was a failure because that's all you did.

1380
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,400
Like, you can literally picture them like wiping their well done and done.

1381
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,160
Let's head to the smokehouse.

1382
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,520
You know, that's it.

1383
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,360
That was the effort we we can show our work.

1384
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,880
If anyone asks, we have the receipts.

1385
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:53,080
We put an ad into two issues of Ebony.

1386
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:56,520
And then those people didn't move to a different town.

1387
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,640
I don't know what else to tell you.

1388
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,640
Yes, a very Disney town. Yes.

1389
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,320
I then there was a census in 2000 that was very damning that it was 88 percent

1390
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,800
white and yeah, so look, things didn't.

1391
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,760
Yeah, things panned out in a way that they were worried was going to happen.

1392
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,960
And then it did happen.

1393
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,560
Yeah. And the median income is like, I think I think the surrounding area,

1394
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:24,680
it's like average income, you know, in a year, fifty thousand dollars or something.

1395
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,440
Celebration, Florida, average eighty thousand dollars.

1396
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,760
It's like, OK, well, yeah, what did you?

1397
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,840
Again, what did you think was going to happen?

1398
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,080
This this isn't, again, the Golden Oaks, the hyper rich houses,

1399
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,240
but they're not exactly cheap houses and God knows what the HOA fees are.

1400
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,760
Like, God knows what else is tacked on top of.

1401
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,360
Oh, yeah. Oh, it's got to be so insane.

1402
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,560
It does seem like a whole town run by a homeowners association

1403
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:54,640
in terms of the strict rule of like, keep your keep your hedges trimmed,

1404
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,240
keep your lawn mowed.

1405
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,720
You can find the style guides online, not just for the houses,

1406
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,680
but for like suggested landscaping options.

1407
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,560
Oh, yeah. They're monitoring like, yeah, if your grass is getting a little

1408
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,000
out of hand, you might end up with a letter.

1409
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,240
They I saw something that said that the compost for the plants is suggested.

1410
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,440
Here is the type of compost you should be using.

1411
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,600
So it got that nitty gritty, which is which is creepy.

1412
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,840
But a lot of it was this big picture stuff

1413
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,240
that is similar to that early Disney thing of we're going to put all the trucks

1414
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:36,200
under the ground and what they did in Disney World with the utility door

1415
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,200
where like you don't see cast members going from place to place.

1416
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,560
We're going to hide the behind the scenes stuff.

1417
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,000
You're not going to see a lot of trash and all that stuff.

1418
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,520
It was that kind of thing.

1419
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:48,640
Like it's porches on the front and you can only keep two cars out there

1420
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,920
and everything else has to be in the back.

1421
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,080
And that's where the trash goes.

1422
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:57,400
So we don't we want it to look idyllic on the street itself

1423
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,080
and our dirty trash will go in the back.

1424
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,000
Yeah, which isn't it's not the craziest.

1425
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,160
I mean, you know, streets are like that sometimes.

1426
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,160
It depends. I mean, I have not lived in a place that's like kind of a

1427
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,160
what do you call I'm not a gated community because that's more like the

1428
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,200
luxury version, but any anytime you see like, I don't know,

1429
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,960
what do you call the places that are all of one like a development?

1430
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,360
Yeah, kind of like a development, but it kind of does have some sort of gate

1431
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,520
that distinguishes it between I'm sounding like an idiot.

1432
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,480
You have very like Valencia type.

1433
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1434
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,200
Houses are almost the same and Calabasas, right?

1435
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,800
It's where the and then any any place with like a homeowners association.

1436
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,520
I think there's like these weird rules, but I've never lived.

1437
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,840
I've never had to experience it.

1438
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,520
It does sound odd.

1439
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,560
It is very like who's policing that?

1440
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,920
Who's policing my grass?

1441
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,960
Here's potentially a relevant clip from the same special

1442
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:58,040
where this guy sort of is digging himself a hole with what he's saying.

1443
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,560
I don't know if he's from Disney development.

1444
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:03,840
I don't know who he is, but he's talking about what they're trying to avoid

1445
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,920
by being micromanaging and having these rules.

1446
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,480
Then next door, they don't want somebody.

1447
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,320
They don't want the Unabomber next door.

1448
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,920
Not the man so much, but they don't want some shack

1449
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:18,440
or some guy decides he's going to paint his house purple or put a swimming pool

1450
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:22,000
in the front or a host of other or junked cars.

1451
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,560
So there are plenty of controls here,

1452
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,560
but I don't think that they are frightening controls

1453
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,560
and they will not interfere with people's real freedoms to.

1454
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,360
Not get a real freedoms.

1455
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,800
They're not frightening controls.

1456
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,240
Don't worry.

1457
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:44,160
Are they the Disney town doesn't have frightening controls, not frightening.

1458
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,480
You can't paint the house purple, which I was upset when he said that,

1459
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,120
because that was my dream as a child to have a purple house.

1460
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,840
That sucks.

1461
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,000
Well, you're out. You're akin to the Unabomber.

1462
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,920
Yeah, no, that is funny.

1463
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,240
It's like you can't have a junkie car and that's the same as the Unabomber

1464
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,720
lives next to you.

1465
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,440
So, yeah, I don't know.

1466
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,960
I'm sure there's different weird rules everywhere,

1467
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:14,520
but certainly the Disney, the ultra squeaky clean Disney vacation town

1468
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,600
adds an extra air of eeriness to any of these rules.

1469
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:25,320
It's all it's the it's the it's like living in the don't grow facial hair.

1470
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:30,920
And, you know, when women should wear these types of cool odds,

1471
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:36,600
like it's like, can we just be in that all the time in the employee dress code?

1472
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,760
Right. I go to sleep in the employee dress code.

1473
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:45,280
The dress like the the guides dress with the what do you call them?

1474
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,400
You know, the writing, right?

1475
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,080
Everyone was given a right to write a prop upon getting the.

1476
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:50,960
Yeah, right.

1477
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,080
They want anything gets that in. We don't allow guns here.

1478
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,240
We don't encourage guns.

1479
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,120
Of course, you have your freedoms.

1480
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,160
You can have one if you want, but you do get a writing crop.

1481
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,440
If anyone breaks in, just start whipping them.

1482
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,120
Mm hmm. Yeah, it worked.

1483
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:06,000
It worked great. Yeah, it worked perfectly until there.

1484
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,960
So, yeah, some there we had there was some crime.

1485
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,840
Some crimes started happening and crimes happen in towns.

1486
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,080
These things happen.

1487
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,920
But of course, but crimes start happening in celebration.

1488
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,760
And these New York Times and BBC kind of people all salivate.

1489
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,640
Well, well, well, you thought you could build the perfect town.

1490
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,640
And as I saw it noted in an article in Gizmodo,

1491
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
this this article was kind of playing both sides of it.

1492
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,360
They were like, but doesn't the crime make it more of a real place?

1493
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,000
Isn't that like now it's not

1494
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,040
Disney fairy castles and white knuckle rides.

1495
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,880
Now it's like a real place and like bad things happen in real play.

1496
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,440
No, they're celebrating the crimes.

1497
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,760
Yeah, they're like they're upset about the crimes

1498
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,440
and they're upset about the no crimes.

1499
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,280
There's no way to please people rooting against the celebration.

1500
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,680
Yeah. But they're still like, there's still not a lot of like,

1501
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,680
I feel like the first break in was a couple of years after the homes went up.

1502
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:04,680
OK, let's say at the first murder was in 2010.

1503
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,960
And then in 2020, there was a quadruple murder and the guy also killed the dog.

1504
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,640
So the first one, Jason, was an ax murder.

1505
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,120
Let's not just count that.

1506
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:20,200
That's not the reason that boy, these are some not good murder.

1507
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,440
There's good murder.

1508
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,440
I was going to say, well, yeah.

1509
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,720
So there are things and also that the 2020

1510
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,000
like the feds were after the guy for like he was a physical therapist.

1511
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,680
I think it was like for medical fraud, for like billing fraud.

1512
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,880
And it's like, Jesus Christ, man.

1513
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,600
Oh, my God.

1514
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,920
Oh, oh, these are these are some nuts ones. Oh, my God.

1515
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,240
So, yeah, that's what's happening.

1516
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,280
And then we're I don't know.

1517
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:55,800
It's it just proves that you can't like what you told me.

1518
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,520
It is impossible.

1519
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:00,480
It would have happened in Walt's Epcot to somebody would have been murdered in Epcot.

1520
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,840
Oh, I would have fallen to shit like for sure they would.

1521
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,520
I mean, look like how like stuff slowly dies, like in inventions,

1522
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,200
like slowly falls up, but just large chunks of it, just empty hallways or storage.

1523
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,800
Like, yeah, that was that probably would have happened in Epcot.

1524
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,120
It's like you got stabbed in the electric umbrella.

1525
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,880
You would have seen.

1526
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,400
Yeah, it would have been such an interesting

1527
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,120
conundrum for Disney because they don't you really don't want to have just a

1528
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,520
rotting city that you own that's next to your theme park.

1529
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,240
So they would have had to do something to it,

1530
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,960
at least either to keep it alive or just to demolish it.

1531
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:43,880
Because just like imagine the full like people movers,

1532
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,440
just like going on like a slow track.

1533
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,200
No one lives there anymore.

1534
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,200
Just going off one side.

1535
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,600
We can't afford the stop anymore.

1536
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,360
It's like you're saying that tomorrow land maybe isn't all it's.

1537
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:08,600
Imagine also that this is like right when like, yes, in like 1981,

1538
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:13,560
like they're dealing with like why we don't know how to do a movie anymore.

1539
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:17,560
Black holes in work, nothing's work, drawn and work.

1540
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,640
What do we do in the city?

1541
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,960
The city's falling apart.

1542
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,920
The underground has been seized.

1543
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,280
We can't go into the underground anymore.

1544
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,360
They started taking over the the grocery trucks.

1545
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,080
More control.

1546
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:35,640
The Morlocks have come up onto the surface and have seized a part of Epcot.

1547
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,200
They're the only people who saw the black cauldron.

1548
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,800
They dress like the black cauldron characters.

1549
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,840
If you try to go down, they whip you with staffs.

1550
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,960
They have skeleton faces.

1551
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:53,040
Did you guys come across the issues with the schools with Celebration First Open?

1552
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,000
Oh, I did not.

1553
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,800
This is another why are we reinventing schools, too?

1554
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,600
Yeah. So talking about Utopian,

1555
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:05,680
there there's often like, you know, cutting edge or like different

1556
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,080
styles of schooling that are tried.

1557
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,920
You know, maybe no desks or there's no grades.

1558
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,520
We just give you an assessment.

1559
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,440
It seems like Celebrations,

1560
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,480
what is now Celebration K through eight, tried to do all experimental schooling

1561
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:28,800
at once. The one that sticks out to me was like, OK, it's not 25 to 30

1562
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,320
students in a class. It's 80 students and there's three teachers.

1563
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,040
And it's like, what the fuck are you talking about?

1564
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,520
And so I think there was a lot of at the school, also,

1565
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,040
I believe, expanded very quickly from like a couple hundred to nine

1566
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,520
hundred or something like that.

1567
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,920
And it it I think it's course corrected.

1568
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,400
Now the school is still open.

1569
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,880
I checked in on the school the other day and it was immediately.

1570
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,320
You went down there.

1571
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,880
Well, I checked in on the school.

1572
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,160
Yeah, no, I can't go down there.

1573
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,960
That's the problem, because the website greeted me with a giant warning

1574
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,400
out of an abundance of caution.

1575
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,760
The Osceola School District has decided to move all students and teachers

1576
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,880
at Celebration K through eight to digital learning starting Wednesday,

1577
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:13,080
August 25th to Friday, August 27th.

1578
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,040
So that long.

1579
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,080
Yeah, no, it's not that long.

1580
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,360
And everyone they've assured everyone's moving back to in-person

1581
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,360
schooling Monday, August 30th.

1582
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,080
Well, that's when you'll be there.

1583
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:32,360
Checking every locker to stick and span deep breaths for the record.

1584
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:36,080
This is all since, you know, a judge ruled that school districts

1585
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,320
and Florida can institute mass mandates.

1586
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,840
But when I first looked this up, the Osceola School District's

1587
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:47,000
mask mandate was that all the students have to wear masks on a bus.

1588
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,640
High school, it's optional because like, man, I'm going to get the vaccine.

1589
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,760
It's required through pre-k through eight unless parents opt out.

1590
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,200
And so like, that's a different breed down there.

1591
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,760
You know, it's.

1592
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,000
Oh, yeah. Everyone.

1593
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,960
I know one in California is mad about mask mandates.

1594
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:11,760
There's no, there's no people yelling and getting into fights out in California.

1595
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,680
Well, yeah, it's where every build a Disney park.

1596
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,640
People are, you know, a little out there.

1597
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,920
It's only those two places, though.

1598
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,520
Luckily, luckily.

1599
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,360
Yeah, most places are you too.

1600
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,760
There's everywhere is more like celebration.

1601
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,560
Exactly. Yeah.

1602
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,520
Yeah. Yeah, boy.

1603
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,360
Who? That's all. Yeah.

1604
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,120
The school makes it seem like.

1605
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,200
Like, it's not just Disney reinventing the wheel there.

1606
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,680
Like, can we reinvent the wheel eight times?

1607
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,520
We're going to have eight new wheels.

1608
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,320
But it's 94 right now.

1609
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,480
And by 96, we will have eight replacements for the wheel.

1610
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,080
Was there did you find any information where they're like, you know,

1611
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,480
maybe this schooling, this type of schooling isn't working.

1612
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,520
Maybe 150 kids per class and eight teachers.

1613
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,480
Maybe that's the formula that would really

1614
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,880
move between these beakers.

1615
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,800
Yeah. All right.

1616
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,720
How about that?

1617
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,160
Was that Eisner's idea?

1618
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,800
Probably. All right.

1619
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,480
I mean, numbers, kids, kids.

1620
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,360
Let's do it. He gets what?

1621
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,520
Three hundred teachers and one student.

1622
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,480
It is the Terminator, the T2, three day

1623
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,240
the the students with the teacher on the screen and stuff.

1624
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,240
Oh, yeah. That's what we all live in.

1625
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,080
We should be thrilled with what's happening right now.

1626
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,960
We we live in the in the idyllic future screen learning.

1627
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,760
It all came true.

1628
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,440
I'm talking to you guys.

1629
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,680
It's like we're in the same room.

1630
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,240
Yeah, like we're in the same town and not just recording

1631
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:51,040
separately because we're terrified.

1632
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,840
What for the second run in a row?

1633
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,240
I'm loving it.

1634
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,240
It's all great.

1635
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,560
Yeah, there was I saw this.

1636
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,520
Look at the sentence from the New York Times.

1637
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:07,160
The parents at Celebration School were concerned about the absence

1638
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,160
of a written curriculum, textbooks and a clear assessment of students

1639
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,560
performance in the form of grades.

1640
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,760
Well, you know, all right.

1641
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,840
So weird teacher numbers and no curriculum or text.

1642
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,560
But what are you doing?

1643
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,680
Is everyone just doing like improv games?

1644
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,120
What is what is school at this point?

1645
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:27,680
Just zip, zip, zip.

1646
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,360
Just got a nice hang. It's a hang.

1647
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:34,760
Yeah. I mean, lots of places have Montessori schools and are that similar.

1648
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,600
But usually that's like and also here's the public school.

1649
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,400
And then here's some private schools.

1650
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,760
Celebration kind of far from other stuff.

1651
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,640
It's like here's our one school.

1652
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,320
There's no doors, man.

1653
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,960
I don't know what to tell you.

1654
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,720
You can't think your way into the school and how are you going to

1655
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,760
deal with any problems in your life?

1656
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:00,880
This is your kid's first lesson right here at the door or the lack thereof.

1657
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,600
It's also unclear if that's a teaching method

1658
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,680
or if that's subcontractors were given two weeks to build the school or something.

1659
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,840
Just call it a mistake.

1660
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,760
Call it some Marty mistake or something.

1661
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,640
I don't know.

1662
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,320
It's not traditional.

1663
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:20,840
Did they just play the like videos of the owl and the like owl

1664
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,520
Disney thing that used on the Disney educational owl?

1665
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:28,240
Yeah, right. Would they use that owl like that owl should have been utilized

1666
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:32,080
some way because he's like, they're teaching statue of them outside.

1667
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,080
At least him or like Ludwig von Drake, I guess.

1668
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,480
Yeah. Mm hmm.

1669
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,160
They just play Donald and Math Magic Land over and over.

1670
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,680
Yeah, we are.

1671
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,120
We already have our curriculum.

1672
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,400
We made it 30 years ago. Mm hmm.

1673
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,960
Yeah, we're I don't understand why that would just don't look.

1674
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:53,520
You're you've already got your plates full and you're still trying to like

1675
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,560
make sure things don't break it,

1676
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,680
that your theme parks like this is animal kingdom.

1677
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:03,760
We're trying to build a zoo also, the biggest zoo in the world.

1678
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:08,480
It's sometimes some days it's hard to do like four things for me.

1679
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,840
You know, I try to multitask a lot and it can get it can get hard

1680
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:12,640
to do a couple of things.

1681
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,560
Do you think if you were like Michael Eisner and you're like,

1682
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,240
I'm looking over all of this stuff, the creative content, Disney parks.

1683
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,240
And then they're like, we have to come up with a curriculum for the school.

1684
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,320
You're like, we're done.

1685
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,480
Get rid of it. Why would we do too much? Why?

1686
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,400
I don't have time for that. That's not that's not that fun.

1687
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,400
What are we doing?

1688
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,560
But no, they forged ahead.

1689
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,640
Yeah, the most ambitious man.

1690
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,520
But then didn't he have like a massive heart attack?

1691
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,200
Yes, he did. Yes, he did have a heart attack.

1692
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,560
Maybe it was about the curriculum.

1693
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,080
Right when that might have been the thing that was the one thing

1694
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,120
too many that forced him into a ride for a while.

1695
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,000
Yeah, really? Geez.

1696
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,200
I never put that together that as all this is going on.

1697
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,000
Yes. Yeah.

1698
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,320
Sorry to laugh.

1699
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,880
We still like to have you on the show.

1700
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,760
It's just so crazy.

1701
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:03,080
It was big. Was it a quadruple?

1702
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:06,000
I think it was like Letterman side, like that letter like quad letterman

1703
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,560
of the quadruple.

1704
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,120
Didn't he have a bypass to or by Jim?

1705
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,720
Maybe I'm mixing them to both of them.

1706
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,440
I'm not sure. I don't know.

1707
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,000
I'm proud that we don't know more about the specifics of Eisner's heart attack.

1708
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,200
Well, we will have to do it.

1709
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,120
Maybe they would get creepy.

1710
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,560
Well, if it hasn't already.

1711
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,480
And of course, Frank Wells dies.

1712
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:26,400
Katzenberg immediately is like trying is on his way out

1713
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,560
if he's not already out, you know, starting DreamWorks and the Katzenberg lawsuits.

1714
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:36,800
I mean, technically, Katzenberg was in the right, like his contract entitled him

1715
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,080
to a lot of money and Disney fought him tooth and nail.

1716
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,760
I think he was always in the right.

1717
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,040
When has Katzenberg ever not been in the right?

1718
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,880
Of course. That's a good point.

1719
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,920
No, I'm wrong. He did not.

1720
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,880
He had like a minor little surgery and then he was back to work quickly.

1721
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,120
Michael Eisner was.

1722
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,600
Was it not OK? Was not a massive heart attack.

1723
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,840
Yes, I think I left the hospital Thursday, many quickly from quad.

1724
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,160
Oh, no, I'm right.

1725
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,200
He had quadruple heart bypass surgery.

1726
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,880
I had quadruple in my head.

1727
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,040
Yeah, I was right.

1728
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:05,960
He's what it is.

1729
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,240
I apologize to me.

1730
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:10,040
But he went home at lunchtime with doctors saying he's on fast track

1731
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,200
to recovery because of his age, only 52.

1732
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,760
Made a remarkable recovery.

1733
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,800
He's basically a healthy person with some arterial problems.

1734
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,080
And they've been corrected.

1735
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,920
There's no damage to his heart.

1736
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:24,080
He bounced right back from quadruple bypass, same as Letterman.

1737
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,840
Well, and same as Trump got stronger from Covid.

1738
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,040
He was a superman.

1739
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,520
Regeneron. Yeah.

1740
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,440
He took he cracked open a vial of Regeneron, like the turtle ooze.

1741
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,000
Gulp it down.

1742
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,120
No!

1743
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,520
Teach you. Yeah.

1744
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,120
Super Trump.

1745
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,600
And they kept trying to get him out of office by putting that

1746
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,880
the antidote in his donut.

1747
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,400
Before, but he kept ripping.

1748
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,040
Yeah, he kept ripping the donuts open and seeing them.

1749
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:56,840
And it didn't work.

1750
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:01,720
Because all the post Covid Trump footage, he's had like fangs.

1751
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,440
Yeah.

1752
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,960
It's been just like oozing bile from the teeth.

1753
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:07,840
Yeah.

1754
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,640
It's yeah.

1755
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,960
I don't think that, by the way, I don't think that's the first time

1756
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,920
we've made a super shredder return.

1757
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,560
I don't believe so.

1758
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,840
No, that sounded familiar.

1759
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,520
The ooze style Trump reference.

1760
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:19,480
But anyway,

1761
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:21,960
that may be the last.

1762
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,080
It's recurring now.

1763
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,840
It's on purpose like the lack of a door in the school.

1764
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,920
It's a callback. Yeah.

1765
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,600
Stuff that did work.

1766
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,640
We talked about the movie theater design a little again.

1767
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,760
Worldwide famous architects.

1768
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,320
Michael Graves does the post office.

1769
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:43,320
Philip Johnson does the town hall, which I found out like an architecture

1770
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,920
blog called Thought Co.

1771
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,840
That did like a tour of like all the public buildings that famous people

1772
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,880
designed.

1773
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:54,080
The city hall is interesting because the author of the blog was

1774
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,480
speculating that it's a little architecture joke because the city

1775
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:03,160
hall is 50 columns like it just has so many columns and it's very distinctive.

1776
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,920
But that the maybe the architect making fun of the idea of public

1777
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,000
classical architecture by just putting an obscene amount of columns on the

1778
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,840
building. Interesting.

1779
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,520
Sending it up.

1780
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,320
Sending it up.

1781
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,760
I bet a lot of people walked by and had a good laugh.

1782
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,560
Had a good laugh.

1783
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,760
When they saw those columns.

1784
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,280
One of the most dark architecture I've ever seen.

1785
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,600
Robert Venturi on his way to do the, co-do the bank.

1786
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,000
You know, he's laughing.

1787
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,800
Right. Of course.

1788
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,760
So that worked is what you're saying.

1789
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,400
Yeah. It seems like the public architecture is, you know,

1790
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,280
comes up in like, you know,

1791
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,160
coffee table books about architecture a lot.

1792
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,840
Mm hmm.

1793
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,400
I like the vibe of a lot of it.

1794
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,680
And I think it was generally overseen by Robert A.M.

1795
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:52,280
Stern, who did a lot that I like from that era.

1796
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:55,960
Sort of like the early to mid 90s Disney stuff.

1797
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,520
Yacht and Beach Club,

1798
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:04,000
the animation building in Burbank with the hat.

1799
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:08,960
A lot of the boardwalk was also which the if you think about that,

1800
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,880
I'm going to live in a town that's like the Yacht Club and the Beach Club and

1801
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,520
the boardwalk. That sounds pretty great.

1802
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,760
Sure. Yeah.

1803
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:18,760
Places aesthetic. Those are not like fake classy.

1804
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:23,120
Like I think those are extremely well done.

1805
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,240
But, you know, these some of the houses had some problems.

1806
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,800
I don't know if they I think they mostly outsourced the making of them.

1807
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:33,280
But here I got the last of my little clips is of that architect of Robert

1808
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:38,880
A.M. Stern and just I think his view of what regular people are and do

1809
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,920
is a little interesting.

1810
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,840
We'd like them not only to hide in the backyard and barbecue their hearts out,

1811
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:50,040
but we'd like them to be walking on the sidewalks, biking with their kids.

1812
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,720
Even there will be so little traffic, they can be playing certain games,

1813
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,120
rollerblading or whatever in the street.

1814
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:01,400
We'd like them to be going to the park down the block and tossing a ball

1815
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,800
or whatever, walking the dog there.

1816
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,880
We want to get them out of the house.

1817
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:09,840
We we want them to we want them to to play the ball.

1818
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,640
We want them to not just pick up the ball, but to to toss it, to toss it,

1819
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:18,600
but to their fellow man or father or mom.

1820
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,480
They should view the sky.

1821
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,960
They should be viewing the sky consistently.

1822
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,880
They should be seeing the sun.

1823
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,880
We want them to look at sun and say, look, it is sun.

1824
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,280
The effects of the sun should be something that they are the be reeling from.

1825
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,920
They would be reeling from the effects of the sun and its heat

1826
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,320
and its warmth.

1827
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:40,240
And we want them to look at cloud and say what cloud look like,

1828
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,840
what it reminds them of.

1829
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,480
They talk loud is like barbecue cloud is like ball.

1830
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:52,640
It's a little I mean, that's all like celebration writ large.

1831
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:56,360
That guy's thing where it's like, well, you're not you're technically correct,

1832
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,080
but they're a little removed from your humanity.

1833
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:03,280
It's a little cold that I think partly when he says get out of the house,

1834
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:07,280
it's like, oh, that was the 90s version of everyone's in front of the boob tube.

1835
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,440
Everyone just stays at home and watches TV.

1836
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,400
It's kind of the equivalent now of like

1837
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:16,760
everyone's looking at their phones, these things, you know.

1838
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,440
Yeah, yeah.

1839
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:23,520
I'm glad Disney is set for one saying everyone should be at our parks

1840
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,720
and also looking at their phones the entire time that they're here.

1841
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,440
Yes. Well, you're right.

1842
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:32,080
You're not scolding us about phone use. They want us on it.

1843
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:35,480
Yes, they figured out you can use your money on your phone.

1844
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,960
Phone can be money.

1845
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,800
We got to work on phone.

1846
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,440
Phone can be money.

1847
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,040
Phone can be money.

1848
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,520
It says that on the wall there at Disney.

1849
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,040
Yeah, it's a shame that scrawled that when he got there.

1850
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,680
It's under to all who come to this happy place.

1851
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,840
Welcome.

1852
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:56,920
When you wish upon a star and then, yes, scrawled like the Unabomber.

1853
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,160
It says phone can be money.

1854
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:02,440
Spelled phone wrong.

1855
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,680
They just needed to get that message up so quick.

1856
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,080
So panicked to write it. Yeah.

1857
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:11,840
Um, you know, also, there is that whole thing of, yeah, we were like,

1858
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,440
we want them out of the house running around.

1859
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,440
But then also this place did have like an internal,

1860
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,360
like a little Internet that was only for them,

1861
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:25,560
which included a library of movies.

1862
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,760
I don't know if it works, but I think it was the idea that there would

1863
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:32,000
you would load up on the digital database.

1864
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:36,680
So some of your favorite movies on perhaps from Disney.

1865
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,360
So this is so celebration had Netflix.

1866
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,240
They had Disney Plus.

1867
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:46,600
I can't imagine how that could have worked in 1996.

1868
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:50,000
But there were some early versions of like like Sega.

1869
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,640
Sega had the Sega Channel.

1870
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,920
I never had it. I never even got to use it.

1871
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:58,440
But it would be this box you'd have to install that was connected.

1872
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,080
I don't know. Even I can't explain it to you.

1873
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:03,200
I guess it's somewhat it would have to be.

1874
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,880
I guess I guess maybe the games were in the box.

1875
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,760
Somebody who's smarter than me probably knows.

1876
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,120
But like so they had the versions of things that would stream

1877
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,520
or you'd have access to from something.

1878
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:19,000
So so it was I guess it wasn't completely impossible.

1879
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:24,000
It also there was a they had seen everything called front porch

1880
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,800
where, you know, you would post about your thoughts and concerns

1881
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,720
about the neighborhood.

1882
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:35,360
And I I don't know what was on there.

1883
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,840
I wasn't there.

1884
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,280
But doesn't that sound a little bit like a great website

1885
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,120
we have now called Nextdoor?

1886
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:45,040
It does sound like Nextdoor or Citizen or something.

1887
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,960
And now and they're reusing front porch is what they want.

1888
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,120
That's the movie theater group.

1889
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,320
Oh, all right. Yeah.

1890
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,640
Hmm. That's what they're all of this whole place is about porches.

1891
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:58,440
That was one of their new urbanism rules.

1892
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:01,920
Also, it's all porches and we want cars in the back

1893
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:07,120
and not very long of yards so that all the porches are pushed up close.

1894
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,560
Everybody should be out.

1895
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,920
If you're in, don't ever go inside.

1896
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:14,640
Be on the sidewalk or be on the porch and say hi to your neighbors

1897
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,800
because you're not afraid. Right.

1898
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:21,200
Yes. Are you trying to say, Scott, that there's a lot of innovation here,

1899
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:25,080
like a lot of technology that would eventually be adopted by everyone.

1900
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:30,240
Like with the next door, like what was it actually?

1901
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:34,720
It was a front porch. It was a like was it a message board?

1902
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,920
I guess. Yeah.

1903
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,560
Julie, just a message board. OK.

1904
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:42,680
So, OK. Cork board, but digitally, I think. Right.

1905
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:46,320
But I think I read somewhere that you would sometimes see some iffy stuff.

1906
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,200
Oh, yeah. Can we get to have we looked at the Internet Archive?

1907
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,480
Can we find this? Yeah, we got to comb through that.

1908
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,360
Yeah. Do we have to join, though?

1909
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,120
Do we have to prove our residents?

1910
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,800
I bet we can do it. You can cheat that, I'm sure.

1911
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,600
Well, we'll look into it.

1912
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,240
I mean, maybe it takes it's a couple step procedure.

1913
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,160
Yeah, we're looking into it very strongly.

1914
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,320
Oh, no, wait, wait, I found it.

1915
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,880
Oh, very strongly, I guess.

1916
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:11,920
I might have to.

1917
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,200
Oh, wait, there's no forums.

1918
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,240
All the forums have been deleted, I think.

1919
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:18,800
And it takes you then to the celebration website, which I already was on.

1920
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:23,080
OK, so they've which is why we broken the celebration website.

1921
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:26,200
Yeah, some of the quest blue question mark boxes

1922
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:29,160
where like the image is not there anymore. Right. Right.

1923
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,200
Speaking of which, apropos of nothing, not that I don't want to do a tangent here,

1924
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:36,480
but the everyone should go to Funny or Die dot com now and see what's there.

1925
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:39,480
Oh, man. I'll tell you what isn't the landlord.

1926
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:44,920
They managed what to redo the site and you can't find the landlord.

1927
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,760
They have mucked this up beyond belief.

1928
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,080
It's a comedy on it, though.

1929
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,240
Well, all right.

1930
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:51,960
They got that.

1931
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:55,040
What they don't do is make websites that work on mobile anymore.

1932
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,120
Oh, well, try it on your phone.

1933
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,840
See what happens anyway.

1934
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:02,960
Wow. It's a really bad.

1935
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,760
People care a lot about Funny or Die dot com out there.

1936
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,120
Yeah, no, they want to.

1937
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:10,080
And for sure, they want to see this banner

1938
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,640
that mostly is promoting television shows that aren't on the air anymore.

1939
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:15,880
Huh?

1940
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:18,000
OK, well.

1941
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,760
The celebration website, yeah, is a little broken.

1942
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:26,000
I did end up finding the one of the things they're doing

1943
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:30,320
or I guess they did it last year called the Posh Pooch event,

1944
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,280
which I'm excited about.

1945
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:35,280
Did that pave the way for anything important in the future?

1946
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,160
Or is that just its own wonderful event?

1947
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,040
I think it's just its own wonderful event.

1948
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,200
What was it?

1949
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,040
Well, the Posh Pooch event is where you bring out your dog

1950
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,240
and they do some shows.

1951
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,520
There's a costume contest.

1952
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:53,040
Osceola County Sheriff's Office then does a canine demonstration

1953
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,120
where I assume they put a guy in a muscle suit and then have a dog attack it.

1954
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,240
And everyone, the crowd goes wild.

1955
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,600
I think that's a guess.

1956
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,880
What would the canine demonstration be?

1957
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,440
Would they like pretend that the dog was like sniffing out weed?

1958
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,680
I don't think so.

1959
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,760
I think they would show that the dog is like in bite

1960
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:10,000
an intruder's arm or something.

1961
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,880
I could be wrong.

1962
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,120
Maybe the dog jumps through a hoop and that's fine.

1963
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:17,240
We have for this and only this instance allowed marijuana

1964
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:20,280
into the Golden Gates of Celebration, Florida. Right.

1965
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:24,920
For your enjoyment, after which it will be incinerated and not in a way

1966
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,720
where anybody can be smoking it.

1967
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,360
Not in a fun way.

1968
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,800
They have to do it in the sky.

1969
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,840
There's a whole there's a slate of events.

1970
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:34,320
You know, Derek and Dave are performing at 2 p.m.

1971
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:36,960
I can't find out who they are or what they do.

1972
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,560
What do you mean?

1973
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,080
No, they're at the event. Derek and Dave are at the event.

1974
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:41,560
I don't know.

1975
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,320
At Posh Pooch. Yes.

1976
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:47,840
And DJ Joe Magic is DJing all during the day,

1977
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:51,520
which I think would be fun to see DJ Joe Magic.

1978
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,240
Is his given name or just a really cool stage name?

1979
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:56,120
Do you think Joe Magic is his?

1980
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:56,600
I think.

1981
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,040
Joseph Magic.

1982
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,120
He. The second.

1983
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,520
Yeah, yeah.

1984
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,360
He but he at least you can find some clips of DJ Joe Magic online and

1985
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:10,840
look, he's got a high energy presentation, a high energy sound.

1986
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:16,440
If everything is striking me now that I would, it seems possible

1987
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:20,920
now that someone is listening to this, to us, say all this,

1988
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:25,400
who lives in the town has to be and maybe they like the town.

1989
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,320
And here's where maybe we need to say, I don't know.

1990
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:33,840
This history is all funny, but I could see how living in the town

1991
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,600
might be fun.

1992
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,880
I don't know. It's probably like

1993
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:42,520
as fine as it is to live in a lot of places, just has all this funny

1994
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,360
history to it. It's funny here.

1995
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:47,640
I think even the look for you're listening and you live in celebration.

1996
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:48,960
I think you'd have to agree with us.

1997
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,840
It's funny that Michael Eisner wants to do this.

1998
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,520
It's a silly idea that Disney wants to build a town.

1999
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,160
The name is silly.

2000
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:58,000
The name is silly.

2001
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,880
The BBC clip you played is sinister.

2002
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,720
Like all that stuff is true.

2003
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:06,680
But as far as the actual day to day living in celebration at this moment,

2004
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,840
it's like, of course, it might be fine. It might be nice.

2005
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,520
Who knows? Fine.

2006
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,760
We're not going to be like Jason and Lake Nona.

2007
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:16,800
We know Jason hates this place like Jason hates Lake Nona, Florida.

2008
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:21,360
Twenty sixteen, the town center residents sued Lexington Capital,

2009
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,800
alleging chronic negligence, breach of fiduciary duty

2010
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,520
and damages of 15 million to 20 million.

2011
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:29,720
Sure. Are you?

2012
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,600
It's not great living in all of the town.

2013
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:32,760
That's from a Daily Beast.

2014
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,560
Well, I'm just saying, you know, you maybe have a little corner of it.

2015
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:38,800
That's nice. And obviously there's some issues, but we don't know.

2016
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,800
I think that's a good disclaimer at the moment.

2017
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,440
Well, we know some of it.

2018
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:48,440
I mean, the the private equity company that bought it in 2004

2019
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:53,760
immediately established like a million like little companies.

2020
01:39:53,760 --> 01:40:00,160
They have Lexan Celebration LLC, Lexan Celebration Commercial LLC,

2021
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:04,040
Lexan Capital, Lexan Real Estate LLC.

2022
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:07,080
And they all own little parts of downtown.

2023
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,000
Like this is shady business.

2024
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,200
Private equity is a horrible thing.

2025
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:14,920
But this is really shady, I think, to go to Florida

2026
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:18,960
and then start buying up pieces of land a little bit at a time

2027
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,240
using all these different names instead of just at once.

2028
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:25,400
If they were for rides, if they were for rides, Scott.

2029
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:31,440
Yes. Secret companies to buy things for rides is a good it's a good secret.

2030
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,200
It was Swamp Land.

2031
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:39,160
But remember then that same land, which that's how Disney acquired it,

2032
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:43,680
then became Celebration, which then Lexan started doing.

2033
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:47,200
Right. But if it's if they're hoarding housing, that's a different thing

2034
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:51,400
than building white knuckle thrills in a fairy castle.

2035
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:55,120
White knuckles than building white knucklers or whatever he calls it.

2036
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:57,360
Hiring fairies with white knuckles.

2037
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2038
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:05,000
So, no, we'll do a full episode about the housing crisis in America someday.

2039
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,200
It seems like a lot of the house is fine.

2040
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:12,040
It seems like there's still a going lawsuit about like the downtown

2041
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,960
that the private equity company owns is falling apart.

2042
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:19,200
I will say in the nicer news, there's a hotel downtown

2043
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:22,720
called the Bohemian Hotel. Marriott runs it now.

2044
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:24,680
I don't think they always did.

2045
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:27,640
Rooms there are pretty cheap.

2046
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:31,320
I looked out the room so you can get really some good news

2047
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,200
under two hundred dollars a night.

2048
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:37,120
And I'm saying Hollywood Studios, five miles, Magic Kingdom, eight miles.

2049
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:40,720
It's probably cheaper to stay in Celebration, Florida

2050
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:44,840
and lift to the Disney parks than stay on site at the Disney.

2051
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,280
Maybe it depends.

2052
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:51,200
It depends. The one downside, no Walgreens or Target or supermarket.

2053
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,280
You need things in your room.

2054
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:57,960
There's some quaint little boutiques and probably a coffee shop and a pet store.

2055
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:02,200
But DJ Joe Magic might be closer to you if you are in Celebration.

2056
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,320
Yeah, you might not go to the parks.

2057
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,680
You might just watch every DJ Joe Magic said.

2058
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:10,600
Yeah. And let's be honest, the pooches are far more posh in Celebration.

2059
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,400
So if you like a fancy dog, that's where you should go.

2060
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:18,560
Well, Lady from Lady and the Tramp is a pretty posh pooch.

2061
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:22,240
But Lady's not really represented in the parks terribly much.

2062
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,080
No, she's not.

2063
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:24,880
Yeah. Is there any other?

2064
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:29,480
Yeah, she is absolutely the most posh pooch of all the Disney pooches.

2065
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,960
How posh was Beverly Hills Chihuahua?

2066
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,400
Pretty posh.

2067
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,520
But they're posh.

2068
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,560
Yeah. Beverly Hills are going to be posh.

2069
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,520
That's true.

2070
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,120
Duchess, of course, from the aristocrat is a cat, but she's very posh.

2071
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:45,880
Very posh. We can't count her as a pooch because she's not a pooch.

2072
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:52,360
Um, the one of the buddies has to be posh, I think.

2073
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,880
One of the air buddies or space.

2074
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:54,960
Yeah, that's got to be.

2075
01:42:54,960 --> 01:43:00,840
Yeah. If anybody knows those movies at all, let us know who is.

2076
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,960
Your poshest Disney pooch.

2077
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:07,600
We're having our own contest here on podcast The Ride.

2078
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:18,760
The pod, the pick of the poshest pooch podcast contest.

2079
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:22,880
Yeah, I guess you'd have to put. Yeah.

2080
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:25,000
There's got to be a P word.

2081
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,240
Yeah, we'll figure that out.

2082
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,640
Pick the poshest pooch podcast pandemonium.

2083
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,680
Yeah, that's good.

2084
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:32,600
That's going to be whatever.

2085
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:33,360
Yeah, official.

2086
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:36,280
That'll be your official contest that we do every year.

2087
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:40,440
So, yeah, no, some of this sounds bad.

2088
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:42,240
There's buildings that have just leaked forever.

2089
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:44,960
And then it's like the leak, the Lexan Capital.

2090
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,120
I will lean also in Disney's defense.

2091
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:50,760
I think Lexan Capital has really let some of this go to shit more than

2092
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,960
than Disney ever did because you hear stories about like,

2093
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:57,720
well, the roof I bought the condo

2094
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,560
and then the roof started leaking immediately.

2095
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:03,360
Could I get that that roof fixed?

2096
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:06,840
Well, the roof. See, what you really bought is the inside,

2097
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,400
not the outside.

2098
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,680
Outside is the roof.

2099
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:15,040
So if you have a suggestion for a way that the roof could be improved,

2100
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:19,320
such as, I don't know, different shingles or stopping the massive leak,

2101
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:23,760
then feel free to take it up with the Town Center Foundation,

2102
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,080
which we at Lexan Capital run.

2103
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,680
Yes. And that's different than the owner found the owner group

2104
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,560
who are not allowed to see the document.

2105
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,960
Like, it's it's very kooky.

2106
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,640
Kind of tangentially related.

2107
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:41,360
Friend of the show, Lentesto, a few years ago tweeted,

2108
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:45,600
our entire complex, Sola at Celebration was condemned today.

2109
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:51,000
And I believe he has a full episode about that on their bandcamp stream

2110
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:54,480
for the Disney dish. So check them out. Mm hmm.

2111
01:44:55,240 --> 01:45:00,960
Yeah. So look, is it a utopia? No, no, it's not.

2112
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,160
But I don't know.

2113
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,680
Calling him friend of the show made me

2114
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:08,520
I feel like I have to address the time where somebody said to us,

2115
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,040
you see, you guys know Lentesta and you guys both

2116
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:18,200
like very like playing it like, you know, we've actually we've been in his hotel room.

2117
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,600
Yeah. Yeah.

2118
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,280
Like neat.

2119
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:26,160
Yeah. As if it was Mick Jagger was the tone of it.

2120
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,280
You know, we actually he actually listened to his.

2121
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,440
Len is listening right now.

2122
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,480
He listens to the second gate. I'm aware of it.

2123
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,720
And he knows he is like Mick Jagger to us.

2124
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,760
Other thing, I can't know Len that it's being dry.

2125
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,840
You let us into your room and then it didn't end there.

2126
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,080
It's been bragged about where we're gaining.

2127
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:45,160
Yeah, exactly. From this is social points.

2128
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:47,320
Our social status is so much higher.

2129
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:49,440
I ran by and Lentesta's hotel.

2130
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:50,320
I read, you know what?

2131
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,240
The funny story when we first met, well, we met Len in Galaxy's Edge

2132
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:59,560
and we were going to interview him and I ran by and said hello

2133
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:03,560
to a friend of the show, Matt Cardona, professional wrestler, Matt Cardona,

2134
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,560
who is eating in downtown Disney.

2135
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,160
And I was like, hey, man, good to see you.

2136
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,440
I got to go. Got a big interview with Len.

2137
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:10,480
And he goes, yeah, I get it.

2138
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,640
He's like, I understand, because he's a theme park guy.

2139
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,840
So, yeah, absolutely.

2140
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,800
Now, Matt Cardona has some feelings about Lake Nona, isn't that correct?

2141
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:23,160
It is. Yes, he I could go read his text.

2142
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,760
And I'm just telling you, I'm telling you, I think the same thing's

2143
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,840
just going to happen like any planned community.

2144
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:33,280
I think the same thing's going to happen here.

2145
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:36,560
You know, I know you're applying the future to it.

2146
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,320
You were talking about current day Lake Nona.

2147
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:40,600
Oh, no, I don't know.

2148
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:43,720
I mean, I met the Lake Nona, like Disney,

2149
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:47,600
you know, office apartment thing.

2150
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,240
Well, it's not how you said the town.

2151
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:51,800
You said the town in general, which caused

2152
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,400
you this text message to be sent.

2153
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,520
Do you have it? I do have it.

2154
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,400
It says Jason can suck it.

2155
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,680
Lake Nona is beautiful.

2156
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:04,400
I'm sure the area is plenty nice and I'm sure it'll be even nicer.

2157
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,160
I am only sure that a wrestler is saying to you.

2158
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:09,440
I have another I have another text, too.

2159
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,280
Let me see where.

2160
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:15,080
If you two work on your listening, you would understand the context that was.

2161
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,280
Wait a minute.

2162
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:21,760
But wait, there's still there's quote, there's the info that was beyond the quote.

2163
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:23,720
That doesn't make sense.

2164
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:25,760
It seems like Matt Cardona, you're saying Matt Cardona.

2165
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:30,080
I think if you go back to the episode, we were trying to add some.

2166
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:34,560
We were trying to say, well, maybe the area is nice, despite the fact that with Disney,

2167
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:38,000
what I was saying on the episode was that it sucks that Disney is making people move

2168
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,720
because they've been here for a long time.

2169
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,520
And I kept saying, well, maybe the area is nice because it's not like you're

2170
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:45,600
trash in the area. And then you kept going in on the actual area.

2171
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,280
That is what happened.

2172
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:51,360
I thought we were discussing the like concept art of the development,

2173
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:54,920
which looks like a glorified celebration, Florida downtown,

2174
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:58,680
which seems like will be great for C-suite executives making six

2175
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:02,080
fingers, regular people working and imagineering.

2176
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:05,520
Like, I think there's already a housing crunch coming in Florida.

2177
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:07,200
Yes, I understand what you're saying there.

2178
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,960
But I'm saying if you go back and listen, I think that is what

2179
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,240
I'm saying in the conversation.

2180
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:16,320
I see. And I can't find the other one where somebody goes, oh, man, Jason said

2181
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,240
Lake Nona is bad. It's not. It's good.

2182
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:23,400
I'm just saying I'm saying if there were two text messages,

2183
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,320
that was the information being conveyed.

2184
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:26,280
All right. A certain way.

2185
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:29,240
And if that's all I'm saying for you to apologize to Lake Nona,

2186
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,920
you might want to take the opportunity.

2187
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:33,680
I apologize to current Lake Nona.

2188
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:38,080
And, you know, I'm but I can't help

2189
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:42,720
but acknowledge the people pointing out that like, yeah, this is going to be great

2190
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:47,000
for very wealthy Disney employees who won't have to pay the income.

2191
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,760
There's no real occasion.

2192
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:52,320
There's no doubt about it that the Disney company's decision

2193
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:57,440
will obviously benefit them and very the very least inconvenience

2194
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:01,200
the people that work for them highly inconvenienced and upend their lives.

2195
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:02,880
That is no debate.

2196
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,000
We were just literally saying, well, maybe they're not being thrown

2197
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,240
in the worst pit in the world.

2198
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,080
That's all we were saying.

2199
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,400
OK, that's all was happening.

2200
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,600
So I don't think MacArdon is that mad.

2201
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:18,840
I know he's so we should have him on and I'll he'll look and find out.

2202
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:21,720
Well, I know he's a death match wrestler now and I'm scared.

2203
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,040
He just had a very scary death match.

2204
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:28,400
He was bleeding all over the place and the next day went to Universal Studios.

2205
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,640
Wow.

2206
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:33,480
And also plenty of people, you know, there are other people, you know,

2207
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:36,920
if you go to the show, Bo Casino and the Lannox City, they're very good chance

2208
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:37,800
you come out bleeding.

2209
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,200
So, you know, it's kind of part of that's fair.

2210
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,160
That's fair. Yeah.

2211
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:44,120
It's not that you want to talk about not really well kept up.

2212
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,640
He's I will say also just now because we're on tangent land here.

2213
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:51,640
He's wrestling in a couple of days in a place that I played indoor

2214
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:53,880
soccer at Hoffman Estates when I was seven.

2215
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,960
Wow. Which is really funny.

2216
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,160
Yes, the actual venue where I played indoor soccer.

2217
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:03,520
They're running wrestling shows there in Hoffman Estates.

2218
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,720
So anyway, now that we're off the beaten path here,

2219
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:09,080
that's what happens at celebration.

2220
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:11,080
We'll get back on it. We'll take a walk.

2221
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,600
We'll play with the ball.

2222
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,680
I mean, I feel like we're winding or we have to wind it.

2223
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:16,840
I knew this would be a it'd be a long walk.

2224
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,680
I figured there's a lot here.

2225
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:23,600
I mean, I guess that's that's a curiosity I have is like, is there like

2226
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:29,640
is it possible to enjoy living there if your building isn't condemned,

2227
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:33,640
if it's not one of the places that Lexan is let go into the toilet?

2228
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:36,360
Yeah, let us know.

2229
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:39,600
Yeah. Let us know if you lived there or grew up there.

2230
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,320
What was the deal?

2231
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:43,720
I'm sure I'm sure

2232
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,920
there are a million untold stories of celebration.

2233
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,040
Yeah. Or maybe it was just boring.

2234
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,880
I don't know. I mean, OK.

2235
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:55,160
Oh, I was going to say, like, I'm sure there's like an interesting,

2236
01:50:55,160 --> 01:51:00,200
like fully fleshed out research, like year by year thing of

2237
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:03,440
the evolution of celebration, Florida.

2238
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,800
Yeah, sure.

2239
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,800
And then, yes, let us know how we're doing.

2240
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,960
We're talking about other stuff.

2241
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:12,160
No, we're just goofing. We're making Big Bird jokes.

2242
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:15,520
But yeah, Jamie Lofton, we have your next project, Jamie Loftus.

2243
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:19,280
If you are the full celebration deep depth, she's a pro at that.

2244
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,720
There's there's one thing maybe to throw in and maybe we can end on this point.

2245
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:25,960
And this is one of those where, again, everyone is in pursuit

2246
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:28,320
of tearing this place apart.

2247
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:32,320
Like it's it's a hotbed of this and that.

2248
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:36,800
And the origin of this seems to be the Daily Mail,

2249
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,480
which is sort of tabloid. Yeah, I think. Yes.

2250
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,120
But I saw it a pop.

2251
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:46,480
This phrase popped up in a number of places and where if they caused it,

2252
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:49,400
I'm just curious, like, what is the source or if there's any accuracy to this?

2253
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,800
And this is almost the main thing I'd like to hear from anyone about.

2254
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,000
If you can speak to the truth of this,

2255
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,440
that the idea that Celebration Florida was a hotbed of wife swapping.

2256
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,520
Oh, nice.

2257
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:04,960
OK, now I just I don't I don't know.

2258
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,520
It I could not.

2259
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:10,440
I guess I think I saw one article somewhere that implied that

2260
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:14,600
families, much like the one that we saw, maybe not literally the one

2261
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:19,760
that we saw in one of those videos, that you go in pursuit of,

2262
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:21,280
you know, shaking it up.

2263
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:24,200
And what ends up happening is you're saying hi to so many neighbors

2264
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:25,560
on your front porch.

2265
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:30,200
Maybe you start getting further than the porch and maybe the marriage is itself.

2266
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:34,320
Like, like, apparently, like there are people who say, like,

2267
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,400
this place was like a divorce magnet, like just something happened to you

2268
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,800
when you got that.

2269
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,840
But it's sort of like unnamed source.

2270
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,360
And this feels like

2271
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:46,560
shady to me. I don't know. I don't know.

2272
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,680
So if you were a wife who swapped,

2273
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:53,600
if your wife swapped, if your mother was a wife,

2274
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,200
send that to Jason and Scott, because I can't even handle stories

2275
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:02,400
of marital infidelity, even in a consent like an agreed upon way.

2276
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:08,640
You know, I I'm wondering how much of it is kind of snowbird population now.

2277
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:13,440
I feel like I saw one vlogger who was like, yeah, my family lives down here,

2278
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,400
but a lot of the neighbors are only here for part of the year.

2279
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:24,000
You know, if this is almost like how much of it is vacation properties at this.

2280
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,520
Oh, I imagine that has to be a ton of like who goes down.

2281
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:31,280
I mean, I guess I guess since it's not Disney anymore, it's not so tight,

2282
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:35,840
but it's certainly at the time it was like we're going to the Disney town

2283
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,800
to be by Disney and go all the time.

2284
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:41,920
And I'm sure obviously a bunch of people have to be doing that.

2285
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:45,280
And probably once in a while, I don't know what other like,

2286
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:48,880
is there another town in America that is a hotbed for wife swapping?

2287
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,760
Like, do we how do they know that?

2288
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:53,520
How does that get around Cougar Town?

2289
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:56,520
Cougar Town, Universal Studios lot.

2290
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:59,760
I guess. Or no, no, I guess.

2291
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,040
It was Storia Lane. Yeah.

2292
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:03,480
How does that get out?

2293
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:05,960
How does that get to the Daily Mail?

2294
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:08,880
It must be there are so much swapping going on

2295
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:13,680
that there's literally no way that that news story doesn't like the mayor knows.

2296
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,720
The guy who publishes the newspaper knows like the meetings about it.

2297
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,920
There were town meetings. There's too much swapping.

2298
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:26,200
The amount of swapping happening for it to become like

2299
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:29,440
the town is known for must be so great.

2300
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:33,800
Raise your hand if you're here and you are a wife who has swapped.

2301
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,640
Yeah. Every with the hands of all the hands go up.

2302
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,160
So I was going to where is your hand if you haven't swapped?

2303
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:42,920
Like a Google swapping town,

2304
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:46,080
wife swapping town, and is it celebration that comes up?

2305
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:49,880
Or is there like, like, oh, Billings, Montana.

2306
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:52,240
Also wife swapping. That's one of the top.

2307
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,800
Italy. Oh, go ahead.

2308
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,640
I did when I just I looked up wife swapping town and the first thing

2309
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:00,560
it just says revealed Italy is the home of wife swapping.

2310
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,040
Sounds right to me. I don't know.

2311
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:07,440
So the biggest wife swapping town is Italy. Italy. Italy.

2312
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:11,080
So what did you find, Scott?

2313
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:13,320
I found this is in the mirror.

2314
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:15,040
You can try to find more information.

2315
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:18,440
There is a name Malcolm Longley, a property investor

2316
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:22,480
who moved to celebration from Maidenhead, also claimed there was a seedy side

2317
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,760
to celebration with wife swapping being rife.

2318
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,320
He said in 2010, and this is post Disney.

2319
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:31,400
So let's let it be known Disney and Eisner were not encouraging swapping.

2320
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:35,680
He's been with Jane, his wife, who named the town. He stayed with her.

2321
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:41,520
So he said in 2010, we call it celebration separation.

2322
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:45,640
Pretty much all the interesting pretty much all the British people

2323
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:51,320
I know who have moved here have come here happily married and ended up divorced.

2324
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:53,680
It's an incestuous town.

2325
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:56,000
And there's an element of his wife swapping.

2326
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,960
So he's saying that this is a British phenomenon.

2327
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:03,000
Oh, well, I don't know what's going on on that island.

2328
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:05,600
You know, that's weird, because I because as far as I know,

2329
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:08,920
Italy is the home of wife swapping. So yeah.

2330
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,160
And then secondary, there's

2331
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,720
Ladaka in India, wife swapping.

2332
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:18,040
That's coming up on my search as well. Yeah.

2333
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:20,200
So so literally here's here.

2334
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:23,920
My search results. First is Italy. Second is celebration.

2335
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:25,960
It's the Daily Mail article.

2336
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:27,960
And then India's third in the results.

2337
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:34,160
So Celebrations wife swapping is really it was or at least was really rampant.

2338
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:35,560
It was really a thing.

2339
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:40,920
So the show Wife Swap began as a British television series.

2340
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:44,200
OK, well, they've done a lot to put this idea out there.

2341
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:44,840
There you go.

2342
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:48,720
Read this filth to spread the notion of swapping.

2343
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:51,960
Wow. So mainly a British.

2344
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:54,760
They call it Brit Wifing down there.

2345
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:58,440
Now a new British wife is in town.

2346
01:56:58,440 --> 01:56:59,760
Wife swaps.

2347
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:04,480
As far as I know, the English version of wife swap is a lot more wholesome

2348
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:06,920
because you'd get like

2349
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:11,240
it looks like Jack K and Tracy Lords, which swap husbands.

2350
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:15,760
Vern Troyer and Heinz Ward would swap wives.

2351
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,720
Corey Feldman and Tommy Davidson.

2352
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,160
But they wouldn't. It wasn't a sex thing.

2353
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:23,400
It was just like living with each other for.

2354
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:25,520
Oh, it's just like, oh, I see. I see.

2355
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:29,600
You're just like, oh, Joe Piscopo and Barry Williams in season three.

2356
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:31,960
They the two of them.

2357
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:36,080
Yeah. The two most famous white fro havers.

2358
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:39,000
That's right. Of the 20th century.

2359
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:41,840
So how about that?

2360
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:45,080
Oh, Bristol and Willow Palin and Joan and Melissa Rivers.

2361
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:47,080
What?

2362
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:53,080
With the mother and daughter, it's wife and daughter swaps.

2363
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:55,960
Can Joan Joan was Joan? Joan was not remarried.

2364
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:59,800
We're going to have to watch to find out, folks.

2365
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:02,120
All right. Yeah, we'll watch every episode of wife swap

2366
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:06,800
and report back on our finding the notion now being related to Disney

2367
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,960
because of their town is their wife's swappy town.

2368
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:11,880
They had a wifey town.

2369
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:16,240
So like like Jiminy Chimney Sweep or whatever your name is

2370
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:18,280
in celebration, mind your own business.

2371
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:19,640
That's what I say.

2372
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:22,680
Blabbing to the tabloids.

2373
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:24,680
Yeah, really.

2374
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:27,520
I mean, he's breaking the code.

2375
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,160
He is. Yeah.

2376
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:31,200
What? Yeah. Golden.

2377
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:34,400
Do they wife swap in Golden Oak?

2378
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:35,360
Do you know?

2379
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:37,360
I don't know.

2380
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:38,600
I'll figure that out.

2381
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:40,880
Yeah, we'll talk to somebody who lives there.

2382
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,800
Only the Brits, I guess.

2383
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:47,440
I never met swingers that much until I came here, said

2384
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:53,000
Martin Martin Poppins.

2385
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,560
We know that's not real.

2386
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:00,800
All right, let's get out of here.

2387
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,440
You survived. I guess the right

2388
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,880
the second gate, boy, a boy.

2389
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:09,000
Lots to say there.

2390
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,280
You felt like you moved into a town for a while.

2391
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:13,560
Yeah, really? Listening to this episode.

2392
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:18,280
But hey, more coming up, as always, three bonus episodes a month.

2393
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:21,600
Keep it tuned here.

2394
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,360
I don't know.

2395
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,360
Anybody thinking about heading to a pub tonight?

2396
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:27,440
To what? To swap?

2397
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:30,360
I don't know. No, just to enjoy some ales.

2398
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,840
OK, if it's just a I guess.

2399
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,760
There's no swapping involved.

2400
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:37,080
I would go. But yeah.

2401
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:38,400
But I feel like you're I don't know.

2402
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:41,600
I feel like you because doing this episode, you've got a taste for it.

2403
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,280
Night lat well, and I'm the only one with a wife.

2404
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,320
That's true. Yeah.

2405
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:48,520
So yeah. So I mean, I guess you could.

2406
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:51,920
I sure noticed I got us a babysitter and

2407
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:56,160
just if you're interested in a pub this evening.

2408
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,400
I would. OK, here's what I'll say.

2409
01:59:57,400 --> 02:00:00,520
I would not be interested in swapping wives or swapping partners,

2410
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:02,720
except if it was with Barry Williams.

2411
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:10,480
And then you're just asking like, so like, I mean, does he like Branson or like?

2412
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:16,600
Well, is he like, does he is it different butterfly neck shirts every night?

2413
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:17,840
Like, how many does he have?

2414
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:19,400
It's like a lot of shows a day.

2415
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:20,720
He probably runs through this quickly.

2416
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:23,080
Could I wear his clothes?

2417
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:24,880
Could I try them on?

2418
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:26,320
Yeah, it would be a lot like that.

2419
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:29,400
So yeah, that I would be interested in that.

2420
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:30,840
That's what I would be interested in.

2421
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:34,920
It comes back, catches you naked in his bedroom.

2422
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:38,320
And you have to say, no, no, no, I was just changing between butter.

2423
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:40,360
Between leisure suits.

2424
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:43,960
I was just putting on your brands and leisure suits that you do your shows with, you know.

2425
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:46,920
Nothing, nothing at all.

2426
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:48,960
Your wife is out of the house. I sent her away.

2427
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,800
I wouldn't have some of the British.

2428
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:56,160
I thought some of the pot roast gravy from the dinner part of your dinner theater.

2429
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:00,200
He brings over leftovers from the dinner theater.

2430
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:02,440
Yeah, you know, they do.

2431
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:05,200
Here's what's really great about performing in Branson.

2432
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:08,720
Yeah. Oh, man, we got to get down there.

2433
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,120
Avery, you can drink.

2434
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:12,080
Oh, we got to get down there.

2435
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:14,760
We sure do. And we got to get out of here so long.
