1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello, I'm here.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And that'll do it.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No Jason today.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And I'll tell you why.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There's a confusing timeline to acquaint you with here.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
At this point in time, as you're listening to this,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Mike has had a child, you've had a baby.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's right.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And this news has been conveyed to you, I assume, in some form.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But we're recording this with days to go, hours to go.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We don't know when it's going to be.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're in the past.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Could be way ahead, who knows?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm totally in the dark on this.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is up to for God to decide.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, as he decided everything else about your bundle.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You've got a perfectly crafted bundle of joy waiting to go.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He has a whole document about my life.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He's written it out like a great novel or something.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So yeah, he's obviously in control of everything here.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, and he's written everything about your daughter also.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's all pre-

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's all done.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You guys have to just physically get through this for what's bound to happen.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes, exactly.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is why.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No free will as far as I'm concerned.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, no.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We know this.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Every sentence that we're about to say, everything down to that, this has all been-

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
God is an auteur, I like to say.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's a little film thing.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A real Kubrick really, very controlling.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So you guys have to start enacting his play.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You have to do your take 70.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're but performers in God's great play.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's also what I like to say.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, and you've welcomed a new cast member, the newest cast member, by the time people are hearing this.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, and I sound very muted about it now because it hasn't happened.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So I'm not, I have nothing.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There's been a glowing version you've heard already.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, I assume.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I believe so.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And yeah, now this is just like guessing as to what, how the feeling is going to be, especially for me, who's outside of it.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm a supporting player in the play.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You're part of the play.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Chekhov's baby or Chekhov's delivery at this point.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No, God is using a device, a common device in a movie or a play.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And you're just waiting for the baby to go off or come out, I suppose.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So it's exciting.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He's written a great moment here.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There's a lot of tension.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But I feel like you're just, you're waiting around.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're trying to figure out how to, you know, what you're going to do.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Numerous anticipation.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So I thought it'd be good.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Does it seem like it'd be good to just get the dads together?

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes, I agree.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The current dad and the dad to be and just have a little bit of dad time.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Work through some stuff here with the platform that we have.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes, of course.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I completely agree.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think it makes so much sense just to have a little bit of dad time.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And also Jason has COVID.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So there's that.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That is also in the mix.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
As long as he agrees to let that in there and he doesn't want that cut out.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
As long as, yes, if he signs off on the, then you're hearing this.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Then you're hearing this, yeah.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
First time, maybe.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I mean, that's just a coincidence.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This dad bonding was on the calendar already.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And then it just worked out that there was a forcible reason for the non-dad to get out of here.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's interesting because I mean, this is, in a lot of ways, you know,

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Better Call Saul is wrapped up when you're listening to this.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now, this is almost like a prequel being recorded before a, like, it's going to be interesting.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're going to see, you're going to current, like, this is taking place in the future,

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but it's actually in the past.

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So it's all very interesting.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is interesting.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, the audience has a lot to, I'm jealous of the people listening because they know how Saul ended.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, exactly.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They've heard the joy of your parental news.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Right.

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And they've probably heard, if he agrees, then they've probably heard some of Jason's hijinks with having COVID.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Right, some of it.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So yeah, well, we'll see.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We'll see you in the future.

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So we're going to push through and which is, you know, look, we're concerned about Jason.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And it sounds like he's okay.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
All the reports are that he's okay.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But he's a little down for the count.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And it's tough for us because knowing that Jason is stuck laying in bed, be like lazing around,

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
that he probably didn't get out of bed until, you know, 11 a.m.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, 11 a.m.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Not the get up and go of the Jason that we know.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Right, up at the crack of dawn.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Mm-hmm.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Getting to that work that he is so that he welcomes and greets each and every day.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hits the rise and grind button, does the battle ropes in the backyard.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, it's Eiger and it's him, you know, the workload of a typical Eiger day.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And the only person who would compete would be Jason Sheridan.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It must be an Ithaca thing.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They instill it in you.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, birthday boys too.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
They rise and grind.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's what I've heard.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
All rise and grinders.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hashtag rise and grinders.

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's how they did it.

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But, okay, so in his absence, we get to just have some dad chat.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Which what is the feel, like genuinely, I mean, it's just, it's nerves and you don't know when the bombs are going to go off.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're trying to prep.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're doing whatever you can.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know that I can even have a good discussion.

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I mean, yeah, it's all like ready to unlock.

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm just right now, I'm really, everything is basically just around like, let's just get through those couple days.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's hope that everything goes smoothly and that's where my head is at.

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm not like, I'm kind of zen about the rest of it, I feel, honestly.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't think I'm too weird, like freaked out or anything.

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That seems pretty right on.

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We had no grand plan going into it and it seems like the toughest thing to do is to just get it done.

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And then you can just do it and it seems like the tough thing is if you are starting to, if you're trying to like work out all the steps of the life.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And you can really only do like, okay, I see the stretch of road that's coming up.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I gotta be prepared.

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So you'll get through the couple days and you'll get through whatever the next couple days are and then the next.

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's like Vince Gilligan in an interview talking about plotting up at her call.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He said he just sees the nose in front of his face.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Barely in front of his face.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can wrap up all these loose ends and make it seem like there was a grand plan.

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So can God.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sure I'll say this later, but look, believe it or not, my interests are not dissimilar to that of a child.

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So I don't think I'm not going to be a Bill Maher snooty kids.

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I only like to party like an adult in a neon colored gaudy as hell basement.

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's when I look at him in Club Random, swigging full bottles and talking to Jack Osborne, sucking down big thick joints with Jack Osborne in his late 60s.

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think adults.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I look at this guy as the epitome of a grown, mature, well adjusted, happy man.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You see that's what is a little scary that you look at when you think happy, childless adult, you think Bill Maher and we have a vessel with which to watch him every week.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So you're probably like we made this choice, maybe an error because we know we're not going to end up like Bill.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And look how happy he's so happy and he does not that every boy exploding the love of life and all people and of all genders.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, the love exuding from Bill.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's not like every week he gets defensive about not having had kids like almost every week he brings it up.

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then he says something like I hate cartoons like he's in cartoon, the supervillain or something.

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, yeah, a very viable opinion to have.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We all know that, you know, we're freaks and the listeners are freaks.

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All of us who like cartoons.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We know the real answer is that cartoons are for babies and babies.

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And that's it.

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And what strange anyone north of eight years old to like a cartoon.

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Crazy.

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Lock them up. Lock us up.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I say, you know what, if you really want, I know we have we have a lot to talk about today, but really that the like looking between looking at the choice between two grown child men.

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's Maher and Leno and Leno at least seems happy and content with everything.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Leno's lived like a child his whole life.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He collects big toys, which are the cars.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He gets to wear a superhero outfit of his own and he eats hot dogs and hamburgers for every meal.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He's like a child. He's living a child's life.

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But he seems like he's content.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He's not like defensive about not having had kids or married, though.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There's not that like bachelor.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's true. Celebration.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But like Mavis goes on vacation without him.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Like, that's an interesting.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Well, there's an understanding.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's what's beautiful about it.

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
She knows what he needs, which is to only be in this one place by the Burbank airport.

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, right.

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then if not, he's in Pensacola doing a gig.

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If not, he's in the same place as he was.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, no money in his pocket.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Right.

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So she needs to, I don't know, go to Europe or maybe to like Massachusetts.

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
She's exotic.

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
She's enjoying his standup money, but not tonight show money, I think.

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But yeah, so I'm just saying, like, Leno's not that defensive about, you know, his choices like Bill is for some reason.

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Bill, for some reason, is constantly mad at an imaginary person that's mad at him for what how he's chosen to live his life.

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He has, well, he has to defend the honor of his choices that he feels so great about.

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why would we ever question that he so he also like thinks Elon Musk is like Tony Stark still he's so I could talk.

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
One of my you know, we can't.

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, that remains one of my favorite.

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Like that a lot of the way, certainly the way I was introduced to Elon Musk was like, oh, yeah, he's this billionaire who's a gadget, may an inventor.

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's like he's a real life Iron Man.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Cut to everything we know about this guy.

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What happened?

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Was that ever applied to?

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't know.

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But Bill hasn't gotten gotten the memo where it's where he's been like cosplaying as Tony Stark for a decade.

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And most people have caught on that he might not be the smartest man in the world, but not Bill.

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's not gotten a club random yet.

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well, he's still he's stuck in 2010 in a lot of ways.

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's as are we I guess by talking about.

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I think we're falling into this because it's a club random kind of format.

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's true.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's just the two of us.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, it is like, yeah, we're just how we Mandela and Bill chatting.

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah.

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Talking it up.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh, boy.

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Man talk.

222
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That said, I.

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Two normal men talking.

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Look, I still I'll be excited when Jason is back and I want to hear Jason interrupt a conversation.

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I want to hear Jason interrupt as Bill's getting into it with George Lopez for two hours.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Jason should be in club random and then hit him with some like facts during the during the conversation.

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's great.

228
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You know, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company.

229
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, like Jack Osborne talking about like, oh, yeah, you know, it's been 20 years since the Osbournes and he's like the Osbournes premiered on March 23rd in the year 2002.

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I think that would be good.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Bill should.

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You had your own show.

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was in plays growing up and the shoes on the stage.

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You can't even watch the video.

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Can we get Jason in club?

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You need to be in the Beach Boys and Jason needs to be in club random.

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's get everyone where they need to be.

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah.

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But first we got to let's do the matters of the day.

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's get everybody where they need to be.

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But first, let's get through the matters of the day.

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Look, it's not just going to be random club random of dad talk.

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Right.

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We've got a specific thing to do here.

245
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The episode title is Dadimotronics.

246
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And maybe you can guess kind of where we're going with this.

247
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We just started thinking, well, how does dad stuff apply to the world we are supposed to that we sometimes cover on the show?

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And we're talking about are there dad audio animatronics out there in theme park world?

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And not only that, I think we haven't exactly talked about the purpose of the episode other than paying tribute to some great dadimotronics.

250
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But I think maybe a good thing because you're in the days where you're waiting for it all to happen.

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I think it'd be great if you picked a dadimotronic to be kind of a dad role model.

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like if we could find somebody who's the closest to the kind of dad that you want to be or that you can or maybe you'll steer course and go, I was not thinking about being like this, but I you know, he's inspiring me to.

253
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, can I do can I take that one further one farther and say let's name a step dadimotronic?

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, sure. Oh, or a god dadimotronic?

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
God dadimotronic?

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, then we're not at then because God, you know, step dad is not right.

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Because step is like if he remarries the robot.

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's not what I meant.

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But like a godfather.

260
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Like for us or for oh, you mean like.

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I would choose for my child's godparents.

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah.

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Godimotronic.

264
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm like, you know, I see that kind of like this is somebody.

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The mentor.

266
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah.

267
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Who I've yeah, like in my absence.

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Right.

269
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is your spiritual.

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

271
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Somebody I've deemed to be somebody to look up to.

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Not Lindsay marrying a robot.

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's yes.

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's this person waiting in the wings and is there at family gatherings maybe.

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's not something Lindsay would do.

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Now you, I don't.

278
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Depends on the animatronic.

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Depends on the animatronic.

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, no, it's true.

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So yeah, that's kind of I mean, there's not a good catchy name to catch a way to say it.

282
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So step god godfather.

283
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
God god.

284
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't know.

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I can't do it.

286
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So that's the idea.

287
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We could still.

288
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Well, still, it's the same thing.

289
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's all the same thing.

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think that what we're building to and maybe we can come up with a catchy or a.

291
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Who's the most trustworthy?

292
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Everything that we think that a dad should be.

293
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Right.

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
As demonstrated through their daily repeated tasks on a ride or in a show.

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes, that's great.

296
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So did you feel like you found a lot?

297
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, I mean, yeah, kind of.

298
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Kind of.

299
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I think you're like there's.

300
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We were talking about this and we were saying, OK, is it all just robots or robots?

301
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Or is it any character that sort of appears in the park?

302
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And it was more of a fun, intellectual exercise, not intellectual, just say exercise, exercise to determine who in the parks were robots and dads.

303
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes. Yeah.

304
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But did you find inspiration from non robots?

305
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes, I would say I did find some inspiration from non robots.

306
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But like, you know, Chewbacca is a suited character.

307
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, he runs around.

308
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You see him on a screen.

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He has children.

310
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Is that are they his children in the holiday special?

311
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes, they are.

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I am B. I saw.

313
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah. Lump, lump, a waru.

314
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
He has a wife, Mala, Tobak.

315
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And yeah, I think he just has one son as far as I know.

316
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Lumpy.

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So, yes, but but he's out.

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Obviously, Vader is a you can meet him at Launch Bay.

319
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Obviously, one of the most famous fathers ever.

320
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Sure, sure.

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, between the two, if we're knocking them out as we go, right, Chewbacca seems better, even though he's out on he's on the road a lot.

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes.

323
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
He's not spending a lot of time with lumpy.

324
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He's got. Yeah, he's he has to make time for the kids.

325
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Hopefully, there's some sort of face time in Star Wars.

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't know.

327
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I guess there is kind of the 3D, the hologram thing that maybe we saw that in more.

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's not always like dire.

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah.

330
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Warning.

331
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
They probably check in with each other.

332
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You can read a bedtime story over the hologram.

333
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

334
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, that's how it sounds.

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And yeah, there's other I mean, there's other characters we talk about like Dreamfinder.

336
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't think there's a he doesn't have a child in canon, but he seems fatherly.

337
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The original version, at least not the hot Dreamfinder from the comic.

338
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I as far as we know, I don't know if there's any official mythology about Dreamfinder's son or daughter.

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I mean, I have I this thought occurred to me about maybe it's similar to a character who is in animatronic form,

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Gepetto, where maybe Dreamfinder did not have the ability himself or somebody to share the parenting with.

342
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And thus had to invent.

343
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Right.

344
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Like is Figment kind of his son?

345
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes, he is kind of his son.

346
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
For sure.

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know.

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I actually know that's a good question.

349
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I now that I think about it, I should have looked up how Figment came to be in those origin comics, if that's technically the real origin or not.

350
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But he finds dreams.

351
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So I suppose he sort of found Figment in some way.

352
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He found his son, as opposed to creating a son.

353
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But Gepetto created his son.

354
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes.

355
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So Gepetto is a robot and a dad.

356
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah.

357
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And that's confirmed.

358
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:53,000
OK, well, let's let's analyze Gepetto for a sec, because my my thought there was he just in terms of a good father or not, like very sweet and well-meaning.

359
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah.

360
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But wanted a son more than anything, but kind of kid shows up and he loses him.

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What?

362
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Within 48 hours is less.

363
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't I don't know the timeline exactly, but it's pretty quickly gone.

364
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah, pretty quickly.

365
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
His wooden puppet that comes to life is wooden marionette that comes to life.

366
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He's out of control.

367
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He doesn't know what to do with it.

368
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He's kidnapped several layers deep.

369
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Like he's kidnapped by one group and then another and then another.

370
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah.

371
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So he Gepetto loses him in like three layers.

372
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I would say he.

373
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah.

374
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So Gepetto has a couple of strikes against him.

375
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What you're saying is that he's like negligent.

376
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
He's a bad.

377
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He's not prepared for just like logistical thing, like keeping your child safe, keeping them in the same place.

378
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I think he pictured one dance.

379
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
La la la la la la la la la.

380
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And like didn't think any.

381
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You're thinking a little further ahead than that.

382
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You can't just dance around once.

383
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The work keeps going.

384
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The word. Yeah.

385
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah. Especially in the Pinocchio's age.

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He's got a lot of energy.

387
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You know, he's a boy of what Pinocchio doesn't come out as a baby.

388
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
He comes out as a boy.

389
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
No, a little boy of like what?

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Five, six, seven.

391
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You're right. Yeah.

392
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So he's got energy.

393
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He's got curiosity.

394
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Sure.

395
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And he was not prepared for that.

396
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'd say it's not a tough age, but he I don't know.

397
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't know.

398
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Gepetto did not think it through.

399
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He took him outside one time and he's gone.

400
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah, that's true.

401
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah.

402
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I would also say he starts from a place of being out of his mind.

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
He's I guess.

404
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, yes.

405
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
As discussed.

406
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah.

407
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He's talking to all these inanimate objects.

408
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And if you include the song from the Christmas special I love, it's it's an unhinged laughter, unhinged laughter.

409
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Now, ultimately, I guess he proves us all wrong.

410
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I guess he proves that Gepetto does have the last laugh because he does create life.

411
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He does make life happen out of wood.

412
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

413
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So in a in a beautiful way that's not marred by disgusting sex.

414
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Right.

415
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He does it in a beautiful.

416
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We see Gepetto create life, something you you don't even you don't even get to see that in the making of me.

417
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
We go up to the roof and Martin just tells us.

418
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Right.

419
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And then we see in the twilight what they're doing in that window.

420
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's a wooden virgin birth is really what it is.

421
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And it's like Jesus or Anakin Skywalker.

422
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's really what those are the top virgin.

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
If you look, is there like a Buzzfeed top virgin birth list?

424
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Just out of curiosity.

425
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Wait, I'm sorry.

426
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Anakin was a virgin birth.

427
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes.

428
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Another shmi gave birth, but she was never impregnated by another character, another person.

429
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What?

430
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's right.

431
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Anakin was Jesus.

432
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Huh.

433
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But Jesus went who went astray.

434
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't know.

435
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
There's not like, let's see, miracle birth stories beyond Jesus.

436
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't know any of these names.

437
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
There's no Horus.

438
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You'd see Pochitil.

439
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's like an Incan kind of.

440
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't know.

441
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't know.

442
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So it's a lot of like different religious stories that have a similar virgin birth.

443
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
These aren't from pop culture.

444
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Right.

445
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Aztec story.

446
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,000
There's no like funny thumbnail YouTube guy being like, what are the wildest IP virgin births?

447
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Number 10, David the Gnome.

448
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Did you know David the Gnome didn't have a mother or a father?

449
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He was born from the earth out of nothingness.

450
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's pretty crazy, right?

451
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Number nine, Scooby Doo.

452
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Scooby Doo.

453
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's nice to know.

454
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It wasn't a gross.

455
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah.

456
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It wasn't some weird, you know.

457
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Don't worry.

458
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Don't think about it.

459
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Straight dog sex.

460
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah.

461
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
No straight dog sex here.

462
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm going to stop looking at this article because these are all from myths.

463
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You know how myths are.

464
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Myths are wild.

465
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Horrible.

466
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah.

467
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
They're frightening.

468
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Just the words I'm catching are, oh no.

469
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah.

470
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So Geppetto, yeah.

471
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So there's a couple strikes against Geppetto, but number one really is what you were saying

472
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
to begin with is that he's just not doing a good job.

473
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
He wants the love, but he doesn't want the responsibility.

474
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And that's a common thing with father, negligent.

475
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
People think they want the responsibility.

476
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They just want the good parts though.

477
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
They don't want to deal with the stuff that's a struggle.

478
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And Geppetto is not cut out for it.

479
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
No, unfortunately.

480
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I mean, I hope it goes well in real boy era, but there's no way of knowing.

481
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't feel the best about it.

482
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And the town is full of threats.

483
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Real boy era should be explored in Zemeckis, Pinocchio 2, 3, 4, and 5, I hope.

484
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
They're doing Avatar.

485
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I hope.

486
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I hope.

487
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah, they're writing five scripts simultaneously right now for Pinocchio's 2 through 5.

488
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
They're filming in a big water tank too.

489
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
At least the only thing about that would be something new.

490
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
A lot of my, I'm less creeped out by Pinocchio than I am Pan, but I'm a little creeped out.

491
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But my main problem is there is a new Pinocchio made every two years, if not more.

492
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
How many more times?

493
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Is Roberto Benini's Pinocchio, does he play Geppetto or is he an adult 60 year old Pinocchio?

494
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I believe he is Pinocchio.

495
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I think he's a grown little boy.

496
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So it's like Hook, but it's Benini Pinocchio.

497
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I think so, yes.

498
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
We gotta watch that.

499
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
If that's the case.

500
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We have to do every full Pinocchio, watch every Pinocchio.

501
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
If that's the case, yeah.

502
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Ugh.

503
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Another Patreon tour where we watch every Pinocchio and we would not run out of content.

504
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah, in all Pinocchio, wait, do you go Pinocchio cast or do you go Podnocchio?

505
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Podnocchio.

506
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Podnocchio.

507
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah.

508
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The podcast with the most legs in it could go for decades.

509
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Supposedly there's like pages of a Paul Thomas Anderson written Pinocchio script that Downey Jr. has wanted to make forever.

510
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
He's like backed up people at a party into the wall and been like, I want to make Pinocchio.

511
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And supposedly Paul Thomas Anderson worked on some like a little bit of it for a while.

512
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I don't know if that's maybe just completely like he said he was going to do it and didn't do it.

513
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But I would love to see like 20 pages of the PTA Downey Jr. playing Geppetto Pinocchio that he's been upset that Downey Jr.

514
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
has been obsessed with for years to make.

515
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
There's an old story that Robert Downey Jr. is passionate about.

516
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yes.

517
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You know it's going to turn out brilliantly.

518
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That's right.

519
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
There's another dad in the park.

520
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm going to over to Adventureland.

521
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah.

522
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But I'm going to knock him out right away.

523
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That's Indiana Jones.

524
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:46,000
We know Indiana Jones has a child, but he's and technically if we're going off of park, the Indiana Jones Adventure, I believe, is set in 1935.

525
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And Mutt Williams, his son and one of the greatest characters in fiction, was not born until 1938.

526
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Right.

527
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So you're saying he's disqualified just by the fact that he hadn't had a child at that point in his.

528
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah. If you were wondering, is the Indiana Jones that we see in the ride a dad?

529
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The answer is no.

530
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
See, this is going to be interesting because I had found something and I don't know if you're going to maybe you'll disqualify me when I bring it up in a little bit.

531
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Okay.

532
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Well, you know, if the message and the moral is strong, I could see my way to not being so literal about it.

533
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But, you know, we're dealing with a lot of situations where the story is out in the world, but we have to deal with the park sliver of it.

534
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah.

535
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So we maybe have to at least think through the time.

536
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Well, you can make a ruling.

537
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'll go along with whatever you say when we come up to it.

538
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, Indy's out.

539
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Let's talk about a bigger one and what my first thought was when this came up.

540
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Like when you think animatronic dad, the big one that hit me is Carousel of Progress.

541
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Of course. Yeah.

542
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That's like the main role you see that guy in.

543
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
That's John.

544
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And you see him being a parent in a number of different eras.

545
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Well defined.

546
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
In a lot of cases, you don't even know who the kids are.

547
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You don't really.

548
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You really see him parent.

549
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You see him with James and Patricia.

550
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Uh huh.

551
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
He is bad.

552
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
He's bad.

553
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Right.

554
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
He's like such a jerk.

555
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Good thing Jason's not here.

556
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I don't know that he would disagree.

557
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This to me is not a criticism of the show.

558
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I think when Jason sees Carousel of Progress, he sees his face on John.

559
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And he's like, that's who I'll be one day.

560
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But not Uncle Orville more so?

561
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
In his party boy days, yes.

562
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And it's all the old, the Jason I knew when we were in our early to mid 20s.

563
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Let's stay up and watch Footlight Parade.

564
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah.

565
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That Jason was more on Uncle Orville.

566
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But I think Jason would reject your premise that he's bad.

567
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I think.

568
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Well, feel free to be the stand in Jason in this case.

569
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But I mean, right away, I think the first scene,

570
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
we see, all right, how does he treat his son?

571
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
He's letting him look at his dirty stereoscope.

572
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah.

573
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
There's like a, there's an exotic dancer or something.

574
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And he does say to put it away, but it's that kind of,

575
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
it's like my dad with Mad Magazines.

576
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Like what you wait, you know what?

577
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
My dad let him read Mad Magazines.

578
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Read it to an entire being in comedy or whatever.

579
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So I guess in a way, maybe I got to give it to the like, let it slide.

580
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's like, I don't know.

581
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I guess I got to give it to John for that.

582
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah.

583
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Well, I mean, I forget what is the woman,

584
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
is she just wearing like a bathing suit or what is she?

585
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't know.

586
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Can you see, can you get close up enough to it?

587
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I don't think so.

588
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Maybe you can't.

589
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I mean, I'm sure it was not terribly indecent if it was handed out at the

590
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
world's fair in the twenties.

591
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah.

592
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Turn of the century.

593
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's the first one.

594
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I think.

595
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Well, this is Jason.

596
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
We need Jason here for this information.

597
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Jason's the one screaming.

598
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah.

599
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Now he's the one yelling at the Patriot, the Patreon player.

600
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's how you're doing it.

601
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You all got mailed a player for Patreon and you're listening here.

602
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Everyone, we announced we were doing a new tier and I said,

603
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
so we're going to do all the voting and the Patriot, we're going to do polls

604
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and oh great.

605
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So everybody's going to have to spend a lot of time in the app.

606
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh yeah.

607
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
He said that in the episode.

608
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
He hates the app.

609
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Like, shouldn't we be getting people excited about being in the.

610
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Oh yeah.

611
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Shit.

612
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
This is bullshit.

613
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I was like, oh, I didn't know the app was bad.

614
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't think it is.

615
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I don't think it is.

616
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I have no problem.

617
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You post episodes.

618
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It seems fine with me.

619
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It seems fine to me too.

620
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Well, then I, yeah, let's not, Hey, Patreon, look, we love you.

621
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We're listening to every episode.

622
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
They've heard every episode of ours.

623
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So yeah, we want to praise them and make sure they like.

624
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Let's make sure they're saying good things.

625
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah.

626
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I mean, you know, John, John knows his son, you know, John knows if his son's ready to

627
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
see a ankle or a calf, you know, he knows.

628
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Shoulder.

629
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah.

630
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah.

631
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah.

632
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah.

633
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah.

634
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah.

635
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah.

636
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah.

637
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah.

638
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah.

639
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah.

640
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah.

641
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah.

642
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah.

643
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah.

644
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah.

645
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,320
Shoulder with a sparkly strap or something like hardcore scene that John, for some reason,

646
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,800
and got his dirty mitts on.

647
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,000
Maybe the rules might've been to, I assume that the turn of the century was a more puritanical

648
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,720
time, but maybe it's that maybe it's like, you know, filth getting handed out at the

649
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,840
world's fair that caused what we got to, what do we do?

650
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Let's prohibition.

651
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,240
Let's start, let's start like curtailing.

652
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
So it could be anything.

653
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
I don't know.

654
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,880
We'll obviously do eventually do a carousel progress episode, but yeah, what is the, what

655
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
is that material?

656
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
Yeah.

657
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,400
I bet there's a way to see it.

658
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,400
This probably a close up so we could find out.

659
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,320
Just for research purposes.

660
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,480
We don't care the contents of the belly dance.

661
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,000
No, I'm not interested in it.

662
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
No, no.

663
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I don't care.

664
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's to report.

665
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's for reporting.

666
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah.

667
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,720
But I'm talking about Patricia, his daughter.

668
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:52,440
He's, he's, he's like, uh, he's like an old timey, like Jim Belushi dad on a sitcom.

669
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,360
He's very like out of it, like says the wrong thing a lot.

670
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,040
Doesn't know, like doesn't maybe not in touch with everyone's feelings in the house.

671
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Yeah.

672
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,200
It's just, you know, it almost gets better as it goes.

673
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,320
But the first thing that we see him do with his daughter is that little scrim.

674
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Yes.

675
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,880
He stands up and he has, and this is where we find out that they, the family know about

676
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,040
the audience because she says, Papa, all these people, I'm indecent.

677
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Right.

678
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,240
It's kind of a joke because she's in big old pantaloon, like the most, she's the most

679
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,080
covered possible, but that's the standard of the time.

680
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,760
She like, he has essentially shown an, without warning, shown an audience, his daughter in

681
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
her underwear.

682
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
You're right.

683
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Yes.

684
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
You're right about that.

685
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,000
I guess I'm trying to think, would that be on a Jim Belushi sitcom where he shows a bunch

686
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,280
of strangers versus daughter getting dressed?

687
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
I don't think so.

688
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
That might be it too.

689
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
You're right.

690
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
It might be too, too outrageous.

691
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,040
Something lewd or implied, but I don't think that's how I think ABC's.

692
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,040
I guess you're, you're, you're giving a good, I mean, you're giving a good rationale for

693
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,600
why he should be immediately disqualified, I guess, cause that is bad.

694
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,000
That's a pretty big red flag.

695
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,640
That's a pretty big one to have happen.

696
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,960
And he says, don't worry, Patricia, they're friends.

697
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,520
That's my teenage daughter.

698
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,040
This is a full quote.

699
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
Yeah, that's weird.

700
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,960
You'll see it Disney world right now.

701
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
It's true.

702
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
That's true.

703
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,800
And which again, it's not the biggest deal in the way I just think in terms of parenting,

704
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:34,760
it just seems like he, he's more in his element talking to strangers about gadgets than he

705
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,240
is relating to and understanding the boundaries of his own daughter.

706
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Right.

707
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
That's right.

708
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
That's fair.

709
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
You're right about that.

710
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,440
So don't go anywhere close to that.

711
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
No, I'm not.

712
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Yeah, no.

713
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,360
I think Jason would be screaming at this point.

714
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,120
I don't think he would defend the, the, that behavior.

715
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
I don't know.

716
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
There's no way to know.

717
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,120
He likes this ride so much.

718
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,800
I mean, this will be a good tease for when we do it in 2026.

719
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
He just loves the world's fair.

720
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,360
Like I think we've, these are something we've been five years of doing this.

721
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,720
If the world's fair is anywhere in the vicinity of what we're talking about, you can see as

722
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,360
like posture, he perks up, like he gets a spark in his eyes.

723
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,480
If we're like remotely in the territory, he's got world's fair.

724
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,040
He's got fair radar.

725
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
You see?

726
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Sure.

727
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
Yeah.

728
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
He, yeah.

729
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,240
He, he, you think, so you think actually maybe that is more important than the actual ride

730
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,200
experience for him is that it's like world's fair or not adjacent, but I think so.

731
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,480
I think maybe not more important.

732
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,200
I just know that's like a big part of it.

733
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Right.

734
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,320
We'll have to find out if he ever listens to this and if we, I guess, if we ever do

735
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:50,280
carousel progress episode, it will now be really, it'll also be really funny if we just

736
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,800
rip through the rest of carousel progress talking about it now.

737
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,480
Cause I think he'd get really mad about that.

738
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Oh yeah.

739
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
You're right.

740
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
Cause we've already burned off a little piece of information.

741
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Like we've heard of analysis.

742
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
Yeah.

743
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,680
Well it's part of what Walt Disney, what Walt Disney did for the 1964 world's fair.

744
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
That's right.

745
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
We can't now.

746
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
He, now he can't say it.

747
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
That's true.

748
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Now he can't say it when we do the, it's been taken.

749
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,720
He's not going to listen to this either.

750
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,720
So it'll be all right.

751
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
I'm not sure.

752
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
We'll see.

753
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,360
You know, I don't know the, I don't know anyone's policy when this happens in the rare event.

754
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,760
I mean, I got a little curious and listened to Cas Amigos and I got to work.

755
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,120
So who's, I had a rebuttal to give.

756
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Oh yeah.

757
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,560
So we might end up seeing something in the, something pops up in the feed that we don't

758
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
know about.

759
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Right.

760
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,000
I think we should add about Carousel of Progress.

761
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,360
Not, not, we're aware of it.

762
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,120
We know plenty about it.

763
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,240
It's, we're saying bad things.

764
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,240
Right.

765
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
That's yeah.

766
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
I hear what you're saying.

767
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
Yeah.

768
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,040
But is not the father from Carousel of Progress also in Horizons?

769
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,200
Isn't he?

770
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
That's the idea of the future.

771
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Right.

772
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Right.

773
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Right.

774
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,840
Imply, heavily implied.

775
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,120
Cause he never likes, I'm the guy from the other place.

776
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
Yeah.

777
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
But yeah, it is heavily implied.

778
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,320
Cause he seems more solid there.

779
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,000
He's playing a kooky synth machine.

780
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,320
He's having a nice video chat while doing it.

781
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Right.

782
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,120
And then like you were saying, even in the future scene of Carousel of Progress, he doesn't

783
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,480
commit any sort of crime.

784
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,440
His egregious is the one he did earlier.

785
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
No.

786
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,360
So maybe progress is learning about your kids.

787
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,360
So maybe actually he's back in the game here because maybe progress is understanding your

788
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,720
children more.

789
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Wow.

790
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,960
What he found is that progress has nothing to do with inventions and Thomas Edison.

791
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,640
Progress have the biggest progress happens in your mind.

792
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
Right.

793
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,400
So he's back in the hunt now that I'm talking this out.

794
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Hmm.

795
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Oh, I guess so.

796
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
All right.

797
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,560
So if you include the, cause he's in, he's asking, he knows all about her career as a

798
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
desert farmer.

799
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,560
Right.

800
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,280
Progress is not just technology.

801
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,320
It's also having more empathy for everyone.

802
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,280
It's also understanding people more, I feel.

803
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,920
So I think, I think progress has something to do, you know, that's like kind of absorbing

804
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,240
cultural movements that happen that like I see.

805
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,880
So this shift has occurred now.

806
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,800
Maybe I don't know everything about it, but I'm going to learn and I'm going to listen

807
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
and understand.

808
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,400
I'm not going to have a podcast in my basement where I complain about it.

809
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,740
John didn't go into a bunker where the, the slight changes that will never affect my

810
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,340
life.

811
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,340
Right.

812
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,740
We have, by the way, are not just describing Bill Maher, but hundreds of other podcasts.

813
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,740
That's true.

814
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,740
Thousands.

815
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,740
Many, many podcasts.

816
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,740
Yeah.

817
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:44,140
I'm going to hide from the vague idea that I might encounter somebody who I don't get.

818
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,300
So yeah, so progress, maybe I, I don't know.

819
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,020
I think he's, I think he's up there right now.

820
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,940
John's in the, well, I think maybe of everybody we've discussed.

821
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,940
Yeah.

822
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,340
And we, he has to, yeah, we're talking about the version that has grown.

823
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,340
Right.

824
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,900
That is in the, the like crazy irrigation world.

825
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,900
Yes.

826
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,660
That's the horizons, John.

827
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,980
And maybe last seen John in carousel progress.

828
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
Yeah.

829
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,580
Do you know that the dialogue in that, I don't think we said this in the horizons episode

830
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:20,300
that somebody refers to, I think the mom says we both love the solar berries you sent.

831
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,980
I did not remember that.

832
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
That's funny.

833
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
Solar berries.

834
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
Solar berries.

835
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,660
Sending solar berries over if she has a bad relationship.

836
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:36,540
Steve is Steven, Steven's solar berry, like a Jetsons version of Steven Soderbergh.

837
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,540
Steven Soderbergh.

838
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
I don't know.

839
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,540
I don't know.

840
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,500
What would solar berries be like?

841
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:51,140
Solar is, is that just made, but like entirely grown in, wait, like the light of the sun.

842
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,900
I was going to say grown from the sun.

843
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,900
Right.

844
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,820
I can't imagine a fruit that was grown with the aid of the sun.

845
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,820
Right.

846
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,820
That's what I mean.

847
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,820
What does that mean?

848
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,780
Is it like in a special, like, like, is it solar powered light?

849
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,780
Yeah I think so.

850
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,780
I think, I think it's berries.

851
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,220
It's artificial light powered by the sun, but why not just hit it with the sun then?

852
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:18,420
Yeah, it seems more, maybe it's a place where the sun doesn't shine.

853
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
This is a question.

854
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,420
Space?

855
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,300
No, but she's not the space one.

856
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,300
God, I don't know.

857
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,340
Well, we'll have to figure.

858
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,340
What's a solar berry?

859
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,900
Let us know if you have thoughts.

860
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,860
If we ever go get Tony Baxter back on this podcast, that's question number one.

861
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,700
So what is a solar berry?

862
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,700
What's a solar berry?

863
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,180
That might not have been his project title thing.

864
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,460
I guess it wasn't, so I don't know.

865
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,740
But maybe overheard.

866
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:45,460
Tony Baxter would survive a trip through Club Random because he'd be, no matter how much,

867
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,860
but don't you think we've gotten a little too, don't you think people with, don't you

868
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:53,140
think we're taking this COVID thing or are we getting a little crazy about it?

869
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,060
And he's like, that's very interesting.

870
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:01,100
Breck Eisner took a tour and he pointed at the model of start tours and said, we got

871
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,100
to do that.

872
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,820
He would go, he'd go back to the stump speech so happily and throw Bill way off his line

873
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,820
of questions.

874
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,180
One of my favorite, you know what that makes me think of, one of the season past podcast

875
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,860
interviews where somebody says something about, you know, a new, it's a new age with themed

876
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:21,260
entertainment or themed experiences where there's a ride, a restaurant and the land,

877
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
it's all themed together.

878
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,380
And Tony goes, that's a new thing.

879
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,820
And Tony goes, oh, you mean like New Orleans Square from Disneyland that has a restaurant

880
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,900
and a themed area and parts of Caribbean.

881
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,900
Like, wow, Tony Baxter, like threw his cards on the table or threw the mic down.

882
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,020
Well, and this, you know, the, the knots thing he said with us, that's true.

883
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,020
He'll get into it.

884
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,740
He'll, he would get, he would get into, yeah, he would, it would all be based on New Orleans

885
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,540
Square or scooping ice cream, but yeah, he would get into it at Club Random.

886
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,780
But isn't that, hey, that's what we do.

887
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
That's what we let.

888
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,620
That's why he came on our show before he went on Club Random.

889
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,620
Yeah, of course.

890
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:04,140
Here's a big, if we're talking just sheer numbers, there are a lot of fathers to choose

891
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
from.

892
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,780
It might be the biggest collection of animatronic fathers in the world.

893
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,780
You know where I'm going with this.

894
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
I believe I do.

895
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,780
The Hall of Presidents.

896
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,780
Yes.

897
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,020
That is essentially almost all of them.

898
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Except for one.

899
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,140
Yeah, that's what I found too.

900
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,140
Yes.

901
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,140
Poke.

902
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Oh, wait.

903
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
I think.

904
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Well, the list I-

905
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Wait, wait, wait.

906
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,180
I found that Warren Harding maybe, because a lot of people maybe didn't have their own

907
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:35,940
biological children with their, with the First Lady, but maybe they raised other, like they

908
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,400
were, they took care of a nephew or niece or something.

909
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,980
But I found that Warren Harding is the one who-

910
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,980
Really?

911
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,980
I saw James K. Polk.

912
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,220
Yeah, that'd be right though.

913
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,220
I don't know what I saw.

914
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:54,740
I don't know what asterisk I saw to where, I mean, there's, yeah, some did not, but like

915
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,100
we're the guardians.

916
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,620
John Tyler, 15 known children.

917
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,180
Oh my God.

918
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,180
So yeah.

919
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:07,100
So the sheer, this collection of robots produced a lot of children.

920
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Well, and-

921
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,420
The numbers are not necessarily-

922
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:15,820
And the founding fathers themselves, the fathers of the country as well.

923
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,980
So-

924
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,120
So you got to give them credit for that.

925
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,300
They did birth a beautiful child called America.

926
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:30,380
A perfect constitution that's never given us any problems.

927
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:39,060
Maybe if they had done, in that, the founding they were doing as fathers, maybe if they

928
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,980
made certain decisions early on, the later years wouldn't have been as wild.

929
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,980
Right.

930
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,380
I'm going to say that one really knocks.

931
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,260
The current state of things really knocks them out in terms of, if we're saying America

932
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,940
is their child.

933
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,940
Yeah.

934
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,060
I don't think the presidents are going to win this.

935
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,980
I don't think they're my choice.

936
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,700
There could be one stray one, but let's, we can knock a few-

937
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,700
Jimmy Carter?

938
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,700
Out.

939
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,140
Jimmy Carter, I think was not good is what I, I was looking at a list of like vaguely-

940
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,140
As a president or-

941
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,140
No, as a father.

942
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,140
Oh, as a father.

943
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,140
Oh, okay.

944
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,140
I think he was maybe-

945
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,140
Amy?

946
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,780
Amy, but I think the, and you think of Amy, that was a cute daughter running around the

947
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,780
White House, but I think-

948
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
It was an earlier one.

949
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,580
I think there were sons who he was shitty to.

950
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,660
You have a lot of, I mean, this is Geppetto too.

951
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,060
It's the presidents and Geppetto that they're married to their work.

952
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,460
It's tough to not be, you're married to your work if you're the president, but I think

953
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,900
a lot of these people were established terrible fathers even before the presidency.

954
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,900
Yeah.

955
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:49,380
I'm sure, well, the book, like George W and the Obamas seem like they liked their kids.

956
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,740
Yes, yeah.

957
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,740
I think so.

958
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:57,540
Yeah, I did not see George W Bush on a list of like the worst fathers.

959
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,180
I'm not choosing George W Bush, by the way.

960
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,180
I'm just saying-

961
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,180
No, that's far too strange to do.

962
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,540
That's intellectually exercise, the intellectual exercise we're doing here.

963
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,140
It is, if you think about George Bush and George W Bush and then John Adams and John

964
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:17,420
Quincy Adams, these are some of the only fathers and sons who appear together.

965
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,700
It's them and then John and the, which one, what's his kid?

966
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,700
Oh, yeah.

967
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,700
John and James.

968
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,700
Right, yeah.

969
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,500
So I was, yes, looking for that too of like father son on stage together.

970
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,980
And yeah, you got two of them in the hall of presidents.

971
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,980
Yeah.

972
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:38,940
If you're, and this is assuming that the, it's possible that the robots do not carry

973
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,620
the sins of their likenesses.

974
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,620
Oh, well that's another-

975
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,220
It's almost impossible to parse, I would say.

976
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,660
Yeah, I can't separate the robot from the man.

977
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,140
No, I don't think that's possible.

978
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:57,020
I think you have to assume that if it's Robobama, that it's Robomalia, it's all the same.

979
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,460
It has to be one to one, I think.

980
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,100
Which is a good argument in favor of one of the things I have coming up here.

981
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,100
Okay, okay.

982
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,860
I think, maybe it's not, maybe the logic's not good.

983
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,860
Okay, okay, yeah.

984
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,180
Let me parse a couple of presidents.

985
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,380
This is really where you got to knock a lot out.

986
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,420
Presidential historian wrote a book, did I write down his name?

987
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,580
Oh yeah, there's a book called First Dads by Joshua Kendall and I found an interview

988
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:26,380
with him talking about the book and he posits that Barack Obama is possibly the only president

989
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,060
of the United States ever to change a diaper.

990
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,580
Oh, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,580
Do you have math?

992
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,580
That's prob, I could see that being the, yeah.

993
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:40,780
Because he's the first of a generation where it wouldn't be considered woman's work.

994
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,100
Exactly, younger guy.

995
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,100
I mean, that was such a big part of voting for it.

996
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,100
You're like, this guy's not 100 years old here.

997
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,100
Even though George Bush wasn't that old when he was elected, it still felt like he was.

998
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,100
Yeah, yeah, yes.

999
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,540
It felt like a different, you're from a different like universe.

1000
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:05,460
I think the youthfulness maybe ties into the, are the parents, because the older you are,

1001
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,980
all these presidents are coming from these eras.

1002
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,580
Most of them grew up in a time where all men were monsters, including them.

1003
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:19,340
But then you end up with like, I didn't realize that Teddy Roosevelt was younger in the White

1004
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,340
House.

1005
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,340
He was like early 40s.

1006
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,340
Oh, right, right, right.

1007
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,340
Isn't that weird?

1008
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,340
Yes.

1009
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,620
The dreaming of like, oh maybe God, one day a 68 year old.

1010
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,100
Like what would happen where it's only the oldest, oldest man ever.

1011
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,740
But he was 42 or something, and he was apparently fun.

1012
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:41,180
He'd like run around and pretend to be a bear and like throw the furniture everywhere and

1013
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,180
hide in the attic.

1014
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,660
Is he the one who would just like leave and like they couldn't find him for a couple weeks?

1015
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,660
As the president?

1016
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,660
I believe so.

1017
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,740
There's somebody like that.

1018
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,740
I think it was him.

1019
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,740
That's cool.

1020
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,740
It's a really fun way to be.

1021
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,540
You're not so married to your work.

1022
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,340
You know, people would say it's the most important work in the world.

1023
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,340
Yeah.

1024
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:06,060
So, so really like when you're talking generationally, like it's only like a decade or two ago where

1025
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:10,660
behavior of fathers would not shock and disgust.

1026
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,660
You know, I think.

1027
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:19,660
Well, I think it's some of the appeal of old 45 Donald J. Trump that he was on record well

1028
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:24,700
before the presidency on some kind of platform called the Opie and Anthony show.

1029
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,700
He was.

1030
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,700
One of our institutions.

1031
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,700
One of our great institutions.

1032
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,700
Protect our finest institutions.

1033
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,700
Cronkite and Opie.

1034
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:38,700
Yeah, he years ago was like, like, no, I'm not changing it.

1035
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,300
I wouldn't change.

1036
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:45,300
He qualified as woman's work taking Tiffany on a walk in a stroller.

1037
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,300
He says like, you know, you think I'm going to be caught.

1038
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,940
I told Marla yelled at me, why don't you take Tiffany out?

1039
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,940
You think I'm going to walk in a boat with a carriage?

1040
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,940
Central Park?

1041
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,940
Not happening.

1042
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,940
Yeah.

1043
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,940
Taking a walk.

1044
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,940
Here's this is here's in case you don't.

1045
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,940
I would say don't.

1046
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,940
I would say don't be.

1047
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,940
Don't be afraid of taking your kid on a walk.

1048
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,940
I'm going to say that's not an embarrassing hyper feminine affair.

1049
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,940
I think that's going to take a hit to my masculinity.

1050
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,940
If somebody sees me with a stroller, they're going to be like, oh my God, I thought, ooh,

1051
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,580
I thought he was a real man and all.

1052
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,580
I'm sure Carlson walk with a baby buggy.

1053
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,580
What a loser wiener head.

1054
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,580
Like, what are they going to?

1055
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,580
That's the weirdest.

1056
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,580
You know, what?

1057
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,580
Also, the idea that changing diapers is woman's work, especially if you go back into like

1058
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:42,580
a traditional view of of gender and that like what the women need to be prim and proper

1059
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:49,860
and beauty and wear lace and and been frilly and flowers and they should get their hands

1060
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,540
covered in feces all day every day.

1061
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:01,540
If I'm next to my shitting baby and she's taking a nap, I need to jostle her awake instead

1062
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,380
of doing it myself.

1063
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,180
It's almost as if you're saying there's a contradiction here.

1064
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,740
Maybe it wasn't a pure line of thought for what women should be doing.

1065
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,740
I don't know.

1066
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,900
I don't know enough about it.

1067
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,900
I have to do.

1068
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,900
I don't either.

1069
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,900
I'm just saying.

1070
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,900
Yeah.

1071
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,900
Yeah.

1072
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,900
That's a very interesting point that Obama is probably the only president.

1073
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,900
Yeah.

1074
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,900
Yeah.

1075
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,900
Because I throw Biden back into because our current president saw 100 years old.

1076
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,900
Yeah.

1077
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,900
Yeah.

1078
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,420
He's like I don't know the timeline.

1079
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,740
I think he's I think he goes back before Teddy Roosevelt.

1080
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,420
He's also a different.

1081
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,500
This is a conversation I should be having.

1082
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,540
He also seems like a I mean, I know he seems like a different guy because he's very old

1083
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,140
now, but he also seems like he's a different energy in his last 15 years than he did when

1084
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,140
he was like in the 80s and 90s.

1085
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,900
I don't know what it is.

1086
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,540
Much like gruff or a lot gruffer.

1087
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,540
Yeah.

1088
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,260
And obviously like he's a bunch of bullshit.

1089
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,260
He passed and all we know.

1090
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,260
We know a lot of that.

1091
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,340
But you just saw some of those hearings.

1092
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,340
Not so good.

1093
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,340
So it was Clarence Thomas.

1094
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,340
Oh yeah.

1095
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,340
Awful shit.

1096
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,340
Yeah.

1097
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,660
Better to get to overlook.

1098
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:12,300
He almost seems like I could see this version of him changing a diaper once in a while,

1099
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,860
but I couldn't see that version of him changing a diaper, if that makes sense.

1100
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,860
Yeah.

1101
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:22,100
30 years ago, I see that guy yelling and I go, yeah, that guy ain't changing a diaper.

1102
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:27,380
But this one, grandpop, like I could see him.

1103
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,380
It's interesting.

1104
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,060
I don't see that a lot with like people where I see such a drastic change.

1105
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,900
I would maybe just, because I don't think he's doing it at this age, but I would say

1106
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,820
maybe he wouldn't leave the room in disgust.

1107
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,300
I think he might stay in the room while a disgusting diaper is changed.

1108
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,900
So he wouldn't leave for the day.

1110
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,820
I was going to stick around for a few more hours, but after that I'm getting out of here.

1111
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,820
Yeah, yeah.

1112
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,180
So it's the diapers are not.

1113
00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:00,740
You've got some gross times ahead of you, but once you figure out that that's not crazy,

1114
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:06,180
to the degree that this was built up my entire life, the worst thing that will ever happen

1115
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,740
to you is having to change a diaper.

1116
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:13,380
You saw like Steve Gutenberg holding it up in a trailer for a movie and you're like,

1117
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,740
ah, no, what am I in for when this happens?

1118
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:16,740
I'm not ready.

1119
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,900
I'm not like radioactive material.

1120
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,420
I don't care about that at all.

1121
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,260
That is not been a, maybe it would have been 10 years ago, but that is not a concern of

1122
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,260
mine.

1123
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,260
No, no.

1124
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,460
I'll touch my child's shit all day long.

1125
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,460
I don't care.

1126
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,460
I'll get my hands in there.

1127
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,180
Then you're in luck.

1128
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,180
Yeah.

1129
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:37,540
I mean, if you have a dog or a cat, like I'm touching shit every day.

1130
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,540
I know.

1131
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,540
Yeah.

1132
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,540
Gross.

1133
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,540
Like I've touched gross shit.

1134
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,540
Gross, weird dog shit.

1135
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,540
Yeah, that's right.

1136
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,380
But I haven't had a dog since I was a kid.

1137
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:50,420
So yeah, you're wait, you're like your life is like the weird stuff.

1138
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:55,380
Like he said, he's in our dog has weird bowels, weird, like orange stuff.

1139
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,700
Sometimes green stuff, trying to figure things out.

1140
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:07,060
I'm so sorry, but talking about Edwin's shit, but I'm just saying, yeah, that's not changing

1141
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,060
diapers.

1142
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,420
Not that I'm not worried about that at all.

1143
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,580
That's weighed on the list of concerns.

1144
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,820
Just those first few days.

1145
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,820
It's right.

1146
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,020
You've told me you've talked about that on the show before.

1147
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,020
Oh, sure.

1148
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,020
Yeah.

1149
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,020
That they're like black in color.

1150
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,020
That's a five timer then.

1151
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,020
Yeah.

1152
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,820
You've talked about how the weird shit is.

1153
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,820
How the weird shit is.

1154
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,740
That's the only, it's one of the only sky.

1155
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,380
Well, that one I read about ahead of time and like, Oh, I think I didn't know that.

1156
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,260
I didn't know what a sloppy situation that was.

1157
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,260
I didn't know that either.

1158
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,540
I mean, there's going to be some certain things, but I've that stuck with me.

1159
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,020
It's almost though humor.

1160
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:43,740
There's, I recall Aaron and I just like, wow, you are kidding.

1161
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,740
This is crazy.

1162
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,420
That's all you could do is laugh at it.

1163
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,420
Sure.

1164
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,060
Well, that's something to look forward to.

1165
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,500
We'll loop the listeners in.

1166
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,060
More you want to know on this.

1167
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,060
Yeah.

1168
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,060
Three.

1169
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:01,380
I'm trying to, is there, Oh, one more thing about here's a, here's a president to knock

1170
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,340
out John Adams.

1171
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:08,340
John Adams told his son he would either be a president or a failure.

1172
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,860
He said that actually to all three of his sons.

1173
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,860
Wow.

1174
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:16,660
Became the president, John Quincy Adams, two other sons drank themselves to death.

1175
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,660
Yeah.

1176
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,660
Yeah.

1177
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,660
He's out.

1178
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:24,980
They can't all be, they can't look as Jeb proved, they can't all be the president.

1179
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,900
Yes.

1180
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,900
They can't all win.

1181
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,700
Though, do I wish he had been in comparison?

1182
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,700
Sure.

1183
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,780
Let's all just go back to imagine Jeb.

1184
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:41,580
Imagine what a shitty do nothing flaccid president he would have been.

1185
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,580
Yeah.

1186
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:45,180
I mean, the sad thing is a lot of this stuff might've been the same.

1187
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,180
Yeah.

1188
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,180
It would have just been less chaos.

1189
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,500
It would have had the same Supreme court, like, but it would have just been.

1190
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Oh, that's right.

1191
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Oh no.

1192
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,780
Like he might've appointed the same shit heads.

1193
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,580
Bush appointed Roberts who ended up not being as insane.

1194
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,180
Like he's still awful, but.

1195
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,180
Yeah.

1196
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,180
Roberts votes.

1197
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,180
What a world I know.

1198
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,180
We're looking at him.

1199
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,860
You're like, Oh, thank God for John Roberts.

1200
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,500
The voice of sanity in the room.

1201
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,220
So maybe Jeb would have gotten us closer to something like that.

1202
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,220
I don't know.

1203
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,220
So who are we?

1204
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,460
I would say maybe Teddy Roosevelt.

1205
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:22,740
And I would say if you just play like a bear with your kid and then be like Obama and change

1206
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,740
a diaper.

1207
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,740
Yeah.

1208
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,060
These are the only presidents.

1209
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,300
Do any of them top John future aware?

1210
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,300
John.

1211
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,300
That's tough.

1212
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,300
I mean, I don't know.

1213
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:40,300
I mean, I guess Obama seems like the best, easily the best one.

1214
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,300
Is he better than John from the carousel of progress?

1215
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,300
Who's a better father?

1216
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,300
That's well, it's better.

1217
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,300
That's what we're doing here.

1218
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,140
Barack Obama or John from the carousel of progress?

1219
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,820
One of the Obama kids interned for Weinstein.

1220
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,460
So I guess it's a strike.

1221
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,020
Oh, is that right?

1222
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,020
Yeah.

1223
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,020
Yeah.

1224
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,020
Wow.

1225
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,020
That's not his.

1226
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,700
So while they're kind of tied, then both of them put their daughters in precarious situations.

1227
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,700
Uh huh.

1228
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,740
So I don't know.

1229
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,740
Let's come back this guy.

1230
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,740
I have another contender.

1231
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,180
Let's get to your you've been teasing this.

1232
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,180
I think it's time to hear it.

1233
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,180
I don't know.

1234
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,180
You might want to disqualify me for this.

1235
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,180
Okay.

1236
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,340
So I'm going around California adventure in my mind.

1237
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,860
First of all, I want to say some of the things I Googled.

1238
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,500
Do any of the Chuck E. Cheese characters have children?

1239
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,980
I couldn't find any evidence.

1240
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,180
Well, well, you found one.

1241
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,220
Oh, of course.

1242
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,220
Of course.

1243
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,580
I almost forgot myself.

1244
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:31,580
Shit.

1245
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,580
You're right.

1246
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,580
I didn't.

1247
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,580
Munch Jr.

1248
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,580
Munch Jr.

1249
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,580
You're right.

1250
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,580
It popped up.

1251
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,580
However, but is it confusing as far as origin is?

1252
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,580
It is.

1253
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,580
Yeah.

1254
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,580
Because as when.

1255
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,580
Okay.

1256
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,940
So there used to be in Chuck E. Cheese, a tiny purple monster munch that would pop out

1257
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,940
of the ground.

1258
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,500
He had a little beanie on and one tooth.

1259
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,140
You would assume from the name Munch Jr.

1260
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,140
It's Munch's kid.

1261
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,700
But in recent mythology.

1262
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:00,900
Oh, in the videos with the puppets in the recent past.

1263
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,300
First of all, Munch is an alien.

1264
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,300
Did you know that?

1265
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,300
I did know that.

1266
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,300
Yeah.

1267
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,300
I didn't know it was an animal.

1268
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,300
I just thought general monster like Cookie Monster or something.

1269
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,300
He's an alien.

1270
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,820
He is an alien.

1271
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,820
So they're from spade.

1272
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,460
They're from planet purple.

1273
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:20,060
And there's one where a bunch of his siblings appear for Christmas.

1274
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:24,460
Their version of Christmas, which and they're looking forward to seeing their version of

1275
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:28,620
Santa's Zorpa Zorpa Glorp Dorba.

1276
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,620
So Munch Jr.

1277
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:35,620
In this video where they're waiting for Zorpa Glorp Dorba, Munch Jr. is established as Munch's

1278
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,620
brother.

1279
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,620
Wow.

1280
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,620
Very confusing.

1281
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,620
Very confusing.

1282
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,620
But it's alien.

1283
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,620
It's you know, it's another planet.

1284
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,540
So juniors can be brothers there.

1285
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,140
Yeah, juniors can be brothers.

1286
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,620
So is Munch a father?

1287
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,620
I guess no.

1288
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,620
I mean, unless we just haven't.

1289
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:51,620
Yeah.

1290
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:56,980
So I think it made me I continue to have more respect for the work that they're doing in

1291
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:02,140
recent Chuck E. Cheese world from the catchy songs to the expanded mythology of their own

1292
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:07,180
Christmas much like the Star Wars holiday special.

1293
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,940
These videos I used to think, oh, and they make these little puppet videos.

1294
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,780
I think these are not to be ignored.

1295
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,780
I agree.

1296
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,780
Well, rock and roll.

1297
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,740
Look, just go back and watch Rock and Robot, which I've done.

1298
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,740
Oh, yeah.

1299
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:18,740
Mm hmm.

1300
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,740
Which is fun.

1301
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,740
I don't know.

1302
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,740
We saw a great concert.

1303
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,740
We saw a great concert.

1304
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,740
I'm still thinking about it.

1305
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,740
They're doing good work.

1306
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,740
So what do you want to run?

1307
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,740
I'm going to California.

1308
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:27,740
I'm thinking again.

1309
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,740
I want you to know Donald.

1310
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,100
There's a seed animatronic, but no, Donald's got nephews.

1311
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,100
He doesn't have kids.

1312
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,100
All right.

1313
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,100
Rock a raccoon.

1314
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,100
Is he a father?

1315
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,100
I don't believe so.

1316
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,100
I'm going around.

1317
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,100
I'm going around.

1318
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,420
I go, what about Mr. Potato Head?

1319
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:48,260
And I go, OK, canon wise and Toy Story, Rickles Potato Head, I don't think, has children.

1320
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:54,100
But if you look up Mr. Potato Head children, you find that in the 1980s, there was a TV

1321
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:59,540
show that I had never heard of called Potato Head Kids.

1322
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,540
Whoa.

1323
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,540
OK, I'm listening.

1324
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,300
1986.

1325
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,540
It was paired with My Little Pony and Friends.

1326
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:13,900
I don't I've never heard of Potato Head Kids before, but I just saw them.

1327
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,900
It just did me.

1328
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,900
They look like shit.

1329
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,140
Oh, it looks bad.

1330
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,300
I watched the intro.

1331
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,340
They look like the little chicken nuggets from the chicken.

1332
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,820
They absolutely do commercials.

1333
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,820
But what's interesting?

1334
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,820
What's interesting?

1335
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,220
Well, I guess I'll get to this.

1336
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,460
So yeah, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head were on this show.

1337
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,660
And then there were kids.

1338
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,260
There was a whole bunch of different kids.

1339
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:41,620
Big Chip Puff, who wore a bonnet, Spud, a cowboy hat wearing potato that talks like

1340
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:46,340
a cowboy voiced by Breckenmire in 1986.

1341
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,340
Child Breckenmire.

1342
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,340
That's right.

1343
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,500
Lumpy, a beanie hat wearing potato.

1344
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,500
Lumpy.

1345
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Yeah.

1346
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,500
Wow.

1347
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:00,060
Lolly, slick, spike and smarty pants.

1348
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:05,980
A female potato in a green hair bow, who is the smartest of the potatoes.

1349
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:11,820
So I you know, this is would you accept these?

1350
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,660
Boy, that's confusing.

1351
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:18,660
I mean, it's not Disney, but it's Hasbro and Disney and Pixar had to do the licensing

1352
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,660
with Hasbro.

1353
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,660
Right.

1354
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,580
And I it's not OK.

1355
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,580
I should.

1356
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:31,580
I can't get a full conclusion that they're actually like Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head mated

1357
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,460
to create them.

1358
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,100
But that's the implication.

1359
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,620
I think you have to go with because there's a lot.

1360
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:41,380
I think the reason we don't find more kids in animatronic world is because they don't

1361
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,980
want to make you think about these characters.

1362
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:44,980
Yeah, right.

1363
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,020
How would two potatoes get it on?

1364
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,700
That's a good question.

1365
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:57,220
Is it an egg based system where like like Mrs. Potato Head lays an egg out of the hatch

1366
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:03,540
in her butt and then Mr. Potato Head comes along and he fertilizes it somehow.

1367
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,540
Buries it?

1368
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,540
Like, but it's got to be how potatoes are made.

1369
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,540
Well, he sticks.

1370
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:13,500
OK, look, I got a content warning, but he sticks the penis on like he sticks the arms

1371
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,500
on.

1372
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,260
Oh, we haven't thought about this.

1373
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,340
All the parts are in his butt.

1374
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,340
That's OK.

1375
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,340
OK, the parts are in his butt.

1376
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,340
Yeah.

1377
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,980
So I guess really it's like humans do it.

1378
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,020
It's just the parts are in their butt.

1379
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,020
Yes.

1380
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:31,260
Well, like, look, I don't want to.

1381
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,860
I have I'm going to have to use the word strap on.

1382
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,460
Well, it's what it is.

1383
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,300
Mr. Potato Head has to get a strap on.

1384
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,220
But Mr. Potato Head, all his limbs are strap on.

1385
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,140
So when you say strap on with potato heads, that's all of the things.

1386
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,140
That's the eyes.

1387
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,140
Oh, yeah.

1388
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,820
You strap on their arms.

1389
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,460
He is a toy and he's into toys.

1390
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,220
Yeah.

1391
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,020
Every part of him is a strap on.

1392
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,780
Every part of the potato heads are strap on.

1393
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,300
Yeah.

1394
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,300
So that's just accurate.

1395
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,300
That's not gross.

1396
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:06,980
So, yeah, so he has to he that's got to be kept somewhere that the kids can't know about.

1397
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,220
Right. But obviously, the kids have their own hatch in his butt.

1398
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:15,020
The kids have their own hatch and they they know is what they don't

1399
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,740
want to ask what secrets are in there.

1400
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,780
Yeah. So so I just want to a little more about the show.

1401
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,700
There's a villains on the show or Greece's gang, a group of delinquents who are the main

1402
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,020
antagonists.

1403
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,780
Greece, a kid is who is a leader of the gang.

1404
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,180
He is a crush on Puff and tries to marry her,

1405
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:32,940
which is the ultimate villain.

1406
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,300
Daughter. Yeah.

1407
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,420
Isn't a very villain.

1408
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,980
And I'll marry the.

1409
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:37,940
Yeah.

1410
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,580
Because less of that these days.

1411
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,460
So, yeah, probably.

1412
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,940
Well, so probably the potato heads protect.

1413
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,140
Which which one?

1414
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:49,660
Puff.

1415
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,180
Yeah. Who is the bonnet wearing potato?

1416
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,220
I can't believe we've got another lumpy on our hands.

1417
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,260
Another lump here.

1418
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,700
Two of the parents were considering are brown and they have a lumpy.

1419
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,180
That's right.

1420
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,820
That's pretty weird.

1421
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:05,460
So, look, I don't know a ton about I watched a little bit.

1422
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,260
Here's what I do know about the show.

1423
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,100
It's on Wikipedia.

1424
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,260
Twenty fourteen.

1425
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:13,300
I on nine listed it among twelve 1980s cartoons that supposedly did not deserve

1426
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,020
remembrance.

1427
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,980
So it's lowest bar of 90s, even the.

1428
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,300
Yeah, we'd never.

1429
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,540
Hey, remember, remember this year, remember Nick.

1430
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,660
You know, nobody wants this to be remembered.

1431
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,700
Nobody remembers this show.

1432
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,100
If you look it up, I'm sure we'll post a picture or two or a clip or something.

1433
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,380
It looks like it looks bad.

1434
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,620
It looks unpleasant because they all look like little turds.

1435
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:41,100
Yeah, they all look like little chicken nugget turds.

1436
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:44,340
And one is kind of a little jughead crown.

1437
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,900
Yes, that's true.

1438
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,100
Yeah, and I do like that.

1439
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,420
I like some of the outfits.

1440
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,420
I like the idea. There's a cowboy hat,

1441
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,700
potato head kid.

1442
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:59,780
Well, let's also, you know, if we want to be more with the Rickles

1443
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:04,740
potato head, he is kind of a surrogate father, much like many of our presidents

1444
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:08,340
to the green, the little green men.

1445
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:10,100
That's true.

1446
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,540
They develop. It's kind of a, you know,

1447
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:19,260
a forced parental relationship, but he comes to it comes to be very sweet.

1448
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,220
Yes. So he saves them.

1449
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,300
They save him. Right.

1450
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,620
That relationship is kind of nice.

1451
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,620
Does potato head do anything?

1452
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:28,820
I'm trying to think, does he ever do anything

1453
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:32,140
that fair yes in any of the episodes and any of the movies?

1454
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,660
You've seen these more recently than I have.

1455
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,060
He's he's particularly

1456
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:40,180
bad to Woody with faulty evidence.

1457
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:44,660
He's kind of the quickest to rush to judgment. Right.

1458
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,700
But, you know, from everything he knew,

1459
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,020
Woody did try to kill Buzz right in that moment.

1460
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,100
So it's not the Ben. That's not children.

1461
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:59,020
I think he's pretty respectful of the feels a little.

1462
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,620
I don't know. I'm worried it's a little Trumpy with the like

1463
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,820
they hug him and he kind of recoils.

1464
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:07,380
But by three, they save his life.

1465
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,220
And yeah, I'm forever grateful.

1466
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,340
It does. It's a little sweet.

1467
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,780
I think he is looking out for him.

1468
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,700
Well, I think the potato head from the potato kids

1469
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,020
is a different version of potato head.

1470
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:23,620
But if I think if we're talking together with Hasbro licensing. Yeah.

1471
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,700
Could be. I don't know if he steers him away from the grease gang

1472
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,420
and he's nice to the aliens.

1473
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,420
Mr. Potato Head's definitely in the running.

1474
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,500
He's in the running. Yeah.

1475
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,700
And he's look, he lets out he lets his kids have their own identity.

1476
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,900
One has a bonnet, one is a cowboy hat.

1477
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,860
And that's good.

1478
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,300
That's you have to get let kids like stretch out and and and figure out

1479
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,900
what they want to go on.

1480
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,180
They get in this wagon with a face.

1481
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,100
They're out, you know, exploring the world.

1482
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:54,620
He's not, you know, forcing him to stay in their rooms. Right.

1483
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,940
So there's that's a strike in our good thing.

1484
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,140
That's not a strike against them. That's a strike in the favor.

1485
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,700
Yeah. Yeah.

1486
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:04,420
I'm going to I'm going to run through two really quick.

1487
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,940
And then I think, you know, I think it's really your call to make

1488
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:10,220
what kind of father you want to be, what kind of role model

1489
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:15,660
the God, Godfather bought that you want to put in your your kid's life.

1490
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:21,340
So there's the kid in Country Bearer, Jim Brea.

1491
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,900
Yes. Yes.

1492
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:27,060
Yes. And I was is one of them, the dad.

1493
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,700
And in fact, that is the case.

1494
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:35,220
Zeb Zuber. Zeb Zuber is if we're if we're including Country Bearer

1495
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,860
is the movie. Yeah.

1496
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,140
As part of the mythology.

1497
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,300
And Jason is not here.

1498
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:44,340
So we most certainly are Country Bearer's 2002 is in.

1499
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,340
Yeah. Zeb Zuber.

1500
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,980
He takes his son on the road.

1501
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,820
That's good. Right.

1502
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,380
But then maybe you get exposed to bad stuff on the road.

1503
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,180
He is addicted to honey.

1504
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,180
Yeah. In the film.

1505
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,180
So he's not keeping himself in order.

1506
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:06,180
Yeah. And the kid seems a little quiet and uncomfortable.

1507
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,980
But like, that's the way that's the vibe on stage.

1508
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,580
Yeah. Like, that's a real strike against.

1509
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,380
That's maybe a stage dad, like a forced performer.

1510
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:17,060
Yeah. And that and because there's a robot, that kid's going to be there

1511
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,580
forever forever.

1512
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,180
It has been there for decades.

1513
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,380
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1514
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,380
All right. Well, I guess I'm going to have to go.

1515
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,780
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, out.

1516
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,380
Maybe I guess he's out. Yeah.

1517
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,780
Yeah. OK.

1518
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,380
Zeb Zuber is not your.

1519
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,780
Sorry, Zuber.

1520
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:33,380
King Triton.

1521
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,780
It you know. Yeah. Right.

1522
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,860
Right. King Triton gives her the freedom she needs at the end.

1523
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,060
And he's ripped.

1524
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,260
He is body and great shape.

1525
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,980
Oh, yeah. That maybe you want to you just want to look at him as a

1526
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,740
not even just as a role.

1527
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:47,740
Maybe you just want to look at him.

1528
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:52,060
Maybe I could overlook everything else just because he's like he looks like a wrestler.

1529
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,300
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Superhero.

1530
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,500
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

1531
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,380
He's so angry at the beginning, but we don't really see that in the ride.

1532
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,660
Yeah. We just see him waving in the ride.

1533
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:04,940
Yeah, it's hard because like his arc in the ride and I guess the arc on the move.

1534
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,420
Same thing in the movie.

1535
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,460
So I guess, yeah, he gets he becomes understanding at the end.

1536
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:14,380
That being said, he's a king and he's certainly like committed atrocities.

1537
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,700
People have carried out atrocities in the underwater kingdom in his name.

1538
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,140
I hadn't thought there's no way there's no way he hasn't.

1539
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,860
Yeah, very rarely are like there's a good king.

1540
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:24,260
Oh, yeah.

1541
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:27,780
That's sadly talked through all these presidents and we know if they're bad

1542
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:28,700
and the king's are bad.

1543
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,100
I mean, King is worse and president King.

1544
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,180
Sea King. Yeah.

1545
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:37,020
Well, who knows what other sea kings he's crushed under his fin.

1546
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:41,660
God, or Sebastian's like preparing for concerts and just ignoring like the.

1547
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,460
Yeah.

1548
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:45,500
Reams, the political prisoners.

1549
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,860
And what did King try and do to get there?

1550
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,540
Oh, you know.

1551
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,100
Maybe he just well, I don't know.

1552
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,860
The daughters are just like their daughters.

1553
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,580
So they get to they've been shield.

1554
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:58,300
I mean, I guess you could make the argument they've been shielded from

1555
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:03,260
his his monstrosity or his his monstrous behavior.

1556
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,700
Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully.

1557
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,180
So yeah. So, I don't know.

1558
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,140
Yeah. Personal life, you have to take into account with him.

1559
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,300
I'm going to throw one more out.

1560
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:13,100
And this is one you've probably forgotten about and one that I kind of forgot about.

1561
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:17,820
But this was a pleasant find a little while back when we talked about Sally Dark

1562
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:23,220
rides. There was this there's this ride that's in Sweden

1563
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:27,420
that is just about family pleasantness and hijinks.

1564
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,900
Oh, man. On a little vacation.

1565
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,060
The ride is called Vipass Salt Kraken.

1566
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,340
I did forget about it. You're right.

1567
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:37,620
It's this gentle, extremely blonde family.

1568
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,100
And I didn't know the family relationships.

1569
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,940
I didn't know who was a grandpa or who was a mom or whatever.

1570
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,900
Here's what I came to find out.

1571
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,100
It is a father in that ride.

1572
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,220
The father's name is Milker Milkerson.

1573
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:54,860
And he is he's a widower.

1574
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,780
So he's raising four kids solo.

1575
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:02,740
Right. Still finding the time to take them on trips that they'll never forget.

1576
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:08,900
Right. A trip that apparently the tales of which move all of the Swedish people.

1577
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,220
Right. Many decades.

1578
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,540
Yeah. Yes. He's an author.

1579
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,620
So he's keeping creative and that's something you need to do.

1580
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:21,580
You want you need to keep your it's better for the whole family if you're keeping your creative life alive,

1581
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:28,540
but still taking these nice trips, going to see Crow Island, installing water flumes,

1582
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,940
getting in mischief with bees.

1583
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,700
He does all that to help his family, to protect his family.

1584
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,340
And it seems like they only say kind things about him.

1585
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,740
Was the crow's name Jumping Jack?

1586
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,540
God, I don't remember that. I believe it was.

1587
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,420
That seems right. If you're called him Jumping Jack.

1588
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,820
Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK. OK.

1589
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:51,660
And other kids are in the mix, like other neighbor kids are over and he's dealing with them, too.

1590
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,980
And he's he gets a little stressed.

1591
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,100
He's not unflappable. He gets flapped.

1592
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,500
He gets stressed. It's like he does.

1593
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:04,180
But that's you know, you get flapped, but you but you manage.

1594
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:10,300
I think that's how I think that's how your parents and go to a tall man like Milker

1595
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,660
Melkerson. His name is Melker.

1596
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:16,140
Melker Melkerson. Great name.

1597
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,020
OK, so let me think here.

1598
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,860
John from the future.

1599
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:24,420
President Barack Obama. Yeah.

1600
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,860
Or Melker Melkerson.

1601
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,860
That's sort of what I've narrowed it down here.

1602
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:31,580
Yeah, we aren't missing any was no much is out.

1603
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,100
But he's in there after all that.

1604
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,820
No, Mr.

1605
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,140
Yeah, he's out. OK.

1606
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,540
He's just a little too caustic.

1607
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,420
Mm hmm. Sure. The kids are not going to.

1608
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,860
It's too much as a vibe. Yeah.

1609
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:44,020
You got to turn it off. Yeah.

1610
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,180
I think you got the three. Yes.

1611
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:48,380
So it's who's the best dad in the trial.

1612
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:52,060
Barack Obama, John Melker, Melkerson, Barack Obama, Melker, Melkerson.

1613
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:58,900
So John is future and I like I like that he's a simple guy in the future.

1614
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:02,980
He seems to have learned not to expose his daughter to

1615
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,100
the audience, which is nice.

1616
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:12,700
Don't don't show her fully clothed to a bunch of strangers.

1617
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,700
Yes. Yeah.

1618
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:18,860
OK. But he's still a little sort of I don't know.

1619
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,580
He's he's distracted.

1620
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:24,860
And can I fully forgive the sins of the past?

1621
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:27,940
I don't know. Barack Obama.

1622
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,580
You know, he's he's president.

1623
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:32,180
That's a busy you got to be busy, you know.

1624
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:35,260
I think he particularly of presidents is like, I'm

1625
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,300
I'm done at this hour.

1626
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,140
And I'm going to be with my kids now.

1627
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:45,780
Maybe did all of us suffer due to two more hours a day, you're saying?

1628
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,380
He maybe with those hours, he might have, I don't know,

1629
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,500
codified a couple of things.

1630
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,940
Well, that's gotten some stuff done.

1631
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,500
He had to go to a play or something, a recital.

1632
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,900
He was going to codify

1633
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,260
but going with Harvey.

1634
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:04,580
Still Senate president.

1635
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,420
Just, you know, it's a lot going on.

1636
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,900
There's it's not as chilled out.

1637
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,860
It's not as chilled out as a life as you might want.

1638
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,100
It's really what I'm saying.

1639
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:18,260
Yeah. And it's hard not when you think about the serenity of of

1640
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:22,660
what is a Vipa, Vipa, Salt Crack and Seacrow Island, Seacrow Island

1641
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:26,100
with with all its antics and its gentle calm.

1642
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,660
You know, it's hard to not say you want Melker

1643
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:34,220
Melkerson to be the role model because, yeah, he screws up.

1644
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,940
But this that the life he sort of provided

1645
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:41,660
feels like it's it's utopia in a way.

1646
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,060
I think so.

1647
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:47,700
It seems like also like the riot is it's, you know, we found this nice house.

1648
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,140
Oh, but there's a leak in it.

1649
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,740
But you know what? We can we laugh at when there was a leak in the house

1650
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,740
and we fix the leak.

1651
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:55,460
Melker fixes the leak. Right.

1652
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,980
And then that's that's a memory and it makes us strong.

1653
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,500
Nice memory. Right.

1654
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,220
So I guess no doubt.

1655
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,740
I think there's no doubt that the answer to the question

1656
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:08,740
of who the best dad of metronic is, one that I would want to be my

1657
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,660
God robot or God.

1658
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:18,340
Father, God, Father, God, Father, God, is the character from the ride.

1659
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:22,020
Vipa Salt Crack and based on and I forget the woman.

1660
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:25,420
What's the woman's name? Astrid Lindgren, Astrid Lindgren, of course,

1661
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:29,420
Swedish author who, of course, created the character Carlson on the roof.

1662
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,300
As well. Oh, that's right.

1663
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,740
That part and Pippi Longstocking. Yeah.

1664
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:38,820
But yes, her character, Melker, Melkerson is the winner.

1665
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,780
Yeah. Wow. Of the data metronic.

1666
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:43,220
That's what OK.

1667
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:45,700
So you know, you have a guiding light.

1668
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:48,340
We know that you're going to be like Melker, Melkerson.

1669
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,020
Yeah. As a father, I'm going to be like Melker, Melkerson.

1670
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:52,300
I think it's perfect.

1671
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,980
Honestly, I guess we could have brought into this mix like a Fred

1672
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,340
von Stone, who's a father.

1673
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,060
And but you know what? He would have been out.

1674
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,780
Melkerson. Yeah, Mel.

1675
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,900
It's still not. Yeah.

1676
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,340
Melker would have won every one beaten them all.

1677
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,420
Yeah, I think he and you know what?

1678
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:08,540
He internalizes his he doesn't yell at his family.

1679
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,620
Yeah. A bunch of bees are stinging him.

1680
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,620
He just goes, ah, he doesn't take it out on him.

1681
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,700
It's fun. Yeah.

1682
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,820
Because I'm sure people will be like, well, you didn't say,

1683
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,700
oh, I guess Homer Simpson's not an animatronic.

1684
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,180
So it would have been out anyway. Yeah.

1685
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:23,620
But still strangles his son, strangles his son.

1686
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,820
Toss him out just for that.

1687
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,700
He's no Melkerson.

1688
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:29,740
I hope that there's not a very dark episode of V.

1689
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:32,420
Posse. I was thinking about that, like in the first book or something.

1690
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:37,540
And he yeah, he like beats someone up in front of the kids or slaps

1691
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,580
one of the kids. Like, hopefully that's not the case.

1692
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,420
Kills a bunch of secrets to teach them a lesson.

1693
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:45,140
It's far as we know, because we saw the ride.

1694
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:45,940
We watched the ride.

1695
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,900
Well, right. Only going off of the ride.

1696
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,420
Yeah. It's the calmest.

1697
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:53,220
I think a little reflection of what family life could and should be.

1698
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:56,100
Yeah. So as far as we know,

1699
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,340
Melker Melkerson wins. Great.

1700
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:01,140
Some people knew this all time. This was going to happen.

1701
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,540
Not me. They are these guys.

1702
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:07,500
They don't even they don't even know how Bear Call Solons.

1703
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:11,700
They don't know how nice the Jason's going to recover. Great.

1704
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:17,100
And that Melker is obviously going to these soothsayers in the audience.

1705
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:19,020
Yeah, they know they were ahead of us.

1706
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:22,420
And well, congrats to Melker. Congrats, Melker.

1707
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:26,260
And I hope I wish for you a family life that is

1708
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:31,180
as as mellow and content as life on Seacral Island.

1709
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:35,220
If if somebody just subscribed to this Patreon and heard this episode first,

1710
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:38,340
they're really going to be confused if they haven't gone back

1711
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,380
and listen to the Sally Dark Rides episode.

1712
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:43,500
You do need that one and go back and listen.

1713
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:46,420
Some of the other episodes have a third host.

1714
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:49,660
His name is Jason and he's very pleasant and funny.

1715
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:52,140
If you just went into this, decided I'm going to start

1716
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,220
listening to this podcast,

1717
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:56,140
but I'm going to subscribe to the Patreon first and start with this episode.

1718
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,820
That is the case. Yeah, there's a third guy,

1719
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,380
the third dude who's on the show.

1720
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,500
Yeah, I know. Yeah, check.

1721
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,660
Check him out.

1722
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:08,060
Character from the prequels to this episode, that being hundreds of prior episodes.

1723
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,660
Yeah, consider them prequels to this data metronix.

1724
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,260
But this episode has come to a close.

1725
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:16,860
You survived podcast, the ride, the second gate.

Thank you. Yeah, good luck. Future Mike,

1731
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,140
future makes a different.

1732
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,780
He's a different guy.

1733
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,660
I'm a different guy now. He'll be different.

1734
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,660
A lot of different time on Spider-Man like John Multiverse.

1735
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:43,540
It'll be like John.

1736
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,700
I'll be like John and Horizons in a couple of weeks. Where?
