1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Forever.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,280
hats not worn on heads, and a massive breakthrough in theme park wallet and hat storing technology.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,500
All that plus Stephen Ray Morris returns to talk Velocicoaster on today's podcast, The

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,220
Ride.

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,260
Welcome to Podcast The Ride with your hosts who are so preoccupied with whether or not

6
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,500
they could start a theme park podcast they didn't stop to think if they should start

7
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,660
a theme park podcast.

8
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,440
I'm Scott Gardner, gold blooming it a little bit, joined by Mike Carlson.

9
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,060
Yes, hello, I'm here and we did not consider the implication, we did not consider what would

10
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,000
happen if we did it.

11
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,380
We didn't earn this knowledge, we took it from yesterland and from Jim Hill and now we're

12
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,020
selling it, we're selling it.

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,280
Jason Sheridan.

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm placing a water droplet on Jason Sheridan's hand right now to show him, to illustrate

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,260
what happened kind of in a non-verbal way.

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,260
I forgot for a second that moment in the movie and I was like do I have a water droplet

17
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,840
on my hand?

18
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,540
How did I do that?

19
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,140
And why is Mike honing in on it?

20
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,740
It's the sexiest part of the movie I think, other than the shirtless gold bloom.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,540
Oh wait that's a little flirty thing.

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,740
It's what he does in real life, it's all hands.

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,840
See how he does this thing with you and with your hands.

24
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,280
The gold bloom sexuality.

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:01,240
Yeah, hey we're doing some Jurassic Park stuff today, Jurassic World really, excited to

26
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,760
be doing it.

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,120
Mainly we are back on main feed, apologies for the long break but it was nice to get

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,160
some time off there.

29
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,840
Of course there were new episodes that entire time on the Patreon so if you want to hear

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,220
everything that you missed, if you didn't hear all that, you can catch up at the second

31
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,300
gate and club 3, all of that at patreon.

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,060
com slash podcast the ride.

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,480
But here we are back for free and good to see you again and it seems like a good way

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,100
to kick off the year to continue our series of big new rides from this decade, from this

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,640
century.

36
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,300
Blockbuster, two year old attraction, two year old ride.

37
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,280
Yeah yeah.

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,560
I know it feels so new.

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,960
I thought it was sooner but it was yeah.

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,540
It's been there for a little bit because it kind of popped up you know when pandemic was

41
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,840
still kind of cooking.

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,680
But yeah, big rides that now we've experienced, some of us will get into that.

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,920
But very excited to be doing it with a fan of the franchise and a returning guest and

44
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,440
a great supporter of the show.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,540
It's so good to see you again from the podcast, from his podcast, See Jurassic Right, it's

46
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,500
Stephen Ray Morris.

47
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,640
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,100
I have the spirit of Jimmy with me today, rest in peace.

49
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,360
Oh yeah, wait, describe your shirt because this ties together.

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,420
You know what, you called a shot a while back and I filed it away and it was like well if

51
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,240
you want to do Velocicoaster or Jimmy Buffett's books.

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,520
Yes, oh my god.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,740
And I was like well we got a lot, there's a lot of Buffett in the air right now, we

54
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,520
just did one on club 3.

55
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,320
We'll deal with it all across that bridge when we get to it.

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,820
But the shirt is.

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,040
So yeah, it's basically, it says Jimmy Buffett in this kind of classic font, like the yellow

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,080
greatest hits cover and then there's the T-Rex and it's Jimmy Buff throwing the peace

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,200
sign surrounded by dinosaurs and yeah I don't know, and then it says live from Jurassic

60
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,420
Park so.

61
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
I wish I knew who actually did it but a friend gave it to me for Christmas but I'm sure if

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,740
you look online you'll find it.

63
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,900
Sell it as official merch.

64
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,340
Because look, I think it's probably not official Jimmy Buffett license which I'm not offended

65
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,720
by.

66
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,500
Look dude, I think you should have sent five bucks to a Buffett estate, yes, just because

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,160
to make it fair.

68
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,980
I will, I will.

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,120
Yes, I think they should officially license that shirt.

70
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,320
It's not official because he's not holding two margaritavilles in peril, or two margaritas

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,860
in peril.

72
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,760
Well yeah, of course.

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,140
It's not advertising enough for the other parts of the brand.

74
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,700
That's right.

75
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,900
That's really what I, again, care about as far as.

76
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,020
That was the funniest thing to me about, because obviously in Jurassic World there's the margaritaville

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,800
at the park where you're like this is great, this is like perfectly like in the world of

78
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,460
a real theme park kind of thing.

79
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,580
Exactly what it would be.

80
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,900
It's my favorite thing about those movies that there's a Brookstone and a margaritaville

81
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,420
and an IMAX theater.

82
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,560
It's that detail.

83
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,100
And then in the Fallen Kingdom, the second Jurassic World movie, they literally have

84
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,340
a shot just of the like destroyed margaritaville sign like on the main street when they go

85
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,180
back to the island where they're like, where Frank is just like Frank, Frank Marshall is

86
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,500
just like.

87
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,520
Of course, yes.

88
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,460
On the show, I think it's the first name basis.

89
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,820
You are not the last Frank Marshall reference today.

90
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,440
But it's just like.

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,460
I just love that they just go like, you know, just in case you forgot there was a margaritaville

92
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,540
here at Jurassic World.

93
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,780
It's a big part of the new ones and he's in them.

94
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,080
I feel like canonically, you know, like in real life, Jimmy Buffett was Frank Marshall's

95
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,620
best friend.

96
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,900
But I feel like in the world of the Jurassic film, I feel like narratively, maybe he was

97
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,660
best friends with Dr.

98
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,220
Hammond.

99
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,760
Oh yeah.

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,560
Oh, interesting.

101
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,620
I like the idea.

102
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,520
We go way back.

103
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,900
We're kind of we're both pioneers.

104
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,800
I fired Trap Rock and he pioneered mosquito getting that mosquito goo out.

105
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,180
Yeah, he had crazy idea for a dinosaur park and I thought, hey, maybe let's put poke on

106
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,100
some nachos.

107
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,980
Same deal.

108
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
Two innovators.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,940
But see, then this guy was telling me that I didn't stop to I'm so concerned whether

110
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,360
I could.

111
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,000
I didn't start to think I should.

112
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,720
That guy talked too much.

113
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,480
I gave him a margarita, said relax and he passed out real quick.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,000
Hammond dinosaurs went crazy, started eating people and the poke nachos made a bunch of

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,740
people sick.

116
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,400
Both incidents and accidents.

117
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,040
Hey, the lawyer got eaten and no one was sad about that.

118
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
Am I right, folks?

119
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,800
Oh, man.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,520
Yeah, you're right.

121
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,560
Jimmy would be like, get the lawyer.

122
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,200
I told him if there's a problem there, just run to the nearest thatch bathroom.

123
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,720
It'll hold up.

124
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,700
Get straight there.

125
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,440
Well, yeah, I mean, so excited to get your perspective on this ride.

126
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
Having a podcast all about the Jurassic Park and Jurassic World.

127
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,260
And you, I know that you're a fan of the ride as well.

128
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,200
Seems like you did it a while back.

129
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,660
What were the circumstances of experiencing Velocicoaster?

130
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,920
Well, it's funny because the first, the only time I'd ever been to Orlando was when I was

131
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,320
like it was the year Lion King came out.

132
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,280
Because I just remember because there was tons of pictures of my sister and I just like

133
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,980
covered in Lion King merch.

134
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,700
And at that point, the Jurassic Park ride hadn't, the second park, the adventure one

135
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,580
hadn't been built.

136
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,400
Islands of Adventure.

137
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,720
Thank you, Jason.

138
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,780
It's on his sweater right now.

139
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,600
It's on my sweater.

140
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,900
It's the heaviest, chunkiest sweater I have and it's cold out.

141
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,860
It's a great sweater.

142
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,300
Putting on my chunky islands.

143
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,240
And I think it was that when the Velocicoaster opened, I think that was kind of like an incentive

144
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,340
to want to, you know, especially like I went in August of 2021.

145
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,360
So the ride had only been open for a couple of months and things had only been like part

146
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,860
because Universal here in LA had opened on my birthday in 2021.

147
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,840
So that was like a fun treat to get to go back to.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,900
You did that on your birthday?

149
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,980
Yeah, I did that on my birthday.

150
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,680
Yeah, that weekend.

151
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,600
It was so much fun.

152
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,480
But then I had a friend who, you know, it was like one of those, his dad worked for

153
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,420
the parks or whatever.

154
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,720
It was kind of just like, hey, if you want to come out for a weekend and you can ride,

155
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,400
you know, like again, first time back to Orlando.

156
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,840
And you know, since I was a kid.

157
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,600
So long, oh my God.

158
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,120
Yeah.

159
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,960
And it was, you know, it's one of those things where I'm like, now that my dad lives in Florida,

160
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,920
like anytime I go visit him, I'm like, do you want to go up to Orlando?

161
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,140
Go to like Disney World or Magic Kingdom?

162
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,460
Because like Magic Kingdom didn't exist when I went there the first time.

163
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,300
But yeah, the Velocicoaster was just like, we have to go.

164
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,320
You mean Animal Kingdom, that's a correct answer.

165
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,080
Or Animal Kingdom.

166
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:38,600
No, no.

167
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,520
If anybody was thinking.

168
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,740
No, no, the listeners are going to appreciate that.

169
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,780
But yeah, it was one of those things where it was like, we're basically there.

170
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,140
I mean, because I've written a lot of the other, you know, well, I guess I hadn't written

171
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,360
the Jurassic Park ride there either.

172
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,760
So it was like, kind of just like, we're there for two days.

173
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,060
We're just going to hit up all this stuff.

174
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,540
We did Margaritaville at City Walk Saturday night.

175
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,000
And then Sunday, we went immediately to Velocicoaster, like first thing, because I just,

176
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,480
I felt like at the time, the lines were just so insane.

177
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,980
So it was like, this is the priority.

178
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:16,680
And then very just very luckily, we because of my friend's dad or whatever, like we got

179
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,100
to go ride the ride twice in a row.

180
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,740
Oh, wow.

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,080
Like we still had to get off.

182
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,240
It was one of those kind of things.

183
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:22,760
But sure.

184
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,220
But it was one of those.

185
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,380
I just feel very lucky that I got to do that, like in that way, because I think it's the

186
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,100
greatest roller coaster of all time.

187
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,740
Wow.

188
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,220
Yeah.

189
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,640
Yeah.

190
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,860
I mean, we'll get in.

191
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,640
You guys are the ones to say.

193
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,260
But if you want to plant that flag, do you agree with that statement?

194
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
Is it a viable candidate?

195
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,020
Is that the only reason I would say it's just because I haven't been on like big stuff like

196
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,140
I haven't gone on Tatsu.

197
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,760
I haven't been brave enough to do stuff like that at Six Flags.

198
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,220
So I can't point, you know, anything.

199
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,960
Yeah, I can't say definitively.

200
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,880
But as far as like anything I've been on now, I posed the question is Guardians better than

201
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,100
Velocicoaster's Velocicoaster better than Guardians.

202
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,340
But I think purely from the like again, I think I said this like purely from the experience

203
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,880
my body is having, the way I'm handled, as I said on the Guardians episode, I think,

204
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,820
yeah, it's the best coaster I've ever been on.

205
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,820
Absolutely.

206
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,300
Yeah.

207
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,500
As far as like thrills, you know, because I like, you know, Transformers and, you know,

208
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,180
Rise of the Resistance and the Hagrid one, like those are all innovative in all these

209
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,060
different cool ways.

210
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,200
But like just as like a regular roller coaster, I feel like it's my favorite at least.

211
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,680
Yeah.

212
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,140
And it seems like there's I bet there are rides with that put up the stats more like

213
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,400
the amount of inversions, the speed, the height, whatever.

214
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm sure Velocicoaster is topped in those in technical regards.

215
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,720
But I bet on in coasters that aren't as well kept up, that aren't as high tech, that don't

216
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,020
have the like kind of the like narrative build, it seems like.

217
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:17,140
Because it feels like this thing, it's not one of those roller coasters where like the

218
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,080
big thing it does is at the top and then the rest is kind of like a wind around and it's

219
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,520
all fun.

220
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,440
But you kind of like did the big thing.

221
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,340
Like this thing has like beginning, middle end.

222
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,440
There's like two big almost magic tricks in this that caught me so off guard.

223
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,060
Yeah.

224
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,720
What are you considering?

225
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:47,140
The second launch, the launch up the top hat and then the very end barrel roll over the

226
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,560
water.

227
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,720
me what that would be like going over the water upside down.

228
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,760
Well, you were in such a port of entry fog.

229
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,960
It's tough to focus.

230
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,920
I was in the port of entry fog.

231
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,360
Just like because you don't you don't just like grab that Cinnabon and go.

232
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,380
You sit, you take 75 minutes with it, knife and fork it.

233
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,620
Yeah, I got to hear the whole loop when the loop repeats.

234
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,400
And whoever you're with, like the piccolo, hear the piccolo.

235
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,280
Yeah, that's like me when I hear like Eve Six playing in a bar.

236
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,060
Everybody stop everything.

237
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,280
A very rare piece of music is playing right now.

238
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,880
That's like I was there was some karaoke and then they did the Mulan I'll Make a Man

239
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,880
Out of You and like the entire bar just like erupted.

240
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,060
It was like, oh, everyone here is like between the ages of 35 and like 45.

241
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,380
Like we look like I just for the first I just saw some Disney Christmas parade.

242
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,340
I'd never seen where Donny Osmond performs it.

243
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,020
Oh, yeah.

244
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,480
Whoa.

245
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,900
Seeing the face, putting the face to the voice, Mr.

246
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,340
Isle, the most pronounced nobody's ever pronounced.

247
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,760
I use it so much.

248
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,300
Make a man.

249
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,300
All right.

250
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,680
I want to start singing it.

251
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,560
Go for it.

252
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,360
Take it out of you.

253
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,220
Of the moon.

254
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,480
Those big man.

255
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,240
OK.

256
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,280
What you were saying about that second launch, I didn't realize this.

257
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,060
The second launch isn't as fast as the first launch, but it makes you feel like it is.

258
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:18,820
Well, yeah.

259
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,740
No, you do go.

260
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,480
It's not as fast on the launch, but you end up going fast.

261
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:24,900
Sure.

262
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,660
But the launch itself isn't faster than the first launch.

263
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,840
I know what I saw.

264
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,180
Well, because first launches, I saw conflicting things.

265
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,460
Zero to 50 or zero to 55 miles per hour.

266
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,100
Yeah.

267
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,380
Second launch, you go from 40, 70 miles an hour.

268
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
To get you down that hill.

269
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,400
It's not going.

270
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,600
It's not zero to that different sensation.

271
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,140
Right.

272
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,660
But I feel like that's why, like, Jason, you're you're so right about that.

273
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,400
Just because it's like I think I'm I think since I've started

274
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,860
getting back into going to theme parks again and stuff, you know,

275
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,860
for I guess for a listener to remind you of like I worked at Disneyland in high school,

276
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,860
you know, so I like.

277
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:00,860
Right.

278
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,220
But like one of those things where it was I just didn't really like

279
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,500
I didn't look ahead or anything.

280
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,540
And it was that kind of thing.

281
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,980
We were like, I'm going as fast as I've ever or feeling like I've

282
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,600
fast as I've ever gone on a roller coaster.

283
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,360
And then you then the second launch happens and you're just like, oh, my.

284
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,280
Like, there's that feeling like when you're on the ride that you're like,

285
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,520
how is it even possible?

286
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,320
Like they're they're just going to send a shooting off like a old like

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,420
roller coaster tycoon like when you're a kid and you just make the most.

288
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,440
Yeah, you just make the roller coaster just go off and then all the,

289
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,180
you know, all the people on the ride just fly off into the park or whatever.

290
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:34,680
Yeah.

291
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,860
And then they just then somebody nails a sign up.

292
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,560
Some little SIM guy took this ride is not safe.

293
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah.

294
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,200
Let's just let's step back.

295
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,980
Make sure we've said some basics here.

296
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,800
This is a fairly new attraction at Universal's Islands of Adventure

297
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,180
and the Jurassic Park area, obviously open June 10th, 2021.

298
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,000
I think let me read their official literature and say that it is

299
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,300
the apex predator of roller coasters.

300
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,380
We can agree on this statement, can we not?

301
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,980
Yeah, yeah.

302
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,440
That's what I was going to say.

303
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,220
But yeah, this is it is like it is a gigantic,

304
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,580
record breaking, highest of tech, highest of thrills, roller coaster

305
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:18,940
in which the just the premise it in the world.

306
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
It is a roller coaster.

307
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,820
It's not like we're abstractly representing

308
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,960
like the way some things are like it's sure it's on a track,

309
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,660
you're supposed to think that you are on the flight of a dragon or something.

310
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:30,780
Right.

311
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,380
Or you are a raptor or something.

312
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:32,880
Yes.

313
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,080
Because I wasn't sure about that, having again, not gone on it myself.

314
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,740
But it is in it is like you're in the world of of Jurassic World.

315
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,280
And they have opened a roller coaster that goes in and out of a velociraptor

316
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,100
paddock to simulate the thrill of the hunt.

317
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,280
Is this a fair summation?

318
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:54,780
Yes.

319
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,160
And Claire and Owen are having a big argument about it in the pre show.

320
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,940
Just like Frank, first name basis.

321
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,740
Claire and Owen, we know them.

322
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,760
We love our favorite characters from the Jurassic Park movies.

323
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,360
Of course.

324
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,700
Well, Owen Grady and Claire Dearing, let's say they're

325
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:08,700
a few.

326
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,660
I'm too.

327
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,420
Thank you, Jason.

328
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,700
Jason, you just wasted five seconds that we didn't need

329
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,140
because the audience knows those last names.

330
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,620
We know the Dearing legacy.

331
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,260
We know.

332
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,640
Well, look, you know, there's different age groups, you know, older people.

333
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,300
They think the star of the Jurassic.

334
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,640
It's Alan Grant.

335
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,400
But the younger generation, they know Owen Grady.

336
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,000
That's true.

337
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,160
Yeah.

338
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,540
Well, we know the correct answer,

339
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,320
which is that Alan Grant doesn't fucking matter anymore.

340
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,860
It's about Claire Dearing.

341
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,740
End of story.

342
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,520
Yeah, that's right.

343
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:35,980
Amen.

344
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,560
Even I know Alan Grant came back in the last one, but I didn't pay attention.

345
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,280
I closed my eyes until Claire was.

346
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,740
I heard about it and I was mad.

347
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,040
So why do they bring these olds back?

348
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,280
You know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

349
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,660
These dinosaurs, these aren't the kind of dinosaurs I want to see.

350
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,100
Exactly.

351
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,920
But yeah, I think another big notable thing about it is that this is,

352
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,360
you know, we've had Jurassic Park, the ride for a long time,

353
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,000
which then opened an island's adventure is Jurassic Park River Adventure.

354
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,820
And there's other like the international parks have versions of that.

355
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,720
But this is the first major

356
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,920
Jurassic Park attraction that is not in the river format.

357
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,260
Right.

358
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,340
It is the first one to open, at least, that breaks us out

359
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,140
and cracks open the entire world of other Jurassic.

360
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,440
I know there was Pteranodon flyers, but I mean like big old, you know.

361
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:29,760
Right.

362
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,260
Well, there's the there's the one in which one is it overseas?

363
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,200
There's a new Jurassic.

364
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,700
The rapids one.

365
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,700
No, no, no.

366
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,400
It's like in a scoop vehicle.

367
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,960
Yeah, where they chase you.

368
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,640
Beijing.

369
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,060
Beijing.

370
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,980
Yeah, that's where that is.

371
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,780
That is, I think, just called Jurassic World Adventure.

372
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,040
Do you know about this, Steven?

373
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,980
Do you know about this crazy ride?

374
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,100
I think I've watched maybe a video of it once,

375
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,500
but it is hard when you're like looking at theme parks that are so far away

376
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,180
and you're just like, well, I don't know.

377
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,540
I don't like I don't want to get too sad

378
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,320
that I'm probably not going to be able to go any time soon, you know.

379
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,400
Yeah, Beijing is a difficult trip to do for sure.

380
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,600
But like it is it's nuts.

381
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,480
It makes me this is also like it makes me so happy that

382
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,840
we're not just sticking with one Jurassic ride because.

383
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,780
Yeah, you're right.

384
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,480
It's the Spider-Man ride vehicle.

385
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:17,960
Yeah.

386
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,200
But you see you're in and out of screens, but there are a lot of practical dinosaurs.

387
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,200
There's one big set piece that's pretty crazy.

388
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,640
That's a big robot.

389
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,300
Spoiler alert.

390
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,460
There's a big T-Rex, I think, in Dominus.

391
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,240
In Dominus.

392
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,040
I'm so sorry.

393
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,400
It's in Dominus.

394
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,640
I have an indominus toy in the house now, thanks to the kiddos.

395
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,740
You know more dinosaurs.

396
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,680
I'm more indominus focused at the moment.

397
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,980
So, yeah, but it's like they make it look like it's truly walking toward you.

398
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,740
Well, that's like at Universal here.

399
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,100
It's the at the end of the Jurassic World ride, the redo.

400
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,820
Because I think when it first opened, it was kind of just like sitting in the corner,

401
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,580
just like roaring.

402
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,040
But like now it actually is under a tent of some kind.

403
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Yeah.

404
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,380
Yeah.

405
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:01,380
OK.

406
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:01,700
Yeah.

407
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,040
When it opened, it was like, I think, yeah, 2019.

408
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,740
It was just like it was kind of like, ah, and you're like, OK,

409
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,240
it's not anywhere near us.

410
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,360
We're not going to be in danger.

411
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,280
But now it actually like walks up right up to the edge where the

412
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,680
T-Rex swings out because the Dominus is sort of just hanging out.

413
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,380
And then the T-Rex still swoops in.

414
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,660
So they have like a snoot off the snoot's touch.

415
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,980
And then they get one of these animals you refer to as having snoots.

416
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,600
It can't all be snoots.

417
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,960
People are pointing out turtles don't have snoots.

418
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,180
It's not well, they have a beak.

419
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,480
Beaks is it?

420
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:34,920
Yeah.

421
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,040
Not every animal on the planet has a snoot.

422
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,420
I know you love saying the word, but at some point I got to call you out.

423
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,620
Look, I think it's cute that this endominus is a snoot.

424
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,400
I just think it's a fictional animal, so it could have a good

425
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,400
idea.

426
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,740
It could be a hybrid.

427
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,420
I mean, it's like the like again, from when I went to Disney World as a kid,

428
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,360
my sister got the Simba and Nala that have the magnets in their nose.

429
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,060
We had those.

430
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,280
The plushes.

431
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:00,880
Really?

432
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,020
I don't know that.

433
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,600
That's cute.

434
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,160
Yeah, we had those.

435
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:03,640
Yeah.

436
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,900
I wonder if maybe they.

437
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,240
Yeah, probably on eBay or something.

438
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,420
But like, yeah, now they need to make an endominus and the T-Rex

439
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,660
with magnets and their snoot.

440
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,760
Yeah, so they.

441
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,280
Yes, that's good.

442
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,200
They're trying to bash heads.

443
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,320
They're trying to fight.

444
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,660
But once they get close, they realize they're in love.

445
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,540
Enemies to lovers.

446
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,620
Yeah, that's cute.

447
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,100
So, yeah, this thing, that thing in Beijing, though, it's like

448
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,880
I think it's on like a turntable of some kind.

449
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,340
So it must be like you are and it is.

450
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,260
So they're just or you're going.

451
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,220
I don't know how it works, but you're going like kind of backwards

452
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,140
and they're turning it.

453
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,740
So it really makes like the full sized body of the dinosaur

454
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,900
kind of like lumbering toward you.

455
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,240
It's crazy on video.

456
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,660
It's it sells in the video and I'm sure in person it's 200 percent.

457
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,920
Yeah, better to.

458
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,140
It's nuts.

459
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,020
So this all makes me happy that the Jurassic World films have been successful

460
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,480
because it juices up the parks.

461
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,440
We get new stuff in the parks and it feels like they really reinvested

462
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,320
in the franchise theme park wise, which this makes it to me.

463
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,420
This is the epitome of franchise.

464
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,900
I'm iffy about, but who cares?

465
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,820
I want my rides.

466
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,820
Give me rides.

467
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,320
So it's it's it's it's fine.

468
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,500
Steven, where do you land on these with your pocket?

469
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,360
What I imagine you love the first movie very much.

470
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,700
Where do you fall on Jurassic World as opposed to?

471
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,860
Well, yeah, I mean, it's

472
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,400
I was like, I'm invested in liking them to some extent.

473
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,040
But I also think I kind of think Chris Pratt was like

474
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,060
I think he was kind of miscast in the movies a little bit

475
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,460
because I feel like they were kind of, you know, because

476
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,940
Guardians and Jurassic World came out like around the same time

477
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,020
or within like a year of each.

478
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,700
I think Guardians was 2014 and they were like,

479
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,380
oh, well, Chris Pratt is sassy in that movie.

480
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,620
So we kind of have to make him like a dour

481
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,500
Werner Herzog character in the Jurassic World movies, where he's like,

482
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,760
everything is, you know, even even in the ride video for a velocity coaster,

483
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,840
he's like, we're all going to die.

484
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,980
Like, you know, you're a bunch of idiots like that kind of stuff.

485
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,900
He's severe in this.

486
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,300
Yes.

487
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,420
And then they've kind of had to pivot away from that a little bit.

488
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,260
And I mean, you know, I think Jason Clarke,

489
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,100
I think would have been a better fit for the Jurassic World movies.

490
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,200
I think just a little bit weirder, a little more eccentric.

491
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,900
But I mean, you know, I like them because I like seeing dinosaurs, you know,

492
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,020
it's kind of like the thrill of that.

493
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,020
And I did like the last movie a lot, if only just because it reminded me

494
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,840
more of like a Michael Crichton novel where it's like dinosaurs.

495
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,340
Sure, whatever.

496
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,280
But like Locust.

497
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,900
Like, that's where we're that's like the interesting part, right?

498
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,340
And we're like, I guess.

499
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,240
But I'm I'm down for it.

500
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,800
I'm down for more Laura Dern getting to kick ass.

501
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,300
So I'm grateful for the last one, that last one just for that.

502
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,400
But yeah, I mean, you know, they're enjoyable and I like seeing dinosaurs

503
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,980
and stuff.

504
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,540
But yeah, that's how it's like.

505
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,140
You're at least getting, yeah, a bunch of new.

506
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,500
I like you know what I feel like about that first one is like there's so much.

507
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,240
It's like I like so many things about it.

508
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,400
I like the Margaritaville and the Brooks.

509
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,260
I like the mall.

510
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,660
And then I like the the spheres that were the gyrospheres.

511
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,100
What is it called?

512
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,680
Yeah, yeah.

513
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,180
I like those.

514
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,320
And I like Indominus.

515
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,700
And I like the I like that it's like the version that worked.

516
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,800
And then that one goes awry.

517
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,360
And then and then it just doesn't add up into.

518
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah, I like every piece.

519
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,340
And then it doesn't like coalesce into something that super works for me.

520
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,820
But hey, that's I don't know.

521
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,620
There's big movies that don't even have pieces that I like.

522
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,260
So that's something I like.

523
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,060
Jake Johnson, but vintage Jurassic Park merchandise.

524
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,100
That's very relatable to me.

525
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,400
But yeah, I liked him as comic relief.

526
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,080
You know, Jurassic World and Transformers.

527
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,480
It's like, yeah, they might not be my favorite movies.

528
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,120
Great for a ride.

529
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,780
Great for a five to six minute, you know, experience with like

530
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,320
factoring in ride time and queue time.

531
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,780
You know, the only thing I would say is with right in regards to the rides is like,

532
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,380
I don't love the aesthetic of Jurassic World as much as the original.

533
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,820
And I don't think that's nostalgia.

534
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,120
It's a little cold.

535
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,960
Jurassic World is a little cold because they do recreate sort of the like

536
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,340
gray blue aesthetic for Velocicoaster.

537
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,560
Yeah, I kind of I'm surprised that I like it.

538
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,020
And now I think I said on an episode recently, like getting to go on

539
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,700
original Jurassic Park, the ride or river adventure there with its yellows

540
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,340
and reds and kind of 90s primaries.

541
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,180
I liked it, but I also kind of it's more it's more generic.

542
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,260
It feels like other franchises have those colors.

543
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,540
But I think like I think the colors of all these all these new things

544
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,120
and especially Velocicoaster are pretty cool.

545
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,720
I don't know why.

546
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,900
I'm like I'm surprised I'm for getting a little cold.

547
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,640
That's all.

548
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,640
Well, I'm not against it.

549
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,800
I think that's by design.

550
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,520
Yeah, it's almost that thing of like in the 90s, they were like,

551
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,940
what does the San Diego Zoo look like in 1991?

552
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,740
And then we're going to, you know, for 1993.

553
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,960
And then now it's like we're looking at zoos and, you know, because I watched

554
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,060
behind the scenes video for the roller coaster and like they hired a person

555
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:19,600
who designed like zoo habitats to do all the to do all the stuff.

556
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,600
Yeah, Velocicoaster like the plants and rock work and stuff.

557
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,920
Yeah, that is to like that's the logic of like it is.

558
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,120
If it's a Velociraptor paddock, then we're we need to make it feel

559
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,140
as natural as possible, like build it to them so that they don't feel like they're.

560
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,360
And just even the aesthetic of how we do stuff now where it is that thing.

561
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,920
Like, I feel like you guys talked about before.

562
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,680
It's like with, you know, with the Star Wars line and stuff where it's like

563
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,100
sometimes the devotion to making it logically sound maybe isn't always

564
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,840
the most exciting, you know, because you miss some fun.

565
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,280
Yeah, yeah, because you're like, this is a theme park.

566
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,100
We can kind of do whatever, you know.

567
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,260
And yeah, I think like a big part of the Jurassic World stuff

568
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,960
is making it feel like a real zoo to some extent.

569
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,360
Sure.

570
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,680
But yeah, it's like mileage may vary on how enjoyable this aesthetic is.

571
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,840
You're right, though, that original Jurassic Park feels like San Diego.

572
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,720
Wait, and it was what it was going to open in San Diego and Lost World.

573
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,060
Yeah, yeah.

574
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,760
I like that.

575
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,820
I was going through the T-rex going through the town is so silly,

576
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,700
but pretty fun.

577
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,620
Yeah, I had a Cadillac chase.

578
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,020
Yeah, I love that.

579
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,880
And the downtown Burbank, you know, it's downtown Burbank.

580
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,140
I figured that out.

581
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,800
Yeah.

582
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,340
Like that's the I think it's a lot of things that aren't open,

583
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,800
but like the blockbuster that gets crashed into.

584
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,180
And yeah, every time I'm in look, I'm already happy if I'm in downtown Burbank.

585
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,780
When I realize I sometimes will go like, wow, Lost World.

586
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,500
Yeah, yeah.

587
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,560
You're like you're like a bunch of weird mechanical things

588
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,700
rip down this telephone pole, you know, this big telephone pole.

589
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,200
Uh huh.

590
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,960
Yeah, they they went this street down.

591
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,660
This is probably closed for days.

592
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,660
And the Lost World, I haven't watched Lost World forever.

593
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,640
And I didn't love it when I saw it for the first time.

594
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,580
I only seen it once.

595
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,420
But people were talking about Mission Impossible Seven with the big train

596
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,020
sequence and people like, oh, that's so cool or whatever.

597
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,860
And people like Lost World did that type of thing first,

598
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,600
where the thing was falling off the cliff.

599
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,580
Oh, yeah, yeah.

600
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,280
It was not it was a trailer.

601
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,540
It was not a train in the movie.

602
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,500
But there was a very similar scene of like trying to climb up

603
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,440
and get out of it.

604
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,160
Oh, that's me out so much when I saw that at like 12.

605
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,480
The hanging off the cliff.

606
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:26,820
Yeah.

607
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,560
And Julian Moore, it's like like she's on the glass as it's like.

608
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

609
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:31,920
And stuff.

610
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,120
That sound design is so yeah.

611
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,980
So you're either that sticks with you.

612
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,300
Filmed on the Universal Hollywood parking garages.

613
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,480
I always loved that.

614
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,380
Yeah, that was a fun.

615
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,180
That was a good time to be here and go into the

616
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,200
going on the tram tour like when Lost World was still a big presence.

617
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,780
Because now I feel like they kind of got a makeup that they're still doing big

618
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,220
things and that they aren't just burning it slowly into more theme park.

619
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,860
Or that like, I don't know.

620
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,200
Well, look, shows film in that soundstage.

621
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,540
But nobody ever goes to the back lot anymore.

622
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,300
But post Lost World, you could really there was an energy.

623
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,260
You could really work there when you did like the tram tour and stuff was that

624
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,480
because I feel like one of before I got a pass as an adult,

625
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,020
one of the last times I had been there, I'd been around when Jurassic Park

626
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,180
three had come out and there was like some sets and stuff, I feel like, from the

627
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,880
both of those movies.

628
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,900
We didn't go near him.

629
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,320
It was very like an over there is some Lost World stuff.

630
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,040
Anyway, now, where are the world's let's

631
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,300
or maybe it was right after War of the Worlds.

632
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,300
Yeah.

633
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,360
But you know, but there's still the drive through where the Raptors.

634
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,300
No, it's I was going to say Raptors spit at you.

635
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
Oh, that's a lot of sources.

636
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,020
That's not correct.

637
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:40,580
Yeah, yeah.

638
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,400
A lot of sources.

639
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,660
I need to I need to run some like dinosaur flashcards or something.

640
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,180
It'll get my son is into.

641
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,620
Yeah, I was going to say, as he got as the boy gets older, it'll come.

642
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,060
Yeah.

643
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,380
Yeah.

644
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,600
Yeah.

645
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:51,800
Yes.

646
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,360
He's not in the dinosaur phase.

647
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,680
No, he's pretty big in dinosaur and he'll ask what things are.

648
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,580
What's this one's name?

649
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,820
I don't.

650
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,780
But he now he's now he's just

651
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,680
it makes you feel like it was such a dumb 2020s.

652
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,980
Like, use your phone.

653
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,140
Check your phone.

654
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,580
There's been so many discoveries since we were kids in the 90s.

655
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,320
There's been so many different discoveries about dinosaurs and stuff.

656
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,420
So whatever you might have retained might not be wrong.

657
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:20,860
Yeah.

658
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,360
Yeah.

659
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,660
I use what's in my head.

660
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,560
Yeah, it's incorrect.

661
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,480
The pluto's of dinosaur world, you know, what are the things that have changed?

662
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:27,920
You know?

663
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,400
Oh, yeah.

664
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,900
Well, aren't we way more aware of the birdlike qualities

665
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,540
and then that they had feathers like that feels post our child?

666
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah.

667
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,260
Yeah.

668
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,140
Or more popularized post our childhood.

669
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,560
And then and then like the Brontosaurus keeps going back and forth

670
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,060
where it's like it wasn't a real dinosaur.

671
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,660
Now people are like, well, we'll take this other skeleton

672
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,900
that doesn't have a name and put Brontosaurus because we all grew up

673
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,640
with that being a dinosaur.

674
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,540
Wait, this is.

675
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,480
Oh, I didn't know that.

676
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,920
Brontosaurus isn't wasn't real.

677
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,620
I knew that.

678
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,140
But they've renamed a different skeleton.

679
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,900
People have been trying to.

680
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,840
And then interesting.

681
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,940
And then like triceratops might not be its own thing anymore.

682
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,080
Or like they might be combining it with like Torvosaurus.

683
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,760
Like I'm also like, I mean, you know, I interview paleontologists

684
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,160
sometimes on my podcast, and it's always like I also Jason,

685
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,920
I feel the same way.

686
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,180
Sometimes I'm like, oh, is my knowledge just from when all the dinosaur

687
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,720
dictionaries I had as a kid, like I actually probably should be brushing up

688
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,040
more on what's what's going on now, because there is stuff like that

689
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,860
where it's like discovering new things and they're like, well, actually,

690
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,720
these five skeletons, like all the scientists were drunk in the 1800s.

691
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,300
So like we actually got to like combine everything together

692
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,160
because like all that all the paleontologists, it's such a trip.

693
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,320
There's I forget there's a podcast where they talk about

694
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,920
the bone wars, where it was like all these paleontologists

695
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,220
mad that the others were discovering stuff so they would like destroy each other.

696
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,020
It was like scientists were insane in the 1800s.

697
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,260
The bone wars.

698
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,800
Yeah.

699
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,780
Oh my God.

700
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,740
Well, it turns out the spitters didn't really spit.

701
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,040
They just kind of drool.

702
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,340
It just kind of dripped.

703
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,600
They'd have to get directly over top of their prey.

704
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:02,980
Yeah.

705
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,080
It wasn't acid.

706
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,600
No, it was just nasty.

707
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,200
It was just nasty little spit.

708
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,420
Yeah.

709
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,220
Yeah, it was a xenomorph, you know.

710
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,860
Yeah.

711
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,860
What's the one I need to file this one away for future kid time?

712
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,840
What's the one that has that's it's almost the only way I can describe it is like it's bald.

713
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,300
Oh, Pachycephalosaurus.

714
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:23,900
Oh, OK.

715
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,160
Great.

716
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,320
Great.

717
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,000
That sounds familiar.

718
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,760
I think I looked that up.

719
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,360
It's a Pachycephalosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus.

720
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,540
Because people also eat in the lost world.

721
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,420
He's trying to pronounce the name.

722
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,380
He's like, he's like, Pachy, Pachy.

723
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,860
He's like the one with the bald spot, Friar Tuck.

724
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,640
Oh, wow.

725
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,420
OK.

726
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,000
So my knowledge is exactly in line with a guy who hates dinosaurs

727
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,640
and is trying to hunt them.

728
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,600
Yes, exactly.

729
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,720
I'm also getting can I ask also, like, is there any truth to

730
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,240
the notion that dinosaurs are some of them were little and cute

731
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,180
and all live on a dude ranch with a bunch of plucky kids,

732
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:02,480
which is the case on the show that my son watches all the time called Dino Ranch.

733
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,920
It's a Disney plus show, but I think was bought from Canada.

734
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,640
Dino Ranch.

735
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,540
Anybody with toddlers out there.

736
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,080
Dino Ranch is a show.

737
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,820
This is the highest endorsement I could give it in terms of toddler

738
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,400
entertainment that doesn't make me want to claw my eyes out.

739
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
It's not a cocoa melon.

740
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,180
Yes.

741
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,480
No, we've never that's never entered our home.

742
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,420
I don't want it to.

743
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,600
Maybe I'd like it more than it.

744
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,260
But I just I feel like I hear things.

745
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,260
I've heard things.

746
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,520
I don't want this cocoa milk.

747
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,060
Yeah, it seems like people start to like glaze over just like those bad CGI

748
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,720
models or whatever they use.

749
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,080
Yeah.

750
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:33,560
Yeah.

751
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,360
Yeah, I think so.

752
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,260
Yeah, that seems like we're parent madness centers.

753
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,300
But Dino Ranch is not camp.

754
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,480
Where is it?

755
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,640
Tertaceous, which is the official Jurassic Jurassic,

756
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,180
which plays, I believe, in the child swap room of this ride.

757
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,680
Oh, really?

758
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,260
Oh, cool.

759
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,760
Family room.

760
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Yeah.

761
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,960
Great idea.

762
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,360
Well, yeah, bringing that up to it's, you know, talking about like

763
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,400
the Jurassic World franchise, creating opportunities for rides and stuff.

764
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,560
It is interesting that or the most interesting aspect is the open theme park.

765
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,280
So they've gone back to that well twice now with the when they redid

766
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,280
the Jurassic World ride or the Jurassic Park ride in Universal.

767
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,720
And then now for Velocicoaster, they're like, OK, who cares about volcano

768
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,920
dinosaurs coming to mainland?

769
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,420
Like, let's like let's sit in the open theme park.

770
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,160
Let's make Bryce Dallas Howard wear that or, you know, cut her hair again

771
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,300
to be that bob, you know, severe.

772
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:25,860
Yes.

773
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,180
In the pantsuit, in the heels.

774
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,680
Yeah.

775
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,560
That was a question I had is like, I guess by

776
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,740
just by virtue of timeline,

777
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,520
Velocicoaster and Jurassic World, the ride

778
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,460
must be happening before the shit really hits the fan.

779
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,540
Like the it maybe happens before those kids come

780
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,940
and then get with the babysitter and then everything goes haywire.

781
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:49,420
Yeah.

782
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:49,580
Right.

783
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,020
So it's so you're on rides that happen

784
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,620
maybe like a week or two before Jurassic World, the movie.

785
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,320
Yeah, I think that's I mean, I think unlike Star Wars with all the,

786
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,740
you know, the all the detail oriented chess that they're doing,

787
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,100
I think with Jurassic World, it's very much Collins just kind of like,

788
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,760
just, you know, takes place around the same time as the movie,

789
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,320
obviously before the movie.

790
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,840
And that even like the whole discussion of like that movie is like now

791
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,080
labeled as a post Christmas movie, which is a weird really to be in.

792
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,180
Because in the beginning, they it's like snow.

793
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,700
And at the airport, you can see like Christmas trees and stuff.

794
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,420
OK.

795
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,840
So maybe.

796
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,380
Have I never seen the beginning?

797
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,900
Did I get to the theater late?

798
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,780
That is possible.

799
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,420
I've seen it.

800
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,300
I just don't remember.

801
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,140
Yes.

802
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,420
Yeah.

803
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:35,960
Because I was.

804
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,220
Yeah, I had a hook up for free fat burger.

805
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,580
So I was prioritizing that.

806
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,020
I'm like, I think I'll pick up the I'll get the gist of Jurassic

807
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,220
World when I get there.

808
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,760
I mean, it's very slight.

809
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,980
It's like one of those things really, I think in one scene.

810
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,260
And and I think in the when

811
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,500
Ty Simpkins is like he's like playing with this Christmas presence

812
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,220
or something like in the opening scene of the movie or something.

813
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,120
It's very slight.

814
00:34:59,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Yeah.

815
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,140
I was just this actually.

816
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,920
Can I ask a quick question about your preference

817
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,780
with the original Jurassic Park ride or the new?

818
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,300
Do you have feelings on that strong feelings or mild feelings?

819
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,860
I mean, I I was very lucky that I had the opportunity

820
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,400
or just didn't have work that day that I went on the very last day

821
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,180
of the original Jurassic Park right here in L.

822
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,320
A.

823
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,240
I was there almost like all day, just like riding the ride as much as possible.

824
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,060
OK, because I was just like like, sure.

825
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,180
Again, it's one of those weird things where it's like, especially in L.

826
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,300
A.

827
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,300
,

828
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,820
it's like, when are we going to be here when a new ride opens and when like a clout?

829
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,980
Like, I don't remember when Back to the Future closed.

830
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,820
Like I like even though I grew up here, like I don't remember

831
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,880
when that ride closed or or backdraft.

832
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,060
Right backdraft was here in L.

833
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,360
A.

834
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,200
, right?

835
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:44,860
Yeah.

836
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,140
Yeah.

837
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,460
Yeah.

838
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,140
Not in that long.

839
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:46,660
Yeah.

840
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,900
And it was just like one of those things where it's like, oh, my gosh,

841
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,540
I'm like here when like a historic thing is like this.

842
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,400
Yeah, it's like here in L.

843
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,900
A.

844
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
, we don't have that many rides.

845
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,020
And it is weird.

846
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,540
There's not always a lot of like history, especially universal.

847
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,080
Yes, right.

848
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,260
Yeah, they're just like starting to get there

849
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,300
where things have been open for decades now.

850
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:03,720
Yeah.

851
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,920
And it is one of the things you're right, where it's like

852
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,260
the only reason they didn't turn this into like a Minions River

853
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,660
adventure or something, you know, was because the Jurassic World franchise

854
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,960
ended up being a surprise, you know, hit.

855
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:17,620
Yeah.

856
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,740
The first one like did like almost like double the productions

857
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,420
opening weekend or something crazy where they were like, it's, you know,

858
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,360
it's just going to be fine.

859
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,700
People like dinosaurs or whatever.

860
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,620
And they're like, no, actually, people want to see these movies again,

861
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,660
even if they're not great.

862
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,580
It was like, all right, cool.

863
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,480
We can reinvest in the parks and, you know, do all that.

864
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
It's crazy to me that Velocicoaster was only built in like three years

865
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,620
or something like that.

866
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,800
We're like, yeah, like because Jurassic World comes out in June of 2015.

867
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,500
And like maybe they were thinking about another ride before that.

868
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,520
But like it's just like thinking about how long it takes Disneyland to do stuff

869
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,980
where you're like Velocicoaster, like great, we need a new roller coaster.

870
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,240
And then like, yeah, and like we've been saying

871
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,740
like, I think I think listeners are probably pretty aware of the extreme

872
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,180
length of Guardians and Tron, especially.

873
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,020
And like, yeah, they they jam this thing together.

874
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,720
It feels like I'm excited because they just they've broken ground

875
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,860
on the coast of their building out here, which the rumor is it's similar to this

876
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,340
and similar to Guardians in a way as well.

877
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,840
But they're building on the side of the mountain.

878
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,520
It's Fast and Furious.

879
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,100
It's not.

880
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,720
Oh, yeah.

881
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,360
The animal show was right.

882
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,720
Yes.

883
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,520
But I'm like, are they going to finish this in seven months?

884
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Like there's so fast at building stuff.

885
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,200
We'll see.

886
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,160
But yeah, so like I do like the Jurassic World ride.

887
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,560
I feel like you guys have talked before about like that notion that,

888
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,500
you know, universal, it's like, oh, we're having a great day.

889
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,780
Oh, no, something's wrong.

890
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,020
Like, you know, yeah, like we're we're, you know, in the tomb.

891
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:47,000
And then it's like he lives and you know, like the Jurassic World ride,

892
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I feel like is like a little bit weirder in the fact that something goes wrong

893
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,220
kind of like right away now.

894
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,880
So you don't have time to have like the peaceful lagoon part.

895
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,180
You're like, oh, God, Mosasaur, you know.

896
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,200
And then you kind of go back to that.

897
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,760
I miss what's the what's the cove that is it Moses or had your sword?

898
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,680
Had your sword code is the one that you never get to go in.

899
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,700
You get knocked off the path.

900
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,260
So that part of like in terms of the flow of the ride is like a little disrupted

901
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,480
in that way because you're like Mosasaur tank, which looks amazing.

902
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,380
And then you go back to kind of like.

903
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,100
Mosasaur is the underwater.

904
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,680
Yes.

905
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:22,940
OK.

906
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,480
The whale dinosaur thing is that real?

907
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,920
Yes, that's that's real.

908
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,180
Yeah.

909
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,340
And they were that big.

910
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:28,700
Yeah.

911
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,180
Wow.

912
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,180
OK, crazy.

913
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,740
Yeah.

914
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,460
They might the size may have been exaggerated a little bit, but

915
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,140
Mosasaur eats the woman in the first Jurassic World.

916
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,620
Yeah, she gets dropped in her mouth.

917
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,060
Right.

918
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,200
The brutal death.

919
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,500
Yeah.

920
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,500
My favorite.

921
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,020
And I'm glad she was on her iPhone too much.

922
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,960
Yeah, they're like she wasn't babysitting well enough.

923
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,900
That's always like because Jurassic Park hates lawyers and Jurassic World is like,

924
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,520
well, we hate personal assistance.

925
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,880
You know, like you're like, oh, jeez, I don't like, you know, again, being in 2015,

926
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,940
they're like, you know, trying to make it in L.

927
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,040
A.

928
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,740
and really like, oh, like I know, like

929
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,140
she punished in a way for Bryce Dallas Howard sins.

930
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,700
Is it like, oh, she like the nephews come and she doesn't.

931
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,000
She's so busy with her extremely complicated park that she runs

932
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,560
that she doesn't put a proper childcare person in charge or spend the time with them.

933
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:19,920
Maybe.

934
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Yeah.

935
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Yeah.

936
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,960
Should is doesn't I've just I've seen the reading of this movie that it's like

937
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,580
like this ambitious woman fucker for her.

938
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:35,160
Like there's something kind of you might you might be able to read into a lot of the work of your director.

939
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,100
Oh, OK.

940
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,780
There's some odd feelings.

941
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,660
Interesting.

942
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,280
Yeah.

943
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:39,680
Yeah.

944
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,160
My favorite bit of fan art that somebody's done is

945
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,280
it's because, you know, the endominus also gets eaten by the Mosasaur at the very end.

946
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,640
Oh, yeah.

947
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:47,980
Yeah.

948
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:53,080
There's like it's it's Katie McGrath's character, the Pteranodon that also gets swallowed with her

949
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,240
and the endominus all like playing cards like next to a campfire in the stomach of the Mosasaur.

950
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,180
I forget what that originally a reference to, but I just really like that idea

951
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,660
that they're all like, oh, all the things that have been eaten are like, you know, it's like Pinocchio.

952
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,060
Oh, yeah.

953
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:07,220
Yeah.

954
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,360
Yeah.

955
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,240
They got a couple of days.

956
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,380
It's going to be that's going to be a slow dissolve.

957
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:10,700
Yeah.

958
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,660
It's going to take three weeks minimum.

959
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,140
But yeah, I do.

960
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,780
I do like that they, you know, fixed up all the dinosaurs, gave them all a new coat of paint and stuff.

961
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,200
Sure.

962
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,560
Sure.

963
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,160
Yeah.

964
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,060
And then I really do think because like I feel like when Laura Dern or like people

965
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,780
talk about working in the original Jurassic Park, they're like, oh, this giant animatronic

966
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:35,100
could literally crush me like the actual physical animatronic, not that it's a dinosaur,

967
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,860
but like this giant robot.

968
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,820
And I feel like the endominus at the end of the of the Jurassic World

969
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:47,320
ride here, like gives you that sense of like, wow, that's like just a fully walking robot.

970
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,500
Like it kind of gives you a little bit of the scope of it.

971
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:50,800
Yes.

972
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,140
Yeah.

973
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,360
Yeah.

974
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:51,980
Well, it's cool.

975
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,880
They didn't just screen it.

976
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,100
Yes.

977
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:59,740
And now, granted, the beginning, Mosasaur is a screen, but it's a unique screen situation.

978
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,720
It's it feels like worth doing a screen.

979
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,720
With the water effect.

980
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,880
I love that.

981
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,240
Yeah.

982
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,620
Yeah.

983
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:04,840
Yeah.

984
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,740
I'm so delighted the first time we wrote it.

985
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,200
Yeah.

986
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,500
Yeah.

987
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,660
Any anytime people are surprised, you know,

988
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,480
they're just sort of like looking ahead or whatever.

989
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,680
And you're like, you have no idea.

990
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,420
Like, what's that?

991
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,280
Yeah.

992
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,860
You just get drenched if you just I feel like if you sit in the middle,

993
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,300
you get at the worst, I feel like.

994
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,120
Yeah, maybe.

995
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:23,480
Yeah.

996
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:23,560
Yeah.

997
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,240
I've now realized front row center on that thing.

998
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,880
I'm sure I said in an episode, I got I got souped.

999
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,140
I got the biggest souping of a lifetime.

1000
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,560
Yeah.

1001
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:32,820
Yeah.

1002
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,480
Like a degree.

1003
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,720
I was pretty like you.

1004
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,260
It's when you enter the big building and not the drop, but you kind of like go into the water.

1005
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,640
Oh, yeah.

1006
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,260
At the top of the and there's just suddenly it felt like slow motion looking.

1007
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,060
I'm like I had four seconds to watch this wave and it all went.

1008
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,980
I felt like it went to my lap and not even the people next to me.

1009
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,200
Yeah.

1010
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,800
Everyone else is bone dry.

1011
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,260
Yeah.

1012
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,600
Yeah.

1013
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,560
That's when they turn the water up in the summer.

1014
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,660
I don't know.

1015
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,240
Well, no, this was this was a chilly evening.

1016
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,120
So really?

1017
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,200
I yeah, I wish.

1018
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
Might have been OK during.

1019
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,700
I think I had a movie to see and I'm just sitting there.

1020
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,880
That's why I was right.

1021
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,600
I always ride.

1022
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,600
I always like doing this.

1023
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,900
I ride Jurassic World and then I ride the mummy afterwards to sort of dry off a little.

1024
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,540
Oh, yeah.

1025
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,020
Yeah.

1026
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,560
I know that doesn't have the flames part, but is there there's flames in there somewhere, right?

1027
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,480
You can get a little dry.

1028
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,120
A little bit.

1029
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,200
It's got to be at least one flame in that ride.

1030
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,600
At least the wind, you know, the the wind of it.

1031
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,460
Not not fans.

1032
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,240
I'm sure there wasn't built in fans in there.

1033
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,720
But well, we're not sure.

1034
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,320
I don't know.

1035
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,360
We have to talk to the jury.

1036
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1037
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,220
We're figuring out the fans.

1038
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,560
Let me say this.

1039
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:35,760
The

1040
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,980
I don't go on the mummy a lot.

1041
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,820
I now will definitely go on Mummy Orlando and look forward.

1042
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,860
Yeah, I don't do it a lot here.

1043
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,580
I guess I find it generally unpleasant, but that still maybe falls

1044
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,040
into the launch territory for me.

1045
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,300
And full disclosure, I did not go on Velocicoaster

1046
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,300
and I'm not here to to make excuses.

1047
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,160
I got to own up to the fact that I did not.

1048
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,440
And then we're doing an episode about something that I just was not brave enough to do.

1049
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,880
Ultimately, I will just say I've come a long way on this show.

1050
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,320
I wasn't even Splash Mountain with.

1051
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,940
Thank you.

1052
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,800
Thanks for saying that, too.

1053
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,940
But this this does feel like a what to me.

1054
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,880
And maybe you guys can correct to me.

1055
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,720
This feels like another level.

1056
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,640
I think this is out of the comfort zone.

1057
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,400
I it seemed like a little too far beyond.

1058
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:28,920
I also as this come up maybe a few times or if you heard one of our Orlando live

1059
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,480
shows, I lost my voice real bad.

1060
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,340
And I've realized that like I have a couple of bits of armor now

1061
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,960
going on rides.

1062
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,600
One is holding harness mommy.

1063
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,080
I want to hold my I need to grip that thing.

1064
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,480
And they do not have that on this ride.

1065
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,220
Just a lap.

1066
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,380
So that I'm I'm screwed there.

1067
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,300
I've also realized that just like huge guttural yells

1068
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,920
is going to help me out on launches a lot because

1069
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,700
Aaron, my wife, realized like you're closing your eyes and you're just like internalizing it.

1070
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,420
So you're going to like you're going to like shake yourself to death.

1071
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:01,980
That's crazy.

1072
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,720
Just like eyes open.

1073
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,740
Yell it out.

1074
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,300
Get it all.

1075
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:05,860
Yes.

1076
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,740
So truth.

1077
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,200
Thank you.

1078
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,580
I'm trying to.

1079
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,000
But I realize, like, if I can't scream my ass off on this thing,

1080
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,860
I mean, I can't or there won't be live shows.

1081
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,060
The live shows are canceled.

1082
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,360
So losing that armor.

1083
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:20,900
Interesting.

1084
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,380
I like it.

1085
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,680
And so, you know, I still feel like it's possible I could try this thing.

1086
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,920
But also, now that I've laid all that out and I thin you and you know, my

1087
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,300
you guys know my level.

1088
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,260
You know what I've done and what was like a little too much for me or what?

1089
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,260
What do you what do you think are my chances?

1090
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,440
Do you think that I could end up enjoying this or not?

1091
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,920
Oh, it's really intense.

1092
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,800
It's like really intense.

1093
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,880
But here's what I'll.

1094
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,260
Oh, sorry.

1095
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,280
But it's smooth.

1096
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,960
Yes, it is smooth.

1097
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,100
This is the big thing about it is because it reminded me so much of Twisted

1098
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,980
Colossus, which freaked the shit out of me and Gio when we did it for the first time.

1099
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,540
Also, this one did crush my genitals a little bit like that one.

1100
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,540
Just a squeeze.

1101
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,600
Just a little bit of like pushing my pressure test, pushing my penis into my body.

1102
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,040
That is what happened on here.

1103
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,280
So I like I went on it three times forced tuck.

1104
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:18,420
The first time was the worst because I wasn't prepared for it.

1105
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,000
But it put so many things parallel to us to classes, which legit

1106
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,440
freaked me out doing it.

1107
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,800
There was only the lap bar.

1108
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,580
So it makes it feel like you're going to fly out.

1109
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,540
Same thing with with Velocicoaster.

1110
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,280
Similar kind of twists like the barrel roll.

1111
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:38,000
But I truly I never felt like this thing is I never felt in danger like that.

1112
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,360
So the smoothness and the newness of it was giving me a completely

1113
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,080
different sense of safety.

1114
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,320
Now, it is Jason's correct.

1115
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,040
It's intense.

1116
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,600
But I went on Hulk after Velocicoaster and I was like, Hulk is so much rougher.

1117
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,180
Like it's rattling my spine around.

1118
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,840
So you're going to be freaked out.

1119
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,380
But I go, but there's a sense of like being handled in a comfortable way.

1120
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,960
Like there's a sense of like safety on this ride that I don't

1121
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,900
feel on other big coasters.

1122
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:12,060
So that's the only thing I think that can I would say in the favor of you going on.

1123
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,240
I think you're going to be freaked going on it for sure the first time.

1124
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,960
But it's so smooth.

1125
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,140
It feels like you're flying and it doesn't feel like you're to me.

1126
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,500
It doesn't feel like you're feeling this like, oh, my God, this thing's coming apart.

1127
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,020
And that's the difference to me.

1128
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:32,280
Was it was it Adam we were with at Universal who said

1129
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,200
he freaked out?

1130
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:34,520
Yeah.

1131
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:34,680
Yeah.

1132
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,000
Like, oh, no, your panic attack.

1133
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,160
I was like I would say I was on the fence and it was a day where maybe you guys were

1134
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,680
going to do it.

1135
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,340
And then a near panic attack was described to me.

1136
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,840
And I'm like, that's that'll do it.

1137
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,100
Yeah.

1138
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:44,700
Bye.

1139
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,860
I was going to say it's funny.

1140
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,500
You talked about Hulk because I went on Hulk for the first time, too.

1141
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,540
And I went after the Velocicoaster.

1142
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:52,840
Right.

1143
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,940
And that I I didn't feel like I was going to pass out, but I feel like it was that

1144
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,340
you could.

1145
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,060
There was definitely that feeling of like you are.

1146
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,220
Yeah, you are definitely like manhandled, like roughly.

1147
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,680
You are just like going through turbulence, you know, the worst turbulence of your life

1148
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,540
on a plane.

1149
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,700
And that's what it feels like.

1150
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,640
You're rattling.

1151
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,120
Yeah.

1152
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,280
And you can have fun on it.

1153
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,400
It's still kind of fun.

1154
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,760
Steven just found the difference.

1155
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,800
You want to be handled, not manhandled.

1156
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:17,860
Yeah.

1157
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,080
Yeah.

1158
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,520
And handled.

1159
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,160
It's right.

1160
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,420
Throwing luggage on a bed.

1161
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,820
That's that's not being careful.

1162
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:26,000
Even though you imagine a man doing the handling, you'd think you'd be in good

1163
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,400
hands, but they're bad hands.

1164
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,200
The man hands.

1165
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,540
The man you just want to be handled, not manhandled.

1166
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,060
That's right.

1167
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,980
Hulk has these crazy G forces.

1168
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:34,440
Yeah.

1169
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,880
And I feel like Velocicoaster, it's more like air time.

1170
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:39,400
Yeah.

1171
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,500
It feels like that.

1172
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,680
We're like you're like when they shot Apollo 13 and they did the thing

1173
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,140
where they're like diving in the plane and you like you're floating for a couple

1174
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:48,680
seconds.

1175
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:49,800
Parabola.

1176
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,400
Yeah.

1177
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,440
It feels like they like there's seven moments on the ride

1178
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,880
where you're kind of like floating in the like I kept laughing.

1179
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,920
And I did this on.

1180
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,860
I was laughing.

1181
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,240
I kept laughing because I couldn't believe the feeling I was having.

1182
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,580
And it was almost like this weird euphoria.

1183
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,200
I was I was still kind of freaked the first time, but I was in this weird

1184
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,940
euphoric state when I came off of it, which is why I've been like so high

1185
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,600
afterwards.

1186
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,640
Absolutely high because of the amount of times where I just was like,

1187
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,540
I'm flying.

1188
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,040
I feel like I'm flying.

1189
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,560
Yeah.

1190
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,700
You come out of your seat.

1191
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,600
Do you not?

1192
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,500
Yeah, yeah.

1193
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,980
I see it a few times.

1194
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,680
Yeah, it doesn't.

1195
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,840
It goes over the top.

1196
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,620
Oh, my God.

1197
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:25,820
Yeah.

1198
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,960
And so there's no over the shoulder restraints.

1199
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,320
So you can't hug that.

1200
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,540
There's only the lap restraints.

1201
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,900
But as a shorter man, I love that because I'm ping ponging around

1202
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,460
in those shoulder restraints.

1203
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:38,600
Yeah.

1204
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,580
I've come.

1205
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,240
I can happen to a tall man.

1206
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:41,720
Oh, yeah.

1207
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,360
Totally in.

1208
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:42,900
Yeah.

1209
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,620
But like that happened when we were the time before that.

1210
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,940
I remember I like I'm like, am I graying out?

1211
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,760
On this.

1212
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,000
No, I felt a little bit of that on Hulk.

1213
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:51,240
Yeah.

1214
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,120
Some of that.

1215
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:52,480
Yeah.

1216
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,640
And I think as it's going on, I mean, they they changed

1217
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:02,500
the track a number of years ago, but I still swear the original one is smoother.

1218
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,820
Like I might be right.

1219
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,600
There was definitely that euphoria on the Velocicoaster,

1220
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,520
especially like we were saying earlier of like when you go,

1221
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,340
it almost feels like your head is like going to touch the water,

1222
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,320
or at least you feel a little bit of mist or something.

1223
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,680
You almost feel like Heath Ledger is the Joker hanging outside the car.

1224
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,340
You know, you're just like, oh, like this is like, that's like,

1225
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,580
there's that element of like, yeah, I think it is the like the fact

1226
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:30,080
that you kind of feel like you're floating rather than being like dragged along.

1227
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,140
A strip or something.

1228
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,520
Yes, especially that last the last barrel roll over the water.

1229
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,220
You're just like, I can imagine like being Superman or something.

1230
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,620
Yeah, like I'm flying upside down over the water.

1231
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,880
And obviously it lasts like a half second or something.

1232
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,560
You are probably 15 to 20 feet above the water.

1233
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,920
But it feels like you're right.

1234
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,420
It feels like I'm going right in the water.

1235
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,940
But like no point did I ever even here's what's.

1236
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,460
And I don't know.

1237
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,300
You might, Scott, you might not react like this.

1238
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:03,100
No point in my brain even register the reality in the gravity of

1239
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,380
literally the gravity or the actual gravity of like this.

1240
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,820
One of the first parts is they kind of make you feel like you're going to fly

1241
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,120
into some jagged rocks.

1242
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:10,660
Yeah.

1243
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,280
Never.

1244
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,200
I was like, oh, that's funny.

1245
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,120
Whoo.

1246
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:15,460
Like, cool.

1247
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,200
I didn't do it.

1248
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,520
And then the water thing, you're like, this feels like they could be like

1249
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,600
torturing, like dunking everyone's heads.

1250
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,340
Yeah, no, exactly.

1251
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,180
Water should go.

1252
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,140
But instead of being like afraid, I was like, whoa, yeah, my head's going

1253
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,080
in the water or whatever.

1254
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:33,540
I didn't register that all week from like Port of Entry or Marvel Super Island.

1255
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:39,520
I was looking at it like and I've and eventually it became my phone

1256
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,440
like background.

1257
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:47,120
Jane took like a photo of the sunset and the top hat and the track is there

1258
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:53,080
and the little olive oil boat like it is a very beautiful photo.

1259
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,160
Me ship the olive.

1260
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,240
Me ship the olive.

1261
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,160
And then I like it wasn't until last night I realized like, oh, my God,

1262
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,720
velocity coasters on my home screen as we're amazing.

1263
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,920
We're researching.

1264
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,360
It tends to get, you know, when you've got me ship the olive there.

1265
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,480
Yeah, yeah.

1266
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,280
It's a beautiful sunset.

1267
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,900
But like, yeah, but the velocity coaster, the velocity coaster is there.

1268
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,560
And when they were building all this, I was so worried that like, oh,

1269
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,080
this is going to ruin the skyline.

1270
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,880
It's going to ruin.

1271
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,160
You're not going to be able to go.

1272
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,860
And they they worked around it.

1273
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,640
They like built the only thing that closed was the old triceratops encounter.

1274
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,480
They demolish.

1275
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,460
Yeah.

1276
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,480
They put her out to pasture.

1277
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,580
Oh, no.

1278
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,780
To build the ride.

1279
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,760
Old yellow style.

1280
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,540
Oh, no.

1281
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,600
You're not really also.

1282
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,060
And then they shot it.

1283
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:41,780
You didn't exist.

1284
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,560
You have to go.

1285
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,540
You never were.

1286
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,260
But the track is so like built into everything.

1287
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:53,120
And they even you can get to the ride entrance by there's a pathway

1288
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,380
or you can come out the ground floor of the Discovery Center

1289
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,460
and you still can see the view across the port of entry.

1290
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,360
So like all of that is is preserved.

1291
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,680
And I there's a special on the making of the Lost Coaster on Peacock,

1292
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,580
which was very fun.

1293
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,320
You know, you got Travaro in there.

1294
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,040
You got Frank Marshall.

1295
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:17,640
Of course.

1296
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,200
You know, one of Mario Lopez.

1297
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,300
Mario Lopez is narrating for some reason.

1298
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,600
Teary Koo, a longtime Universal creative guys in there.

1299
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,480
A number of people who worked on the ride.

1300
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,160
It's funny.

1301
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,440
I rewatched this.

1302
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,300
And I swear to God, I had watched the entire thing before.

1303
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,820
I had zero memory of Frank Marshall speaking.

1304
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,320
And he does speak and clutching my pearls a couple of times.

1305
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,320
I was speaking this one.

1306
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:42,920
I remember.

1307
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,740
How a lot of it clearly had a hit a lot of we, you know,

1308
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,980
we wanted to do something bigger and better than it ever been done before.

1309
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,460
OK, write that down.

1310
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,560
Write down what Frank said.

1311
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:54,420
Yeah.

1312
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:54,940
To Frank.

1313
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,040
I don't think Frank was there's no footage of him going on this ride, though.

1314
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:58,980
Do you think Frank would do it?

1315
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,320
I don't know.

1316
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,200
I don't think so.

1317
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,920
I don't know.

1318
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:02,560
Older man.

1319
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,780
Maybe you shouldn't.

1320
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:04,520
Maybe you should.

1321
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,540
I mean, it's bad for your ticker, you know.

1322
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,740
It's so smooth.

1323
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:08,960
It is very smooth.

1324
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:09,280
Yeah.

1325
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,740
I would say Frank, don't go on the Hulk.

1326
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,520
But maybe this one that have you guys talked about it?

1327
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,120
Because that's like the fun fact of like Steven Spielberg

1328
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,460
like rode the original Jurassic Park ride and gets like I feel like that's

1329
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,780
like a theme park, you know, one of the big trivia.

1330
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:22,500
Yeah.

1331
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,600
You don't want to get wet.

1332
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,500
And it always made me so mad that like so I need I could.

1333
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,680
The only way to do that is to have the power of Spielberg.

1334
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,820
Yeah, stop it.

1335
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,140
That's what I why still in a way.

1336
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,440
So I will still be going up the Splash Mountain or the soon to be Tiana's

1337
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,960
lift and like still kind of like that Spielberg treatment.

1338
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,720
If I could, they should just give you the option.

1339
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,560
If you're right, anybody out?

1340
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,540
Yeah, I'll do it.

1341
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:47,820
Yeah.

1342
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah.

1343
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,880
One last call.

1344
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,660
Can I pull a string like a bus?

1345
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,100
Yeah.

1346
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,520
Well, that's a work lights.

1347
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,240
Come on.

1348
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:57,840
I think we were all at the premiere of the ride of the dress.

1349
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,020
Yeah.

1350
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:58,300
Yeah.

1351
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:58,620
Yeah.

1352
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,360
I was there too that night.

1353
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,380
You were there too.

1354
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:01,640
Yeah.

1355
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:01,780
Yeah.

1356
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,560
I was talking about this before.

1357
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,480
I don't think we had, but it was one of those things.

1358
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,220
Oh, the fireworks were very upsetting.

1359
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,640
I felt like they set them off right behind us.

1360
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,160
But I think, Mike, were you saying that you tried to get on the ride

1361
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,740
with Colin, like at some point?

1362
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:14,380
Yes.

1363
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,880
We saw Colin and we thought he was heading to the ride.

1364
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,000
We're like, you know, if we follow him, we could get on the ride with him.

1365
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,880
But he was leaving.

1366
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,100
So we did.

1367
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,920
The accident was the same spot.

1368
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,360
Yeah.

1369
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,240
We didn't do it too aggressively.

1370
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,560
We just happened to walk like we could go on the ride with the director of the

1371
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:31,820
movie.

1372
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:34,640
So I feel like he what he what I feel like he didn't get off.

1373
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,260
I feel like he might have toughed it out.

1374
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:37,600
Yeah.

1375
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:37,900
Yeah.

1376
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:38,220
Yeah.

1377
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,080
So you were at that premiere.

1378
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,360
Do you remember anything else?

1379
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,220
Do you remember like any speeches or any lack of speeches?

1380
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,160
You know, it's so funny, because when I listen to that episode, too,

1381
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,500
I was like totally with Mike.

1382
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,760
I'm like, yeah, totally.

1383
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,700
And then then I was like, go.

1384
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,920
I actually went back through like some of the footage and things

1385
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,620
that I take from them.

1386
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,760
I was like, oh, I guess he didn't talk.

1387
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,580
But I was totally with you.

1388
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,720
I was totally.

1389
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,680
Yeah, because he's he's become such a,

1390
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,140
you know, spokesperson for the franchise in a way.

1391
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:06,540
Right.

1392
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,140
The franchise of Margaritaville.

1393
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:08,520
Yes.

1394
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,200
But it was one of those things.

1395
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:11,900
The new Jimmy.

1396
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,480
He's taking the man taking the mantle.

1397
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,660
He said he should take his name, too.

1398
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,500
I'm officially changing my name.

1399
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,060
Jimmy Marsh.

1400
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,680
Jimmy Kathleen Kennedy and Jimmy Buffett.

1401
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,360
How could half the people the concert wouldn't know?

1402
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,120
I mean, if you're in the back row, you can't.

1403
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,240
I guess I think so.

1404
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,700
Yeah, he's got the flip flops on.

1405
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,040
I thought he died, but I guess that.

1406
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,100
It's better than a hologram, you know, it is.

1407
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:33,480
Yeah.

1408
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,200
Yeah, sure.

1409
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,120
Absolutely.

1410
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,340
I it's I feel like with some of these little scandal,

1411
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:44,880
these things where I say the reality, such as the Frank Marshall didn't speak,

1412
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,340
such as that it is a spoiler if you're not on the second gate,

1413
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:52,300
that the George Clooney story is a suitcase story, not a briefcase story.

1414
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:52,560
Right.

1415
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,640
Or the or the one that we're we still don't have the proof on.

1416
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,380
Eisner and the Eisner being the goal in Soren.

1417
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,500
I feel like I'm ending up right.

1418
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,920
And yet I think people want the spirit.

1419
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:10,120
I feel like maybe I'm like maybe I'm doing a disservice

1420
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,560
to these tales by unraveling them.

1421
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,620
People want our audience wanted so much for Frank Marshall to have spoken.

1422
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,200
Yeah, I did.

1423
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,900
Yeah, I was like I was so ready.

1424
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,740
I was right there.

1425
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,900
And then I literally went back to my stuff that I take for the podcast.

1426
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,180
I was like, oh, yeah, like I'm totally going to back Mike up on it.

1427
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,080
And I was like, oh, no.

1428
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,440
Oh, did you think you could prove it wrong?

1429
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,760
I thought I thought I could prove it to be honest, because yeah,

1430
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,640
like I because, you know, I was like creating content or whatever,

1431
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,440
trying to like from that night of like because again, it's like,

1432
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,420
how often do we get to be around for a brand new ride opening?

1433
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,780
Like, that was so exciting.

1434
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,360
Yeah, yeah.

1435
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,460
No, yeah, that was it was awesome to be at for sure.

1436
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,440
But yeah, it was yeah, it was like going through the going through the Watergate,

1437
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,720
you know, there must be a way.

1438
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,400
Jurassic Gate hearings.

1439
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,880
Let's talk before we dive fully into just like what the ride does

1440
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,520
and the emotion of anything from the pre show or the queue that we want to shout out.

1441
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,700
Yeah, yeah, there's

1442
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,780
first of all, I like to talk about the lockers.

1443
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:14,220
Yeah, because the lockers and they have these on Tron now as well at Disney World.

1444
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,960
This is an innovation in the I don't know who did this first, but the locker.

1445
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,240
You put your stuff in one side and it comes out another side.

1446
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,240
Yeah, we haven't talked about that.

1447
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,360
That was odd on Tron.

1448
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,460
And it's interesting.

1449
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,160
It's interesting.

1450
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,280
And this works so a hundred times better than the Harry Potter system

1451
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,400
of going in this crowded little room.

1452
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,540
You're packed and fighting with people and looking for an open computer screen

1453
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:42,440
to touch, like to touch a button and then try to figure out what that opened up.

1454
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:46,680
This is such a somebody is like several below you.

1455
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,220
There's a problem that you like not since high school.

1456
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,500
You didn't think you'd have to deal with this.

1457
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:50,940
Yeah, exactly.

1458
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,200
Somebody's hunched down or you're the one hunched down

1459
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,440
and somebody's reaching over you.

1460
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:54,600
Yeah.

1461
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,060
And the Hulk has like Hulk.

1462
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,200
It's it's not as crammed because it's outside with all these.

1463
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,420
But like I was having a big problem getting into one of those free lockers

1464
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:06,140
are so far away from and then some of them are like paid and some of them

1465
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:06,900
weren't working.

1466
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,720
And then I'm like trying to find somebody and I'm like, do I need like a physical ticket?

1467
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,880
Like I was so confused.

1468
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,660
But the way they do it now, when we were in Orlando before,

1469
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,700
I believe you were like a seeing eye dog for me because I had to put my glasses

1470
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,940
in the whole locker and walk through the whole queue.

1471
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,680
Like a block to the queue and then through the queue.

1472
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,300
And I was just like, I got on all fours.

1473
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,100
Magooing it.

1474
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,580
I put a leash on.

1475
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:33,240
Yeah.

1476
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,620
And Jason just walked.

1477
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,080
Yeah.

1478
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:35,740
He held the leash.

1479
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,000
Just I don't know.

1480
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,240
Anybody gets too close.

1481
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,760
Do not hit him.

1482
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,240
Please.

1483
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:40,840
It was fun.

1484
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,720
It was a fun time.

1485
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,300
It was innocent.

1486
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,660
Also, it wasn't like a weird.

1487
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:45,140
Yeah, yeah.

1488
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:45,440
Yeah.

1489
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,820
It sounds like so I had a different experience on philosophy.

1490
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,940
Because, you know, I had the scooter when we were in Orlando.

1491
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,400
And this was universal.

1492
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,120
I have to commend them.

1493
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,000
You know, a number of attractions.

1494
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,040
They're like, oh, they can't really bring that in the queue.

1495
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,200
Can you transfer to a wheelchair?

1496
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,660
So I got in a wheelchair and Jane pushed me.

1497
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,500
So I kind of went like a roundabout way through the queue and I took an elevator up.

1498
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,780
Oh, you got to do an elevator.

1499
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,000
So I got to an elevator.

1500
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,000
So I I didn't really go past the lockers.

1501
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,160
She just stayed with the stuff.

1502
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,900
Oh, OK.

1503
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,520
And I got on on the exiting side.

1504
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:29,680
But as a result of that, she was able to clock the car and videotape me.

1505
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:35,420
And then we were able to go frame by frame and find me on the coaster.

1506
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:35,960
Yes.

1507
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,440
Like just like a smiling like a pig and shit.

1508
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,340
Like having a ball the best time of my life.

1509
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,520
Here's here's the photo.

1510
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,340
Here's the sunset.

1511
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:46,980
Wow.

1512
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,020
Do I was talking about beautiful posted and other people?

1513
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,140
Yeah, yeah.

1514
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,840
I think my phone back.

1515
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:52,520
Yeah, yeah.

1516
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,040
Everybody's the city.

1517
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:54,680
Beautiful.

1518
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,020
So the port.

1519
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:57,720
Beautiful.

1520
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,080
But universal.

1521
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,120
Very team members.

1522
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:05,240
Very good about like helping people on if they need assistance, allowing extra time

1523
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,460
like on doom.

1524
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,440
And I also switched a wheelchair for villain con.

1525
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,740
So I got to do villain con seated.

1526
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:13,520
Oh, really?

1527
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:13,980
Yeah.

1528
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,320
Oh, we didn't talk about.

1529
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,460
They're just like, yeah, when you get on the moving walkway, lock those wheels, please.

1530
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,540
Oh, did you do Tron?

1531
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,220
Did you do Tron?

1532
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,240
I didn't do Tron.

1533
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:26,680
OK, because that's the only other place with the with these innovative lockers.

1534
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:27,160
Yes.

1535
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,340
I just wanted to make sure two doors, two doors on each side.

1536
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,580
So it couldn't be done.

1537
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,860
Yeah, I love these lockers.

1538
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:38,420
I was also thinking you were talking about the lockers that are like of the workers.

1539
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,360
And there's like, oh, sure, sure.

1540
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:44,140
You know, Ian Malcolm's book there and Alan Grant's book and like,

1541
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,200
you know, like again, because it is that thing of like, you know,

1542
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,600
I think Harry Potter has such an advantage in Star Wars as well,

1543
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,740
where it's like these fantastical worlds and stuff.

1544
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,480
And Jurassic World is like it's like the zoo, but with like a little extra judge.

1545
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,640
You know, so I guess to draw on, I guess.

1546
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:01,880
Yeah.

1547
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,840
How many beakers and amber like slabs can we throw in here?

1548
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,660
You know, so I like the having the callbacks to Jurassic Park with the

1549
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,440
the book of Ian Malcolm and the book of Alan Grant.

1550
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,180
Oh, that's so cool.

1551
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:13,520
Yeah.

1552
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,460
Also, like attraction posters.

1553
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:17,220
Oh, really?

1554
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:22,940
Also, attraction posters for the one, the real ones for River Adventure

1555
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,860
and and Tyrande on Flyers, but then like ride the gyrosphere.

1556
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,100
Yeah, which is not something they figured out how to do.

1557
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,440
Although I also realized

1558
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,780
the one in Beijing we were talking about was apparently developed as a gyrosphere.

1559
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:35,460
Yeah, I read that.

1560
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,680
And then they I think it proved to

1561
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,600
insane or ambitious.

1562
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,600
But they filed patents for it.

1563
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,360
Yeah, yeah.

1564
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,000
How to which it would have been

1565
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:49,300
the kind of vehicle where you think you're supposed to feel like you're going on.

1566
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,880
Like you're being moved on the ground, but the mechanisms up above you.

1567
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,360
So you're being swung.

1568
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:54,960
Oh, OK.

1569
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,420
They would have been like that because, yeah, it's that thing of in the original

1570
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,620
movies, all the glass is CGI.

1571
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,180
Like there's no there was no physical glass on them.

1572
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:05,780
Complicated thing.

1573
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,940
Yeah, just like a glass ball that's supposed to be rotating around.

1574
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,080
Like that's probably as just a sci fi as the dinosaur part.

1575
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,780
You know, the gyrospheres.

1576
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,380
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1577
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:17,740
Yeah.

1578
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,620
But then I love that.

1579
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:24,540
Then you you like ground it in that you're watching little Jimmy Fallon skits in the.

1580
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,980
Yeah, I liked that part of it.

1581
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:31,100
I'm like, wow, they have the videos in the ride are what it would be in reality.

1582
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,160
Yeah, I think they filmed that on the SNL set.

1583
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,080
Oh, that's cool.

1584
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:35,860
I think so.

1585
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,920
I believe I believe that when they they did that, they wanted it to have that.

1586
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,040
Like your side of the old school like sketch lighting.

1587
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,580
Oh, sure.

1588
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:42,860
Yeah.

1589
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:43,540
Interesting.

1590
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,040
Huh?

1591
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:44,480
That's cool.

1592
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,600
The queue has.

1593
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,000
But can I just say I like to vouch for Colin DeVarro to host SNL.

1594
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,900
We get that on the record.

1595
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:52,620
Yeah.

1596
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,720
You may know me for my movies, not for being on screen.

1597
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,140
Should have happened after the book.

1598
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,080
But yeah, yeah.

1599
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,960
You didn't even finish the name of it because it's.

1600
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:07,580
You know, it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we know when we say the book, we mean the book.

1601
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,120
The good book is not the Bible.

1602
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,860
The book is the book of the good book.

1603
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,040
Have you read the good book?

1604
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,040
By that, I mean the feature film, the Book of Henry.

1605
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,880
They have robot.

1606
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
They have animatronic stuff.

1607
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:19,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1608
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,000
I don't know.

1609
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:20,940
Yeah, I guess so.

1610
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,680
It's animatronics.

1611
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,780
But it's yeah, Raptors with the big

1612
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,820
what metal muzzle.

1613
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,140
Yeah, yeah.

1614
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,740
Which are really cool.

1615
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:31,180
And that's those are sequences in in the movie.

1616
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:35,220
These kind of these awful, restricted, these locks that make you these face locks.

1617
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,200
Yeah, they make you upset when you see them in the movie.

1618
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,400
But that's all CGI.

1619
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:44,740
So like the Indominus, it's crazy to take a CGI moment and recreate it in reality.

1620
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:50,440
So lifelike to where you like, I swear, you can like look at footage of those

1621
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,360
Raptors in the queue and think you're watching CGI footage.

1622
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,880
It's really it's it's really good.

1623
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,320
And it's also like it is kind of minimal movement for it as well.

1624
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,800
Like if you watch them, they're minimal movement,

1625
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,180
but it's just enough to make them feel alive.

1626
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,640
Cheeks and the eyes.

1627
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:05,100
Yeah.

1628
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,420
Yeah.

1629
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,380
And then the like the the not the cage.

1630
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,680
Or whatever is behind them rattles.

1631
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:11,960
Yes.

1632
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,000
But the face doesn't do what so you're able to get like

1633
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,960
this really impressive moment without having this full body, super complex

1634
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,600
animatronic.

1635
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,340
And it's really a well smartly done.

1636
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:26,960
I to me, it seems like just some sort of minimal effects,

1637
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,660
like a smart use of whatever technology.

1638
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,960
Let me ask this.

1639
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,600
The Mario Lopez special we've been discussing this big chunk that is about

1640
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,920
creating the smell.

1641
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,680
We had to think about what a what a velociraptor smells like.

1642
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,140
I did not go in this queue.

1643
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,120
They don't really try to say what it smells like in the special.

1644
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,300
Did you any of you guys get a sense of the smell?

1645
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,920
Do you know what a Raptor smells like?

1646
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,460
I wish I could say that I remembered what it smelled like because it was a while ago.

1647
01:04:54,980 --> 01:05:00,200
But I mean, it definitely like the vibe of of what I would imagine

1648
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,320
a real Jurassic world to see, you know, it's just the metal and there's like a

1649
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,060
rain, you know, Petrachore, like that, the scent of like the rain on the sidewalk

1650
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:09,660
kind of stuff.

1651
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,980
But I was like, well, they the way they talked about in the special,

1652
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
they're like blood.

1653
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,900
And I'm like, I don't remember any of that.

1654
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:16,800
Like I was blood smell.

1655
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,100
Yeah, I don't I don't know.

1656
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,860
I don't remember a smell at all.

1657
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,760
Maybe they stop.

1658
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:21,900
Maybe they stop doing the smells.

1659
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,640
There are no smells.

1660
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:23,540
Maybe there are no smells.

1661
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,300
Maybe the blood was throwing people off.

1662
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,220
Yeah, everyone's just like really sick on the ride.

1663
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,300
The smell of blood.

1664
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:28,580
Oh, my God.

1665
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,020
Blood.

1666
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:29,900
Oh, no.

1667
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,360
Something awful happened.

1668
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,860
And you get a little Mr.

1669
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:34,520
DNA.

1670
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,180
Yeah.

1671
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,580
In there, voiced by somebody new and not the person.

1672
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,240
Steven, you were talking about before the show.

1673
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:41,560
Oh, yeah.

1674
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,800
That I like held people at gunpoint.

1675
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,020
Yeah.

1676
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:44,660
It's a Mr.

1677
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:45,240
DNA.

1678
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,000
Yeah, the voice.

1679
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:46,320
Yeah.

1680
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,220
Greg Burson.

1681
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:51,760
It was just one of those things where, you know, like there is these trivia points

1682
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,460
where we like, oh, you know, there's only this amount of CGI in the original

1683
01:05:55,460 --> 01:06:00,400
Jurassic Park and, you know, like just just kind of the basic, you know,

1684
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,960
the sounds of the raptors are like dolphins and tortoises having sex or,

1685
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,380
like, you know, these kind of like the basic trivia that we all know about,

1686
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,520
like the things we like.

1687
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,380
And but that was like a trivia that I did not know.

1688
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,620
I was like, oh, yeah, who did the voice of Mr.

1689
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,140
DNA?

1690
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:20,000
Because I think it was either Brad Bird did or Colin Chavarro

1691
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
did the voice of Mr.

1692
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,480
Oh, I did it.

1693
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,020
I remember seeing that.

1694
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:25,220
Yeah.

1695
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:25,580
Yeah.

1696
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,280
I think or Brad.

1697
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,920
SNL put him in a costume.

1698
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:28,940
He'd be Mr.

1699
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,260
DNA and a skipper.

1700
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,240
Hey, it's me.

1701
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,280
He has guns.

1702
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,880
I can't believe I'm in studio eight.

1703
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,820
I think Brad Bird maybe did the voice of like like an intercom person

1704
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:40,940
in Jurassic World.

1705
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:41,480
Oh, I know.

1706
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,800
But but but yeah, it's it's funny that they've started to bring Mr.

1707
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,260
DNA back into like marketing and things like that because merch.

1708
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,900
Yeah, they were coming up on the 30th.

1709
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,300
I feel like you were seeing more Mr.

1710
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,680
DNA merch around.

1711
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,180
Yeah.

1712
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,140
Yeah, because it is this weird part of that movie where it is like we're watching

1713
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,380
a cartoon for two minutes.

1714
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:01,860
Yeah.

1715
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,400
A little of like a blockbuster movie.

1716
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,280
But I feel like movies now do that a lot more, like have like little animated

1717
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:12,060
sequences, like trying to explain a concept or something or show like

1718
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,560
I don't know what Ice Age was the first example, but like the Ice Age where they

1719
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,700
have the cave paintings, you know, that animates his his past or whatever.

1720
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,040
Oh, I like a good thing.

1721
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,740
Coco starts with a lot of that, like that, like paper cut.

1722
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:26,540
I don't know.

1723
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:27,200
Yeah.

1724
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,080
But like a big chunk of backstories explained that way.

1725
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:34,160
And you don't realize you're like eating your vegetables because it looks so

1726
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,560
you get lost in how cool and unique it looks.

1727
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,800
You said another one in there, though, that I didn't know,

1728
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,020
which is the turtles having sex is one of the velociraptor sounds.

1729
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,140
I think it's like one of the yeah, it's like two tortoises have it because

1730
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,240
it's like a screech.

1731
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:46,860
Yeah, yeah.

1732
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,180
It's like, yeah, like not that because I'm thinking of the

1733
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:53,220
and your way you're wearing Crocs or Crocs.

1734
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,800
The official Crocs are Crocs.

1735
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:56,120
OK.

1736
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,020
But the records say

1737
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,200
but like because I'm so fond of the like

1738
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,820
if you're watching video of a turtle having sex with a croc.

1739
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:05,740
No.

1740
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:06,560
Oh, my God.

1741
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:06,840
Yes.

1742
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,300
Exactly.

1743
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:07,560
Oh, yes.

1744
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,300
I have seen this.

1745
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:08,560
Yeah.

1746
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,580
They just the most tender sound.

1747
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,120
It's not like sex.

1748
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,020
It's a romance.

1749
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:15,540
It's love.

1750
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:16,200
Yeah.

1751
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:16,400
Yeah.

1752
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:16,940
That's nice.

1753
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:17,180
Yes.

1754
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,020
That's making love.

1755
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:18,580
Yeah.

1756
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,840
Gary Reidstrom, like pitch that down, stretched it out

1757
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,700
and then it becomes the raptor scream.

1758
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:24,240
Wow.

1759
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,980
Turned into something mean, something

1760
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,900
so so passionate, so affectionate.

1761
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:29,680
All right.

1762
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:30,240
Well, cool.

1763
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:30,480
Pretty.

1764
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,860
Oh, I was saying, you know what?

1765
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,660
I think when I was talking about the aesthetic, it's partly the black

1766
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,620
or like blue, gray, whatever aesthetic.

1767
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,720
But also there is a cruelty to Jurassic World.

1768
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:43,720
I think what I actually I'm more responding to is that the majesty

1769
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,360
of the first Jurassic Park I do miss in like maybe the New Jurassic World

1770
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,880
ride and then some of this like you're going through this queue

1771
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,420
and it's not like, oh, dinosaurs are wonderful.

1772
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,100
It's like they're locked up.

1773
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,640
They will kill you.

1774
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,340
You're missing a little of that, which is what I'm wistful or nostalgic for.

1775
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,160
That's the only difference.

1776
01:08:59,380 --> 01:08:59,960
Now, it's good.

1777
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,560
It's cool.

1778
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:01,800
It's just that's the difference.

1779
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:04,700
No, I think I think you're more than colors that I'm talking about.

1780
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:08,260
Owen literally tells you, do not ride this ride.

1781
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:09,020
Is that correct?

1782
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,420
I miss that clip.

1783
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:11,320
Pretty wild.

1784
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:14,460
Yeah, because there was one of my rides, I got to see most of it.

1785
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:17,520
And I'm like, this is a like feels like a 10 minute argument.

1786
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:20,740
And there's like a Larry David like on this ride, like Bryce

1787
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,960
else, Howard, just kind of looking at the camera like,

1788
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,180
should turn, you know, like like because he's just like,

1789
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:27,880
that's what I mean.

1790
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,440
He's like a Werner Herzog character,

1791
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,540
like like the Antarctica documentary that Werner Herzog did, which is my favorite.

1792
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:37,580
You know, the penguins go into the wilderness, you know, into madness.

1793
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,300
And it's like in the interviews, all these scientists who are like in like

1794
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:45,260
they went down to Antarctica, who like like have ceased talking to other humans

1795
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,660
and are just like studying whatever it's like.

1796
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:51,400
That was I feel like on a like, you know, a better filmmaker

1797
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,640
would have like pulled that out.

1798
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:56,640
But like that's part of the Q video is like, oh, and just being like, this is bad.

1799
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,680
We're all going to die.

1800
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,320
What are you doing to these people?

1801
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:00,040
These people are.

1802
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,280
Why would you build this here?

1803
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:04,680
And she's like, Owen, it's overdoing it.

1804
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,680
We live now.

1805
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,820
There's cameras on us right now.

1806
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:08,820
Wow.

1807
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,860
They were really like pumping out new rides.

1808
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,080
Velocicoaster, the Indominus.

1809
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:14,540
Yeah.

1810
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,040
Yeah.

1811
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,620
All of this.

1812
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,220
And and what we said about the timeline

1813
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:21,480
where this all happens right before.

1814
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,860
If if OK, things are bad in Jurassic World, the movie.

1815
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:30,700
So if we've had a predominance escape into the T-Rex paddock

1816
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:34,880
and the boat dropped and the there were the coaster,

1817
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:39,580
the Velocicoaster went haywire to and they kept the park open.

1818
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:39,920
Yeah.

1819
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,880
Still had her nieces over.

1820
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:42,500
It is.

1821
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,320
It all happened on Christmas Day.

1822
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,720
And that logic, too, that it's like, wait, they're going to visit her

1823
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,580
at Christmas time like that crowds that parks going to be at capacity.

1824
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,980
I don't know if that's the best time to have visitors.

1825
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,080
Is there less crowd on Christmas?

1826
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,080
No, not at Jurassic World.

1827
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,140
You should wait until the New Year.

1828
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,820
You should wait until that first couple of weeks in January.

1829
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:05,720
It's very slow when it's mostly just cheer competitions and football

1830
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,520
competition.

1831
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:09,000
Yeah, I went and sing and choir at Jurassic World.

1832
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,320
Yeah, I did marching band.

1833
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,380
I actually marked down my march down the thoroughfare.

1834
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:16,080
I blew my trumpet in the direction of Brookstone.

1835
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,900
I was going to say, though, the parents were getting divorced

1836
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,180
and they couldn't schedule that.

1837
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,460
You know, so that was a whole thing.

1838
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,400
It's true.

1839
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,760
I know what that's like.

1840
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:24,520
Divorce.

1841
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,320
It's yeah.

1842
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:26,820
Shove it off to theme park.

1843
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:27,200
Yeah.

1844
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,860
Oh, that was some of the better parts.

1845
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,420
You know, that was smoother.

1846
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,220
But it's it's it really they they paint Claire.

1847
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:38,460
If you put a piece all this together is incredibly irresponsible.

1848
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:41,800
The guy there's no like it's you.

1849
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,480
The universe is a little bit more like cheeky, like like danger stuff.

1850
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,240
And like Dr.

1851
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,740
Doom says, ignore safety measures on the fear fall and stuff.

1852
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:52,780
But this one is the star of the movie who knows dinosaurs very well being like,

1853
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,760
this is terrible.

1854
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,120
Don't do it.

1855
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,860
Why would you build this dinosaur expert?

1856
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:00,360
A velociraptor, a guy who can talk to them is like, stop it.

1857
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,400
Don't do it.

1858
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,340
Turn this ship around.

1859
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,880
And he's not saying it to the villain of the film.

1860
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,300
No, he's saying it to the other star.

1861
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,580
He's saying it to somebody who he wants to have sex with very much.

1862
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:11,020
Yeah.

1863
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:11,560
Yeah.

1864
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:11,820
Right.

1865
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,160
And this is going to ruin his chances.

1866
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:13,900
Yeah.

1867
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,640
He should be going, oh, great idea.

1868
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:16,440
I know.

1869
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,680
Why do they keep working together?

1870
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:18,580
Yeah.

1871
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:18,840
Yeah.

1872
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,860
It seems every interaction is as combative as can be.

1873
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:22,540
Well, yeah.

1874
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:25,220
But by the time you get to Dominion, they're like,

1875
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,500
full on make it out of Cabin in the Woods.

1876
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,440
Well, yeah, they adopted a clone child.

1877
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,080
Yeah, they got a clone child.

1878
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,060
Ellie and Alan couldn't make it work.

1879
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,380
You know, but then you didn't have that.

1880
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,400
That Owen Claire spark.

1881
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:37,880
Yeah.

1882
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,160
That electric chemistry that we see in all these rides, the tension from screaming

1883
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,400
at each other about Velocicoaster eventually built to that.

1884
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:45,900
Oh, yeah.

1885
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:48,360
It just comes to a head where it's like, come on.

1886
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:50,260
We all know what's going on here.

1887
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,680
We know what this argument is really about.

1888
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,580
That would be great if in Dominion, they just had like a reference

1889
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:59,480
to the Velocicoaster just as like a little Easter egg of like

1890
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:04,580
in that time when like we let people get chased by Delta, Blue, Echo

1891
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,680
and Charlie, our favorite rafters.

1892
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,920
All four of them ate a head.

1893
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:10,220
Yeah.

1894
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,100
They all read that.

1895
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,380
You said it couldn't happen because the ride goes 70 miles an hour.

1896
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,140
But all of my rafters ate a full head that day.

1897
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,860
You know, I was just saying, if I was a kid, though,

1898
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:22,360
because I would always buy into the pre show stuff as a kid.

1899
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,060
And I've said it, the going to the place called Pirates Cove,

1900
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,140
which is a small place like amusement park by where I grew up.

1901
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:31,980
There was this UFO ride that explained we were going into space.

1902
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:35,240
And I bought whatever the pre show, whatever the video said to me.

1903
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,900
And I if I was in line for this and I was scared in nine or 10

1904
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,880
and I'm like, what are we doing?

1905
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:42,480
Yeah.

1906
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,360
Yeah.

1907
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,820
The stars of the movie are saying.

1908
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,120
So what I trust, they're arguing in the middle of trying to tell us

1909
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,380
what this ride is about.

1910
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:53,860
Before the ride begins, they argue more than they say what it is.

1911
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:56,140
And these are the takes they use.

1912
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:56,580
Yeah.

1913
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,500
So can I I don't want to go on a tangent.

1914
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:03,720
I think I can't not expel this from my head.

1915
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:08,800
While we're talking about the portrayal of females in Colin Trevorrow films.

1916
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:09,320
Oh, yeah.

1917
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,940
I was just sometimes I'm like, how do you go from safety

1918
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,120
not guaranteed to what is this?

1919
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,240
How did he get that?

1920
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,880
Why is he Jurassic World?

1921
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,080
I'm so I don't know much about him or where he came from.

1922
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:23,420
I feel like there's so much lore about Spielberg.

1923
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:26,160
Of course, you know everything about Spielberg and he was on the lot.

1924
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,960
And we don't know the story of Colin.

1925
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:28,420
Do I?

1926
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:31,160
Well, I was going to say the one thing that I find very interesting

1927
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:36,440
was that I think originally Brad Bird was going to do Force Awakens.

1928
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:41,940
But only if Colin Trevorrow was going to like just prep the movie.

1929
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:45,600
I might have some of this wires crossed, but it was like

1930
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,620
because they wanted JJ and then he said no.

1931
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,780
And then I think Brad Bird was going to do it.

1932
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,380
But then he was like, well, I'm doing the tomorrow.

1933
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:53,960
Right.

1934
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:54,800
And then tomorrow.

1935
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,860
But then he was already in prep for that.

1936
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:00,580
So it was like, oh, I'll do Force Awakens, but only like I need help.

1937
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,360
Basically.

1938
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,040
And so I think Colin originally was going to prep Force Awakens,

1939
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,780
which that feels like such a weird consolation.

1940
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,120
I've never heard that.

1941
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:15,340
Junior director feels like the Prairie Home companion, Robert Altman,

1942
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,860
Paul Thomas Anderson, stand by director.

1943
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:18,960
Yeah, yeah.

1944
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:23,220
I mean, I might have some of this cross, but these names were all swirling around.

1945
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,020
That's fascinating.

1946
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,720
Well, it's interesting because he fell into the like he makes the move like that.

1947
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:32,400
That happened a bunch in the recent past with going sort of from a smallish movie

1948
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,540
to small, well received movie to yeah, to doing like the biggest thing with the craziest budget.

1949
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:40,920
And then once you're I think once it was a huge hit, the first one, it was like,

1950
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:42,700
well, I guess we plug him in.

1951
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:46,160
Yeah, because then, yeah, he would been announced for doing episode nine.

1952
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:46,500
So he's doing it.

1953
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,880
Can I just can I just knock one out real quick?

1954
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:49,820
It's called Book of Henry.

1955
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,000
It won't trouble anybody.

1956
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,240
One for them, one for me.

1957
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,140
You'll see it's yeah.

1958
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,980
But it's going to be one for them, too.

1959
01:15:54,980 --> 01:16:01,500
People are going to want to see Sickleman and a woman doing an assassination guided by her dead son.

1960
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,340
Watch the movie if you haven't seen the movie.

1961
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:03,840
Yes.

1962
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,880
I beseech you to watch Book of Henry.

1963
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,020
But here's what I did.

1964
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,000
I was like, what is the root of Colin?

1965
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:14,800
And I and on Wikipedia, there's a mention of Colin's first short film from 2002.

1966
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,740
It's called Home Base.

1967
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:22,540
Home Base is a movie where it's a short film, eight minutes, but a lot is packed into it.

1968
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:25,760
It's very like mini DV, like old blocky digital.

1969
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:31,800
And basically, it's about a woman who comes to her boyfriend and says, you know,

1970
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:37,920
I have to tell you, this is hard, but I had a connection with with with your boss at the company

1971
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:43,000
picnic, and it just made me feel like maybe we need to end this and this isn't, you know,

1972
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:43,840
I'm just so sorry.

1973
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,320
I feel terrible about it, but maybe we aren't meant to be.

1974
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:50,000
And then the guy is this kind of snarkster Craig Healy guy.

1975
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,980
And he's like, OK, all right.

1976
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,120
Well, you know what I'm going to do?

1977
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,680
I'm going to fuck your mom.

1978
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,300
Excuse me?

1979
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:58,020
Yeah, I'm going to fuck your mom.

1980
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,840
Why don't you go home and tell your mom,

1981
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,160
get ready to get fucked.

1982
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:02,260
Whoa, whoa, you can't.

1983
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:02,960
Hey, hey, hey.

1984
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,360
And he leaves the restaurant.

1985
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,640
And then sure enough, the next scene is him showing up at

1986
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,760
the house like, I'm here for Mildred.

1987
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,380
And then he goes on a date with the woman's mom.

1988
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:17,260
And then it's unclear whether anything's happened or not.

1989
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,540
But the woman has a fight with her mom.

1990
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,260
And then this is yeah, this is the mom character.

1991
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:26,880
Is it such a shock that your mother wants to fuck?

1992
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:32,160
Your mother wants to fuck.

1993
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:39,580
And then and so it's this is the very the first sparkles of the

1994
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:40,380
Travarro filmmaking.

1995
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:42,780
No podcast has ever tackled this.

1996
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:49,240
Although Wikipedia claims that this was like this movie had 25 million views in a pre YouTube

1997
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:49,680
world.

1998
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:51,760
This was like an eye film.

1999
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:56,920
Yeah, it might have been like, do you see this mom fucking movie?

2000
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,300
I mean, I guess that I could see like college kids being like,

2001
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,380
do you see the wall with the old lady says she wants to fuck.

2002
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,920
I guess I could kind of see that logic.

2003
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:12,120
And if there's not a lot of stuff, if he put it

2004
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,180
Travarro's vimeo channel.

2005
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:14,960
Oh, wow.

2006
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,040
Listed as him.

2007
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:18,760
But anyway, this is too much for the woman.

2008
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,120
And she goes to the husband

2009
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,080
almost in the side of the ex boyfriend, almost in tears.

2010
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,420
And she's like, I'm sorry.

2011
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:24,780
Okay,

2012
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,860
I just don't want this.

2013
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,660
Please don't have sex with my mom.

2014
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:28,840
Whatever I did.

2015
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:29,740
I'm just sorry.

2016
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,200
I don't she's like breaking down.

2017
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:35,160
And the and the guy's response is like, hey, hey, it's okay.

2018
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,600
I don't think you're shallow.

2019
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,740
I think you've got something wrong.

2020
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,040
You're just emotionally

2021
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:40,980
disconnected.

2022
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:43,100
I mean, that whole orgasm thing.

2023
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,120
It's not my fault if you can't come.

2024
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:45,940
I've tried

2025
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:46,340
everything.

2026
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,340
You've done everything.

2027
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,220
You're just you're emotionally frigid.

2028
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:49,860
You're physically

2029
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:50,320
frigid.

2030
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,580
And she just listens and agrees.

2031
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,200
And that's the end of the movie.

2032
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:57,960
And no, because the end of the movie is she comes downstairs.

2033
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:00,300
And the guy's there in a bathrobe and

2034
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,740
clearly did fuck her mom.

2035
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:05,280
The end directed by Colin Travarro.

2036
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,380
Now you know that now the audience

2037
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:09,620
knows that it's about it's a movie.

2038
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:20,100
It's a movie about a hero who says you'll have sex with a mom,

2039
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:25,280
then says you were too frigid to come then does have sex with the mom.

2040
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,600
And this is where it ends.

2041
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:30,640
This is who is in charge of the Jurassic Park franchise.

2042
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,680
Well, Steven, did you know that?

2043
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:38,220
No, I mean, I think he's done.

2044
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,640
If you want to do the Donald Trump, I'm hearing this for the first

2045
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,020
time.

2046
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,360
I've never heard this before.

2047
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,620
She was very frigid, very frigid.

2048
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:50,340
He told us safety's not

2049
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,040
guaranteed.

2050
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:56,020
My thing is that, you know, it's one of those things where, you know, Jurassic Park

2051
01:19:56,020 --> 01:20:00,060
fans are very much like, well, yeah, there's not going to be any more movies like clearly, like,

2052
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:05,200
as much as people enjoyed the movies enough, you know, Transformers style, like nobody's holding on

2053
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,720
to Claire and Owen in the same way that maybe like a Marvel.

2054
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:10,180
Well, now we've been saying that now

2055
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,140
doesn't matter anymore.

2056
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,440
Nobody wants Marvel anymore.

2057
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,780
But like, I feel like at least Bryce

2058
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:20,700
Ellis Howard lately has, like, done some of the best Star Wars.

2059
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:22,680
Like she's been a really great

2060
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,420
television director.

2061
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:28,500
And I feel like just let her have these movies because I feel like she at least

2062
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:34,040
I always feel like all blockbuster movies have like one actor who's like actually nerdy and into

2063
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,320
the thing that they're in.

2064
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:40,880
And I feel like she has been kind of actually been like, oh, I know what

2065
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:46,080
it's like to run away from green screen dinosaurs, like actors on the volume and stuff like I can,

2066
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:52,140
you know, oh, yeah, help you like to help you sell stuff better and not just be lot like,

2067
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,600
because I imagine movies like this.

2068
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,060
Michael J.

2069
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,440
Fox talked about this and Back to the Future,

2070
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:00,700
very good that you can like, everybody's so worried about effects and all the like, you know,

2071
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:05,820
the big meaty stuff that you the actor ends up like alone and like nobody's tending.

2072
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,460
Nobody's really directing them.

2073
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,250
I mean, even like,

2074
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:16,100
oh my God, I was gonna say Gantov, Sir Ian McKellen, even like, you know, if you watch those,

2075
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:19,920
like the making of Hobbit movies, he's like having like a mental breakdown.

2076
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:20,840
He's just like

2077
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:26,940
in a green room by himself having to act against like 12 dwarves and Martin Freeman, you know,

2078
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,980
this was going around.

2079
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:32,800
I think I'm probably like stealing the framing of this as like an

2080
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,560
existential nightmare.

2081
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,280
But there was footage that came like raw footage of Space Jam and like what

2082
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,920
that was like for Michael Jordan, where like, like and action and then he's on a green screen

2083
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,520
and then he's swarmed by four fully green guys.

2084
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,480
He has to defend the basketball against it.

2085
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,720
It is a true nightmare.

2086
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:51,300
Yeah.

2087
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:51,800
Yeah.

2088
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,900
My hope is that because I mean, they're gonna make it's like

2089
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:55,840
that was that thing too.

2090
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,160
It's like, well, they're done after dress code.

2091
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,140
It's like, no, they're not.

2092
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:02,740
Like, like, like, I think they I think they're putting it on ice in the sense because I think

2093
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:07,520
people are realizing that like when you don't miss a movie franchise, you're like gonna get

2094
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,860
sick of it because with every day going on.

2095
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,880
But like, I feel like, yeah, just get Bryce Ellis

2096
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:18,540
Howard, who's kind of like used to like working on like leaner TV settings, kind of make it smaller

2097
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:19,340
again.

2098
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:25,060
You know, all that stuff where it's like, yeah, and then get Clint Howard to pop in maybe.

2099
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:27,520
I'm surprised he's never been in a dress in a lab.

2100
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:28,020
Yeah.

2101
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,140
Oh my God.

2102
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:29,580
Yeah.

2103
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:30,640
What's the second

2104
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,060
Jurassic?

2105
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,220
It's fallen kingdom.

2106
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:32,600
Yeah.

2107
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,020
That's the haunted house one.

2108
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:35,380
Yeah.

2109
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:36,580
Like I really like

2110
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:36,840
No.

2111
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:37,040
Yeah.

2112
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:37,940
I really love that too.

2113
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:41,160
That whole part is because J Bayona directed that one.

2114
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,420
And so

2115
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,620
he did like the impossible and some other stuff.

2116
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:46,800
But like horror movies.

2117
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:47,220
Yeah.

2118
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:47,760
Oh, yeah.

2119
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:48,660
The orphanage

2120
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,020
and stuff.

2121
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:52,600
And it's like, you know, I think dinosaurs are scary.

2122
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,760
You know, leaning into that

2123
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,040
might help a little bit.

2124
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:56,440
Right.

2125
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:56,760
Yeah.

2126
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:56,980
Yeah.

2127
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:59,440
And is Cromwell in that?

2128
01:22:59,440 --> 01:22:59,820
Yeah.

2129
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:00,660
James Cromwell's in that.

2130
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:04,300
Like, uh, John Hammond's old friend.

2131
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:04,560
Yeah.

2132
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:07,180
The hidden, the hidden partner that like the hidden

2133
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:07,680
partner.

2134
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:07,900
Yeah.

2135
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:12,220
And he, he, I think just when you have an actor of that caliber, it just kind of

2136
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:13,780
like lifts everything.

2137
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:18,000
Well, and Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter is also in it as the, as the nanny,

2138
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,220
Geraldine Chaplin.

2139
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:19,580
Yeah.

2140
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:21,760
Cause she's in all of J Bayona's movies.

2141
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:23,000
So interesting.

2142
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,580
That's interesting.

2143
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:24,140
Yeah.

2144
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:25,100
Charm.

2145
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,640
Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter.

2146
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:27,700
Yeah.

2147
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:28,560
Yeah.

2148
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,000
Um, yeah.

2149
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,040
Well, yeah, it made some

2150
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:33,980
cool choices, but ultimately at the end of the day, not enough mom fucking for me.

2151
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:34,920
That is

2152
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:36,500
true.

2153
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,020
That's what the franchise needs.

2154
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,940
Maybe that's what T-Rex's mom.

2155
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,240
Was that what his episode

2156
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,320
nine was going to be?

2157
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,020
Yeah.

2158
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,020
It was going to be like sort of an ending like that.

2159
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:46,960
Yeah.

2160
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:47,280
Yeah.

2161
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:47,980
All right.

2162
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,180
We, we know I am your father, but we haven't, we haven't heard.

2163
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,380
I fucked your

2164
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:52,860
father.

2165
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,260
The Knights of Ren are going to say that to Kylo.

2166
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,340
Oh, about Princess Leia.

2167
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,180
Rest in peace, Gary Fisher.

2168
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:03,120
All right.

2169
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:04,840
Let's, let's talk some ride stuff.

2170
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:05,660
You guys, there's already

2171
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:10,800
been some emotional reaction to like the big parts of it, but let's, let's throw out then.

2172
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,200
And I leave

2173
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:15,140
it to you cause I can't, uh, what, what, like, I dunno.

2174
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,840
Well, let's, let's talk like favorite moment.

2175
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:20,460
If you, if you had to pick a number one, cause it seems like there's a lot of candidates, but what is,

2176
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,580
what is the, the peak of that ride experience for you?

2177
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:25,280
I mean, it, they, they talk about in the making

2178
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:31,920
of special that it kind of builds in a way that like a lot of roller coasters that first drop

2179
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:39,360
and then like maybe some bunny Hills or some inversions, but like Velasco's or does seemingly

2180
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:46,900
get more intense as you go on, like that, uh, launch up to the top hat, you know, the biggest

2181
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:47,740
part.

2182
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,640
This phrase is new to me by the way.

2183
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:50,740
The top hat.

2184
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:51,080
Yeah.

2185
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:51,280
Yeah.

2186
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,700
That big kind of like straight

2187
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,440
up and down on a curve.

2188
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,840
It's almost like what's the Knott's one.

2189
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,820
That's just that.

2190
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:00,300
Montezuma's revenge.

2191
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:00,640
Yeah.

2192
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,980
Just that up and down really.

2193
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,220
Kingda Ka, Six Flags, Great Adventure and

2194
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:05,880
Jersey.

2195
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,840
That has the famous one.

2196
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:09,320
Yes.

2197
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:12,940
Where it's that's most of the ride is the top hat, but this

2198
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:15,080
is like halfway through the second launch.

2199
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,400
That's like one of seven things.

2200
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:16,820
Yeah.

2201
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,220
And then the finale,

2202
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:19,500
the barrel roll.

2203
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:23,840
I also saw it called a heartline roll or the Moses source role

2204
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:30,780
is such a surprising, but like, it is so crazy to go over the water upside down.

2205
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,440
Yeah.

2206
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:35,920
Well, and I think, you know, again, like I was also scared of roller coasters as a kid.

2207
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,160
And

2208
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:42,380
I remember first time going on Indiana Jones at Disneyland, I held on like this and like, I

2209
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,300
remember being rattled and stuff like that.

2210
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:46,280
And I think the thing about the Veloci coaster that,

2211
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:52,480
you know, maybe you might be able to do Scott is that like, because it's so smooth, you, I like,

2212
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,240
you aren't like huddled down.

2213
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,900
You are kind of getting to like enjoy everything.

2214
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:57,320
And I feel

2215
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:02,260
like it's that it's those parts where you're like doing these like twists and there's that part.

2216
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:07,900
It's like, I forget what point it is where it kind of like, it kind of dips you down and then

2217
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:08,700
kind of, but like, does it.

2218
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:09,860
It's like a fake out almost.

2219
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:09,960
Yeah.

2220
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:10,100
Yeah.

2221
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,480
It's like a second half.

2222
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:11,860
It

2223
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:15,080
kind of like feels like you're going to dip, like let's say, I don't remember the direction,

2224
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,200
dip left, but then it takes you right back.

2225
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,620
It's like this almost like fake out thing that happens

2226
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:20,000
too.

2227
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:20,600
Yeah.

2228
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:24,500
And it is like a thing where they're like, you know, I guess the, yeah, the story,

2229
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,400
like, you know, at the beginning, it's like one, two, three, and you're like, the Raptors are

2230
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,260
running with you and you're like, I'm not really thinking about that when I'm on the ride, but

2231
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:36,200
those little moments, like that fake out and stuff where you're like, I can remember the whole,

2232
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:41,320
I can like remember the order of things on the ride, maybe a little bit better than other roller

2233
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:41,740
coasters.

2234
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:42,500
Yeah.

2235
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:46,460
Because like, obviously like in credit coaster for like, you remember, okay,

2236
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,940
like what are the best parts of it?

2237
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:50,240
And now there's like little characters on it, which, but,

2238
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,000
but basically you're like, you're remembering the launch.

2239
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:53,620
You're remembering when you kind of go up

2240
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,600
a little high and you go on that big drop.

2241
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:59,940
And then you remember this going in the loop and then the

2242
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:00,840
bouncy thing.

2243
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:08,140
It's honestly what makes it like hard to talk about roller coasters on a podcast,

2244
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:12,880
because it's, you end up so as a part where you go up and then the part where that kind of that,

2245
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,580
that twist and that, but this, this is different.

2246
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,620
These, these moments definitely read as like

2247
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:24,060
notable, that kind of go in a, in a sequence that you recall.

2248
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:24,540
Right.

2249
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:25,540
And it feels, because it's a

2250
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:26,200
short ride.

2251
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,340
It's very, what is it?

2252
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:30,320
It's 90, shorter than 90 seconds.

2253
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:32,660
The YouTube video is like a minute

2254
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:36,760
and 32, but that's with like the intro, you know, Velocicoaster.

2255
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,780
Is it by the way in when is the

2256
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:46,020
launch, is the idea that you're going to go through a Velociraptor paddock, but they're going to be

2257
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:50,300
taking care of, you know, they're, they're sedated or putting their place in whatever,

2258
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:56,380
but then they kind of, there's like rattling and they break out when you're, as you launch,

2259
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,540
is that roughly correct?

2260
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:57,840
Yeah.

2261
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:00,640
I feel, well, cause in the Jurassic world, when they like let them

2262
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:05,920
out to go like ride, I was going to say ride motorcycles, but that was like somebody CGI'd

2263
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:11,180
that, but like when they're all running with Chris Pratt, like I think it's almost meant to kind of

2264
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:15,220
replicate that moment of like, like, like the race horses or whatever.

2265
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,660
It's like one, two, three,

2266
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:21,860
go, but yeah, I can't, I'm like, I feel like they let them out on purpose.

2267
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,840
Oh, maybe that's like what

2268
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,320
Pratt doesn't want is that like, wait, you're going to like have them race a little bit.

2269
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:29,540
Yeah.

2270
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:29,720
Yeah.

2271
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,580
My Raptors.

2272
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:35,360
Well, cause it's almost like treating it like it's an exercise, you know, how people do

2273
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,880
like, you know, like sea world or whatever.

2274
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,120
It's kind of like, you know, I was like,

2275
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:42,980
is Jurassic world the bush gardens of theme parks, you know, where it's like,

2276
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,980
in sea world where it's like coasters and animals, you know, together?

2277
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,220
I guess so.

2278
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:49,400
And there's,

2279
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:56,500
you know, the statues of the Raptors in the, at the first parts of the ride, you kind of go through

2280
01:28:56,980 --> 01:29:01,800
a look when we were riding this again, I did not, I took my glasses off.

2281
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,240
So I didn't catch

2282
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:10,380
some of the like riding details as you're riding, but you're going so fast.

2283
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:10,820
Yeah.

2284
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,100
But the sound is

2285
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:12,260
great.

2286
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:19,460
Like your Raptor cries that are startling as you're going through it, like 50 miles or

2287
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:21,200
60 miles an hour or whatever.

2288
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:21,580
Yeah.

2289
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:24,320
That is the thing I forgot about, but like thinking about it

2290
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:28,540
again, that's the part I think that also adds a little bit to the thrills is yeah, they'll have

2291
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:31,420
like Raptor screams kind of call out occasionally.

2292
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:34,260
Just there's Raptors on the ride that I never saw.

2293
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:38,300
I never noticed like actual like little static figures.

2294
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,840
I caught one of them.

2295
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,080
Yeah, I caught

2296
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:40,620
one of them.

2297
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:46,060
Like I had to watch a video weeks later and go, Oh, there's Raptors on the ride.

2298
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:49,960
There's also a Raptor statues at the entrance.

2299
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:52,640
And I saw that on a lot of Easter egg lists of

2300
01:29:52,640 --> 01:30:01,570
that's sort of a nod to the now long gone dueling dragons attraction, which had big

2301
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:04,200
dragon statues at the entrance.

2302
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,220
Yeah, I'm wrong.

2303
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:06,320
It's two minutes.

2304
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:07,160
It is longer than I thought.

2305
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:07,560
It's two minutes.

2306
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,360
But it's still short, short ride.

2307
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:11,300
By the way, of course we all know those

2308
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:15,740
dragons on dueling dragons, uh, uh, Blizz Rock and Pyrock.

2309
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:21,000
Uh, uh, yeah, Blizz Rock is the ice

2310
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:21,480
dragon.

2311
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,120
Pyrock is the fire dragon.

2312
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:25,820
We all know they were back.

2313
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,820
They were back for a haunted

2314
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:28,240
house.

2315
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,940
They were back for a, a haunted maze.

2316
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,680
My question is that a fact you learned in the

2317
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:38,040
last several months or did you know that love it, memorize it, pray to it at night?

2318
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:38,660
I knew it.

2319
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:43,760
And then I, I double checked it last night because I'm like, what are their names again?

2320
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:50,640
And I couldn't quite find, I, I had heard at some point, but it couldn't quite confirm last night

2321
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:53,560
that those are the names of the Raptors at the entrance.

2322
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:56,220
But I think just like a little nod,

2323
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:01,700
cause you can get to a velocity coaster from lowest continent.

2324
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:03,020
I believe they demolished

2325
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:05,180
the bridge and then rebuilt the bridge.

2326
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:10,000
Mom, dad, can I call you guys Blizz Rock and Pyrock

2327
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,660
instead?

2328
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:13,520
I'm getting a little bored of mom and dad.

2329
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,680
It's like how we all remember blue,

2330
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,260
Charlie, Delta and Echo.

2331
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,080
Charlie's the young one who's light green.

2332
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,120
Delta's the handsome one.

2333
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,180
Echo's got glasses.

2334
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,280
Echo does machines.

2335
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:32,320
Blue cannot be called beta cause she is an alpha.

2336
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,000
So you have color blue.

2337
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:34,660
Yeah.

2338
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:35,620
We can, oh, sorry.

2339
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:37,560
No, I was just going to say, yeah, like, uh,

2340
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,820
or what we actually, let me ask you, do you have a favorite of these Raptors?

2341
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:41,980
I like Charlie cause

2342
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:43,340
she's like the young one.

2343
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,120
And she was also like, it is funny when they were like,

2344
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:49,900
we're going to make these Raptors and we're going to put like a blue stripe on blue cause you know,

2345
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:50,940
they're birds, whatever.

2346
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:55,760
But, but you know, it's like that again, attention to realism.

2347
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:56,280
We're like,

2348
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,220
why didn't you make one of them like red?

2349
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,580
So then at least we have like blue, red,

2350
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,140
brown and green.

2351
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:05,360
Cause Charlie's also the other one to me that stood out the most cause

2352
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,420
she was like bright green.

2353
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:10,760
And then she's the one that gets exploded by the rocket launcher

2354
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:16,120
at the end of the, where like Chris pets like, Oh, like my old friend.

2355
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:17,100
And then she like looks at

2356
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:20,680
him and then just explodes.

2357
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:26,260
And then I think, I think I can't remember which one it was.

2358
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:30,060
Delta or echo that gets thrown onto the like, it wasn't Margaritaville.

2359
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:31,540
It was the other restaurant

2360
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:35,100
gets thrown onto the, to the grill, the Hibachi grill.

2361
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,280
Oh, that's cool.

2362
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:38,720
I know looking back,

2363
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:41,780
like they wanted us to love these dinosaurs.

2364
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,060
And then in fallen kingdom, they show you footage of

2365
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:46,600
them when they're babies and they're like, what happened to that?

2366
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,080
Oh yeah.

2367
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,300
And like onto the

2368
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:50,000
Hibachi grill.

2369
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:52,840
Oh, they blew up in the, what was that?

2370
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,860
A chink burger rim or burger lounge.

2371
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:55,220
The one

2372
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:58,260
that was like a massive Ponzi scheme or something.

2373
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:01,140
It like popped up everywhere for a little while.

2374
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:04,380
And then eventually they're like, Oh, this isn't a real company.

2375
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:04,580
Yeah.

2376
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,440
It's just money laundry.

2377
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:05,760
Close.

2378
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:12,240
You throw out these, these terms, these like, like a little roller coaster

2379
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,320
terminologies, the, the, there's top hat.

2380
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:19,300
And then there's, I had not heard inverted stall.

2381
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:25,960
You have an inverted stall on this, which means, cause you got four inversions on this ride all

2382
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:26,320
told.

2383
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:31,540
And then there is one where, okay, if you're, if you're flipping the whole time,

2384
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:36,680
if you're spinning the entire time, that's not a, that's an inversion, not a stall.

2385
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:42,920
And what this has is a moment where you flip and then you stay fully upside down for two to three

2386
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,280
seconds and then flip again.

2387
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:46,460
So I think that's a rare moment to find.

2388
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:48,240
That's the end thing.

2389
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:48,540
Yeah.

2390
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:49,120
Over the water.

2391
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:49,900
That's the water.

2392
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:51,360
No, that's a barrel roll.

2393
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,140
In the middle.

2394
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:52,500
Oh, right.

2395
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:52,700
They're

2396
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:58,780
saying, it doesn't stand out in a ride video where like twist and turn and then like it does like

2397
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:01,640
get still for a second for, and then flips again.

2398
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,580
I'm trying to remember what that specific one is.

2399
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:04,800
That's after the top hat.

2400
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:05,680
Is that right?

2401
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:06,980
I think so.

2402
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:07,620
After the top.

2403
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,160
Yeah.

2404
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:08,460
Yeah.

2405
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:08,760
Yeah.

2406
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:09,380
Cause that's

2407
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:13,560
when it, yeah, you go up and then you're heading towards the visitor center or the old visitor

2408
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:13,980
center.

2409
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:14,820
Oh, okay.

2410
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:15,040
Yeah.

2411
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,200
Yeah.

2412
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:15,260
Yeah.

2413
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:17,240
When the fake out happens or does it fit?

2414
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:17,600
Yeah.

2415
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,520
It's so built

2416
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,020
into the land.

2417
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,460
Like it is for such an intense ride.

2418
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,600
It is not like obtrusive.

2419
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,200
No, no.

2420
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:26,780
To where,

2421
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:33,160
if you're entering it from the Jurassic park Island, you got to follow like kind of a winding

2422
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:33,480
path.

2423
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,420
It's kind of hidden.

2424
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,100
It is hidden.

2425
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:35,980
Yeah.

2426
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:36,300
Yeah.

2427
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:36,960
Yeah.

2428
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:37,300
It is.

2429
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:38,740
I also was like, I had a problem

2430
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:39,480
finding it.

2431
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:43,340
I was wandering around tired that day and I was like, wait, where is this?

2432
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:44,340
I see it,

2433
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,900
but I don't, I can't get to it.

2434
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:50,000
A fact, I think someone down there told us about when they were

2435
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,960
building this, you know, because they talk in the special, like, oh, this construction site,

2436
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:57,880
there was no backstage.

2437
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,500
Like we, we work far from backstage.

2438
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,940
So I, when they were transporting

2439
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:10,100
materials, sometimes they use the old Island skipper tour dock, which is kind of off to the

2440
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:17,120
side of Jurassic park because it's just easier to put it on a barge at port of entry and sail it

2441
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:17,580
across.

2442
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:21,920
Well, I mean, yeah, when I, when I worked at Disneyland in high school, I worked at pizza

2443
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,660
port and then our ice machines broke one time.

2444
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,420
This was like 2004, I think.

2445
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:27,700
Yeah.

2446
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:27,740
Yeah.

2447
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:27,920
It was

2448
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,760
like a couple of years after California adventure had opened.

2449
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,340
But I remember that we wanted to get

2450
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:34,700
ice from club buzz or whatever it's called.

2451
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:39,220
And instead of having us go like through just that

2452
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:44,100
like courtyard or wherever we went through the underground tunnels, because we had this big ice,

2453
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:48,720
I had to like drag this big ice bucket thing and they just didn't want, I guess they didn't want

2454
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:54,240
to run over kids or, you know, just to, just to not ruin the illusion, but, or, or just even that

2455
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:59,340
idea of like we're, we're in the middle of this thing and, and like maybe just putting on a boat

2456
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:03,920
is actually just like, so we don't have to go through crowds in order to try and navigate the

2457
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:04,380
stuff or whatever.

2458
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,020
Yeah.

2459
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:10,220
It seems like, um, in this, according to the special, because building

2460
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:16,820
this crazy ride in the middle of the park is very difficult, then COVID hits, but COVID, then you

2461
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:18,340
got nobody in the park anymore.

2462
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,820
So it might've helped them drive like a truck through.

2463
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,820
A flat bed through Susslanding trees are about to happen.

2464
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,720
They're tear down the Dr.

2465
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:32,360
Sussland.

2466
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,140
Yeah.

2467
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:36,780
Oh, the Ford F 150 clip the side of the three brooms.

2468
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:39,480
Yeah.

2469
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:43,900
Uh, I was saying earlier, the first thing, one of the first things that happens is that they

2470
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:46,880
shoot you over these, like this rock formation.

2471
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,640
And when you're coming down, correct me if I'm

2472
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:53,420
wrong or you didn't think this, it feels like they're teasing, throwing you into rocks.

2473
01:36:54,280 --> 01:37:00,440
No, I kind of, I felt that it was, cause yeah, it's not like, it's not like, um, oh my God,

2474
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:06,320
why am I forgetting the Yeti, um, thunder mountain or whatever matter horn matter horn.

2475
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:06,560
Yeah.

2476
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:06,780
Matter

2477
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:11,600
horn where it's like, you know, like they're not like letting you know that a cave is coming up.

2478
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,580
Like this is just kind of a big pile of rocks that you're sort of heading towards.

2479
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:15,120
And then I

2480
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:19,040
think, I feel like it'd be surprised when you hit a turn and yeah, I feel like it becomes clear.

2481
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:23,840
Cause I think that's like, again, I don't really remember where the Raptor statues are, but I feel

2482
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,280
like there's one kind of over by there.

2483
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,960
Maybe that like, maybe it's almost like, oh, like, you know,

2484
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:32,520
we got to turn and get out of the way or something like that.

2485
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,320
Um, I can't remember if there's a

2486
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,560
Raptor statue right there.

2487
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:38,760
Um, this I feel like is the first part of the ride where you get some

2488
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:43,580
decent air, which is where your body first goes, Oh, I'm going to fly out and I'm just going to hit

2489
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:47,480
these rocks in such an aggressive manner, beautiful plants.

2490
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,600
But your adrenaline has surged so much,

2491
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:53,480
hopefully fingers crossed that you're just like, great, let it happen.

2492
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:54,740
Let's go.

2493
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:55,100
Yeah.

2494
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,680
I throw me into these rocks.

2495
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,600
That's what I need.

2496
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:58,860
Yeah.

2497
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:00,220
Like, like Steven, you're doing a pose.

2498
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:03,220
That's kind of a, just like giving yourself to the Lord.

2499
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:04,700
That's what I need to do.

2500
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:05,040
Yeah.

2501
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:05,780
Yeah.

2502
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:09,360
I can't restrict myself and tighten and close myself.

2503
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,660
I have to just, I gotta open my chest

2504
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:15,100
and just like create myself to be in it.

2505
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:16,800
I was a freak doing Dr.

2506
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,580
Dooms Fearful for the first time

2507
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:19,420
that I was there.

2508
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:24,020
I mean, it was shorter obviously, but this, yeah, there's this weird euphoria that

2509
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:24,920
this ride gives me.

2510
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:25,360
Yeah.

2511
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,280
But it's exciting.

2512
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,120
You want to give Lord Doom your fear juice.

2513
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:31,980
Well, of course I want to give Lord Doom my fear juice.

2514
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,220
I gave him my fear juice.

2515
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:34,020
That wretched

2516
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:37,240
Richard is up to his old busy body trip.

2517
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:37,580
Yes.

2518
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,800
And I, but I, but I didn't even,

2519
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,840
I didn't even feel that I had fear juice left.

2520
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,540
I didn't know there was any fear left in me,

2521
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:43,920
Andrea and Velocicoaster.

2522
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,400
Sure.

2523
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,460
I got a way to refill my fear juice.

2524
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:46,800
Yeah.

2525
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,280
But I don't even,

2526
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:48,040
it just was in there.

2527
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,220
I didn't even use it.

2528
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:49,420
Yeah.

2529
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,040
I barely has any fear juice.

2530
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,120
Quick, squeeze his

2531
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:52,580
nuts.

2532
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,400
Lower the lap harness.

2533
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:59,640
Doom's Doom is better at getting the fear juice out of me than Velocicoaster

2534
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:00,800
than Owen and Claire.

2535
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:01,320
Yeah.

2536
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,840
And look, I don't want to, I don't want to, you know, toot our own horn,

2537
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:10,580
but shout out to the person who worked on this, who I know is a listener of this show who I've

2538
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:11,180
talked to.

2539
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:14,860
So I don't want to blow up their spot too much, but sure.

2540
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:15,180
Yeah.

2541
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:15,900
Thank you for

2542
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:15,900
all.

2543
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,060
Thank you for getting up there.

2544
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:19,020
It was an incredible coaster.

2545
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:19,500
Yeah.

2546
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:20,080
Yeah.

2547
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,120
Do you think about

2548
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:21,940
it once a week?

2549
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,340
Both of Steven and Jason?

2550
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:24,120
Velocicoaster?

2551
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:24,960
At least once a week.

2552
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:25,800
Do you think about it?

2553
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,840
Cause I do.

2554
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,540
Once a week I go, oh, that Velocicoaster is good.

2555
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,200
Well, I did something very nerdy where,

2556
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:36,280
cause I got a projector and so I just put the projector as big as possible on the wall and

2557
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,220
then projected the Velocicoaster video.

2558
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:38,920
Oh, really?

2559
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:40,900
Like it's kind of sat in the middle just to be

2560
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:44,380
like, can I, can I replicate that feeling a little bit?

2561
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:47,760
Cause this would, I mean, you know, I had a

2562
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:52,040
Quest 2 for a minute and like one of the first things you can do is like a roller coaster

2563
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,520
VR experience or whatever.

2564
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:56,420
And it's just, it's not quite the same.

2565
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:58,180
Cause if you're just, you know,

2566
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:03,580
if you're just standing or something, it's not, you know, you're not, you're not really getting at it.

2567
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:03,840
Yeah.

2568
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:04,800
Yeah.

2569
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:10,680
It pops up in my YouTube recommended like videos all the time is the ride through and

2570
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:12,100
other people's ride throughs.

2571
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:16,060
And well, this, this I feel like was an early, I feel like lots more

2572
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:21,100
parks now are putting out like really good quality official videos.

2573
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,460
And this was one of the first

2574
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:31,320
ones that struck me where Universal put out like a full HD, like really good quality ride through,

2575
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:36,460
which is partially so they can just give the media this video and they don't have to worry

2576
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:42,120
about people with GoPros, like electronics flying off their person, you know?

2577
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:42,580
Why not?

2578
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:43,060
Cause it

2579
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,160
ruin it.

2580
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:48,320
I mean, I guess it might spoil a surprise or two, but it's like an entirely different thing

2581
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:49,800
on it.

2582
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,040
I would imagine.

2583
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,260
Maybe I'll know.

2584
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:57,000
I mean, this and guardians, I managed to avoid like spoilers.

2585
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:02,840
So I was really surprised by a lot of elements on both these roller coasters.

2586
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:03,220
Yeah.

2587
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:03,340
Yeah.

2588
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:03,940
For sure.

2589
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:07,760
Especially gardens, obviously because there's more like stuff to look at.

2590
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:08,200
Yeah.

2591
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:08,880
Yeah.

2592
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:09,380
Which obviously

2593
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:12,140
those are pretty horrendous ride through videos.

2594
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:15,720
You might watch that and think like this ride

2595
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,580
isn't that good.

2596
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:17,180
You got that one.

2597
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:18,220
You really got to be on.

2598
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:18,520
Yeah.

2599
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:18,720
I agree.

2600
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:18,860
Yeah.

2601
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:19,740
It's hard to replicate

2602
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:24,460
like in the dark and, and those sensations and that kind of thing.

2603
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:24,820
Yeah.

2604
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:25,040
Yeah.

2605
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:25,360
Well, yeah.

2606
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:25,840
I don't

2607
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,960
think a video space mountain would be the best thing to watch either.

2608
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:30,960
Let me throw out this,

2609
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,340
this debate if we're kind of heading for the door, because we kind of left this at guardians,

2610
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:37,640
because guardians, obviously a big candidate for best ride in Orlando.

2611
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,960
This one has to be as well.

2612
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:46,600
I mean, I did a little poll online to see what people thought, but let's, let's get the,

2613
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,180
do we, do we have knee jerks?

2614
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,720
Mike, I'm just going to make you.

2615
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:52,740
I got texted an angry.

2616
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:53,000
You got 10

2617
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,360
seconds.

2618
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:55,240
Oh, 10 seconds.

2619
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:56,920
Let the man cook.

2620
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:57,840
No, what are you saying?

2621
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,640
My heart.

2622
01:41:58,800 --> 01:41:59,720
Well, I was going to say

2623
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,960
a friend of the show, Matt Cardona angrily texted me when I threw out the idea that

2624
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,560
Velocicoaster could be better than guardians.

2625
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,460
Cause he said, are we not theme park people that like

2626
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:07,020
themes?

2627
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:14,240
And, and it was like, well, that's true, but here's what, here's what I'll say.

2628
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:17,600
My heart wants to say Velocicoaster is my favorite.

2629
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,020
I think that's my answer.

2630
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,320
Well, and it doesn't even

2631
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:23,240
it's a viable, a lot of people have that answer.

2632
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:23,780
It's not crazy.

2633
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,720
It doesn't make sense intellectually.

2634
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:31,300
You know how when you, sometimes your heart and your mind say different things, my mind wants to

2635
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:33,500
say guardians, everything about it.

2636
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:34,980
I like the movies better.

2637
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:37,060
I like, I'm a big rock and roll fan,

2638
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:42,540
as you know, as everyone knows that it's a new, it's innovative in the way that it turns of guardians.

2639
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:43,160
It's amazing.

2640
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:46,460
And the, the, the way it looks like you're in space, but it's bright.

2641
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:47,660
I love it.

2642
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:47,900
It's

2643
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:48,540
amazing.

2644
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:53,100
But my heart says that I like Velocicoaster better.

2645
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:54,440
It just does.

2646
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,660
It does things to my body

2647
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:58,880
that guardians does not.

2648
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:05,880
It's a smooth, crazy experience that it can't like, it doesn't, again,

2649
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:06,600
it doesn't even matter.

2650
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:09,020
This could be a, this could be the book of Henry ride.

2651
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:10,620
It does not matter.

2652
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,860
It could be themed to a short film.

2653
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:16,600
They only be Watson's truly the physical experience you have on

2654
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,540
it to race to sickleman's house.

2655
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:19,980
Great.

2656
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:21,400
Fine.

2657
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,040
So again, there's like a static of the guy in the

2658
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:25,860
end, like right by the barrel roll.

2659
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:29,720
I am the, I am the police.

2660
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,640
So I'm above the law.

2661
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:34,080
It doesn't, oh, that's from the short film.

2662
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,240
I got confused with sickleman.

2663
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:35,640
Sorry.

2664
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:37,920
I'm getting my Travaros mixed up.

2665
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:38,340
All right.

2666
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:39,220
It's the, it's home base.

2667
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:40,360
The ride it's home base.

2668
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:42,740
You're on a race to fuck your ex's mom.

2669
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:42,900
Right.

2670
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:43,320
Right.

2671
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:43,700
Hurry.

2672
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:44,780
Somebody else might.

2673
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:45,360
The couple's

2674
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,320
having an argument in the pre show about fucking the mother and they're like, no, don't do it.

2675
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:49,880
Let's do it.

2676
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:50,900
Well, you're frigid.

2677
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:51,840
I'm going to do it.

2678
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:56,000
But I think that maybe for the first time

2679
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:01,380
in my life, I have to say that the actual like physical experience of going on the ride

2680
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:04,340
supersedes the theming or anything else.

2681
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,040
I just, that's how I feel.

2682
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:07,020
That's what's in my heart.

2683
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:07,160
And

2684
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:09,180
I have to say my heart declared it.

2685
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:09,880
I like it.

2686
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,220
Put your neck out like a non-existent brontosaurus.

2687
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:13,840
Yeah.

2688
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,660
And declare your opinion.

2689
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:19,300
A slightly bad, like I love guardians and it's the

2690
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:20,560
second best ride in Orlando.

2691
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:21,900
Wow.

2692
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:22,840
Jason thoughts.

2693
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:23,700
Yeah.

2694
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:26,540
Um, you know, I'm the little thrill boy of

2695
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:29,320
the podcast, you know, and the thrill seeker.

2696
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:36,240
Um, so I think like, yeah, I, I did this like the last

2697
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:43,360
day before we flew out and like, was so, uh, you know, worried all week.

2698
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,660
Like I kept having chances

2699
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:49,680
to go on it, not getting on it for whatever reason, one reason or another.

2700
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:50,400
Yeah.

2701
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,360
Worried about not

2702
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:51,900
getting on it.

2703
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:54,240
This was like the one thing down there.

2704
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:55,960
I was like, I have to do this.

2705
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:56,600
So like,

2706
01:44:56,700 --> 01:45:03,880
thankfully got on the last day and I just found it to be so exciting and so satisfying.

2707
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:04,360
Yeah.

2708
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:04,860
So,

2709
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:10,220
but by, if you're declaring it best ride in Orlando, you're spitting in the face of Peter

2710
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:10,580
Parker.

2711
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:12,560
Well, willing to do that.

2712
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,300
Jason Sheridan.

2713
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:15,600
I might say best coaster.

2714
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:17,320
Uh, I don't know.

2715
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:18,100
I don't

2716
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:23,600
know about best ride cause then you start getting into the dark ride.

2717
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,640
Like I feel like guardians

2718
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:30,520
and even Hagrid's, you know, they have a lot of story beats.

2719
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:32,360
They have a lot of tricks

2720
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:37,140
that are closer to dark ride mechanics than coaster mechanics.

2721
01:45:37,740 --> 01:45:40,240
But I feel like this one has such

2722
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:46,000
exciting coaster elements with story and place making involved.

2723
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:46,620
Sure.

2724
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:47,580
Yeah.

2725
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:48,340
Yeah.

2726
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:49,180
I think it's

2727
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:57,540
definitely in the top, whether that is just like recent bias of like shiny new thing, you know,

2728
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:05,480
but I think the fact that it's built in, it's so compact and I'm, I'm, I'm so fascinated by how

2729
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:14,600
they're going to translate that thrilling compact coaster into like the hill, like universal,

2730
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:21,680
like into that land, like another sort of difficult landscape it's being built into.

2731
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:25,700
Also the rumors of like, Oh, there might be drifting elements.

2732
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,340
I think there is for sure.

2733
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:27,660
Yeah.

2734
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:32,560
It's going to be like guardians with the ability to turn, which is the drifting thing.

2735
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:38,160
And that's the word and it goes over the various going to be our favorite ride.

2736
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:42,380
And it goes over the escalator.

2737
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:43,780
It goes around the escalator.

2738
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,800
That sounds cool.

2739
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:46,080
Steven.

2740
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:46,380
I don't know

2741
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:48,080
if you've, I mean, this trip was a little while ago.

2742
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,860
You've probably missed some things that are

2743
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:53,860
potentially on the list, but do you have a knee jerk if you were to weigh in on that?

2744
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:54,200
Well, yeah.

2745
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:58,040
So I haven't been on guardians, but the thing that I can maybe compare it to a little

2746
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:02,740
bit is that, um, again, I worked at Disneyland in high school and it was all, you know, all about

2747
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:07,380
that life that, you know, and then even after I stopped working there, I got a pass and, you know,

2748
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:12,120
my friends in high school, we had a thing where we would like go in the morning and see how long we

2749
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:16,460
could go before the lines would be too long because, you know, we could just go the next day or

2750
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:16,740
whatever.

2751
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:19,780
And it was just like such a magical part of growing up.

2752
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:21,360
Um, but I hadn't been to

2753
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:25,260
Disneyland in like 10 years until last year for my birthday.

2754
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:29,060
I did basically just did, um, Batu,

2755
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:29,680
Batu.

2756
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:29,940
Yeah.

2757
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:34,040
Did, did, um, I didn't do the Millennium Falcon, but I did rise the resistance

2758
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,240
for the first time.

2759
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:38,220
And again, not to bring up any debates or anything like that, you know,

2760
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:42,860
previous debates on the podcast, but again, like Jason, like you were saying, like I think

2761
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:46,500
Velociraptor is easily my favorite roller coaster of all time.

2762
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,480
But I think for me,

2763
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:55,660
there's like a part in rise of the resist rise of the resistance where you forget that you're,

2764
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:59,400
cause like to me it's, yeah, it's like that, like you're saying the debate of like theming versus

2765
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:03,480
pure thrills, but there's like definitely a part in rise of the resistance where I'm like, I'm just

2766
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:08,520
in star wars and I just totally forget the rest of the world exists and I'm just fully immersed

2767
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:13,620
in a way that was just like, you're like, like I remember describing it to my sister, like the

2768
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:16,060
next day and I was like starting to get like teared up.

2769
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,620
I was like, I was there, you know,

2770
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:22,640
like that kind of thing, you know, like all of our favorite characters, but like, but, but you know,

2771
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:27,260
it was just one of those things where like, I think rise the resistance is like my favorite ride of

2772
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:32,560
all time because it, it even has like the history of like every kind of ride thing we have like drops,

2773
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:37,700
like like vague, yeah, it kind of like uses all the tricks.

2774
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:40,620
So for me, like rise is like my favorite,

2775
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:45,440
maybe my favorite ride of all time, but Velocicoaster just pure thrills, just like something

2776
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,340
I could like ride over and over again.

2777
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:50,100
I feel like definitely Velocicoaster is number one in that

2778
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:50,380
regard.

2779
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:50,900
Yeah.

2780
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:51,380
Yeah.

2781
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:52,140
Yeah.

2782
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:55,380
My like thing that haunted me, I couldn't stop thinking about for a long time

2783
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:57,680
was the big cannons and ride that.

2784
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:01,180
Like, I just like, yeah, I just needed to like close my eyes

2785
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:05,960
and to think about it for a couple of, and during pandemic when it was not available anymore.

2786
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:12,360
Internet, I did a little, I did like, all right, let's do four at Disney world, four at Universal,

2787
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:20,380
rise the resistance took it at Disney world, Spider-Man took it at Universal, put them together,

2788
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,840
rise the resistance by a wide margin.

2789
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:27,500
It's almost as if rise of the resistance is a good ride.

2790
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:29,740
It's a good, it's fine opinion.

2791
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,660
Yeah, good is a fine describer of it.

2792
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:32,980
I know, I know I've got my

2793
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:34,540
edge Lord opinions over here.

2794
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:35,800
It is a good way to put it.

2795
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,300
I agree to Mike's credit.

2796
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:38,060
I will say that

2797
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:42,260
now when I ride the transformers ride, I do expect him to be like, I'm proud of you.

2798
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,060
You know, like I

2799
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:49,040
like, I do, like I do get emotionally impacted by that, like that bit of score.

2800
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:49,920
Like I went and like

2801
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,220
looked up that score, like to go listen to it later.

2802
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:54,300
Like it's like, it's like actually really

2803
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:54,740
music.

2804
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:56,540
That end of the ride is like perfect.

2805
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:58,860
What I wonder is how many people didn't feel

2806
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:01,840
anything about it before, but Mike made them feel something.

2807
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:02,820
You accepted us.

2808
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,240
I, yeah, it would be

2809
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:06,580
interesting to know who I would think of.

2810
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:09,340
You've heard me talk about it now that you break into

2811
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:11,600
like tears when you see this part of the ride.

2812
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:14,480
And then I influence people by being really into

2813
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:22,860
that one character actor who's in the, the Q videos that, yeah, the generals like evac, what are you

2814
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:23,900
like?

2815
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:25,180
Oh, he's in everything.

2816
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:26,380
I love that guy.

2817
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:28,920
He plays like Landry's dad on Friday night lights.

2818
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:32,240
I think he probably plays everyone's dad on Friday night.

2819
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:36,080
Like, he does play every football

2820
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:37,020
player's dad.

2821
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,460
That's just that good.

2822
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:44,520
You know, he can, he can carry that many roles in a TV show.

2823
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:51,060
You know, having not done Velocicoaster, I think I'm going guardians with slightly,

2824
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,200
behind Hagrid's.

2825
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,320
I am a bit, I want to represent Hagrid's here.

2826
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:56,320
Yeah, Hagrid's also that drop.

2827
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:59,200
Hagrid's is number two in the universal in the online.

2828
01:50:59,360 --> 01:50:59,760
Yeah.

2829
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:03,120
And Velocicoaster didn't make it

2830
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:09,660
to the four in the, so is that, is that heresy that in a little tournament that it wasn't in the top

2831
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,040
two?

2832
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:13,560
Well, isn't that also just people haven't gotten down to ride it?

2833
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:14,560
Have they gotten it on it?

2834
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,480
Are they scared of it?

2835
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:16,280
I'd like to know.

2836
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,520
They'd have to pass a test to prove they went on it.

2837
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:22,200
There were a thousand votes in this poll, so you have a thousand answers to get.

2838
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:22,840
That's fine.

2839
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:24,520
The tweet us photos like Jason did.

2840
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:25,400
Why not Velocicoaster?

2841
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,600
Tweet us a photo of you on the

2842
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:31,880
coaster like Jason has and prove that you are on it to be allowed to vote in the poll.

2843
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:32,540
So does that

2844
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:33,620
mean I'm not allowed to vote in the poll?

2845
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:34,300
You're not allowed.

2846
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:34,980
All right.

2847
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:35,580
So my opinion.

2848
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:36,040
Your opinion

2849
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:36,400
doesn't count.

2850
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:37,460
My opinion is dirt.

2851
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:40,420
You have to ride a vintage Popeye Toon Lagoon.

2852
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:40,900
I need to see

2853
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:43,100
a photo of it too, to prove it.

2854
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:45,700
Even if, I mean, I guess if I'm on it with you, I can, I will vouch

2855
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:46,140
for you.

2856
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:48,240
But other than that, I won't buy it.

2857
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:49,100
Yeah.

2858
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:50,640
You will have to.

2859
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:51,260
It's only proof that you

2860
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:53,960
didn't fly out of it and then somehow get back in at the very end.

2861
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:56,200
Snap a GoPro that is reversed

2862
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:59,700
to your chest with it's a little bit of a selfie stick on it.

2863
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,240
Hopefully that won't impale you on

2864
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:01,620
some part of it.

2865
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:05,320
Requiem for a dream, you know, like that camera where everyone's like, yeah.

2866
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:10,460
But it might be, I'm worried a bit, but you guys gave me hope that this might be something I could,

2867
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:11,640
I could build up to.

2868
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:12,140
I do think you could do it.

2869
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,760
It's not going to be, you're not going to be

2870
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:16,100
so calm on it.

2871
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:16,720
No, no.

2872
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,360
But that's not the goal.

2873
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:21,160
But I just think that there's a couple elements

2874
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:24,880
like that will be taken out, which is the roughness of a coaster like this.

2875
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,000
My question is, do you do

2876
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,400
it sober or?

2877
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:28,600
Well, I know the answer to that.

2878
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:31,020
Well, but then there's this dizziness because I

2879
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:33,120
didn't want to drink before Guardians and I'm really going to drink.

2880
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:33,300
Oh yeah.

2881
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,540
Cause you guys were saying that Guardians got rough.

2882
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:38,360
Guardians just not nauseating potentially.

2883
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:40,100
It's high potential for nausea.

2884
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:42,280
It handles you in a

2885
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:43,740
different unique way.

2886
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:44,760
Yeah.

2887
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:46,360
It's like jostling your little belly.

2888
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,080
It's like kind of like touching your

2889
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:50,380
belly as you ride and like moving it around and stuff.

2890
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:54,580
In five years, people might be more accustomed

2891
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:57,120
to that as spinning coasters catch on more.

2892
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:59,160
Like will evolve to be able to.

2893
01:52:59,180 --> 01:52:59,360
It will evolve.

2894
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,400
Will evolve.

2895
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:03,300
The Raptors did to get better at spinning.

2896
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,360
So we'll be okay for the fast and furious.

2897
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:05,600
Yeah.

2898
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:06,720
Maybe one, maybe one glass.

2899
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:09,700
I just need a little, one little hit of Kendall Jackson,

2900
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:10,200
Chardonnay.

2901
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:11,740
Let me handle that.

2902
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:12,340
Yeah, yeah.

2903
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:12,600
That's right.

2904
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,280
I didn't get, I get a thing in the pit of my

2905
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:18,060
stomach when I do the big upside down part on an Incredicoaster.

2906
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,720
Every time now I just go like,

2907
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:23,260
I can feel it like deep down there going like, and it's not crazy.

2908
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,160
I'm not going to puke or anything,

2909
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:24,940
but I can feel it.

2910
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:25,980
It's really doesn't do anything for it.

2911
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,200
For me, it's all like bigger drops and launch

2912
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:31,360
oddly the spiral does nothing.

2913
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:35,200
There's like a G force on and it's cause it's too slow also.

2914
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:35,800
Yeah.

2915
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:37,540
Slow upside down.

2916
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:39,060
And I can feel it.

2917
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,840
And I never ever had that feeling.

2918
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:41,300
Well,

2919
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:47,600
there's no longer the like late nineties, early two thousands calliope music to comfort you.

2920
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:48,720
Yeah, that's really, yeah.

2921
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:50,520
That was something nauseating about that.

2922
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:58,180
Your father now you're so concerned about Jack Jack, you know, getting him

2923
01:53:58,180 --> 01:53:59,340
under control.

2924
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:00,120
Yeah.

2925
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:00,900
Yeah.

2926
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:01,520
Of course.

2927
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:05,300
I really now I go on a ride and stress about it.

2928
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:05,920
Getting the baby.

2929
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:06,300
Yeah.

2930
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:10,440
That's a dream I have once a week probably that I've like lost to the baby.

2931
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:13,340
That the baby has grown 10 sizes.

2932
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:14,400
I haven't had that dream.

2933
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:14,840
Okay.

2934
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:16,160
That it's like that's a

2935
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:16,940
large baby.

2936
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:17,460
Yeah.

2937
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:18,340
Yeah.

2938
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:19,120
Stomper in Vegas.

2939
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:19,420
Yeah.

2940
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:22,120
But the amount of times I've half asleep,

2941
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:27,200
tried to like go through the covers on the bed in the middle of the night to find where I put the

2942
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:27,780
baby.

2943
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:32,760
That's happened many times at this point where no, wait, I forgot to put the baby in the

2944
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:32,880
crib.

2945
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:33,360
Where?

2946
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:34,260
Oh no.

2947
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:37,900
Like just going through the comforter and like the different and then like

2948
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:39,960
feeling like I've been looking for 10 minutes.

2949
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:40,540
Oh my God.

2950
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:41,300
And then finally kind of.

2951
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,180
It's like

2952
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:45,700
you're just going through the tunnel and then you pop out like in a different place.

2953
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:45,780
Yes.

2954
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:46,060
And then

2955
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:47,760
going, no, the baby's in the crib.

2956
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:48,520
Okay.

2957
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:51,720
Well, now you know what it's like to really care for something

2958
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:54,060
like Owen Grady and Blue.

2959
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:54,900
Right?

2960
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,700
I do feel more of a kinship with Owen now.

2961
01:54:58,380 --> 01:54:58,380
Yeah.

2962
01:54:58,380 --> 01:54:58,620
After this.

2963
01:54:58,820 --> 01:54:58,820
Or

2964
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:00,880
Owen Grady and a clone child.

2965
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:01,460
Yeah.

2966
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:02,980
I'm actually going to watch that other movie.

2967
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:05,180
Well anyways,

2968
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:08,500
fantastic to talk about this for a while.

2969
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:11,460
And here you're passionate, passionate about it Stephen.

2970
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:12,820
It's lasted for a couple of years.

2971
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:16,040
Your passion for Jurassic Park world in general.

2972
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:17,120
Stephen Ray

2973
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,860
Morris, you survived podcast, the ride.

2974
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:20,260
This is a pleasure.

2975
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:22,100
So it's so glad we could have you back

2976
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:24,560
and let's let's exit through the gift shop.

2977
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:25,580
Anything you would like to plug.

2978
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:26,260
Thank you so

2979
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:26,400
much.

2980
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:27,400
Again, thank you guys so much.

2981
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:28,900
I just really loved this podcast.

2982
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:29,920
And again, it's always an

2983
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,660
honor to be on.

2984
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:31,100
Oh man.

2985
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:32,320
Oh, well, and thank you.

2986
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:35,720
Like, like if we, if we get tagged and see you

2987
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:42,020
wearing a Chris Gaines shirt, or a launch queen or I debated wearing the Chris Gaines shirt today,

2988
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,240
I would have been.

2989
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,220
I love the shirt.

2990
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:45,140
It picks a perfect shirt.

2991
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:46,780
So many of them have lead painter,

2992
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,040
micro plastics.

2993
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:50,260
And you gotta be careful with those.

2994
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:52,900
But thank you for your, for your support

2995
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:53,980
and for being a great guest too.

2996
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:54,600
Thank you.

2997
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:54,920
Yeah.

2998
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:56,640
It's always, I mean, again, it's always when you

2999
01:55:56,640 --> 01:56:01,960
find a podcast that you love and you're just like, wait, somebody else like thinks about lost in you.

3000
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:06,840
And ladies and gentlemen, you know, like, yeah.

3001
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:10,560
But yeah, no, again, this is so much fun.

3002
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:11,160
Yeah,

3003
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:15,620
you can follow me at Steven Ray Morris and all the things, uh, see Jurassic right podcast.

3004
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:15,980
And

3005
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:20,980
then I wanted to mention, we're talking about, um, off mic, but I'm, uh, the next project I'm

3006
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:27,440
working on is a step-by-step, uh, TV show podcasts, you know, the classic TGIF show from the nineties.

3007
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,360
You have handled me with this information, Steven.

3008
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:31,540
Oh my God.

3009
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:34,280
Um, it's called, um, um, it's called

3010
01:56:34,780 --> 01:56:36,760
Kenan and Lakin give you deja vu.

3011
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:39,900
And it's with Christine Lakin who played Al Lambert,

3012
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:47,200
the sassy tomboy and, uh, Stacy Kenan who played Dana Foster, who was, you know, just the

3013
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:50,300
every, you know, all of our teen crush growing up.

3014
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:53,480
And I had crushes on all of those girls on that

3015
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:53,840
show.

3016
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:56,580
Like, uh, and Suzanne Somers rest in peace.

3017
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:56,840
Yes.

3018
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:57,280
Yes.

3019
01:56:57,660 --> 01:57:00,060
Uh, it's, I always really loved that show

3020
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:05,640
because it was like Brady bunch, but with divorce and it was just like, yeah, and they mixed it up.

3021
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:06,860
Keep you on your toes.

3022
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:08,860
They don't all, their hair doesn't all match.

3023
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:09,160
Yeah.

3024
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:09,880
Yeah, exactly.

3025
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:14,880
And you're like, I still don't remember which family member, which kid goes, yeah, no, it's,

3026
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:16,200
they mixed it all up.

3027
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:21,300
But, um, but yeah, uh, yeah, I'm working with Christine and Stacy and the, the,

3028
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:26,320
the premise of the show that I think is very funny is that Stacy was a, you know, too cool for school

3029
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:26,760
teenagers.

3030
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:30,400
So she never watched the show that she was on for seven seasons.

3031
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:31,860
And Christine was a kid

3032
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:36,480
and her mom was out here and she was just excited to be like in the first episode, they talk a lot

3033
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:40,880
about like, oh my gosh, they're closing magic mountain so that we get to film this opening kind

3034
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:41,080
of thing.

3035
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:42,260
So she's that age.

3036
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:45,100
You hear, you were saying there's a, but right off the bat, you get

3037
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,660
a bunch of info about that, about the magic mountain.

3038
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:47,980
Yes.

3039
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:48,100
No.

3040
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:48,320
Yeah.

3041
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:48,580
Yeah.

3042
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,120
Yeah.

3043
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:49,780
My God.

3044
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:50,480
Um,

3045
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,780
and so, so she watched every episode.

3046
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:55,840
So she was like the lore keeper with her mom and then, uh,

3047
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,700
Stacy was just like, whatever nineties and like, so it got out of the business as a very successful

3048
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:01,180
attorney.

3049
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:02,020
Yes, exactly.

3050
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,840
So their dynamic I think is just really fun.

3051
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:06,160
And again, it's like,

3052
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:09,960
you know, for people listen to podcasts, the ride it's the, you know, all the nineties,

3053
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:16,000
you know, ephemera and goodness and pop culture and, um, yeah, uh, Kenan and Lakin Instagram

3054
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,800
is the only thing that's up right now.

3055
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:20,640
Cause the show is not coming out until March, but, um,

3056
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:23,020
but placeholder with that get on that Instagram.

3057
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:25,360
And then I'm going to do it for sure.

3058
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:26,060
Love step

3059
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:26,520
by step.

3060
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:30,120
I just, I saw you just tweet about step by step and I can't believe how much backstory

3061
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:30,840
there was to this.

3062
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,400
Cause you tweeted something about, oh, it's, it's the best TJF show.

3063
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:33,540
Cause

3064
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:34,520
it's the horniest.

3065
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:40,220
Cause Frank and Carol Duffy and summers, they're like, there's none of that.

3066
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:41,640
They're not like lock horns.

3067
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:44,300
They're like, they are into each other.

3068
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:45,340
And there's con I feel like

3069
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:51,860
every episode has some like, uh, why don't we play that game where you're the fireman is home from a

3070
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:53,460
long sweaty day.

3071
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:57,260
And literally the first episode, it's like at the end, the little button where

3072
01:58:57,260 --> 01:59:00,220
they're in bed and it's like the to-do list of groceries and stuff.

3073
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:00,660
And she's like,

3074
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:01,380
what do you like to do?

3075
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:02,340
And he like wrote it down.

3076
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:04,180
She was like, the kids could see this.

3077
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:04,420
And he's

3078
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:06,260
like, well, let's check it off the list.

3079
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:08,380
And it's like, clearly he was writing the word sex,

3080
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:08,800
you know?

3081
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:13,540
And it's just like, you know, this was a sitcom that, you know, it was in the TGIF block.

3082
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:14,400
It was 9 30.

3083
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:16,040
It was the last one.

3084
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,740
It could be a little body.

3085
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:18,740
We can push it.

3086
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:19,680
We can push it.

3087
01:59:19,860 --> 01:59:20,200
Yeah.

3088
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:21,640
Um, I I'm so excited.

3089
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:21,880
Yeah.

3090
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,280
You were, you dropped this info before we started recording.

3091
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:26,620
I had to collect myself to do the episode.

3092
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:28,400
So, uh, can't wait for that.

3093
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:29,560
I'll, I'll listen to all of

3094
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:29,800
that.

3095
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,580
Uh, and thank you so much for being here.

3096
