1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,160
Howdy folks, welcome to our week long Country Bear thing.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,400
Quick heads up, today's episode features Mule Talk, Goofy getting hit by a car, and Joe Piscopo

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
on a cruise ship.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:33,920
Just wanted to warn you, it's Country Bear Jam for week day one on today's podcast, The

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,240
Ride.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:46,400
Howdy folks, welcome to the one and only original podcast, The Ride Country Bear Jamber Week,

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,320
a daily podcast series devoted to the Walt Disney World, Tokyo Disneyland, and dearly

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,000
departed Disneyland attraction, the Country Bear Jamboree.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,480
We made it, we finally did it.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm swinging Scotty Gerdner, joined by big car Albson.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,600
Howdy there, yes, that's my name.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,920
I was going to call you, if I was doing the intro, Scooch or Scooter Gerdner, I think.

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
That works.

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Because I was trying to think of a name.

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
But anyway.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Anybody else can be swinging.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Yeah.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,520
I have a Jason, if you want.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
If you accept it.

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
I'd love to hear both Jason.

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
I have one too for Jason, but go ahead.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,160
Well, maybe we landed on the same thing.

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,600
Mine was Jason Bonnet Sheridan.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,480
That's good and more clever than mine, but I think I do have to say mine because it ties

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,280
into something that I said on the show a while ago.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,920
I was just going to call him Jason Jughead Sheridan.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,320
It's double meaning because Jughead, obviously we like Jughead because of the Archie Comics

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,380
character, but also I said many, many years ago at this point that what I wanted is Jason

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,120
Sheridan to learn how to play the jug for the Country Bear episode.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,040
And I have a jug with me here.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,560
I feel like he didn't learn it though.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
I had a jug.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
I didn't.

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,140
It's a little water in it because I was, I watched it real quick because I forgot about

37
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,160
it until the last second here, but this is a jug.

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
I cleaned it.

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
It's freshly cleaned.

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
So, when you-

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,800
Whoa folks, there's a genuine jug.

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,360
I brought a jug with for Jason Jughead Sheridan.

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,360
And what was his other name?

44
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
Jason Bonnet Sheridan.

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,920
Oh, Jason Bonnet Sheridan.

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,760
I think you both did a great job.

47
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,520
Jughead Jason Bonnet Sheridan.

48
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Why not all of it?

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,280
Why not the longest name?

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Yeah, that's good.

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Okay.

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Let's clear the air.

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Let's, okay.

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Cause we got a whole week here.

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,740
It'd be great if there was improvement by the end of it.

56
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,640
So let's hear just unvarnished Jason Jugheading.

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,920
I'm getting a little.

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Okay.

59
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
So here's the thing.

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,640
I watched a couple of YouTube videos of jug instruction.

61
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,200
Of people hooting on a jug.

62
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,240
And here's the thing I didn't know about playing the jug.

63
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,040
Cause I thought it was more like what you're trying to do right now.

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,640
It's actually a lot more, you make the noise with your mouth and then it resonates off

65
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,760
the bottom of the jug.

66
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
So you're making a-

67
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,720
And put it into the jug.

68
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
That's actually good jug.

69
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
That's good jugging actually.

70
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
That's good jugging?

71
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Yeah.

72
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,080
That's actually good jugging is from what I understand according to YouTube.

73
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,560
This is also a glass jug.

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,280
It's not the ceramic brown and white kind of traditional jug.

75
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,480
He says a glass jug might be a little bit tougher, but you can do a couple of these

76
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,080
gentlemen instructed me about this online.

77
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,440
And you can do it in a milk jug, an empty milk jug that's plastic.

78
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,160
You can do the classic, what you're talking about, the ceramic that you've seen, you know,

79
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,880
like everybody drank moonshine out of.

80
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,480
That's the issue is where are we getting one of those?

81
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,880
Where are we getting an old timey jug?

82
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
They used to be everywhere.

83
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,800
And now I don't know where I'd go for a jug.

84
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,680
Well maybe by the end of the week we'll have a ceramic jug for Jason, but this is what

85
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,200
I had on hand.

86
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,680
Listeners, point us to like, where do you think is the most authentic jug that we could

87
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
get?

88
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah.

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
So Jason, if we call for it during the episode or anytime this week, if you could just do

90
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,600
a little jugging for us, I would appreciate it.

91
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Oh, okay.

92
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, I'll do my best.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,640
As always with this show, I promise to try my damnedest.

95
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,560
Cause you know, like you're like when Lisa had the jug on the Simpsons and Homer would

96
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,600
ask her to play it to cheer him up.

97
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Yeah.

98
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Yeah.

99
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Well, and so if like somebody's looking up information that they don't have at the ready

100
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,000
or if the cricket comes back, we've had a cricket issue here in the garage.

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We need to deal with that.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,800
You're going to need to fill the time.

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,520
That's a great little bit of audio color for like a country bear jamboree kind of like,

104
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
you know,

105
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Oh, a cricket would be great.

106
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Yeah, I wouldn't care.

107
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,960
Would you're, you're currently holding it's a little, it's like a modern water bottle,

108
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,560
but it looks a little like a drug.

109
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Yeah.

110
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,080
This is, this is a, it's got the wood.

111
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,880
It's slowly the wood slowly fading away.

112
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,320
Cause it's like a couple of years old.

113
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
It's like a swell style.

114
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,320
You think you can get anything out of that, out of the swell?

115
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,360
Maybe it's full of water.

116
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
No, I'd say that.

117
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
I think, yeah.

118
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,880
Can I play the empty burger king cup with ice in it?

119
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Let's see how I can get out of my zone.

120
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
I can get out of this.

121
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,880
I got a glass iced tea.

122
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,120
See that's pretty, I'm doing too much of the work there.

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
A little too much.

124
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Yeah.

125
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
That's not genuine.

126
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
And there speak of the devil.

127
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
There's the cricket.

128
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Wow.

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Really?

130
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Where's that cricket?

131
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
That cricket sit back.

132
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Wow.

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,480
We have some characters here today, including our cricket friend.

134
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,200
Wait, this is the opportunity.

135
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,880
Mike here, Mike hit the wall and Jason cover with the.

136
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
All right.

137
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
All right.

138
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,200
I'm going to hit the wall, hit the wall to try to get the cricket to stop.

139
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Jason go.

140
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Didn't work.

141
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:39,880
There was a brief pause with the cricket though, when I heard the sound.

142
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,280
Wait, if I can ask what was in this jug beforehand?

143
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm getting a little bit of like a citrus flavor.

144
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,360
That's got to be the soap.

145
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Yeah.

146
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
That's the soap.

147
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Okay.

148
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,840
Well, we're keeping an ear out for the cricket, but there's a couple of bits of business to

149
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,000
do here at the beginning of this new event series.

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,200
It's been a little while excited to be doing, doing it.

151
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,920
It means we have different stuff at play.

152
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,400
We've got a new country fried theme song courtesy of our own Mike Carlson.

153
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Thank you.

154
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Fantastic.

155
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Thank you very much.

156
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
It's fun.

157
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Yeah.

158
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,360
You go out to the bar and you whip up that old fashioned garage band and you just see

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
what happens.

160
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,240
You know, I have my plugins.

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,680
I'm using logic filters.

162
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm using logic on Apple.

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
That's just, that's quality.

164
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,920
You help me out with the pro tools here.

165
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,400
Pro tools acting up again.

166
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,640
My midi keyboard is acting up.

167
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,000
My midi ports ain't showing up.

168
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
I got no ports.

169
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,080
This is a hee haw sketch.

170
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Pretty good.

171
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,880
Jug modern day jug, but 21st century jug.

172
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Yeah.

173
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Yeah.

174
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,560
And we've got great artwork courtesy of Tonagrassa.

175
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,600
And this I'm excited about.

176
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,240
If you're a long time listener to the show, you might know this art already because a

177
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,640
long time ago he, they did art called the good boy jamboree.

178
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,920
And I think maybe the best fan art probably we've ever received.

179
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,160
It's up there for sure.

180
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,480
As the country bears.

181
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,840
Aaron, my wife often does like the special art for, and the main art for these things.

182
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,160
But in this case she was like, you already got good boy jamboree.

183
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,800
It's gotta be good boy jamboree.

184
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Use that.

185
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Yeah.

186
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Tona helped us out and thanks so much.

187
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,720
And you can check out more of Tona's work at, in the show notes.

188
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Yeah.

189
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Sure.

190
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
They'll be there.

191
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Yeah.

192
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
It's so good.

193
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,760
So it's, you know, we freshen it up for this week.

194
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
Everything's fresh.

195
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Yeah.

196
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Yeah.

197
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
And it feels good.

198
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,760
I feel the sheen and the shine, the moonshine where it's, we've turned into a, it's a real

199
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,120
hoot and holler now.

200
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Yeah.

201
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Yeah.

202
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
So we're gonna, yeah, we're gonna do a lot.

203
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,720
There's a lot of content coming this week.

204
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,640
And I don't think we're not gonna say everything.

205
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,120
It'll be a fun, fun surprise.

206
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Yeah.

207
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
I think so.

208
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,360
Cause you might, yeah, you could make guesses as to how we'll, we'll sort of break everything

209
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,960
down and parse this into different areas and topics.

210
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,680
But I don't know that you could, you could guess all the twists and turns.

211
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,560
I'll say that if you want the full country bear jamber week experience, you should subscribe

212
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,760
to the second gate at hn.com slash podcast, the ride.

213
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,680
But I think most of what we're doing right here on the main feed, uh, for, for our good

214
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
old family.

215
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,960
Cause we're one big, we're one big family here.

216
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,720
You're entitled to most of the content in front of the paywall.

217
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,520
We're generous bars.

218
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Yep.

219
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,880
Just a little, but just a little bit.

220
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,480
You gotta pay.

221
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Family's got to chip in.

222
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
You know what I mean?

223
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Yeah.

224
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,160
You want to hear the two hour episode about buck Owens, his music career.

225
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,800
You got to listen to the patron and pay us a little money.

226
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,320
Oh, that'll get them over there.

227
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Oh yeah.

228
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,680
I see such a spike today.

229
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,640
Um, yeah, this, this I think is exciting.

230
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,960
It's cool to be tackling something to really like do, do a major here, do a thesis.

231
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,200
We're really, this is a thesis project about, about an attraction.

232
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
It is.

233
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Yeah.

234
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,880
Um, and I, you know, that deep breath that you just did, Mike, that was a question I

235
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:12,800
had is I think, I think for you, maybe this is the biggest, um, hill to climb because

236
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,640
this has been looming for a long time.

237
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,280
I recall an instance where I suggested maybe doing the country, Virginia and you said pretty

238
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,840
seriously, I have, you know what?

239
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,680
I got to tell you, I'm not ready.

240
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,960
I'm not, I don't think I can do it yet.

241
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
I'm not ready.

242
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Yeah.

243
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,580
So now, now we're here.

244
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,580
Are you ready?

245
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,400
I would say this, uh, I am ready in the sense that I'm always ready, which is, uh, something

246
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,940
that a podcast friend, Matt Cardona uses as a tagline.

247
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,640
So I'm always ready, but am I ready?

248
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,920
No, I'm not ready, but that's look, Saturday night live.

249
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,400
They say, you know, it's the show.

250
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,840
What do they say about it?

251
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
It goes on.

252
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,760
It doesn't go on because it's ready.

253
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Exactly.

254
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Exactly.

255
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
They say that about studio 60.

256
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Do they say that?

257
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:08,240
They say that, yeah, the show goes on because it's a Friday night at 11 at a theater resembling

258
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,520
of the palladium, but that isn't the palladium.

259
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
Right.

260
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
That's studios.

261
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,040
So the hallowed studio 60.

262
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,240
Did you see the thing there in Sorkin said about I love Lucy?

263
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,240
That he, that it's not, if we looked at it today, it's not funny.

264
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Right.

265
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
Fuck off.

266
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Are you kidding me?

267
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
No, no.

268
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
He said that he makes making the Lucy movie anyway.

269
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,520
But no, I'm who we've been trusted with this property.

270
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,280
I am not ready, but I'm ready.

271
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Yeah.

272
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Okay.

273
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,280
Great.

274
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,000
Um, I mean, because like, you know, we're, we're taking our time here and that's, that's

275
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,440
some of what I think is easing us into it that we don't have to get to all of it today.

276
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,640
But the, the notion of today's episode is that this is the country bear jamboree, right?

277
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,040
The primary thing, the big ticket item.

278
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,000
Now I was, I should say at the top, I think that if we stumble into something or we're,

279
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,600
we're at like the distant mo we're at three and a half hours and we haven't even gotten

280
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,280
to big Al, whatever it is, I think we could call for an episode.

281
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
Ah, yes.

282
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Break off.

283
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Of course.

284
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
We could, we could break off a piece.

285
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
I agree with that.

286
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
If we need to.

287
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,800
So let's put that option on the table.

288
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Anything yet.

289
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,320
If you want to call for it a full episode during this show, you can about any topic.

290
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,120
Don't, don't summon that spell.

291
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,000
Unless you're ready to cast it.

292
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You gotta be sure.

293
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,880
I'm sure there's enough, there's enough meat there.

294
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,880
But again, but also it's a, you know, it's a, it's a saga or an ordeal or a jam or week.

295
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,680
We've used a lot of words at this point and that's, you know, that, that setup is hopefully

296
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,800
so that, um, these episodes don't all have to be a minimum two and a half hours, but

297
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
maybe they all are.

298
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I don't know.

299
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
I don't know.

300
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,880
I don't know what the shape of these will be.

301
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,760
I think part of my mental thinking or the way that it's shaping up is we, we just kind

302
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,760
of had this, you know, buckle up and just do it.

303
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,120
Cause we've talked so many different angles on it.

304
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,800
It's like, well, at a certain point you just have to break down and it just becomes something.

305
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,240
Maybe I'm still delaying it, but even talking about process.

306
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,200
I guess we just got to dig in and on this attraction, which I'm glad we're doing it

307
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,460
now because it is the 50th anniversary, just like Walt Disney world.

308
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,560
This was an opening day while Disney world attraction.

309
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,560
So it's celebrating its 50th anniversary.

310
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Still there.

311
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
It's made it there.

312
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
It was opening day Tokyo and it's still there as well.

313
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,320
And notable for being the very first to open, uh, open at Walt Disney world and then get

314
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
cloned for Disneyland.

315
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,640
This is the first time that happened in that order.

316
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
Oh yeah.

317
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,240
Most things started at Disneyland and they made us, they shipped the door land out.

318
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Yeah.

319
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,320
And it changed the complexion of Disneyland or I guess the name.

320
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,880
My complexion seems like a lot.

321
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,160
Well, we had keep going.

322
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
What do you mean by that?

323
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,800
Well, like bear country then became a thing.

324
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,600
Like that, that area all became bear country because of the country bears.

325
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Yeah.

326
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Yeah.

327
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,760
Well that that's kind of like, um, one thing I find interesting about all this is that

328
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,200
it opened in Florida, seemingly pretty big smash hit there pretty beloved out of the

329
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,840
gate in Florida.

330
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:21,040
So much so that I think it was pretty hyped coming into Disneyland and California and

331
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,300
maybe too much in a way, because it's a little unassuming in Florida.

332
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,900
Like it's, it's one of, it's one of a bunch of attractions.

333
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,180
This one's new and exclusive to Disney world.

334
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,180
That's cool.

335
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,500
But there wasn't a lot of pressure put on it.

336
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,120
Maybe that helped it take off here in Disney by the time they get it to Disneyland, it

337
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,400
gets an entire land devoted to it, uh, which happens pretty rarely that an attraction is

338
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,760
accompanied by an entire land.

339
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,840
And also they are also e-ticket.

340
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,280
We're still doing the ticket system at that point and they name it an e-ticket attraction,

341
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,440
which I don't think, I don't think people, I don't think we've talked a lot about the

342
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
ticket system.

343
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,280
I don't even know what a lot of these older attractions were ticket wise, but today e-ticket

344
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,800
is thrown around mostly for thrill rides.

345
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,480
You'd think that that system was retired, but Indiana Jones or rise of the resistance,

346
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,280
you'd imagine would be e-tickets kind of weird that a theater show, that a sit down show

347
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,560
was considered an e-ticket.

348
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,120
In my heart, it's not weird, but it is weird for the average public.

349
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
I think.

350
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Yeah.

351
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,920
So we have a graphic that yesterland preserved from like 72 73 of all the e-tickets at Disneyland.

352
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Okay.

353
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,320
Do you want to guess some of them?

354
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,040
Um, do we have, there's no big thunder yet.

355
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Not yet.

356
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,960
Uh, the haunted mansion pirates.

357
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Correct.

358
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,520
Uh, how many we got here?

359
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,800
Um, two, four, six, eight, somebody else has got a joke while he can't read.

360
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Like 11.

361
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
There's 11 on here.

362
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Uh, 11 really?

363
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,600
Then like, is the, uh, at that point in time is like the railroad, an e-ticket.

364
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,640
That's a good question.

365
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,800
Um, the, uh, a mode of transit is.

366
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Monorail?

367
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Monorail is.

368
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Monorail is an e-ticket.

369
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,600
Small world an e-ticket at that point?

370
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,000
Small world is an e-ticket.

371
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Interesting.

372
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah.

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Okay.

374
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Matterhorn then?

375
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Uh, Matterhorn is not listed.

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What?

377
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What are you talking about?

378
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Small world and not Matterhorn?

379
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Really?

380
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When does Matterhorn open?

381
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Is Matterhorn not open?

382
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No, it's open.

383
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Matterhorn is on here.

385
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, thank God.

386
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm losing my mind.

387
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This is not the clearest graphic.

388
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Uh, what else we got?

389
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,680
Uh, we have the Monorail, the Jungle Cruise.

390
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Huh?

391
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
Uh, the mine train through nature's wonderland.

392
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,480
Oh, interesting.

393
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,000
Um, the submarine voyage.

394
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Hmm.

395
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Pretty good.

396
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
Can we list what wasn't an e-ticket at this point?

397
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,600
I mean, the other, the weirdest one to me.

398
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,400
Walking down Main Street e-ticket.

399
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,840
The strangest one to me that not only was it an e-ticket, but it was still here.

400
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Pack mules.

401
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Wow.

402
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Yeah.

403
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Writing a mule.

404
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Pack mule is an e-ticket.

405
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
That's right.

406
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Wow.

407
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,640
It's a vaunted phrase that they only, like, that they say in this, let me tell you, this

408
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:14,240
is going to be a real e-ticket akin to writing a mule that might take a dump or like spit,

409
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,360
it's like just piss all over your shoes.

410
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,880
If you could still ride a mule at Disneyland, you would have to pay for the Lightning Lane

411
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
to ride a mule.

412
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Lightning Lane for a mule ride.

413
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,400
You would have to pay $15 for the Lightning Lane to ride a mule at Disneyland.

414
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,320
By the time an entire family has done it and if you're there with a big, you might, some

415
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,080
people travel with bigger families than there are mules.

416
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
Yeah, sure.

417
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,880
So what do you do in that case?

418
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,640
They've paid the money, you want to make it work.

419
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,280
Yeah, a family, an angry family reunion and matching t-shirts arguing, like, you've got

420
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,040
to get more mules out here.

421
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,720
And a collective $210.

422
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,760
I mean, if they, if like Bob Chapek or Demaro was on stage at one of these D23 type places

423
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:04,240
and they're like, we are starting a virtual queue for the mule rides at 7 a.m.

424
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,120
You will wake up and get on your app and get a spot in line for mules during the day and

425
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,360
that will go quickly.

426
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,200
So you have to get up at that time and everyone's writing articles about how to get in the virtual

427
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,280
queue for a mule and just all of us queue for a mule.

428
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
Geez.

429
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,680
All the theme park media pleading with them.

430
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,200
Please update the mules are very old.

431
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,020
They are struggling.

432
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,160
Several of them are from the opening of Disneyland.

433
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,680
Several of these are original days.

434
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,600
Let shooter retire.

435
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,560
Shooter to deal with Bob Cummings opening day and now he has to deal with me.

436
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,360
Most of shooters legs are fake.

437
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Let him rest.

438
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,840
I'm going to be the first to say I don't know anything about mules, but I'm going to hazard

439
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,240
a guess that they either live very few years or they're like turtles where it's like, oh,

440
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,440
they live a long time.

441
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Yeah.

442
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,440
The average mule was 300 years old.

443
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
It lives to be 300.

444
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Mules are sterile.

445
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Yes.

446
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
So they can't sit there.

447
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,640
So when a mules or donkeys, one of them, I think it's difficult to make.

448
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
It's difficult to make.

449
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Well, they're sterile.

450
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,080
They're not like, you know, hold on, hold on.

451
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,000
This is important at the top of the country.

452
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We got to do some animal husbandry.

453
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,200
We got to cover a bunch of non country bear mule, just stats about real mules.

454
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Mule.

455
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Okay.

456
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Continue talking while I do this.

457
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,080
Well, at Disneyland, this I thought was interesting when it did come to Disneyland because they

458
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,720
were predicting it being such a hit.

459
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Two theaters.

460
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,040
Florida has one theater.

461
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,960
Tokyo also has two theaters.

462
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,920
Seemingly still a big hit there.

463
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Okay.

464
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
I was correct.

465
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,760
They are sterile because they can't make sperm or eggs.

466
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,760
A female horse and a male donkey have a mule.

467
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Got it.

468
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,280
Oh, so once, but then that a mule is an evolutionary dead end.

469
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Basically.

470
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
Yes.

471
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Like our country.

472
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
It's, it was a dead end.

473
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,800
Bear country, the mule of lands.

474
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Yeah.

475
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,040
Um, I mean, yeah, that's, that is all pretty crazy.

476
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,920
Like it's, it's coming in blockbusters that you got to use the biggest ticket on it.

477
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
It's its own land.

478
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,540
It's two theaters.

479
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,940
And I, and I think it like, did all that hurt it in a way?

480
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,600
Did that make it not take off in California ever to the degree that it did in Disney world

481
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,360
and seemingly Tokyo, Mike, I think you can attest or you got to see it there, right?

482
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Was it?

483
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Oh yeah.

484
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Yeah.

485
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
Um, psyched crowds.

486
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,320
That was like a absolutely hyped audience.

487
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,280
Although lately I've been noticing that in Orlando as well.

488
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,720
I think people, it depends.

489
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Sometimes.

490
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Yes.

491
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,120
I was going to say that, yeah, just it depends.

492
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,920
I've been there where no one gives a shit.

493
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,080
I've watched YouTube videos where no one gives a shit, but then I have been in there with

494
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,480
a crowd that likes it.

495
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Yeah.

496
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Yeah.

497
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
And I think it's infectious.

498
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,360
I think if there's a couple people in the country bear crowd who are determined to give

499
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,960
it their all and really cheer for everything and really clap for everything and who laugh

500
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,480
at the things that there are to laugh at, um, then everybody has a better time.

501
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,280
I think in general, the more the audience puts into it, the more they, uh, the more

502
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,440
everybody gets out of it.

503
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,720
It's just like the end of the Abbey road suite.

504
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,520
The love you make is equal to the love you take.

505
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,840
I agree with that completely.

506
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,280
They famously cut the hoedown portion of, there was a right after the big drum solo,

507
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,920
there is a big, uh, jug solo.

508
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Yeah.

509
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Yeah.

510
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,080
They will, they all turn, take turns jugging.

511
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:39,040
Pretty different jug players take turns jugging like the guitar solos at the end.

512
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,960
When John Lennon was staying at the Polynesian, do you think he saw the country bears?

513
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Whoa.

514
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
What a question.

515
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Oh my God.

516
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,080
Can I call for an episode about this?

517
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
About this hypothetical?

518
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,640
Well, I don't know how you find, how you verify any of this.

519
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,440
The other thing about that story that I had read on some sort of like long form article,

520
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,560
like ages ago, and I don't know, I don't remember where it was.

521
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,440
I don't remember how well sourced, um, but I think it had kind of a debunking angle of

522
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,440
like, Oh, the papers were presented there, but they realized the lawyers had to tweak

523
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
something.

524
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
So he was further down.

525
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,040
Uh, he was either Miami or he was somewhere else in Florida when he finally got the final,

526
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
final pep.

527
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
I have to dissolve the Beatles.

528
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
To dissolve the Beatles.

529
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Yeah.

530
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,960
I have seen this correction that he didn't actually dissolve the Beatles in Disney, in

531
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
the pollination.

532
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,880
But he got papers that were going, that was going to do that.

533
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,600
But yeah, the final, final ones, I guess happened somewhere else.

534
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,040
Would he have been like, um, would he have enjoyed the country bears?

535
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,160
Would he have been impressed by them?

536
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,360
Like the way he, you know, he likes a Nielsen, like, uh, I respect to my musical peers.

537
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,760
Would it have stressed him out?

538
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,180
Uh, like it feels like work to him to go analyze another great band's music.

539
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,080
They liked, uh, they liked, uh, like American country, Western.

540
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,960
I mean, Ringo covers Buck Owens is act naturally and Buck Owens has a song in the country bears.

541
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,200
Oh, that's an interesting crossover.

542
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,480
I don't think I knew he was the artist of act naturally.

543
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,080
Uh, yes, yes.

544
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,720
So, uh, you know, that song, of course, they're going to put me in the movies.

545
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,600
They're going to make a big star out of me.

546
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Yeah.

547
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,260
I mean, I think a lot of those British invasion bands, I mean, the early, early stone records

548
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,320
are mostly like covers of like a blues and country songs.

549
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
Right.

550
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,240
Did any of them do a blood on the saddle?

551
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Well, it's okay.

552
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
It's a good question.

553
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
I don't know.

554
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,920
I mean, Elton John is in the country bear movie.

555
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Spoiler alert.

556
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,680
I guess I shouldn't have said that, but he has a bunch of old, he is like a bunch of

557
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,800
very country Western tumbleweed connection and stuff, like all these different influences.

558
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,960
So I think that would be right up John Lennon's alley.

559
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
It has a question.

560
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
You might've appreciated it.

561
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
I think he would have loved it.

562
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Yeah.

563
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,360
Unless he was just like high out of his mind and doesn't recall seeing it and it was not

564
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
really possible.

565
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,640
It was the, it was, it was with may pang right now with Yoko.

566
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,320
It was a long weekend situation.

567
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
I guess so.

568
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Yeah.

569
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,080
In the photo, the Polynesian, it's may pang, right?

570
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,080
I believe so.

571
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Yeah.

572
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,280
And she's also, I think in the, is she the one in the photo of him doing like the Mr.

573
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,200
Nat, he's doing that crazy walk.

574
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
I don't know.

575
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
I can't remember.

576
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Okay.

577
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,600
I can't remember that photo where he looks like an alien.

578
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,360
I won't tall string being alien.

579
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
I won't remember it.

580
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,080
Um, I refused to, sorry, may my eyes are straying.

581
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,160
I've got a new, I might have a new girlfriend.

582
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,440
Her name's swinging Teddy bar.

583
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,720
When it was so high, he like clung to her animatronic as she went into the ceiling.

584
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,320
There's a man trying to ride up into the rafters correction.

585
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,360
That's the most famous man on the planet.

586
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,040
John Lennon had a long weekend with swinging Teddy bear from may pang.

587
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Right.

588
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,080
I'm being told to allow it to happen.

589
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,640
Uh, he's going to, he's going to stay up there.

590
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,840
We don't want any trouble with Apple records.

591
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,760
So, uh, let's not bother him for the weekend folks.

592
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,480
Paul famously had to go and tell John, get back with Yoko leave swinging Teddy bear.

593
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,200
He went to him in California.

594
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,480
Is it funny because it's Trixie was seeing text Ritter at the time and she got him in

595
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
the show.

596
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Sure.

597
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Yeah.

598
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,960
Uh, I, so where do, where do you even begin here?

599
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,680
Uh, I mean, we could talk a little bit about where it, where it came from because it, um,

600
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,040
you know, as with a lot of stuff that was put into Disney world originally, like there's

601
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,880
a couple of attractions that were new to Disney world and, uh, Walt had passed away, been

602
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,200
a deceased for five years or so, but a lot of the new attractions in Disney world still

603
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,880
had roots to stuff he was alive and helped think of.

604
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,680
It's like not till further down the road that they finally are willing to try an attraction,

605
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,920
but Walt didn't sort of approve.

606
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:03,240
Um, but this, yeah, he was around for an iteration of the country bear jamboree because it was

607
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,760
meant for a ski resorts that never got built.

608
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Mineral king.

609
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,040
The mineral king ski resort.

610
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,680
Um, I mean, it starts of course when Walt was the chairman of pageantry for the squaw

611
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
valley Olympic games.

612
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Of course.

613
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Uh, I'm going to call my own episode.

614
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,680
Uh, all right, squab out.

615
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:31,000
Uh, I was looking that up and like you would, you'd think like a, an entire Disney run.

616
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,320
He did not like do like a custom animatronic show.

617
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,480
I don't think he had the lead time to, he didn't make up the Tiki room or have like

618
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:46,240
an original show about, um, you know, chipmunk skiers and uh, like, uh, vulture shot putters

619
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
or what have you.

620
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,080
I don't think anything too interesting was happening there, but, uh, I guess in doing

621
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,560
so he got interested in, in putting together a ski resort.

622
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:01,360
Um, I don't know the math super well of how all that played out, but that's a property

623
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,200
that's it's now part of Sequoia.

624
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,400
It is, it wasn't at the time it got annexed in the 17th century.

625
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
It was the 70s.

626
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,040
Um, but yeah, he wanted to build what would have been the biggest ski resorts in America,

627
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,480
um, and drew up a lot of plans for it.

628
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,960
And in doing so he, it was like, well, what do people do at night?

629
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,640
We have to come up with something once the skiing is over.

630
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,200
And he tasked Mark Davis with coming up with a great imaginary.

631
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,480
We've talked about a lot, really responsible for a lot of the, you know, funnier, zanier

632
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,280
character designs over the year.

633
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,120
These characters where you feel like you get a picture of the whole character just when

634
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,120
you look at his concept or forget about even the robot is concept art says so much just

635
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
speaks volumes.

636
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,440
Um, the whole quote I have, uh, Walt commissioned Mark Davis to come up with shows that would

637
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,640
keep those folks and their money right there at mineral King.

638
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,080
Uh, Walt thought maybe we should have a show that had something to do with bears said Mark,

639
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,240
lots and lots of bears.

640
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,840
And he went off and thought of a lot of different bears and a review that they could do.

641
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,040
Um, but here's something interesting.

642
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,400
I discovered in all this that, uh, something Mark Davis said is that the drawings that

643
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,800
he showed Walt had all kinds of bears.

644
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Sure.

645
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,440
There was a country band, but also a jazz band, a circus band, a one bear band and a

646
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,080
red outfit with a bunch of instruments he was playing.

647
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,400
So because if this was supposed to be in Northern California, um, country music is not, you

648
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,640
know, the exclusive dominant music there.

649
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,200
So there's an alternate version of this where it's not the country bear jamboree, just a

650
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,480
bear, the bear show, the bear concert.

651
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,200
Yeah, it's multiple things.

652
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,980
It's like, uh, uh, Andrew Dice Clay used to do a bunch of characters and then he settled

653
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,880
on one of the concepts that became his whole persona.

654
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,280
That's exactly the same thing.

655
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,280
I see.

656
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Hmm.

657
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,720
So like there were a lot of versions that could have been of a bear band.

658
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,640
Um, I guess it's actually kind of like America sings where there were multiple, like they

659
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,720
weren't all sort of a part of one like group on America sings that were different.

660
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,040
Yeah, essentially a bunch of American genres represented in half now canceled.

661
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Right.

662
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Yeah.

663
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Yeah.

664
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Yeah.

665
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,440
When you look at country bear jamboree and then America sings, it does feel because we

666
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,160
were talking about classic rock, like, uh, important rock bands.

667
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:32,800
It does feel like the trope of, you know, big first hit with country bear jamboree and

668
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,480
uh, kind of doesn't nail it on the sophomore efforts to ambitious, maybe too ambitious

669
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,560
or not focused enough for it's like American idiot and 21st century breakdown, you know,

670
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,720
21st century breakdown is not as good as American, right?

671
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,280
We haven't used this as metafitals fairly new.

672
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,080
We didn't land on this metaphor for half an hour.

673
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,560
We can't, we can't dive in more though.

674
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
We have so much to get to.

675
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,720
I was trying to think of like, is there a more current reference at all?

676
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,240
Like I think of it's like, well, that first shins album to that second shins album.

677
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,360
And I'm like, that's the same time period.

678
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,040
What am I talking about?

679
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,920
The first shins album, I think even older than American idiot.

680
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Oh yeah.

681
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
Maybe.

682
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Hmm.

683
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
Maybe.

684
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
I don't know.

685
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
I don't remember.

686
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
I liked the second shins album.

687
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
It's a first shins album.

688
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,960
The one with the garden state songs with caring is creepy.

689
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Is that right?

690
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,800
Pretty well along before garden state.

691
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,280
Uh, but yes, a lot of it.

692
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,320
And then shoots too narrow is the second one.

693
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,800
I'm calling for a separate episode about shoots too narrow.

694
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,960
We got two already separate shins episode and that's going to be in country bear jamboree

695
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
week.

696
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Okay.

697
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Great.

698
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Perfect.

699
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,080
If you're a good boy in college, you would order them online on the CDs come to your

700
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,720
dorm room and yeah.

701
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,120
If you're what I say, if you were a good boy, if you were an idiot like me, you didn't know

702
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,360
how to steal music.

703
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Oh, I see.

704
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,720
Oh, you're so you were a good boy.

705
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,160
I was a good boy and I bought the album.

706
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Sure.

707
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Sure.

708
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Yeah.

709
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,200
So anyway, when they realized this was going to be a Florida specific attraction, that's

710
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,320
when it became country music because country music, country Western was the like, uh, dominant

711
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,200
music genre in Florida.

712
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,360
So I don't think I realized that that if it had started in California, maybe this is not

713
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,760
a country music attraction.

714
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Yeah.

715
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Not a jamboree at all.

716
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,560
I mean, I love the idea that they could have done just different bands for different spots,

717
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,480
different Disney parks, like different types of bear bands.

718
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
That's pretty fun.

719
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,760
Uh, so in Europe, is it like a craft works?

720
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Oh, sure.

721
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
Oh man.

722
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Oh, why?

723
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Oh jeez.

724
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Craft work.

725
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Uh, just a really art.

726
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Yeah.

727
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:44,320
With like, you know, we are the 3d components and they're aware that they're robots.

728
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
They know that they're robots.

729
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Yeah.

730
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,440
We like, like the craft works on.

731
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
We are the robots.

732
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,760
We, we're the bear robots.

733
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,200
We are the bear robots is what you could call it.

734
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,080
Uh, yeah, that would be perfect.

735
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
Oh boy.

736
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,080
Yeah.

737
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
I'm sorry.

738
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,760
You dampen my enthusiasm for the jamboree cause I'm just going to be thinking about

739
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
that hypothetical.

740
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,080
Also all of the, if you, if you kept it cause craft workers such like, you know, svelte guys

741
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,280
and then, but it's those kinds of suits, but like, but massive.

742
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Yeah.

743
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Yeah.

744
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
Fantastic.

745
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
Yeah.

746
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
700 pound.

747
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
So great.

748
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
Yeah.

749
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
That would be amazing.

750
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,920
Um, but I don't, the window for that has passed.

751
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,360
Sadly, there's no chance.

752
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,360
I don't think of us ever getting a new animatronic show based on characters that don't have a

753
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
TV show or movie.

754
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,280
I don't think maybe anywhere.

755
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,720
I don't think they're, because this kicked off, you know, I think I'm not sure that you

756
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,640
have Chuck E cheese without the country bear jamboree.

757
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,720
I think this is such a, you know, there'd been the Tiki room, uh, you know, there's

758
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,840
Lincoln and hall of presidents, but those aren't, you know, fun and for families, right.

759
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,280
Uh, depending on your view of things.

760
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:56,280
But, uh, this is, I mean, clearly the, just style wise and just the, you know, how much

761
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,960
you meet people and like, Hey, why don't you play us a two?

762
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,360
It's completely what Chuck E cheese turns out to them.

763
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,480
Yeah, for sure.

764
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:10,760
It's interesting because like where the Disney regional projects never really took off.

765
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,560
I mean, between mineral King and then there was that St. Louis indoor one Disney quest,

766
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,760
like very famously flamed out and, but Chuck E cheese got off the ground, but Disney couldn't

767
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,480
get their act together.

768
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
They tried weird.

769
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,960
Yeah, it is weird to think about it.

770
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,520
They had care, beloved characters that everyone knew, but they didn't figure it out.

771
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,960
I mean, I guess, yeah, Michael Eisner tried it later.

772
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
You got the store, but that's not the same.

773
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Yeah.

774
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Yeah.

775
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,840
I mean, how much did you look up in the rafters and wish that all of those characters, I loved

776
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
seeing those characters.

777
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
Yeah.

778
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
I wanted them to do something.

779
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Of course.

780
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Yeah.

781
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
But I mean, there were all these like rules.

782
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,000
And then like we talked about the directive DVD sequels and stuff where it's like, there

783
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,280
were just like rules in place.

784
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,520
And I think for awhile, the idea was like, Oh, they should be like just kind of contained

785
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,640
to hear.

786
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,280
But then Michael Eisner had some wild ideas, but then didn't go hard enough with them.

787
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,520
Maybe well, he was still stuck in the confines of the rules.

788
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,900
I mean, the same issues keep arising with that.

789
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,000
They can't get the regional stuff off the ground.

790
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,480
They can't get their act together there.

791
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,800
But also the problem you mentioned of, you know, Walt saying, how do we keep these people

792
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,420
and their money here at night?

793
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,720
That was the same idea with pleasure Island.

794
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,420
It's like they're leaving property.

795
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,240
They're leaving Disney world.

796
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,560
They're going to church street station or they're going elsewhere in Orlando.

797
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,520
We need some sort of nightlife.

798
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,520
Yeah.

799
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
Yeah.

800
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,520
Thing.

801
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,200
Um, which I don't look, I think if there's animatronic bear shows all over the country

802
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,640
in the world, everybody's money is going to it.

803
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,040
And that's still today.

804
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:51,840
I got not, not country bears, but I got like right before I came here, I was rewatching

805
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,600
the country bear jamboree and YouTube suggested it's like, do you want to watch this bear

806
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,480
animatronic show in Brazil?

807
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,960
It was also in England and I was like, what is this?

808
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,560
Like I had never come across this.

809
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,960
We have another episode to add this week.

810
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,640
I think it's worth looking into more, but I don't know anything about it.

811
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Oh, wow.

812
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Yeah.

813
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,920
And this look, this is inspired, this inspired a generation, multiple generations, uh, to

814
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,560
want to make their own animal talking animals show.

815
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,040
Uh, I think also people have written about it.

816
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
There is something about talking animals.

817
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,960
Like human beings have been obsessed with talking animals like forever and it is, it

818
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,320
is strange.

819
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
Yeah.

820
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,000
Like, but there is something about it that is funny, weird, fascinating.

821
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I don't know.

822
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,880
It works better than human shit, like human animatronics just like sort of end up creepy

823
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,760
or at least did until the recent past where they've kind of cracked a little better.

824
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,440
But these guys can be big and round and fuzzy and don't you just like every country bear,

825
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,640
don't you want to just like grab their face, just like see what that feels like?

826
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,560
Just like, yeah, they're, uh, give their cheeks the shake more than anything.

827
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
Yes.

828
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
I want to do that.

829
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,920
Uh, the bear it's just, it's like, I mean, it is funny.

830
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,640
Cause obviously like a bear doesn't talk.

831
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,120
So you go in here and you see a bear talking and then singing sad songs or weird songs

832
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,200
and it's funny.

833
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,760
It's really funny.

834
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,520
So I think somewhere in the, I don't know if this was Mark's concept or Walt's concept,

835
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,400
but I think somewhere in the brainstorm was just the idea that, you know, if we're staying

836
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:32,000
with the mythology of the, this is like, we're in this ski resort, we're near the Sequoias,

837
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,800
uh, you know, you're, it's a regional thing.

838
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,080
So, uh, where we went out and we found some bears and we trained the bears to be musicians,

839
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,520
but not very well.

840
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,400
They are technically trained, but the show is a problem and it's high jinks and falls

841
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
away.

842
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,400
And that's like, I kind of never thought of that as the concept of the show, but it's

843
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
pretty neat.

844
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,440
And I think it makes you, I think the fact that the show's coming apart at the seams

845
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,000
a little bit in a very Muppet show, you know, what predating the Muppet show, there is no

846
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,560
Muppet show yet.

847
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,280
And I think there's a lot of Muppet show feel to the Country Bear.

848
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Yeah.

849
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,120
Cause it's old, like vaudeville stage stuff and it definitely feels like, yeah, like,

850
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,920
like it's a fun zany show going wrong.

851
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,000
I didn't actually think of that, what you were saying about that.

852
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,160
Cause that is an element of the show is that it goes wrong, but it kind of isn't that bad.

853
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,920
I mean, like big L at the end is interrupting stuff and they argue with each other a little

854
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,560
bit, although they've cut some of the arguing from the recent, the newer show.

855
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:39,880
The newer version of the show, but in the vacation one, which we'll cover down the road,

856
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,680
there's the, there's the Rufus, the unseen bear who has to go fix problems.

857
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,520
Like you hear him climbing around to settle tech issues and what have you.

858
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,920
So that has a little bit of like coming apart at the scene, but yeah, it's, you know what?

859
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,560
Under that lens, they do a pretty good job.

860
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Yeah.

861
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,840
They're a lot more professional than the Muppets.

862
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,600
Good, good musicians.

863
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,800
They're all, a lot of them are a little goofy.

864
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,640
Some of them are a little horny.

865
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,200
I think we can safely say that.

866
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,360
Well, I also very, yes, the show is horny, which is funny, which is something that, cause

867
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,480
when Lindsay and I went to Disney world, which I hadn't been in like 10 years, we went like

868
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,920
now, I guess 10 years ago that we went and we, I hadn't seen it in a decade or more and

869
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,120
we watched it and we were high.

870
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,120
We thought it was so weird and funny.

871
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,720
Not literally, of course.

872
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,520
Well, no, no, not literally.

873
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
No, of course.

874
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
Hope not.

875
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
But we ran up to somebody.

876
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,880
I'm sure I said this on the show before we ran up to cast members like, Oh, where's all

877
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,600
the, where's the country bear merchandise?

878
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
And they were like, we don't have any.

879
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,680
And I was like, we were like, what?

880
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,760
This is unbelievable.

881
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
But yes, the bears are horny.

882
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,600
I always thought, I always interpret it that a lot of them are hammered.

883
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,360
Like, like they're like, cause they're goofy.

884
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:57,240
You're saying goofy, but like they're like weird, like they seem out of it.

885
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,920
And I feel like that's a, you know, thing about country Western music, you know, and

886
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,080
honky tonks and dive bars and stuff.

887
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Is it, they're all hammered?

888
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,080
You get, yeah, you get a little hammered, maybe a paid in drinks, you know?

889
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,240
But they're drinking human alcohol and it has the same effects as it would on a human.

890
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,240
I think, yeah.

891
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,080
If you give a bear moonshine, he's going to get drunk.

892
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
Suppose so.

893
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,880
Is that a thing, like other videos of like the bear broke into the, you mean like, like

894
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,840
on a frat party and it's like, let's get the bear drunk, man.

895
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,800
That's a dangerous endeavor for this frat, but, uh, I don't know.

896
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,080
I don't know if there's drunken bear YouTube videos.

897
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,600
It's like a dark part of the internet.

898
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,680
Bear bags in the Boy Scouts.

899
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,480
You'd have to, if anyone's gone camping around bears, you've talked about bear bags on the

900
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
show before.

901
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
Have I?

902
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Yeah.

903
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
I think it's so interesting.

904
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,160
I mean, you, you just put all of your food, essentially, like most of your like dry good

905
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,800
food that you can't like seal in an airtight cooler or something, you put it in a bag and

906
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,640
you tie it with a rope and you hoist it up in the trees.

907
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,520
So the bear can't really get to it.

908
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
Yeah.

909
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,960
So you put your moonshine up in the tree so the bear can't get it during the night when

910
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
you're sleeping.

911
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Sure.

912
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,220
According to backpacker.com, the answer is a qualified yes.

913
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,520
Like almost all animals, uh, wait a minute.

914
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,560
This is like from the point of view of a bear.

915
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
All right.

916
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
I'm confused by this.

917
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
I don't know how to appeal.

918
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,480
I was starting to read it and it was like, ah, yes, I can.

919
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
All right.

920
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Well, I guess, all right.

921
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,680
I am susceptible to the sauce and will experience the effects of alcohol provided I drink a

922
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
ton of it.

923
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
I see.

924
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,840
Uh, there's got to, what animal wouldn't get drunk if you gave it alcohol?

925
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,880
Oh, here's a, uh, in 2004 federal wildlife agents found a black bear passed down on the

926
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,120
lawn of a resort in Baker Lake, Washington after drinking 36 cans of beer.

927
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
Oh my God.

928
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,120
Sure.

929
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
So there's one.

930
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
How did that happen?

931
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,640
Wait, how do you like 36 cans?

932
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,720
You slash a cube that you slash like a, a crate of though.

933
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,720
I guess so.

934
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,960
But in the slashing doesn't most of the beer come out.

935
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Yeah.

936
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
How would the bear get it?

937
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,400
How would it know to like have its mouth by it?

938
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,080
Put your mouth, but you start, you smell it and you start like licking it up, you know,

939
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
36 cans though.

940
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Then keep popping it, crushing it on its own head after it completes a can.

941
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Uh, this is another, maybe the, you know, the daily nature of this, we can go off and

942
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
do homework.

943
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:30,200
I can get the full story of the Baker Lake drunk black bear incidents, figure out the

944
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,520
logic of it.

945
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,040
Uh, so John Lennon is homework, black bear is homework, but bears can get drunk.

946
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,920
So you're saying that these are, well, does this bother you?

947
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:45,160
Does it bother you that these are, uh, inebriated horned up performers?

948
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,240
Uh, it doesn't bother me.

949
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
They're not real.

950
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:55,320
They're, it's a, it's a fun, fun fantasy life for bears are anthropomorphic.

951
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,520
Uh, so no, I am not so bothered by it.

952
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:04,840
Um, but this is, I was thinking how, you know, because it's almost impossible to unravel

953
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,840
where some of the threads over the years on these podcasts have come from, but I do feel

954
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:16,440
like country bear jamboree is one of the primary sources in theme park world of Mae West level

955
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:24,000
sexuality, which has I think been a runner in your comfort level with such sexuality.

956
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Yeah.

957
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Interesting.

958
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,400
Uh, well, Mae West, I'd say all of the female bears, Mae West herself obviously was a big

959
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
influx.

960
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,280
She, everybody's been doing the Mae West thing.

961
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,000
I think for Ms. Piggy, everybody, like that's a rich tradition of kind of that vibe that

962
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Mae West vibe.

963
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,600
Um, so yeah, no, I think it would be interesting to know where this thread came from when the

964
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:53,440
first time I, I wrinkled my nose up at some sort of bodyness and was bought was the first

965
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,120
use of the word body related to the country bears.

966
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,920
I think it was, I misused the word body.

967
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,320
I think that's honestly what it was.

968
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
I used it wrong.

969
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,240
I was like an idiot and said body in the wrong way and then now I'm Mr. Body.

970
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,720
I'm bodyness is part of the fabric.

971
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
Yes.

972
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,720
Uh, so yeah.

973
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,960
Uh, but no, this is, uh, um, this is the ball.

974
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,600
If a bodyness is funny, I have to give it up to it.

975
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,680
I have to give it up for the body.

976
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,600
It's body is for the sake of bodyness.

977
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Yeah.

978
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,440
If it's, if you're just trying to be body and trying to be shocking, then that's not

979
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
something I'm interested in.

980
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,480
But if it's in this, in this service of comedy, in the service of comedy and it's funny little

981
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
bears doing it.

982
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
And it's safer.

983
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,480
Yes.

984
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,160
Saying like, as soon as I find a ladder, I'll be right up.

985
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
You know?

986
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,080
Well, the show would be a lot creepier for humans.

987
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,080
It would be much creepier.

988
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,080
Yeah.

989
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:45,000
If everything that happened in it was a similarly proportioned human being.

990
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yes.

991
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,400
It would be one of the most disturbing shows of all time.

992
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
The country guys.

993
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
The country guys.

994
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
The country guys.

995
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,480
If it was older country guys who all look like they're melting.

996
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,480
If it's like a late in life Elvis.

997
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,640
The Knott's Berry farm like mine train.

998
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,640
Oh God.

999
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
The log workers.

1000
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
The lumber workers.

1001
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,280
A bunch of like wrinkle.

1002
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,080
You look at them and think that they're 68, but they're actually 31.

1003
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,320
They just lived a hard life.

1004
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
Yeah.

1005
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,000
The show would not be the same.

1006
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,520
You'd be really worried about that one kid one.

1007
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,520
Yeah.

1008
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,760
As it stands, the kid who sits with the band, he's like part of the family.

1009
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,040
But if there's only one child in this seedy world, you could rescue him.

1010
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,400
Raise him as your own.

1011
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,160
There would be a lot of concern if this was a human based show.

1012
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,040
There would be a lot of people you would be worried about.

1013
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,680
But yes, again, this is fun.

1014
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
It's a fantasy.

1015
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,680
Yeah.

1016
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
The bears aren't real.

1017
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,680
Uh huh.

1018
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,680
Uh huh.

1019
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,720
So, oh you know who we should, because you guys brought this name to my attention.

1020
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,640
Mark Davis isn't the only person to credit with the formation of this.

1021
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,080
There's the guy, Al Bertino.

1022
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,440
I hadn't heard that name until you brought him up and I needed it explained to me.

1023
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,760
I was like, Albertino?

1024
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
What is that?

1025
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,680
No, it's Al, space, Bertino.

1026
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,800
And he is the namesake of Big Al, the biggest, saddest country bear.

1027
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,080
So we know anything else about Albertino.

1028
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,760
Oh, that's about the Imagineer.

1029
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,280
Oh, and I don't have anything written down here.

1030
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,960
So I'm sure there's a lot about him, but I don't either.

1031
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,960
All right.

1032
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,760
Well, Al, you're not getting your full due then.

1033
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,200
I know that Big Al is, you know, at the Disneyland version of this ride, there used to be like

1034
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,280
bear sized dressing room doors.

1035
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,480
Yeah.

1036
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:39,800
And I always forget this, but Big Al's full name is technically Big Albert, which is very

1037
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,760
funny to me in that it sounds like a thing that John Kerry messed up on the campaign

1038
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
trail.

1039
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,200
Like he was just like, I love the music of Big Albert.

1040
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,720
Or like when he would get like when a politician just clumsily like they were prepped with

1041
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,520
a local reference and they eat it, like they do something a little wrong.

1042
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,920
What did John Kerry say?

1043
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,800
Did he have a famous mess up of the?

1044
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,160
Well, I mean, his whole vibe, like nothing he said sounds natural, but in Philadelphia,

1045
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,880
he got a lot of flack because he went to a cheesesteak place and ordered a cheesesteak

1046
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,320
with Swiss cheese, which get the fuck out of here, fancy man.

1047
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,520
Like that, you don't do that.

1048
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,520
That doesn't fly.

1049
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
Cost them the election.

1050
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,520
Cost them the election.

1051
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Yeah.

1052
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,560
Jason voted for Bush that year.

1053
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,560
It genuinely could not in his case.

1054
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,880
He was, I don't think he came close, but being that Pennsylvania is a swing state, you really

1055
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,040
can't mess that one up.

1056
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,040
Yeah.

1057
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,040
You got to know.

1058
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,040
Very densely populated Southeastern PA.

1059
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,560
You got to know.

1060
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,520
Don't fuck up your sandwiches.

1061
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,440
Any future candidates, please.

1062
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,320
The future of the world depends on it.

1063
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,320
That's true.

1064
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,240
Jason's willing to coach you through regional.

1065
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,240
I will coach you through.

1066
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,240
Rolls and candies and.

1067
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,240
Yeah.

1068
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,520
Cause cause I think he had Pittsburgh cause Teresa Heinz Carey, you know, that that she

1069
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,520
would have Pittsburgh.

1070
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,240
She'd be like, okay, some of the places here put french fries and coleslaw on the sandwich.

1071
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,080
So don't be confused, John.

1072
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,280
Like don't freak out, you know.

1073
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,800
Jason, you brought up that room.

1074
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,320
I love that room.

1075
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,400
I got to be in that room in Japan, the pre show room.

1076
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,960
Yes, with essentially nobody in it because there was this horrible rainstorm.

1077
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,240
The only one of my Japan trip that cleared out Tokyo Disneyland.

1078
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,600
And since we survived it, we had every room to ourselves.

1079
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,800
So we're just running around.

1080
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,280
I hadn't looked at the pictures in a long time, but we went up to every door because

1081
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,080
all of these characters and probably one thing we got to do is sort out these characters

1082
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:39,240
because I didn't know straight till we started thinking about this show more.

1083
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,440
But every character has doors that represents their, their height.

1084
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,680
It's little, it's short doors for short characters, tall doors for tall characters.

1085
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:55,760
There's doors that like expand out in the seat zone, only the seat zone so they can

1086
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,860
make it through a swing and Teddy Barra.

1087
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,280
The one who is, is it Barra or Barra?

1088
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,280
Am I saying Barra?

1089
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,280
I always heard it as Barra.

1090
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
It's probably Barra.

1091
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,280
I might be.

1092
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,280
All right.

1093
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,280
I'll, I'll, I'll stop it there.

1094
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,520
I'm sorry, Teddy Barra, I think there's a little ladder and the door is up in the ceiling.

1095
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:17,480
Oh, so she's going to climb up to get to her spot.

1096
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,040
And so much other fun nonsense.

1097
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:27,480
Like there is the song that they, they sing you on the way out the door.

1098
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,640
There is musical notation of it that's scratched into wood.

1099
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:38,560
Like Henry, the host like made the music notes, but scratched it with his claw.

1100
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:44,600
I think they also have a record that is screwed that they scratched themselves like a weird

1101
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,920
clunky bear scratched vinyl.

1102
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,800
A lot of fun details in that opening room.

1103
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,280
Yeah, that's really great.

1104
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,840
I, I'm trying to remember.

1105
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,280
We, we, I end up, I feel like we ended up rushing through that more in Tokyo when we

1106
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,560
were there.

1107
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,440
But going through back on the YouTube and looking at it, it's like, it is a pro.

1108
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,360
Now would you say Scott, this queue is something that you would just skip immediately to go

1109
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,360
into the theater.

1110
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,680
I'm just saying it sounds pretty great.

1111
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,040
I think that there's no version where you, there'd be like a long enough line where you'd

1112
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:24,280
have to, but, but if there was a teleport machine outside of the country bear to teleport

1113
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,640
you right into your seat, straight.

1114
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,200
Look the answer is yes.

1115
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,720
There is no one skippable queue.

1116
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,720
There's no such thing.

1117
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,960
I stand by this lot.

1118
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,280
This is not the episode.

1119
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,400
It's not the episode to do it.

1120
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,120
We have too much too much to cover.

1121
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,120
Sorry.

1122
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
Too much.

1123
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,760
We don't have the time here to discuss the issue that I was correct on in which there

1124
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,440
was almost no support for the other side.

1125
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,440
Anyway, moving on.

1126
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,560
Well, we'll just, we'll discuss it in 2022.

1127
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,520
We'll, we'll earmark it for that.

1128
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,800
Cause again, I have, I have emails.

1129
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,920
We'll talk about these emails.

1130
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,920
Yeah.

1131
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,400
Oh boy, that morning I thought I was going to open it.

1132
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,040
I thought I was going to be so mad at me.

1133
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,120
It was just a day of, I'm just laying back in bed.

1134
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,680
Ah, another Scott is right.

1135
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,000
Why another Scott is right?

1136
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So good.

1137
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So good to be me.

1138
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,680
Well, you know, what it'll be a whole, we'll do two and a half hours.

1139
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,520
And we'll bring in many judges.

1140
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,760
I think too, there'll be a lot of independent, like independent councils and independent

1141
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,440
judiciary bodies to help us litigate this, whatever it takes.

1142
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,440
I'm ready for it.

1143
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,440
I'm up for it.

1144
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
Me too.

1145
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,040
Folks prepare for it.

1146
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,840
Um, anyway, you were the building that you're in is, uh, is grizzly hall.

1147
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,200
Hello, grizzly hall.

1148
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,680
That's technically where you are.

1149
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,160
Um, it's not like anything else before you're just, you're in the place.

1150
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,840
Um, you know, it's a, just a great place to see that beautiful Disney wood.

1151
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,840
Yeah.

1152
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,560
Uh, it's the best thing about frontier land or anything with a similar theme that it's

1153
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,560
old and tarnished, but also shiny.

1154
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,080
You want to like touch every inch of the room.

1155
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,080
Yeah.

1156
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,520
It would just looks great, feels great.

1157
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,880
Um, and I, uh, yeah, I do, I do love, uh, I do love grizzly hall.

1158
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,120
There's the old before they redid like Mrs. Knott's, I got the same vibe.

1159
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,840
Even though the country bear lobby is better.

1160
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,640
It's like, I still get the same vibe.

1161
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,760
Like you're a hundred years back in time, maybe like there's an old vibe there.

1162
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,760
Yeah.

1163
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:26,240
I remember I kind of all my memories of country, but I remember are being in this room largely

1164
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,640
empty, not just when I went recently in Tokyo, but like usually, and cause I feel like just

1165
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:37,000
my park day trajectory, it would always be, I wouldn't get here till close to closing.

1166
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,360
So you're in, and everybody's kind of like, nobody's seeing this thing late.

1167
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,040
And I just have fond memories of like Disneyland's getting dim and it's all lantern lit around

1168
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,360
frontier land now.

1169
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,520
And a lot of, a lot of kids have gone home, but my mom's sticking it out with me or whatever

1170
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,520
it is.

1171
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,240
And where we got, we got grizzly hall to ourselves.

1172
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,940
Um, so yeah, your memory is see, cause I saw this when I was little and I always liked it,

1173
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:06,000
but I was not, I didn't like country music as a little kid.

1174
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,640
No, I liked the animal.

1175
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,480
I liked the robots, but I obviously didn't get any of the joke.

1176
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,460
I didn't get most of the jokes.

1177
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,160
So it didn't make a huge impression on me.

1178
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,640
It's like, do you have memories of seeing it specific?

1179
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,520
You're saying, I guess you do.

1180
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,520
I do.

1181
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,920
I like, I mean, my whole thing with it, I feel like I find this thing, like, uh, I always

1182
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,680
liked it as a kid and I find it so pleasant and fun and I've always dug it, but the characters

1183
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,920
have always been muddy in my head.

1184
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,080
I don't, I haven't, like, I don't have a lot of like individual beats memory.

1185
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,920
It's just a general feeling.

1186
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,320
I like those guys on the wall, but I didn't have the names memorized, but where do you,

1187
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:51,000
like, uh, did you get up to speed, Mike, in preparing for Jambor Week or did you have

1188
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,840
a lot of this mythology set just from like liking it in the last decade?

1189
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,040
No, there's still a lot of stuff I had to refresh.

1190
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,600
Like, I know who Wendell is.

1191
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,800
I know who Big Al is.

1192
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:06,480
I know the Sunbonnet trio, but there's like, I need Oscar is the little boy you referenced,

1193
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,480
I believe.

1194
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,480
Baby Oscar, baby Oscar.

1195
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,480
Yeah.

1196
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,480
I didn't know that.

1197
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,400
I couldn't have picked out Zeke and Zeb, like which one is which in the, even though it's

1198
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,640
in the song, if you think about it, because he says who's playing what.

1199
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,360
And somewhere it's implied that Zeb is the father of baby Oscar.

1200
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,360
I believe that's correct.

1201
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,080
I have that written down just to make sure.

1202
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,200
Yeah, it's Zeb's son, it says.

1203
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,200
Yeah.

1204
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,560
When I saw this in Florida recently, first off, Pac Theater, everyone into it, clapping

1205
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:40,520
along, but also much of the day, Wendell and Big Al on the roof waving, waving, taking

1206
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,520
pictures, mugging.

1207
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,520
Really?

1208
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,040
Still doing the suits, still the suited characters.

1209
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:51,600
Yeah, there's a lot of cavalcades right now in Florida, a lot of quick character pop-ups

1210
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:57,240
or character, or like Chip and Dale were doing like loops on a raft, on like the rafts over

1211
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,600
to Tom Sawyer Island.

1212
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:03,480
They had one of the rafts set aside and they were on the rafts like in cowboy attire, waving,

1213
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,480
like doing.

1214
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,160
So one everywhere, there was one point where we were standing on that sort of footbridge

1215
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:15,340
shortcut in Frontierland and you could see Chip and Dale doing raft loops.

1216
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:20,640
There was a cavalcade like float coming by with a bunch of characters and then Big Al

1217
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,000
and Wendell are on top doing a dance to the music the float is playing.

1218
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,340
And so everywhere you look, there was stuff going on.

1219
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,480
So that was very exciting.

1220
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,480
Wow, wow.

1221
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,480
And that's one thing to say that the country bears have maintained as suited characters

1222
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,040
and they still show up in Disneyland once in a while, don't they?

1223
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,040
Like special events?

1224
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,840
Oh yeah, we got our pictures with them I believe when we did Thanksgiving years ago at the

1225
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,680
Disneyland Hotel at the buffet.

1226
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,780
We had Thanksgiving at the Disneyland Hotel many years ago.

1227
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,880
We had photos with them then.

1228
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,480
They'll pop up in California Adventure sometime over in the Grizzly Peak area.

1229
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,480
Wow, wow.

1230
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,280
And then of course I danced with them in Tomorrowland a couple years ago at a dance place.

1231
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,600
I walked over and excitedly took some photos with them because they were all dancing to

1232
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,720
like a DJ with a bunch of people.

1233
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,280
So yeah, they wander around.

1234
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,960
Has anybody seen Club Buzz yet?

1235
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:18,480
This is a no, we don't have time to do this, but there's like a light rave happening at

1236
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,080
Tomorrowland at night now in Disneyland where Buzz Lightyear stands on the top of the interventions

1237
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:29,200
building while like loud music plays like music and there's a lot of lights.

1238
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,640
Oh, interesting because Club Buzz was also the name of the short lived name of the Tomorrowland

1239
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,800
stage for a little while.

1240
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,400
Yes, I think it's, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm misremembering, but I think it's Club Buzz

1241
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,720
what they're calling it, but it could be wrong.

1242
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,720
Oh, that's fun.

1243
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,800
So anyway, that's a different, hopefully the country bears will party there in Tomorrowland

1244
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,280
again and I'll get to see them.

1245
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,280
Sure.

1246
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,280
Hope so.

1247
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,280
If they aren't busy.

1248
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,280
If they aren't busy.

1249
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,280
They can make time.

1250
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,880
Yeah, well their home was destroyed so.

1251
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
Yeah.

1252
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,880
Yeah, yeah.

1253
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:02,160
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh has so much blood on its hands, Toad Hall, Grizzly the

1254
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,160
theater.

1255
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,160
Yeah.

1256
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,360
It's evicted some of the greats.

1257
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,760
Let's keep talking about characters.

1258
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1259
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,960
Let's get everybody straight and give them their due.

1260
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:19,440
And I don't think there's any order we got to go in here, but just like, let's talk about

1261
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,440
everybody.

1262
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,440
Well, yeah.

1263
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,240
Do you want to do the guys on the wall?

1264
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,240
Yeah.

1265
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,240
Yeah, I guess we are.

1266
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,320
That's order, but Melvin Moose.

1267
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,000
So yeah, basically they're mounted heads of animals and they're talking in case you haven't

1268
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
seen the show.

1269
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,480
I also, by the way, I know it's an hour in, but maybe you watched the show too, if you

1270
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,480
haven't seen it ever.

1271
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,480
Yeah.

1272
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,480
Yeah, I was thinking that.

1273
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,640
To know what the hell we're talking about.

1274
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:48,160
Because you mentioned the show getting shortened and we both went down around 2012, 2011.

1275
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,540
And so we like, and it was closed in August of that year to shorten it.

1276
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:59,600
So it's very, very good chance that we saw one of the last showings, the last runs of

1277
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
like the full.

1278
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,600
Maybe.

1279
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,600
Unabridged show.

1280
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,600
That's interesting.

1281
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,600
Yeah, I'm not sure.

1282
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,680
You can find the Unabridged show on the record album, which you can get on the iTunes store.

1283
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:14,800
And that has the banter, has the song that was cut and then some other area music kind

1284
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,800
of stuff.

1285
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,800
Yeah.

1286
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,800
The full show is still in Japan.

1287
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,800
They still do the full one in Japan.

1288
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,800
Oh, okay.

1289
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,800
But they've got stuff.

1290
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,800
And all the holiday versions.

1291
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,520
Oh, yes, the other two versions that they don't do that in Florida.

1292
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,520
Geez.

1293
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,520
Amazing.

1294
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,520
So yeah.

1295
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,520
So there's three mounted heads.

1296
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,520
Max, Buff and Melvin.

1297
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,520
Buff is a buffalo.

1298
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,520
Melvin is a moose.

1299
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,520
Wait, Melvin's a moose.

1300
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,520
Max is a deer.

1301
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,520
Yes.

1302
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,520
Okay.

1303
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,520
Yes.

1304
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:45,720
And I think that's probably my favorite aspect of it as a kid.

1305
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,400
That's like, you know, utilizing the space in an exciting way.

1306
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,920
The show is not just in front of you.

1307
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,920
It's over here.

1308
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,920
It's all around you.

1309
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,160
And you get to leave the theater under them and they're still singing.

1310
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,080
The show is still going on.

1311
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:06,120
And I didn't know that, or I forgot that the mounted heads were also up in a restaurant

1312
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:13,520
next door to both of the American versions at the mile long bar that you would go and

1313
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:19,240
the heads were there and would, they were moving the entire time.

1314
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,480
Once every few minutes there would be a song.

1315
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,840
And if there wasn't a song, then they're just like looking around and blinking in a very

1316
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,960
Chuck E. Cheese fashion.

1317
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,480
It's all very Chuck E. Cheese.

1318
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,480
Yeah.

1319
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,480
When you read about it.

1320
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,920
Um, but yeah, those, I, I, what do, what was the year that closed those places closed?

1321
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,920
Do we know?

1322
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,920
The nineties sometime.

1323
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,920
I don't know.

1324
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,920
I don't think I ever went in those.

1325
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,640
I didn't have a memory of going in those.

1326
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,400
Do you, do you remember that?

1327
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,400
All that stuff.

1328
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:53,680
Yeah, a lot of that was closed with, um, the, the, uh, Winnie the Pooh when it shifted from

1329
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,560
bear country to credit country.

1330
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,920
Even before that, I think I have the faintest childhood memory.

1331
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,160
I'd say, and say, wait, and they're out here too.

1332
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,160
That's also like, felt funny to me that the hair that they're like, and is it the same

1333
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,800
ones or did they move?

1334
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,760
Did they, uh, are they alive animals with full bodies and they just walked over to different

1335
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,760
holes?

1336
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:20,440
The long bar I read had mirrors at either end so that it wasn't obviously a mile long,

1337
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,440
but it would look longer.

1338
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,120
The image bounced back and forth and yeah, it looked like it went on into infinity.

1339
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,360
Um, yeah.

1340
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,960
Uh, that's cool.

1341
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,960
Frontier land flavor or whatever bear country flavor.

1342
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:38,400
Um, I, you know, I, I, as often I do, I like going to these Disney dot fandom type, uh,

1343
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,640
places or, uh, this might've been on the sea of the society of explorers and engineers

1344
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:49,920
specific Wiki, uh, which, because I think there's in some bizarre way you could say

1345
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,240
that Melvin, Buff and Max, the heads are in the sea universe.

1346
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,960
And I don't remember why it seemed like a stretch to me, but I'm reading a thing and,

1347
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,960
uh, this is a nice way to put what they are.

1348
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,640
Um, Melvin, Buff and Max were a moose, buffalo and deer, which at some point in the 19th

1349
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,880
century were hunted and turned into taxidermy mounted heads.

1350
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:15,160
However, the three did not die and instead stayed sentient via unknown means.

1351
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,400
And we're also able to communicate in English.

1352
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,240
I mean, that is correct.

1353
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,080
It is true.

1354
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,400
I can't argue with the truth of what they're saying.

1355
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,880
It's just a bizarre way to put it.

1356
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,080
I don't know how you know 19th century.

1357
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,760
I don't know that like that they stayed alive.

1358
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,760
I just don't look, I don't think of the reality of, isn't it just that magic happens?

1359
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,080
I think that when the cast member walks up to the front of the room and starts the show,

1360
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:49,440
he also kind of like, he brings a little pixie dust with him and it turns that, I don't think

1361
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,600
these are alive.

1362
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,080
And if so, they're not singing.

1363
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:58,840
If these heads are, have been alive for 200 years, um, and feel the pain of when their

1364
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,040
body was severed off of them.

1365
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,320
You're saying it's a more fun, it's a, it's better to think about it like, oh, just by,

1366
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,400
you know, touching the dial, it turns magic on and they're alive again.

1367
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,440
And it's a fun little show they put on and then they go back to not existing.

1368
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,640
Their consciousness is again gone.

1369
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,000
They don't know the pain of having died or being dead.

1370
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,840
Or it's magic has to be involved.

1371
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:26,600
It's gotta be a, like a beauty and the beast enchanted objects in the castle situation,

1372
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,600
right?

1373
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:33,080
Not some weird, they held on to a glimmer of life.

1374
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,200
Just a few alive brain cells.

1375
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,640
They live the most tortured existence of any creature.

1376
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,640
Yeah.

1377
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,640
Okay.

1378
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,640
That's less fun.

1379
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,640
Um, it is similar.

1380
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,520
I'm trying to, I have not read the Oz books and I, I have not read many books cause I'm

1381
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,040
a fucking idiot, but, uh, the Oz books, there's a character in return to Oz.

1382
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,440
That's a disembodied moose head.

1383
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,800
Um, that's like mounted that, that, that kind of flies, helps them fly like whatever kind

1384
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,760
of like sleigh that's, I was just looking up the name cause I forgot the name.

1385
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,320
The name is the gump, but I do wonder where is like, this is the character.

1386
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:14,560
So I wonder if this was, um, maybe inspired by an old Frank L. Baum character.

1387
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,560
Oh, probably.

1388
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,960
He had a lot of influence.

1389
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,180
So I wonder, yeah, I wonder if, is he the originator of disembodied animal head that's

1390
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,180
still alive?

1391
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,800
Where's the first part?

1392
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,560
Where's the first instance of that in fiction?

1393
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,560
I don't know.

1394
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,560
Could be.

1395
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,560
It's a monster.

1396
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,560
He's a monster.

1397
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:36,260
So yeah, condemned these fictional characters to the gump is not as

1398
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,800
fun as these three characters.

1399
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,720
I will say that a lot more disturbing.

1400
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,560
Um, uh, buff my favorite voice in all of theme park world is thorough Ravens.

1401
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,000
Croft, the deep voice, the deepest voice guy, sure.

1402
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,120
One of the bus, uh, uh, open the fantasy land castle, that guy.

1403
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,800
So that's another thing that gives me fun.

1404
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,800
Thorough Ravens.

1405
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,880
Croft is just a texture in, in similar to like, I dunno, I like Disneyland lanterns

1406
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,580
and the way they light up trees and I like the wood and I like the voice of that guy.

1407
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:10,400
That's just like part of enough of the attractions and Africa, the place that it's magical to

1408
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,400
me.

1409
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,400
Yeah.

1410
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,400
I was going to mention Max.

1411
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:19,200
The buck is voiced by Peter Rennaday, who is not also in this show.

1412
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:24,800
He is the voice of Henry, your master of ceremonies has come up before on, on the show because

1413
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:30,960
he is the voice of captain Nemo in the 20,000 leagues attraction of Florida.

1414
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,040
He's he's doing the, um, James Mason impression.

1415
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,280
I didn't realize this or maybe I had a couple of realizations where it's like, I may have

1416
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,520
known this at some point and totally forgot it and relearned it.

1417
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:48,160
He is the voice for years of the, um, tomorrow land transit authority.

1418
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:54,840
When that reopened the people mover, the narration, the narration until 2009 and from like 94,

1419
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,440
2000, he's the guy.

1420
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,800
Uh, and, and that means he is also my phone ringtone because a portion of that announcement

1421
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,320
is my phone ringtone.

1422
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,320
Get your phone on.

1423
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,320
I'm going to call you.

1424
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,320
I'm going to call you.

1425
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,320
Yeah.

1426
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,320
What do you mean a portion of it?

1427
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,320
It's here.

1428
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,320
Turn everything off.

1429
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,320
I don't know if I've ever played this before.

1430
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,320
I don't.

1431
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,320
Uh, yeah.

1432
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,920
But I heard you get a phone call once a month when I actually get a phone call with a ring

1433
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:17,920
because it's usually on vibrate.

1434
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:18,920
Uh, okay.

1435
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,920
Here we go.

1436
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,920
I never had my phone on.

1437
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,920
Yeah.

1438
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,920
All right.

1439
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,920
Let's uh, let's see.

1440
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,920
Tomorrowland transit authority Metroliner nonstop now departing rocket tower Plaza

1441
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,920
station for a round trip.

1442
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,520
Whoa.

1443
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,280
And, and, and that was a pain in the ass to clip too.

1444
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,520
Cause if you try to make a ringtone, uh, in this modern era, it is, um, yeah, it's real

1445
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,520
pain in the ass.

1446
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,600
There's so much security stuff still on the iPhone.

1447
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:51,160
So you had to rip, I think I had to rip a YouTube video for the audio and then edit

1448
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:57,400
the audio down and then convert it to ringtone file type and then add it to iTunes and then

1449
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,080
import that to my phone.

1450
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,200
Oh, so this is not, this was not available for you.

1451
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,200
You made this custom.

1452
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,200
I, yeah, I made this.

1453
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,480
You just confessed to a crime.

1454
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,480
I did.

1455
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,480
I did confess to a crime.

1456
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,440
Peter Renned is not getting any residuals.

1457
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,760
Oh, for every time you have a phone call, he should get a couple bucks.

1458
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,760
Well, he should.

1459
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,760
And, and it's a shame he's not in the park because it's like some, Hey, you're right.

1460
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,760
And the people move it.

1461
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,760
Like it's a different voice.

1462
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,760
Oh, is it like a cool skateboarding kid?

1463
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,760
It's a cool skateboarding kid since like 2009.

1464
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,760
Yeah.

1465
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,760
Oh really?

1466
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,760
I didn't really, I mean, I've been on it.

1467
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,440
I haven't listened to that.

1468
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,360
It's really, maybe this should be, maybe this is unfair to put it on.

1469
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,000
Well, no, some of it, Jason knows Peter Renned a some money for sure.

1470
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,920
But I think at this point, anybody who calls him like myself, unfortunately, I think I

1471
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,040
owe Peter Renned a day.

1472
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:47,440
If anyone has Peter Renned days address that voice that you heard, let me know so that

1473
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,360
I can send him three cents in the mail.

1474
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,360
Okay.

1475
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,360
Yeah.

1476
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,360
I owe him that much.

1477
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,360
Let us know.

1478
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,360
Yeah.

1479
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,560
I'm going to have to wait a little bit after to see if I could get this to just go off

1480
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:03,640
constantly in the episode, but you've already, I switched it back to do not do not disturb.

1481
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,640
Yeah.

1482
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:10,120
What would it sound like if, if you were called and you put the phone next to the jug with

1483
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,120
that reverberate?

1484
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:15,000
Oh, Renned a day was laying the jug.

1485
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I guess it wouldn't be that good.

1486
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Probably wouldn't sound like anything.

1487
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,040
Also all this talk, I hope I have that fact right.

1488
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:25,400
Cause I, I saw it and I, cause I was just assumed because it sounds very Jack Wagner

1489
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,840
re and I was like, Oh, did they get in to do this?

1490
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,840
I looked it up.

1491
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,360
Jack Wagner was alive.

1492
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,900
He passed away in 95.

1493
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,760
So I was like, okay, it was possible.

1494
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,760
But then I think you're right.

1495
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,160
I'm seeing people saying that, that it was him.

1496
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,160
But what do you do?

1497
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,160
Do a double check.

1498
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,160
I think so.

1499
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,240
Well, and the big voice of this guy is splinter.

1500
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,240
This is splinter.

1501
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,520
He's voices in the country, but Jamboree, the host of the country, but Jamboree.

1502
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:54,960
Uh, any splinter, not just in the cartoon, but in the coming out of their shells life

1503
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:02,600
to he is, he does the spoken word pre before we did all have a set about this on the Patreon

1504
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:09,280
where, uh, there's spoken word, which sounds like old splinter before it shifts over to

1505
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,280
sub Brian Adams.

1506
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:21,160
And water nature surrounds, uh, skipping stones, uh, which I was by the way, singing this in

1507
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:28,760
the car and on Lindsay two days ago, I think water surrounds me, which was preceded by

1508
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,880
you saying, I have a pitch for our first dance at our wedding.

1509
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,880
Oh my God.

1510
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,880
You know, it's on the list.

1511
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,880
You know, it's on the list.

1512
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:42,840
Really, I'm sure, well, I'm sure it's a perfectly normal and romantic song.

1513
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,000
Mike, would you feel free to sing it to me?

1514
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,960
Well, if I, if you insist, let me get the outfit on first though.

1515
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,760
Wait a minute.

1516
01:06:52,760 --> 01:07:00,000
I'm also seeing the names BJ ward and Mike Brazel, uh, under transit authority.

1517
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,160
So this is going to drive me nuts.

1518
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,160
Oh no.

1519
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,160
Well, you know what?

1520
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,120
With the, the character, some of the characters in the country bears, I know have had two

1521
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,000
voices they've been, people have done right now.

1522
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,080
BJ ward is now it looks like I think you were completely.

1523
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,080
Oh, okay.

1524
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:17,880
BJ ward is the one who's like, he's talking about like, cause when you're writing it,

1525
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,720
there was the narrator and then there was announcements and they're very similar in

1526
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,720
tone.

1527
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,720
The voices.

1528
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,400
So your word is now and Mike Bressel is there's no such person.

1529
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,400
I think you hallucinated that.

1530
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,400
Oh, but it says on Disney.

1531
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,400
Oh, okay.

1532
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,400
No, no, you made them up.

1533
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,400
You're seeing things.

1534
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
We don't have to deal with Mike Bressel.

1535
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,400
There's no Mike Bressel.

1536
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:40,600
So, so he's great and he's Henry.

1537
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:46,680
Henry is the host of the show in his, in his top hats and his dapper.

1538
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,120
What is it called when you have just a, like a dicky, the oval?

1539
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,120
Yes.

1540
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,120
There you go.

1541
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,120
Yes.

1542
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,120
He's got, he's got a dicky.

1543
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,120
It's what big bird wears when he dresses up.

1544
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,120
That's right.

1545
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,120
Yeah.

1546
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,080
That's as, as dressed up as cartoon characters and puppets are typically required to get.

1547
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,080
It's so great.

1548
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,080
I, that's another thing I'd love to know who the first like Yogi bear.

1549
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,320
It was just wearing a tie.

1550
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:09,760
Like he's wearing a hat too, but like, whoa, the idea that a cartoon character is naked

1551
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,600
except for just a little bit of some decoration around their neck is so funny.

1552
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,600
Yeah.

1553
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,600
Yeah.

1554
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,560
Cause he was the first who pioneered it.

1555
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,160
Maybe that was Buck Owens.

1556
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,640
Did Buck Owens was he naked on stage except for a tie or a dicky?

1557
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,640
I don't know.

1558
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,040
A lot of these honky tonk type musicians.

1559
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:32,840
They were like red hot chili peppers and in the old days, just penis out.

1560
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,080
They didn't even bother to bother them.

1561
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,240
Didn't bother them.

1562
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,960
Different time.

1563
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,400
Or you were, or you did, you could have like a raccoon like blocking your, if you could

1564
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,360
get a, if you could get a hide to perfectly hide.

1565
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,360
Yeah.

1566
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,360
Your junk.

1567
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,960
Uh, Henry's the one who has various creatures popping out of his hat.

1568
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,960
Yes.

1569
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,400
The vacation one, it's a skunk and this one, it's a raccoon cause he's wearing on top of

1570
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,400
it.

1571
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,400
It's a hat on a hat.

1572
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,400
We have a little hat on a hat.

1573
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,400
Yeah.

1574
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:06,360
It's the first thing in the wind comedy possible, but it's happening here and it's great.

1575
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:10,880
It's a top hat with a, uh, the Davy Crockett raccoon hat on top of it.

1576
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:16,360
But then face comes out of it and it is a real raccoon who harmonizes with him.

1577
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,360
Sammy Sammy.

1578
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,360
Sammy is the raccoon.

1579
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,360
Yeah.

1580
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,080
Kudos to Sammy.

1581
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:26,240
I think Henry is not drunk or just a little buzzed.

1582
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,240
Henry seems pretty comfortable.

1583
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,240
Yeah.

1584
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,240
Yeah.

1585
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,520
Um, so, but Henry's a seemingly a nice bear.

1586
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,920
He's not, he seems nice, which is good.

1587
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,920
Does his job.

1588
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,160
Well, he doesn't mess anything up.

1589
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,360
I put his professionalism very high.

1590
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,800
Well, he gets, you know, he gets yelled at, I think once like Henry helped me out here.

1591
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,840
Um, but yeah, basically he's, he's on point.

1592
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:46,840
Yeah.

1593
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,960
Uh, and there's a couple of him.

1594
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,760
That's one thing I like is that he pops up on the right side of the stage and the left

1595
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:55,280
side of the stage, like he's running all around, you know, like the host of the Oscars might

1596
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,280
sometimes they come out of the wings and I'm up in the audience.

1597
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,280
That's fun.

1598
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,280
Uh, Henry's, Henry's all over.

1599
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,560
I think you feel welcome.

1600
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,640
Um, one thing I like about this show is the way the is figuring out the mechanics of it.

1601
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:13,680
It's got kind of the cleverness of the carousel of progress where those side stages have to

1602
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,440
rotate to allow more acts to come out.

1603
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,280
Like, I'm right about this, right?

1604
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,840
That like curtains close, Henry might do an introduction curtains close.

1605
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:29,840
And then that entire area has to swivel so that another character can show up.

1606
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,240
Trixie shows up there, I believe in the same spot thing.

1607
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,040
And then Henry comes back at the end.

1608
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:39,320
Like, cause if you'll notice they all, a lot of them come back for the ending number, but

1609
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,800
Trixie does not.

1610
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,920
Oh, because Trixie spot is taken.

1611
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,920
Trixie is, I think so.

1612
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:45,920
There's only one Trixie robot.

1613
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:51,120
Yeah, there's only one, but like the sunbonnets come up and three like cut out rudely.

1614
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,120
Right.

1615
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,120
Yeah.

1616
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,600
They should make a new rope.

1617
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,280
I mean, they should, they should honestly been adding like three bears per year since

1618
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,280
this opened.

1619
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,080
So there were even on the sides and stuff like there should have been so many more bears

1620
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,320
by now, but they're never going to do it.

1621
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,320
Obviously.

1622
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,440
Well, in different, you know, they were starting to do, we had our Christmas version that they

1623
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,560
did a Christmas overlay and they did a summer vacation overlay and then it stops.

1624
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,840
They didn't do like, I'm trying to think, cause if these stop happening in the nineties,

1625
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,840
what did we miss out on?

1626
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,800
They didn't do a Gulf War benefits.

1627
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,200
They didn't do a like, let's get our troops home safe.

1628
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,200
Yeah.

1629
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,240
They didn't do like a warped tour.

1630
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,720
They didn't do a warp tour.

1631
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,720
Country bears alive aid.

1632
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,720
Yeah.

1633
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,720
Yeah.

1634
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:40,320
Bear, bear, gelled off, bear, gelled off, doing I what's the boom town rat song Mondays?

1635
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,320
I don't like Mondays.

1636
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,320
Is that what it's called?

1637
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,560
I don't like Mondays.

1638
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,560
Tell me what it's a Bob Gould song.

1639
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:52,080
Phil, Phil crawlins traveled to both.

1640
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,080
There were two.

1641
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,080
Oh, the Concord.

1642
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,080
Yeah.

1643
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,080
Yeah.

1644
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,160
I don't know how you, the corn on the Cobb cord.

1645
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:03,840
He took the corn on the Cobb cord so that he could be at the Orlando and the LA ones.

1646
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,120
But nobody knew how he did it, but he made it.

1647
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:12,520
What a funny show to do like up on both coasts all the time and then go back and forth with

1648
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,480
like live feeds to each coast.

1649
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,840
Oh yeah.

1650
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,680
And it's real and the camera, they have to be synced up.

1651
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,960
This is difficult because this whole hours of operation, they have to open the park early.

1652
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:23,960
Yes.

1653
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,400
It always has to be open at the same time.

1654
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:29,040
Or I guess you could do it where it's like when it's not open, it's just like the, it's

1655
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,040
not the live feed.

1656
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,560
They have just like a placeholder video.

1657
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,840
But you know, it's tough to sync them up, which is why it like, like to have a duet

1658
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:46,560
happen from across the world, which is why David Berry and Mick, oh shoot.

1659
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,960
What is a Mick Jagger?

1660
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:48,960
What's a Mick Jag Bear?

1661
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,120
When in doubt, just make it bear.

1662
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:58,040
David Berry and Mick Jag Bear, when they did their, is dance, does the songs have to change?

1663
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,600
Can it still be dancing in the streets?

1664
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,600
Oh yeah.

1665
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,280
Well, they know they don't have bare versions of these songs.

1666
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:08,400
They're just doing like real songs or songs that were written for the show.

1667
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,160
So yeah, I guess it could just be dancing the streets.

1668
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,160
Yeah.

1669
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,080
Well, that's why they pre-taped it is what I'm saying.

1670
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,080
Right.

1671
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,080
David Berry and clawing.

1672
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,800
Oh wait, David, no, David Berry and Mick Jagger did dancing in the trees.

1673
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,800
Okay.

1674
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,800
Okay.

1675
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,800
Of course.

1676
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,760
Yeah, of course.

1677
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,640
Country bear alive, folks.

1678
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:33,160
Did Josh tomorrow announce this at the show, the thing this morning that we're recording?

1679
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,640
Totally interactive, completely retro show.

1680
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,520
We think it'll blow audiences.

1681
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,880
Hey, do you remember Liza?

1682
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,880
Their chairs.

1683
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,880
We are.

1684
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:48,440
So yes, we are rebuilding the country bear Jamboree and evicting the poo ride so that

1685
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,600
we can do country bear live aid.

1686
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,840
So we can make a parody of live aid.

1687
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,840
Yeah.

1688
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:59,040
Unfortunately, in a couple of years that will get down much like the luxury hotel was downgraded.

1689
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:04,440
The live aid bear version will get downgraded to a very small lawn.

1690
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,480
Oh, we can dream.

1691
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:14,560
Well, yeah, they look, they should have kept them going, you know, they'll show about Y2K

1692
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,560
paranoia, paranoia.

1693
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,560
Yeah.

1694
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,920
But we missed out on so much.

1695
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,920
I know.

1696
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,920
Yeah.

1697
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:21,920
No growl cello.

1698
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,920
Oh yeah.

1699
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,640
That'd be the way to do it.

1700
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,040
Like you do it, all right, the theater's gone, but now you do it open air.

1701
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,440
You do put them on a lawn.

1702
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,440
Oh yeah.

1703
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,440
It doesn't rain that much here.

1704
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,960
We can do it Disneyland easy.

1705
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,920
The weather's pretty consistent much of the year.

1706
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,920
Yeah.

1707
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:37,920
Yeah.

1708
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,920
Yeah.

1709
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,920
So it's a multi-stage outdoor festival.

1710
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,960
Put the stage over at the end like that's by the exit of splash mountain.

1711
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,520
That's a dead end there demolish the poo gift shop.

1712
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,520
Pretty much.

1713
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,520
Just put a big stage there.

1714
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,520
Yeah.

1715
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,520
Yeah.

1716
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,520
Yeah.

1717
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,240
And it's a shame to you have to stay for three full days to see.

1718
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,240
He used to live there.

1719
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,240
Yeah.

1720
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,360
For three days because you got to keep the money there.

1721
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,360
That's what Walt was was worried about.

1722
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,360
Yes.

1723
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,960
Bear cello would growl cello would is that what you said?

1724
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:03,960
That's right.

1725
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,960
Yeah.

1726
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,560
Growl cello would finally achieve Walt's ultimate dream.

1727
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,000
Walt would have tried to get into like the concert venue.

1728
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,600
Like he would have been like, we should have a Disney three day event.

1729
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,960
Like he would have kind of come up with something like that.

1730
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,960
I assume.

1731
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:15,960
Yeah.

1732
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,960
Because he liked always liked it.

1733
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,960
Ladies and gentlemen, Annette Funicello.

1734
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:18,960
This is in 1979.

1735
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:29,040
I think it was like 89.

1736
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,160
He submitted a big list of artists and just like, no, no body.

1737
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,160
No, no offensive.

1738
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,160
No.

1739
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,160
When was French?

1740
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,160
No.

1741
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,160
Whatever weird reason he has.

1742
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:47,680
My Marine Corps band, John Philip Sousa, John Philip Sousa, that band of imagineers who

1743
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,200
all wear fire hats.

1744
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,280
They're allowed to play the fire, the fireman jazz band.

1745
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,280
Yeah.

1746
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,320
My theory that like like celebrities are just going to start coming back from the dead once

1747
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,600
the technology is there.

1748
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,200
Like Walt will be one of the first, I think to come back and then this will happen.

1749
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,440
He'll start, then he'll start bringing back who we're talking about from the dead.

1750
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,440
Yeah.

1751
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,440
So Annette will come back.

1752
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,440
For example, Shet will come back.

1753
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,440
Yeah.

1754
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,920
He fires the full Hollywood records slate.

1755
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:16,960
He fires anyone's song and it's all just everyone is back.

1756
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,440
I only want like, I only want neatly dressed girls singing about popcorn.

1757
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,120
And I, oh, who are these Avengers?

1758
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,560
Can we get Annette in the Avengers?

1759
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:35,080
Well, he sees the money that's coming in and he's like, fine, but can we put some of them

1760
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:38,560
in like some, uh, some red checkered dresses?

1761
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,480
Why not the women of the Avengers wear red checkered dresses?

1762
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,120
They don't play the ukulele.

1763
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,560
What's the tie clip situation with these Avengers?

1764
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,240
Tell you what, uh, I like them all.

1765
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,680
Keep the, keep the movies the way they are.

1766
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,600
But this Robert Downey, I don't care for him, sordid past.

1767
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:01,400
Can we digitally comp Harvey Corman's face on this, on the iron man's body?

1768
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,120
All right, get to it.

1769
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,440
Well, it's maybe a problem.

1770
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,680
I don't want to hear it.

1771
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,680
Good luck.

1772
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,680
I'm going skiing.

1773
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:14,600
Uh, characters, liver lips, McGrell, sorry about liver lips, McGrell.

1774
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,600
Yeah.

1775
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,840
He's got a funny outfit on a lot of, yeah, there's a lot of funny outfit.

1776
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,440
Like what you were saying earlier with like stuff barely hanging onto the bears being

1777
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,600
held up by like one overall strap or one suspender strap.

1778
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,000
He's got just the one strap.

1779
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,880
Look, I'm looking at a drawing of him.

1780
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:36,520
So now I don't know how much the actual, the reality reflects it, but I bet it does a lot.

1781
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,680
He's kind of, he's got hair cover in his eyes.

1782
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:43,000
This is probably Walt's jab at rock stars and how foolish they look.

1783
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Well, right.

1784
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,360
And in the, in the, in the summer show, he is rock and roll star.

1785
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,360
He's Elvis.

1786
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,200
So this is the character Elvis essentially.

1787
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,200
Basically.

1788
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:57,360
So yeah, that is sort of, you know, um, these old men being like, this is what rock stars

1789
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,260
are like these awful.

1790
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,320
They don't know how to dress themselves.

1791
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,320
Yeah.

1792
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:09,640
There are haircuts or lack thereof, uh, are really a, uh, a vision issue.

1793
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,520
Um, I liable to fall off the stage.

1794
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,520
Yeah.

1795
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,440
I don't know what Mark Davis thought of the Beatles or anything.

1796
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,440
I don't know.

1797
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:21,440
Or the Mark Davis might've done those, uh, um, those vultures in the jungle crews who

1798
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,440
look like the Beatles.

1799
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,360
So he might've been, maybe I'm, I'm, that's a guess.

1800
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,360
It's similar looking.

1801
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,360
Oh, right.

1802
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,360
Right.

1803
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,760
But that's kind of, you know, that was one of their only comments on rock and roll at

1804
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,760
the time.

1805
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,500
And, uh, it was similar.

1806
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,720
It was just, they got hair covering their eyes.

1807
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:41,720
I guess, you know, the monkey's uncle is a rock and roll song technically by Disney standards.

1808
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:42,720
Yeah.

1809
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,880
The Annette beach boys do it monkeys uncle.

1810
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,520
So there was a little bit of it, you know, that again, I've talked about beach, but I've,

1811
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,880
I be true to your school is not in the rotation so much monkeys.

1812
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,880
Uncle I would say is not in the rotate.

1813
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,880
I do not.

1814
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,880
I can't say I recreationally listened to monkeys uncle.

1815
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,400
What about let's get together from the parent trap?

1816
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,440
Uh, no, well, you got no beach boys on that.

1817
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,480
So no beach boys specifically.

1818
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,480
Oh, beach boys.

1819
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,800
You guys blast and let's get together in the car a lot.

1820
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,800
Haley mills.

1821
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,240
Uh, wedding dance candidate.

1822
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,240
Yeah.

1823
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,440
I listened to that Sherman Brothers city.

1824
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:24,800
So it's not uncommon that like pineapple princess is playing or something from that album, from

1825
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,800
their greatest hits.

1826
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,840
Who did, uh, um, who did the music for this?

1827
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,840
It's not Sherman Brothers and a lot of the covers.

1828
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,360
It's a George Brun, George Brown, bronze, excuse me.

1829
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,640
Did a lot of the animated, um, and exitensio.

1830
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,440
He wrote the lyrics.

1831
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:44,960
I have, um, hold on, I have in the, in the, there's so many notes here.

1832
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,800
I have like the, I have the credits for songs for the show.

1833
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,400
Um, so yeah.

1834
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,680
Uh, like, like for instance, the, uh, the big band serenade, which is the big thing

1835
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,840
where they introduced the five bear rugs who we haven't talked, we've talked a little bit

1836
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:02,600
about, but that one's exitensio and George runs.

1837
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,640
Um, they wrote that, that song.

1838
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,640
Okay.

1839
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,880
Uh, uh, that where they all like was Zip and Zed and that's that.

1840
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:10,880
Yeah.

1841
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:11,880
Yeah.

1842
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:18,760
It's kind of one of the grander, I mean, it's always exciting when the, you know, you got

1843
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,160
your side acts, right?

1844
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:23,920
You got your little stages and that's where a lot of the characters appear solo.

1845
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,760
They get little solo spotlight numbers, but the most exciting moment in any of the shows

1846
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:33,480
is when the big stage opens up and the full band appears.

1847
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,480
Yeah.

1848
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:40,040
And the way it all rolls up is one big, you know, that's like, that's some real concert

1849
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,040
theatrics.

1850
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,120
That, yeah, the, the, the big moments in the concert.

1851
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,880
And I'm trying to think of like other big concert moments in history.

1852
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,720
Like, like Teddy bear, I think in this one is a bit, is like the big, it's the, what

1853
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,520
you're saying, the big rollout at the start.

1854
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,120
And then Teddy bear is the other one.

1855
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,320
I think where you go like, wow, look at their bears.

1856
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,840
She's coming from the ceiling.

1857
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,840
This place is exploding with bears.

1858
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:01,840
It's exploding with bears.

1859
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,320
They pop up under my seat and I might go to the restroom.

1860
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,320
Yeah.

1861
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,040
And they might burst out of the toilet.

1862
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,040
Yeah.

1863
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,600
But those are, yeah, huge, huge moments in this concert.

1864
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:18,760
But yeah, the five, the bears playing all together, which you like, you never get, although

1865
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,400
this is just a side note, I'm thinking like you never get like no bear wears out their

1866
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,040
welcome also.

1867
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,920
You would think if you were like, well, let's just do a bear show and it is like six bears

1868
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:28,920
and it's 15 minutes.

1869
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,920
Yeah.

1870
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,360
And that's like, you can have six bears or whatever, but they're in those constant, you're

1871
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,880
getting assaulted by bears constantly during the show in a good way.

1872
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,880
I'm literally lucky.

1873
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,320
No, in a good way.

1874
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,320
Yeah.

1875
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,040
The bears maintain their distance.

1876
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,040
Yeah.

1877
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,040
Stay on the stage.

1878
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,040
Right.

1879
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,600
So they were, they are well trained in that regard.

1880
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,240
You don't get attacked by these bears.

1881
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,960
No, these are not bears that are going to maul you.

1882
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:55,120
I don't get a bad vibe from any of the bears as far as like violence.

1883
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,840
I mean, some of them are singing about violence, but sure.

1884
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,040
Well, it's not in, you know, and the ones that the ones that booze are only hurting

1885
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,040
themselves.

1886
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,920
That's true.

1887
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:06,920
So yeah, yeah.

1888
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:07,920
The five.

1889
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:13,400
Do you think anybody would like, you know, like if I were to take my son in a couple

1890
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:18,080
years and his reality is blurred, he knows where bears are and we're going to see a bear

1891
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,360
show.

1892
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:24,960
Is it possible that he thinks, is he scared to go to this because the bears might at any

1893
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:30,400
point drop the instruments, see a delicious kid sitting in the front row.

1894
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,440
I dive.

1895
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,800
If you're in the front row, I think with a lot of this for me, at least when I was a

1896
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,600
kid, proximity is a big deal.

1897
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,360
So if you're in the front row, I mean, there's still pretty, there's still pretty big space

1898
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,440
between the front row and the stage.

1899
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,600
I assume that's for general admission in the front there.

1900
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,320
There's a pit maybe if they have like too many people in there.

1901
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,680
Get in the pit, girls to the front.

1902
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,680
Yeah.

1903
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:56,560
There's a mosh pit going on at the bear show, but I've never seen that.

1904
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,520
But I would assume you have proximity wise.

1905
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:02,600
There's a very good chance that your son will yes, think the bears are going to eat him.

1906
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,600
Yeah.

1907
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,120
At the very least take him and like put him up on stage like the poor Oscar.

1908
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,120
Oh yeah.

1909
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,120
Oh yes.

1910
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,120
He has to live with them.

1911
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,120
Now I have to live with them.

1912
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,120
Yeah.

1913
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,160
Cause that kid isn't even having any fun on stage.

1914
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,640
He looks a little shy.

1915
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:18,640
He's there with his dad.

1916
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:23,480
It looks like mom couldn't take him that day or something.

1917
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:29,480
He's kind of the, he's kind of in the, the almost famous scenario.

1918
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,840
He's along with the band.

1919
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,840
Yeah, yeah.

1920
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:38,840
In the crew, but not, you know, so the, the five bear rugs are still water.

1921
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,280
He's the, he's the writer, Henry, I think.

1922
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,280
I don't remember the name.

1923
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:47,800
He's Patrick Fuget and the sun bonnet trio, I guess is the, is Penny Lane.

1924
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,760
And what are their names?

1925
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,640
Oh, this is a sun bonnet trio.

1926
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,640
No, no, no.

1927
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,160
The names of the, of the, no, this is a tangent.

1928
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,400
The names of the almost famous.

1929
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1930
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,640
Am I not coming up?

1931
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,640
I can't.

1932
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,640
I haven't seen the movie in forever.

1933
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,640
Yeah.

1934
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,680
Um, but that's another, you know, obviously they made a film about the country bears,

1935
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,880
but that's a movie I might rather see.

1936
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,400
There's just something with the almost famous sheen.

1937
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,400
Right.

1938
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,560
Like dramatic tour.

1939
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,880
Right.

1940
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:22,280
You know, full of romantic woes and, and ending up with them being on the cover of rolling

1941
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:27,560
stone and that's growling stone.

1942
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:32,520
I would love to see the bear version of Philip Seymour Hoffman's, uh, cause he played a real

1943
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,520
life guy.

1944
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,520
He's playing the guy from cream magazine.

1945
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,520
Lester bang.

1946
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,520
Yeah.

1947
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,520
He's playing Lester bang.

1948
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,520
Lester bears.

1949
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,520
Lester bears.

1950
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,520
Lester bears.

1951
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,520
Yeah.

1952
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:47,920
Uh, jamboree music is dead, man.

1953
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:53,320
Don't the band aids, the band aids is what I was.

1954
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,360
Right, right, right, right.

1955
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,360
Um, yeah.

1956
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:59,040
Um, famous groupie Pamela DeBeers.

1957
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,480
It's getting real obscure.

1958
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,760
It's getting really obscure.

1959
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,320
Pretty dark too.

1960
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:12,800
Uh, um, anyway, uh, oh yeah, you know, the country beers are on the cover of, uh, climb

1961
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,080
magazine.

1962
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,720
That's something that I saw in the lobby in Japan.

1963
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,720
Okay.

1964
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:22,880
That's a hard pun to get when it's time magazines, the style of time magazine, but it's climb

1965
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,880
magazine.

1966
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,880
Okay.

1967
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,360
That's pretty good.

1968
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,360
Current bear issues.

1969
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,960
That's where they go.

1970
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,960
That's good.

1971
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,800
Uh, do you want the names of the five bear rugs?

1972
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,800
Yeah, please.

1973
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:39,480
Zeke who plays the banjo, uh, the fiddle, uh, he's got the little bowler hat on.

1974
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:44,280
He's also playing like the dish pan basically with his feet or wait, no, excuse me.

1975
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,280
Zeke is playing the banjo.

1976
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,280
Zed is playing the fiddle.

1977
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,280
I'm already confused.

1978
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:51,440
Uh, uh, Ted plays the corn jug.

1979
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:55,640
Fred plays the mouth harp and then Tennessee bear is the one that has the base with one

1980
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,640
string.

1981
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:00,320
Um, and a lot, I think all of them are hammered.

1982
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,760
I think they're all drunk.

1983
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,680
These are the, but that's the, you know, it's what, uh, the, you know, Carson and the tonight

1984
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,680
show band.

1985
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:11,000
It's always that, uh, these guys are smoking dubs in the parking lot.

1986
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,720
This is the, this is what you want out of your 10 year.

1987
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:14,720
Yeah, sure.

1988
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:15,720
Yeah.

1989
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,720
I'm getting a little loose.

1990
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,720
Yeah.

1991
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,840
Well, so they're a unit.

1992
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:23,120
And so if one's a little further gone, the others can carry this.

1993
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,960
So many other acts or solo acts except the sunbonnets.

1994
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:27,960
Yeah.

1995
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:33,240
And, and Henry is the one who introduces all of them basically during this song.

1996
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,240
Yeah.

1997
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,240
Yeah.

1998
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,240
They all, they each get called out.

1999
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:42,360
Um, if we know now that it takes 30, at least 36 cans of beer to get a beard, there's five

2000
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:46,320
of them and that's the rider for the country bear show.

2001
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,000
The five bear rugs need 180 cans of beer.

2002
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Yeah.

2003
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
But shine can be a lot stronger.

2004
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,240
You know, moonshine can be like paint thinner, you know, like rocket fuel.

2005
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,240
Yeah.

2006
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,600
They just, so they just leave a big trash can of paint thinner out.

2007
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,440
All of the bear rugs dip their heads in.

2008
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:08,320
If you smell really hard, especially if you're in the front row, you can, yeah, yeah.

2009
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,840
It smells like paint thinner stink.

2010
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:10,840
It smells like cleaner.

2011
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,480
It's that's what bleachers on there.

2012
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,760
So there's no pupils in their eyes.

2013
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:21,760
A Mountain Dew Mountain Dew originally a mixer for paint for not paint thinner for moonshine

2014
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,800
to make moonshine more palatable.

2015
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,800
That's what I always heard.

2016
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,400
At least in the early days people would mix it.

2017
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,400
Really?

2018
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,400
That's what it's called Mountain Dew?

2019
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,400
Like a mountain.

2020
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,400
Yeah.

2021
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,360
Like the, like the mountain, like it was, it was a more like country fried product and

2022
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:40,320
not as much like for an outdated idea of what skateboarders are.

2023
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,320
Yeah.

2024
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,840
No, that was a big pivot when it became like the extreme drink, I think.

2025
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,080
Are we really, are we supposed to buy that it is?

2026
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:50,200
Cause when you Google it now, it's just MTN.

2027
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,600
This is a branding that no one on the planet uses.

2028
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,600
MTN.

2029
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,120
Yeah, they just took out some of the, I mean, it's like, it's like a license plate version

2030
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:01,720
of the, it's like Flickr or like, you know, when they, they just take out the valves, you

2031
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:05,600
know, wait, it's MTN and then no D E W.

2032
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:10,240
Look at a bottle when you, when you leave here, if you're getting your traditional post

2033
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:15,840
show Mountain Dew, 7-Eleven, you'll see on the bottle, it's just MTN.

2034
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,840
I get it.

2035
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:17,840
It's been this way for a long time.

2036
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,840
I just get a super golf.

2037
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:19,840
I go to the, get at the 7-Eleven.

2038
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,000
I was going to say, Galeen through the takeout window or the drive-through window at Taco

2039
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,960
Bell and like, Hey, can I see the Baja blast pump?

2040
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,960
Can I see that?

2041
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,920
Can I see the jug of like syrup?

2042
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,280
Does it say it on that?

2043
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,640
Like, yeah, what is the jug?

2044
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,800
What does the canister say?

2045
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,800
Yeah.

2046
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:42,160
Um, I was just about to bring up and I really, really shouldn't cause we're still behind

2047
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,160
probably.

2048
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:46,560
I would say we're behind, but the, I still like the character, then that character person,

2049
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,560
popcorn Sutton.

2050
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,560
Have I ever talked about him before?

2051
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,920
You've not talked about popcorn Sutton.

2052
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:54,400
Popcorn Sutton was a bootlagger of moonshine in the old days.

2053
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,440
And he's, I believe somebody's going to be mad.

2054
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,520
I'm going to be, get this a little bit wrong.

2055
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:05,120
He was a part of like, what listener is going to hold your feet to the fire about moonshine

2056
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,120
or popcorn Sutton.

2057
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,400
Well, he would, he would, he would have a lot of listeners in the holler and they're

2058
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,600
going to come for Mike.

2059
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,040
Jason knows I've talked about popcorn Sutton before.

2060
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:15,840
They have to hand crank their podcast machines to, uh, for two straight hours to hear our

2061
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,680
crazy rigged up cars that they had to outrun the feds in.

2062
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:20,680
Yeah.

2063
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:25,240
But he used to challenge other like bootleggers to races in a circle, which is how NASCAR started.

2064
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,240
Yes.

2065
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:29,920
Cause they all had crazy souped up cars to outrun the police.

2066
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,840
During bootleg, uh, yeah.

2067
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:33,840
Bootleg times.

2068
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,920
Did you learn this in his autobiography?

2069
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:42,640
Me and my liquor spelled also incorrectly like current mountain do L I K K E R.

2070
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,640
Uh, I did not.

2071
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:44,640
I have, I learned it.

2072
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:47,080
It was like during college, I was visiting somebody.

2073
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:52,440
We were watching like, like CMT like 2 PM in the afternoon.

2074
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:57,680
It was like popcorn Sutton is one of the popcorn.

2075
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,240
That would have stopped me in my trucks.

2076
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,760
I would put anything aside.

2077
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,080
I'd say to watch a biography of popcorn.

2078
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,320
I don't know anything else about him.

2079
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,320
I just know that.

2080
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,320
Yeah.

2081
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,000
He seems like he died in a very dark way.

2082
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I am sure.

2083
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,240
Look, I don't know anything about him.

2084
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,480
If he's canceled, I mean, he's passed away.

2085
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,480
I know.

2086
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,160
If he's canceled, I'm not saying I celebrate him or anything.

2087
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:21,360
I'm just saying I find it an interesting fact that he was a bootlegger and that's part of

2088
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,640
the Genesis of NASCAR.

2089
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:28,320
Uh, this man, uh, had a foot stone prepared in advance for his grave site.

2090
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,520
He knew what he wanted it to be and had it made years before he died.

2091
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,240
And what it says is popcorn said, fuck you.

2092
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,120
Wait, did you say a foot stone?

2093
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,480
That's the word that's in this Wiki.

2094
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,480
His foot stone.

2095
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,000
I've never heard that term before.

2096
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I've always heard hate stone.

2097
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I've never heard foot stone.

2098
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,520
Interesting foot down here.

2099
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,520
We got foot stones.

2100
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:52,800
I guess that's also, uh, you can get those socks at the sock market at universal city

2101
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:57,520
walk popcorn says, fuck you.

2102
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:02,360
I had a college professor who worked on a documentary about a similar character named

2103
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,120
Jessica white.

2104
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:08,600
Um, and then another documentary came out about him and his family called the wild,

2105
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,840
wonderful whites of West Virginia.

2106
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,920
But he was like, um, that phrase.

2107
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,000
Sure.

2108
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:21,160
He was a maniac like bootlegger and, uh, he was really good at like dancing.

2109
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:26,040
Like it was like a country kind of like tap dancing, uh, sort of thing.

2110
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:33,000
But then sometimes if he got real liquored up, Elvis would come out and a different person

2111
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,700
like, Oh, it was Jesse.

2112
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:35,700
Sometimes it'd be Jesse.

2113
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:39,880
And sometimes he'd be Jessica and you don't want to mess with Jessica.

2114
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:40,880
Hmm.

2115
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:45,320
Anyway, since we're just because we're talking about all these characters.

2116
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:46,320
Yeah.

2117
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:51,200
Um, who's the, who's the country bear most likely to have such a profane epitaph who's

2118
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,200
got the most.

2119
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,200
Oh, that's a good question.

2120
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,520
Um, let's see.

2121
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,880
Uh, not Henry.

2122
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,960
Wendell's got like a mouth on him.

2123
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,760
That's what I was going to, that's my first inclination is Wendell.

2124
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,920
Wendell seems like he's like sassy.

2125
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,720
Wendell said fuck you.

2126
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,080
Wendell says Wendell says fuck you.

2127
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,520
Um, Gomer seems very nice and quiet.

2128
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:14,840
He's a piano player who doesn't really talk, but what if he's just quietly seething?

2129
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:18,640
Uh, like he has a lot of anger that we don't know about.

2130
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,440
And then we get a Gomer said, fuck you.

2131
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:24,440
There's a weird line in the original version that they've cut.

2132
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,720
I just got to do, listen to the regular, the original version.

2133
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:28,720
I don't think so.

2134
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,720
Or well, maybe.

2135
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:34,360
Um, cause, uh, I forget exactly which pair Jason, I think knows you what, listen to this

2136
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:37,640
where they go, yeah, they're talking about Gomer and they're like, yeah, he's a regular

2137
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,640
liberace.

2138
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,880
Whoa, no, I didn't hear this.

2139
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,680
And then the other, one of the other bears goes, yeah.

2140
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,320
And he plays good too.

2141
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:48,560
Which I guess, I, that's what I was trying to figure out.

2142
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,880
Is it, is it a gay Joe?

2143
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,360
Is it, they're saying he's gay?

2144
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:56,040
I've never, I don't, but I know I'm telling clear cause there's also like, it's also unclear

2145
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,640
cause like later on there, there's sometimes they do that thing where it's like not really

2146
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:00,640
a joke.

2147
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,200
That's like phrase like a joke where they're like, we wrote these loud.

2148
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:07,440
One of the songs is like, we wrote these lousy lyrics and we also wrote the words.

2149
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:11,240
And it's like, that's not really a joke, but it's like kind of a joke.

2150
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,240
Do you know what I mean?

2151
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:21,960
It could just be that they're dumb or Gomer is a pioneering gay piano, Liberace and, uh,

2152
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,440
and Elton John.

2153
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,800
That's possible too.

2154
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,240
That's a possible reading of it.

2155
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,240
Yeah.

2156
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:30,560
But they have cut that from the show that is cut from the modern version of the show.

2157
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:35,600
Well they also, you can hear on the album track, Henry says, you know, just refrain

2158
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,800
from hybrid date and something, something, and we'll all enjoy the show.

2159
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:45,760
Cause we got a lot to give, which is a reference to Pepsi's slogan.

2160
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,240
You've got a lot to live.

2161
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:52,480
Pepsi's got a lot to give, which Pepsi sponsored this attraction for awhile.

2162
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:56,040
So it's possible that that line and then this Liberace line was just cut.

2163
01:33:56,040 --> 01:34:00,020
We're just cut because no one knew what the reference was anymore.

2164
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:04,240
Not necessarily because it's pretty obscure Pepsi tagline.

2165
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:09,320
People know who Liberace is, but when you say the name weird, it's tougher to understand,

2166
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,320
which I like.

2167
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,320
It's funny to say Liberace like Liberace.

2168
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:13,320
Sure.

2169
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,320
Yeah.

2170
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:19,480
So, um, should we talk about the, the big thing that they cut the song that they cut?

2171
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,480
Oh, which one?

2172
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:24,280
Uh, the but my mama don't whoop little Beaufort.

2173
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,280
That's still in the show.

2174
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:27,280
Yeah.

2175
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,880
That was a good fractured folk song.

2176
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:29,880
Oh yeah.

2177
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,920
Mama don't whoop little Beaufort is still in the show.

2178
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:32,920
Oh my God.

2179
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:33,920
Yeah.

2180
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:34,920
I saw that a couple of weeks ago.

2181
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:35,920
Yeah.

2182
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:36,920
Oh wow.

2183
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:40,200
Fractured folk song where Henry and Wendell duet on that and he, Wendell gives him shit

2184
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,200
for coming in late.

2185
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:45,240
Jim Hill has talked about how this is probably, this will get caught.

2186
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:46,240
This is on the chopping block.

2187
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:48,440
Uh, it's a very brief song.

2188
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:49,440
Yes.

2189
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,300
And it is a very dark.

2190
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:54,320
It's a joke song, but it's a very dark song.

2191
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,320
Yeah.

2192
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:58,560
Um, which is just mama don't whoop little Beaufort.

2193
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,920
Mama don't hit something on his head.

2194
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,360
Mama don't whoop little Beaufort.

2195
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,400
I think you should shoot him instead.

2196
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:05,400
Yeah.

2197
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:09,960
But that sort of shit, I feel like still flies in country music, country music still insanely

2198
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:10,960
popular.

2199
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:14,600
Well, I don't, is there a Kobe key song about shooting a child?

2200
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,280
Does he talk about shooting someone in the Applebee's like song?

2201
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,280
I don't know.

2202
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,400
Oh, what's the guy's name?

2203
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,080
What's that song I like about Applebee's on a date night?

2204
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,080
Yeah.

2205
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,080
We both discovered this.

2206
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,080
Scott, you know this song?

2207
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,080
I don't know.

2208
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,080
By this point, we discovered it late because it was in the commercial.

2209
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:32,840
It was a song and then it became a Tik Tok dance sensation.

2210
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:38,320
And then Applebee's used it in a commercial and the guy was, and it's about like taking

2211
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:42,240
your lady to Applebee's on date night and getting her the bourbon street steak and an

2212
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,240
Oreo shake.

2213
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:48,640
If you don't hate this with all your being, I think I'm totally misjudged doing everything.

2214
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:52,320
And they heightened it recently because there's a remix with Kesha doing a verse on it too.

2215
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,880
It's called fancy like fancy like the Applebee's commercial.

2216
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,480
You know, it's hard for me to hate Toby Keith because I don't come across.

2217
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:00,960
It's not on my desk a lot.

2218
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,240
You know, there's another guy.

2219
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,240
This is another guy.

2220
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:04,240
Oh, who is this?

2221
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,240
This is Walker Hayes.

2222
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,240
Okay.

2223
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:11,240
Uh, let's and stay with the Oreo shake and some whipped cream on the top too.

2224
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,240
Two straws, one shackle.

2225
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:13,240
I got to get to the chorus first.

2226
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,240
I don't know what he's saying enough to get the gist.

2227
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,240
Yeah.

2228
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,240
You'll have to listen to the home and private.

2229
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,240
I don't know what he's saying enough to get the gist.

2230
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,240
Yeah.

2231
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,240
You'll have to listen to the home and private.

2232
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:24,240
I don't know what he's saying enough to get the gist.

2233
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:26,040
Yeah, you'll have to listen to the home and private.

2234
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,720
Well, give me some lyrics though.

2235
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:28,720
What are we fancy like?

2236
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:32,120
Ooh, it's not the chorus yet.

2237
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:38,600
You just, yeah, the chorus already played, but that was a natty natural ice, natural

2238
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:42,200
light, natural ice, squeak squeaking in the truck bed.

2239
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:47,960
So that's a natural light in a cyber from cooler squeaking in the truck bed all the

2240
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:48,960
way home.

2241
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,240
Uh, yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night.

2242
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:54,520
Got that bourbon street steak with the Oreo shake.

2243
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:58,120
Uh, I didn't, I would say nothing about this terribly bothers me.

2244
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:01,920
It's look, I think I'd have trouble if I had to hear this music all the time.

2245
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,760
If you know, married to someone who made me listen to this all the time, that could be

2246
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,760
tough.

2247
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,560
But, uh, you know what?

2248
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:13,600
I don't think that I don't think I'm going to run into that song naturally on the street.

2249
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,120
If you see the Applebee's commercial though, you'll know what it is.

2250
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:20,600
It's a lot of these songs, like obviously Toby Keith has some just dog shit politics

2251
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,600
and opinions.

2252
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,640
Um, but I was going to say in terms of violence, there's the, you know, put a boot up your

2253
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:26,640
ass.

2254
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,720
It's the American way, but yeah, Osama bin Laden.

2255
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,440
This is how a lot of people were feeling about Osama bin Laden.

2256
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,440
Yeah.

2257
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:35,920
I mean, obviously I think maybe he, in his mind, he wasn't just saying that about one

2258
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:36,920
person.

2259
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,120
I don't know, but likely not.

2260
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,040
But impetus certainly.

2261
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:45,640
But, uh, but I will say this red solo cup is a good song.

2262
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:49,160
I have to give it up to the guy with terrible opinions and politics.

2263
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:53,200
This is a thing that Mike, uh, every few years a song comes out.

2264
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:59,360
That's just so technically like a hit, a country, red soil cup, chicken fried.

2265
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:03,960
You've ever heard the song chicken fried and this Applebee's is the newest Zach Brown band.

2266
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:04,960
Yeah.

2267
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:05,960
Okay.

2268
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:09,240
Really you end up like, you've got your like country hit of every two years.

2269
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,240
Yeah.

2270
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,240
Yeah.

2271
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:12,240
I weighed into that in the past.

2272
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:19,080
We sat around trying to like reverse engineer, like, like if this truck could talk, like

2273
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:23,160
the truck could talk, like how do you mathematically create one of these?

2274
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,400
Just like you can do with a lifetime Christmas movie.

2275
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,400
Oh yeah.

2276
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,400
How do you line up?

2277
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,400
Yeah.

2278
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,400
It's sort of a mad libs.

2279
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,400
Yeah.

2280
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,400
Name a restaurant, name a type of pants.

2281
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:32,400
Yeah.

2282
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,400
Probably going to be jeans.

2283
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,400
Yeah.

2284
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,400
Blue jeans type fit.

2285
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,400
Yeah.

2286
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,400
Well I've done it.

2287
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:38,400
Yeah.

2288
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,400
I've done it a little bit with Jimmy Buffett.

2289
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:44,880
I've done, I wrote the song, uh, uh, hiding out in a Pelican's beak and the song, my wife

2290
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,820
is a boat.

2291
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:47,820
So those exist.

2292
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:52,200
But I, I haven't, I haven't recorded the country, one of these country versions.

2293
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:56,040
Well don't you think, is your, uh, do you think the country bears have influenced your

2294
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,080
taste to go this way?

2295
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:03,240
Is there any correlation between the slightly country air of Jimmy Buffett and your love

2296
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,280
of the country bears?

2297
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,040
It's a good question.

2298
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,320
I do think yes.

2299
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:12,840
I think actually the answer sincerely is yes on some level because I am very fascinated

2300
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:18,720
with old time like, as we've talked on the show, Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, Roly

2301
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:26,020
Poli like old, like at this point, a hundred year old music, uh, that sounds like it was

2302
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:29,560
recorded in a tiny little can.

2303
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:34,160
And then recently of course, Little Jimmy Dickens, I am fascinated with some of these

2304
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,680
and some of these songs I think are legitimately good.

2305
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:41,240
You say of course the, another throwing around of course, like I know what you're talking

2306
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,760
about was a little Jimmy Dickens.

2307
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:43,760
Little Jimmy Dickens.

2308
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:44,760
Uh, Little Jimmy Dickens is a-

2309
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,760
Oh that helped Jason.

2310
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:46,760
Thank you.

2311
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:47,760
No more questions.

2312
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,760
Little Jimmy Dickens, remember we looked him up.

2313
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,920
He's a small guy.

2314
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:56,640
He only passed away a few years ago, but he was, uh, remember we looked this up.

2315
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:00,680
He had done a sketch like 10 years ago with Brad Paisley at the country music awards where

2316
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:01,680
he played Justin Bieber.

2317
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:02,680
Okay.

2318
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:03,680
Oh, I kind of remember this thing.

2319
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:04,680
He was like a little Justin Bieber.

2320
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,680
Did this come up in America Sings or Reed?

2321
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:07,680
Probably.

2322
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,680
I guess so, yeah.

2323
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:09,680
Bullshit again.

2324
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:10,680
Yeah.

2325
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:16,080
And he has a, uh, take, he has a song called take an old cold tater and wait, which is

2326
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,080
about how-

2327
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,440
The most buffety stuff.

2328
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:19,440
Yeah, yeah.

2329
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:23,240
And he's saying he has a song, uh, and basically the song is just how he was malnourished as

2330
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,640
a child and that's why he's so short.

2331
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:27,480
That's the whole, that's the whole point of the song.

2332
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:31,040
Like his mom didn't feed him very well and that's why he's so short.

2333
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:35,960
Uh, and I don't know, this stuff is all fascinating to me and some of it I think is legit, um,

2334
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:36,960
enjoyable.

2335
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,840
I think some of these songs in the country bears are legit good.

2336
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:40,840
Mm-hmm.

2337
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,840
Mm-hmm.

2338
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,080
Um, we, you know, we can keep character jumping around, but also like let's give some songs

2339
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,080
some do.

2340
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,080
Well, yeah.

2341
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:51,440
In this territory, it seems like I think you like songs, uh, that aren't afraid to be a

2342
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,440
little funny.

2343
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:57,400
They aren't afraid to reference things that other songs would, would be embarrassed to

2344
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:02,240
reference and that I think is what the country bears have where you get a sense of, of, of

2345
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:07,640
a character and a guy's way of life and it might be odd, but it's just the way I am.

2346
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,640
Yes.

2347
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:12,840
I mean, there's, there's, I mean, uh, every song in it is pretty good.

2348
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:17,840
Uh, some of them are like funny and some of them are not really funny.

2349
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:23,800
Like I'm sure the idea like Trixie is singing that song, uh, what tears would be the chaser

2350
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,040
for my wine.

2351
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,040
Yes.

2352
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,480
Um, but that's a good song.

2353
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:30,200
That's like a, just a legit pretty song.

2354
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:31,200
Like pretty.

2355
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:32,200
Yeah.

2356
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,200
I don't know.

2357
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:34,200
Pretty song.

2358
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,080
We do a lot of cute here.

2359
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:40,320
Is the tears in my wine song, tears of the chaser for my wine.

2360
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,320
Pretty.

2361
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:42,320
I think so.

2362
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,320
What would you say?

2363
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:44,320
Pretty little melancholy.

2364
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,320
Yeah, it's Mel.

2365
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:46,320
For sure.

2366
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,320
Melancholy.

2367
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,320
A lot of these are Mel.

2368
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,320
Hart, we did all that we could.

2369
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,320
Yes.

2370
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,320
Teddy bear song.

2371
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:55,280
Uh, a lot of now I really don't know which of these are covers and which of these are

2372
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,240
well, I have a bear original.

2373
01:41:57,240 --> 01:42:01,120
I think this might be, and I'll save some of this for down the road, but there's, I, I

2374
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:08,200
maybe generally like vacation a little more or some tech cause I think I remember the songs

2375
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:11,280
a little more and I know more of those are original.

2376
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:17,560
Uh, maybe I just, just the one I saw more cause I think just switched over permanently.

2377
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:18,560
Well that's good.

2378
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:19,560
Yeah.

2379
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,560
That is more.

2380
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,800
So I mean that is, it is on the road again.

2381
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:22,800
It has more.

2382
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:23,800
Oh wait, actually there are a lot of covers.

2383
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:24,800
Yeah, you're right.

2384
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,560
There are some covers in that one too.

2385
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:30,520
Um, but this one, yeah, I like, uh, let's see here.

2386
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,960
I have a little list of all the songs.

2387
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:39,440
Um, by the way, just, I was like, is there, are there any Google results if I put in Jimmy

2388
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,880
Buffett and country bear jamboree?

2389
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:46,960
And there's only a comment that references that this, what Jimmy posted reminded them

2390
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,480
of the country bear jamboree.

2391
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:53,520
Does he post a photo of him holding a giant fish fish like as tall as he is.

2392
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:59,920
Uh, and his caption was, um, posted, I believe the month that we saw him live at the Hollywood

2393
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:00,920
bull.

2394
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:06,800
Uh, but I got to stop wishing, got to go fishing, which is very much like the great outdoors

2395
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,800
song.

2396
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:12,840
It's like almost, almost the same as a, I think, I think nobody would bat an eyelash

2397
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:15,920
if Jimmy Buffett started putting country bear songs in the set.

2398
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,440
No, no, it makes complete sense.

2399
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,880
I think I've told this story.

2400
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:24,200
I like no, nothing is almost too absurd for Jimmy Buffett songs.

2401
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:29,560
Like it's on, I wrote this, I literally, I did a thing for a screen junkies at the time,

2402
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:33,680
Jason and I went to go cover the opening of Margaritaville and I wrote a song called hiding

2403
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:37,920
out in a Pelicans beak about a guy who cheats on his wife and hides out in a Pelicans beak

2404
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,120
until she's not mad anymore.

2405
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:44,440
And I went in there like playing the song for people live thinking they would like,

2406
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:45,440
think it was absurd.

2407
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,440
And they were just like, this is great.

2408
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:49,600
I was like, don't you think Jimmy Buffett would like record this?

2409
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,520
And they're like, yes, of course he would.

2410
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,520
That's pretty.

2411
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:53,880
That's a pretty song.

2412
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:57,160
No one said pretty, but they were all like hell, they were all drunk and like they had

2413
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:00,080
just seen Jimmy Buffett and they're like, yeah, he would like that song.

2414
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:03,000
I was like, oh yeah, what am I doing here?

2415
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
This was not the calculate.

2416
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I was not correct in my calculation.

2417
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,320
Well, I'll tell you what you're not doing is writing a song like that a week, getting

2418
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:16,720
your ass on tour, playing the, there's artists, if you don't know this, who like they're where

2419
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:21,120
they play almost exclusively is in the parking lots of Jimmy Buffett concert.

2420
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:27,080
I know this is like, there's enough of the tailgate culture that you can like, you can

2421
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:32,600
like, yeah, my thing and it like, and they do songs that just reference Jimmy to the

2422
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:35,800
Jimmy show and Fort Worth tonight.

2423
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:38,560
So that's like the parrot head equivalent of Patreon.

2424
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:43,680
I guess you, you, you play the parking lots and you, you build up some degree.

2425
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:44,680
Yeah.

2426
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:48,000
I mean, that's, there's a documentary on, he'd do himself well.

2427
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Jimmy should flag.

2428
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,880
I wish a copyright that and see if we can get Jimmy to pay us for it.

2429
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:52,880
I'll take some money.

2430
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:53,880
Jimmy, 5% of visa.

2431
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:54,880
15.

2432
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:55,880
15.

2433
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:59,360
I don't know if I was not enough.

2434
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,360
Yeah.

2435
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,320
That's the parrot heads documentary, right?

2436
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,320
You get a lot of that.

2437
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,320
TROPROC.

2438
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:09,720
You get a lot of, of that, by the way, are you going on the beach boys cruise in March?

2439
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,720
Joe Piscopo is on it.

2440
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,360
Oh my God.

2441
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:17,320
COVID-19 is on it.

2442
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,320
So let's see here.

2443
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:22,080
Oh, my notes are just, what were you, what were you looking up?

2444
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:23,080
Songs?

2445
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:24,080
Yeah.

2446
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,080
Songs.

2447
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:27,520
I think it's called Don't Growl, which I believe is caught Jason.

2448
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,520
Can you confirm this?

2449
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,880
Cause I've gotten myself all mixed up here.

2450
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,880
Uh, yeah.

2451
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:33,200
That, well, that was moved.

2452
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:36,840
No, that's in the show moved to where folk song was.

2453
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,840
Right.

2454
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:38,840
So, okay.

2455
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:40,640
And, and then Jason, can you play the jug really quick?

2456
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,280
Jason, play the jug real quick.

2457
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,280
Yeah.

2458
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,280
I'm so scared about shattering this chuck.

2459
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,280
Excellent.

2460
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:49,280
I think a little bit.

2461
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,280
Great.

2462
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,280
Great.

2463
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,280
Okay.

2464
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:53,280
All right.

2465
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,280
So back to Mike's phone.

2466
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:59,600
Where you're like, it's just, this is a crazy song about a guy flirting with a woman, but

2467
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,540
he's not allowed to hook up with her because he's married.

2468
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:07,840
So she basically tells him, if you can't bite, don't growl.

2469
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:12,960
I genuinely am lost and don't remember if this is a country bear song or if this is

2470
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:18,160
a, uh, little, little Jimmy Timbers or Zach Brown.

2471
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:20,080
I don't hear, get me back to reality here.

2472
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,080
Tommy Collins.

2473
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,080
Okay.

2474
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,360
This is not an original country.

2475
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:27,360
This is a different, this is a old recording Tommy Collins song that's in the country,

2476
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:28,360
but yes.

2477
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:29,360
Okay.

2478
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,360
Got it.

2479
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:31,360
He recorded it and he wrote it as well.

2480
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:35,080
And yeah, it is, uh, who's, and who sings this song in the country bear show?

2481
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:36,080
It is.

2482
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,520
I, uh, Ernest, Ernest, uh, in the five bear.

2483
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,520
We haven't even talked about Ernest.

2484
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:40,520
Okay.

2485
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:41,520
Wait, no.

2486
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,520
Ernest isn't a bear rug.

2487
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,520
Is he?

2488
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,520
No, he's not.

2489
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:45,520
No, no.

2490
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:46,520
He's with the five bear rugs.

2491
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:47,520
Okay.

2492
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:48,520
He's, they back them up.

2493
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,520
So who's Ernest?

2494
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:50,520
Uh, okay.

2495
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:51,520
So Ernest this, I like this energy we have right now.

2496
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,520
The fiddle.

2497
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,600
He wears the Derby and a polka dot.

2498
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:57,440
I wrote the, my note here says Ernest plays the fiddle.

2499
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:58,440
He is fancy.

2500
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,440
Uh, great.

2501
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,440
Yes.

2502
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:01,440
He doesn't have a Dickie.

2503
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,840
He has like a, well, no, it is a Dickie.

2504
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:06,880
I mean, there's a bow tie in the picture I'm looking at here.

2505
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,880
Yes.

2506
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,880
Yeah.

2507
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:09,880
Yeah.

2508
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:10,880
But it is a little like collar.

2509
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,960
He just had sort of as a white collar and a little like bow tie and bowler hat.

2510
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:14,960
Okay.

2511
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:15,960
I like Ernest a lot.

2512
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:16,960
I do too.

2513
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:21,360
Um, do you, you guys don't have the art in front of you?

2514
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,280
I know it's fantastic work.

2515
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:27,800
Um, but I am, am I, who's who in this art?

2516
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:30,680
Who's who's playing the banjo in the show?

2517
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:33,320
Um, that's not, do we have a fiddle player?

2518
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:35,680
I believe that Jason is a bear rug.

2519
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:41,520
I think you were, you, you two are both bear rugs and I, I'm a sleepy looking guy.

2520
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,040
Uh, am I Wendell perhaps?

2521
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:48,520
Oh, maybe you're saying golden kind of Brown, golden Brown.

2522
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,520
Um, I know.

2523
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,960
No, no, I'm dark Brown.

2524
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,960
Okay.

2525
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:58,120
Well, one of them did change fur colors, uh, during the refurbishment.

2526
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:00,320
I, I don't have that.

2527
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,720
Maybe I am a bear rug.

2528
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:03,800
Um, somebody tell me who I am.

2529
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:04,800
Yeah.

2530
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,160
This art, by the way, if you get, and we'll post this so you can look at it high res.

2531
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:13,840
Um, but it's, it's really wonderful in that, um, I'm holding a glass of white wine.

2532
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,320
Mike has a moonshine.

2533
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:20,960
One of the X's is crossed off on the, on the X, X, X, and I wonder if that is a nod to

2534
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,400
your dislike of body nets.

2535
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:26,480
I think that is a really dry joke on Tony's part.

2536
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,480
That's good.

2537
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:32,080
You're not okay with triple X and there is a crazy straw and an umbrella coming out of

2538
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:33,080
the top of the show.

2539
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,500
I mean, that's great detail.

2540
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:40,040
And then yours, I, Jason, you're hanging off of the guitar is a parsley eaten donut, a

2541
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:41,040
parsley.

2542
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:44,840
And I want to say churro unless it's a sausage, either would apply.

2543
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,120
And then there's a little Mr. Tato up on the top.

2544
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:49,920
Oh yeah.

2545
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,640
Truly the finest arts.

2546
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:52,640
Yeah.

2547
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:53,640
Real great.

2548
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:54,640
Check it out.

2549
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:57,120
A new new merch will be available with that art.

2550
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:58,120
Um, yeah.

2551
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:06,160
So, so Tommy Collins, uh, that's a song I like, uh, you know what is a legit legit good song

2552
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:07,160
too.

2553
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,160
How long will my baby be gone?

2554
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,840
Which is another Buck Owens song in this show.

2555
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:11,840
And who sings that?

2556
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,560
Uh, that is, I just want to make sure I know.

2557
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:19,840
Uh, these notes, you guys, you should see these notes.

2558
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,760
Uh, it's all on your phone.

2559
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:22,760
Terrence.

2560
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:23,760
Thank you.

2561
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,200
There Terrence is also called shaker.

2562
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:26,200
Hmm.

2563
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,680
You can have two Terrence, AKA shaker.

2564
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:29,680
Yeah.

2565
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,680
I find that confusing.

2566
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:35,400
The, um, one country bear appearance that I like a lot to jump around a little bit is

2567
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:40,400
when they are on the great Disney Disneyland sing along songs video.

2568
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:44,480
Uh, and there is a song they do the great outdoors, which is in the summer.

2569
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,480
Vacation version.

2570
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:46,480
Oh, yeah.

2571
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:47,480
Running around.

2572
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:48,480
Yeah.

2573
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:49,480
Oh, yeah.

2574
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,480
She was telling me about this this morning.

2575
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:51,480
She's like, we gotta watch this sing along.

2576
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:52,480
Great, great.

2577
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:56,360
Take great number, great use of the country bear walk around suits and like a kind of

2578
01:49:56,360 --> 01:50:00,200
obscure song for the, for a video that otherwise has grim grin and ghosts.

2579
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:06,120
And when you wish upon a star and big ones, this is a seasonal attraction specific song.

2580
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:07,360
And I like that.

2581
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,920
But one, that's the main way I had to look up what even, what are they saying?

2582
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:17,320
Cause at the beginning, a big chorus of children all goes, sorry, what are they saying?

2583
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:18,320
Watch it again.

2584
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,320
How, how do you shaker?

2585
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:21,920
Oh, yeah.

2586
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:22,920
Yeah.

2587
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:26,960
Um, I don't think there, I don't think you could find 10 children today who all know

2588
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:27,960
shaker.

2589
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:28,960
Yeah.

2590
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,480
I don't think that's, yeah, I don't think so.

2591
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:32,480
Probably not.

2592
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,760
Um, so yeah, I like that song.

2593
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:35,960
I think that song is good.

2594
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:39,120
Shaker is the, he has kind of a, kind of a quiver.

2595
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:42,560
It's kind of a, sort of not like he's not Elvis.

2596
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:43,560
Shaker is not Elvis.

2597
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:44,560
Shaker is not Elvis.

2598
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:48,880
Liver Lips is Elvis, but he's sort of, he's tall and he sings kind of sad songs.

2599
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,880
Yeah.

2600
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:51,320
Um, and it's very, how long am I, baby?

2601
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:52,760
Just a little snippet of it.

2602
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,800
Um, but I think that's a nice, a nice song, a pretty song as well.

2603
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:59,520
I would say it's pretty.

2604
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:03,200
There's a real earnestness when you say this about these and there's another, then another

2605
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:04,200
pretty one.

2606
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,200
Yeah.

2607
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:06,200
I'm an earnest guy.

2608
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:07,280
What are the, what are the, what else is pretty in this show?

2609
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:08,280
Uh, let me look here.

2610
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:12,960
I mean, like, um, we said Heart, We Did All We Could is pretty.

2611
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,360
Uh, I don't think the Five Bear Rugs introductory song.

2612
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:17,520
No, I would say it's not pretty.

2613
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:18,600
No, that's the attempt.

2614
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:19,920
That's not what they're going for though.

2615
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,920
Uh, yeah, exactly.

2616
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:21,920
Um, I don't know.

2617
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,840
I think that's with the ones I think are pretty.

2618
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:28,840
Is the, is what, uh, Teddy Bear swings swings.

2619
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:29,840
That's what I said.

2620
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:30,840
Heart, We Did All We Could.

2621
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:31,840
Yeah.

2622
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,840
That's the pretty.

2623
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:33,840
Yeah.

2624
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,320
Which is a Wanda Jackson song.

2625
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:36,320
She sung that.

2626
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:37,320
Okay.

2627
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:41,560
And she is Reese and I say this recently, she did the Jack White album, but that's probably

2628
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:42,560
like eight years ago.

2629
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,560
Hmm.

2630
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:45,880
Person who might enjoy the country bears.

2631
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:46,880
Jack White would love a country bear.

2632
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:47,880
Oh, Jack.

2633
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:48,880
Third man records.

2634
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,280
Does it have a animatronic show?

2635
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:51,280
Oh man.

2636
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,280
It should.

2637
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,280
It really should.

2638
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:54,280
Performance space.

2639
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:55,280
Yes.

2640
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,480
They put out the like, um, seven inches or the, the singles.

2641
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:01,440
Isn't there like a, yeah, like you make your own vinyl or is that a little booth or something?

2642
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:02,440
You can make your own.

2643
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:03,440
Yeah.

2644
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,440
I like the country bears for a residency.

2645
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:05,920
They have nowhere to go.

2646
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:06,920
Yeah.

2647
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:10,280
Um, Disney will be eating their hat if they show up in Nashville.

2648
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:11,280
They have a permit.

2649
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,280
Right.

2650
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:14,840
They're all of their, uh, or potentially installed at third man.

2651
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:17,920
I say like, you know, cause Jack White did the Wanda Jackson album, but then before that,

2652
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,440
I think he did for sure.

2653
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,320
He did the Loretta Lynn album.

2654
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:24,760
So he has an appreciation for the classics.

2655
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:26,080
With Slogin Fitz.

2656
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:27,080
Yeah.

2657
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:30,320
So he should, uh, he should produce the country bears.

2658
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,320
That's what I was getting at.

2659
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,320
Yeah.

2660
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:33,320
He should produce.

2661
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:34,320
Makes some new.

2662
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:35,320
Yeah.

2663
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:36,320
This is all right.

2664
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:37,920
Like Rick Rubin, Johnny Cash.

2665
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:38,920
Exactly.

2666
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,600
New relevant music.

2667
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,600
Yeah.

2668
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:44,040
Well, the Johnny Cash went to a little bit of a bummer because to me it's not suggest

2669
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:48,320
they're dying, but uh, I guess he's where he doesn't work with all.

2670
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,360
Country bears two country bears three.

2671
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:51,360
Yeah.

2672
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,360
Yeah.

2673
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:53,360
Yeah.

2674
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:58,360
Well, I mean, I don't want to, uh, say anything dour, but if the country bears learned, if

2675
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:02,160
any of them learned that they're not long for this world, they gotta make their way

2676
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:03,420
to Nashville.

2677
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:11,320
If big Al did hurt during one of these shows, the roof would go off the building.

2678
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:12,320
Big Al.

2679
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,520
I think you could absolutely switch it to that.

2680
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:15,520
Yes.

2681
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,520
Yeah.

2682
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:19,520
Would it seem insensitive or something?

2683
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:24,880
I hurt my bear self today.

2684
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:31,560
Well, I think we have more bears talk about, but since we brought up big Al and, and uh,

2685
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:36,760
and I mean, I think a lot of people's favorite, everyone loves big Al people laugh.

2686
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:37,760
People are excited.

2687
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,760
Yeah.

2688
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:39,760
Yeah.

2689
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:40,760
Comes out.

2690
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:46,160
Um, big Al's track is unique in that it's pretty much just a Tex Ritter album track.

2691
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:47,160
Yes.

2692
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:51,200
He's like his is not an original, at least the first time around, it was not.

2693
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:56,560
And when I found that interesting that this weird, funny, depressing song he sings that

2694
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:59,880
brings down the room that that is not a Disney invention at all.

2695
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:00,880
That's full text reader.

2696
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:01,880
No.

2697
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:02,880
And it, okay.

2698
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,160
A couple of weird things about this.

2699
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:10,520
This is another thing that I think I unlearned, unlearned, relearned in the last week.

2700
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:13,560
Tex Ritter, the father of John Ritter.

2701
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:14,560
Yeah.

2702
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,560
From television.

2703
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,560
Yeah.

2704
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:20,240
Uh, they seem like that seems like completely different eras and types of pop culture.

2705
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:21,240
It's really weird.

2706
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:22,240
Yeah.

2707
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:23,240
They're linked.

2708
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:28,520
And that his, his, uh, he, I don't believe he wrote blood on the saddle.

2709
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:35,800
Uh, Everett Cheetham is the name I have, uh, as writing, uh, blood on the saddle, but blood

2710
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:40,800
on the saddle, the, uh, Tex Ritter album came out in 1960.

2711
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:41,800
Here is a cover of it.

2712
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,800
It's a fun painted cover.

2713
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,120
This show opens 1971.

2714
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:48,840
That isn't that long of time.

2715
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:54,240
That is like if they opened a show now and one animatronic towards the end just did chicken

2716
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:56,440
fried or just did red solo.

2717
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:57,440
Right, right, right.

2718
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:58,720
Like that is modern.

2719
01:54:58,720 --> 01:54:59,720
Yeah.

2720
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:00,720
Yeah.

2721
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:03,840
Cause you don't, you think of all these songs at the time being like 50 years old, but that's

2722
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:04,840
not the case.

2723
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:05,840
No.

2724
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:06,840
Yeah.

2725
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:09,040
Um, um, blood on the saddle.

2726
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:14,000
I mean, I don't have a clip, but maybe we should just perform it to the best of our

2727
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
ability.

2728
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Yeah.

2729
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
They're blood on the saddle.

2730
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Boom.

2731
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,200
Blood all around.

2732
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:28,480
And this is the funniest thing in the show.

2733
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,600
I think the sun bonnets is the funniest thing.

2734
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:31,600
Oh, that's fair.

2735
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:32,600
Yeah.

2736
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,600
Yeah.

2737
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:34,600
This is almost kind of close.

2738
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:35,600
Yeah.

2739
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:43,640
But it's so funny that he's such a depressed looking bear and he sings just this like the

2740
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:51,000
dark dark song done in the most minimal, the way those notes bend down, which I guess

2741
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,240
is the original track.

2742
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:55,280
But what a well chosen track.

2743
01:55:55,280 --> 01:56:00,800
It's just very funny that he, um, sticks to his guns.

2744
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:06,480
He, he sees what everyone else does for the jamboree and he says, no, I'm going to bring

2745
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,120
a different flavor to this.

2746
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:10,080
I have to be true to myself.

2747
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,080
Yeah.

2748
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:15,400
I have to represent myself like any you'd be told to do on American idol or the voice

2749
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:16,940
or anything.

2750
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:19,120
He can't be, he can't do happy songs.

2751
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:20,400
That's not who big Al is.

2752
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,400
Yeah.

2753
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,600
They're embarrassed by him.

2754
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:24,920
They're embarrassed by the choice.

2755
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:30,920
Well, the show is a kind of self referential, like that song that is not cut about, um,

2756
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:33,040
beating little Buford.

2757
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:36,680
After that, Henry goes, Henry goes, uh, yeah, exactly.

2758
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:40,600
Henry goes like, uh, we only have high class stuff on this show folks.

2759
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:42,800
Uh, but they want big L off the stage.

2760
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:43,800
They want him to stop.

2761
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:48,280
So they're like really just like, this is not what we thought you were going to do.

2762
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:50,000
That's what I, how I read it at least.

2763
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:55,360
Well, I think he does his song and then they go into the ballad of Davy Crockett and then

2764
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,360
he brings it back.

2765
01:56:56,360 --> 01:57:04,000
He interrupts that and to kind of, uh, overpower him, they go into old, old slew foot, uh,

2766
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,560
which I think is a very jaunty song.

2767
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:16,000
Uh, there's a recording by an act called Jim and Jesse from 1976, uh, on a television program

2768
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
doing it.

2769
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I, you know what?

2770
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,800
You're right and, but I, for whatever reason, I always, in my mind, I was reading it like

2771
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:27,440
he was, he had to end it early and he wanted to come back to finish it.

2772
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:28,840
Oh, interesting.

2773
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:31,080
But maybe he was just, you didn't give me my time.

2774
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:32,080
Yeah.

2775
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,080
Maybe that's not right.

2776
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:36,480
That's for some reason, that's how I interpreted it, but that's probably not right.

2777
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:42,640
You're going to have to shut off the goddamn lights to get me to leave over my dead body.

2778
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:45,600
Al said, fuck you.

2779
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:50,040
I have the text reader version and there are more lyrics after blood on this apple.

2780
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:51,040
Oh yeah.

2781
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:52,040
What keeps happening?

2782
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:53,040
Sure.

2783
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,520
Because that's the, we should say blood on the side, even that you're in a theme park,

2784
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:58,960
it strikes me and I think a lot of people in that audience funny every time that you're

2785
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,560
hearing a song about blood.

2786
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:03,320
I don't think they would do this from the ground up today.

2787
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,480
No, there's no way.

2788
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:05,480
Yeah.

2789
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:07,520
We paid for a new show where people sing about blood.

2790
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:08,520
Yeah.

2791
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:14,260
I mean, I think there, there is, um, there's transgressive stuff that you can get away

2792
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:17,040
with and country music.

2793
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:20,520
And I think that's why it's still like in the park.

2794
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:23,720
Bring it closer.

2795
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:24,720
Yeah.

2796
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:53,480
Is that what's in the show?

2797
01:58:53,480 --> 01:59:22,120
Or is this is not an issue?

2798
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:25,000
Like if I'm reading blood, I don't write any Broncos no more.

2799
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,320
Oh, the next line is, Oh, pity the cowboy all bloody and red for the Bronco fell on

2800
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:31,000
him and bashed in his head.

2801
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Whoa.

2802
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,680
There was blood on the saddle and blood all around and a great big puddle of blood on

2803
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,680
the ground.

2804
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:38,720
So yeah, it's good.

2805
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:39,720
That's what, yeah.

2806
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:44,960
When we, we saw the show after so many years, I was like, Whoa, this is wild.

2807
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:45,960
Wow.

2808
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:46,960
This is wild.

2809
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:47,960
This still exists here.

2810
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:48,960
That's a good, that gets a little more serious.

2811
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:52,280
It's like it almost, it reads as a comedy song completely.

2812
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:53,280
Right, right, right.

2813
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,360
When you get into details of how this guy's head was bashed.

2814
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:57,360
Right.

2815
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:06,080
So dark show sometimes some ways, but you know, these performers live rough and tumble

2816
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,080
lives.

2817
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:08,080
Yeah, sure.

2818
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:09,720
Again, Alice speaking his truth.

2819
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:10,720
That's right.

2820
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:11,720
This is something he saw.

2821
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:13,240
This was a bear.

2822
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:14,240
He knew.

2823
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:15,240
Yeah.

2824
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:17,120
Or he's just a really great interpreter of song.

2825
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,120
He's really feeling.

2826
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,400
Well, he's absolutely that.

2827
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:20,480
Well, yes, you're right.

2828
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,480
For sure.

2829
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:22,480
He's that.

2830
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:27,760
I feel like you could give him a, like Adele, you do hello in that style.

2831
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:33,040
I people for one of those nights where you have to pay extra money to go into Disney

2832
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:37,520
world or Disney, I guess Disney world, they should just fucking have him sing Adele and

2833
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:39,520
people will lose their minds.

2834
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,520
Yeah.

2835
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:44,040
Go and you want to see, they're going to do Adele and people would pay money for that.

2836
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:46,240
We'll need to sound like off stage.

2837
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:47,680
Dexter at our long dead.

2838
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:48,680
Well, sure.

2839
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:49,680
I know Dexter.

2840
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:51,320
It did not show up at every performance.

2841
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:59,760
Oh, if only, if I sync it up, but like a success again, a successful singer in his own right.

2842
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:02,280
And so did that just put his song?

2843
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:07,840
I mean, they think seems like it's a little deeper, a little gravelier in the show, but

2844
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,160
it's so close.

2845
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:14,800
Yeah, they didn't change that at all or barely at all, I should say.

2846
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:18,480
So yeah, he, I would imagine yeah, he's number one.

2847
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:22,400
I'm trying to think because big Al the merchandise in Tokyo, because Tokyo still has country

2848
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:23,400
bear merchandise.

2849
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,400
Yeah.

2850
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:28,880
At least was when I was there and they have Henry, they have a stuffed plush of Henry.

2851
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:30,600
They have swinging Teddy bear.

2852
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:32,880
They have the sunbonnets.

2853
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:33,880
But I don't remember.

2854
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:34,880
Did they have big Al or not?

2855
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:35,880
I don't know.

2856
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:41,600
I mean, those are probably the main most popular characters, but there's a very cute trio of

2857
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:48,840
stuffed sunbonnets and we should talk about the sunbonnets and the song they sing.

2858
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:55,760
Well that's maybe, yeah, that I think if you were trying to do a weird trip to Disney world

2859
02:01:55,760 --> 02:02:00,600
or to, you know, I guess Tokyo too, if you're trying to like, all right, I know what the

2860
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:01,600
big rides are.

2861
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:05,080
I know what big thunder and space man is and tell it, show me weird stuff.

2862
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:11,680
I think like, you know, your list would include Carousel of Progress with its weird 1994 locked

2863
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:12,680
in time sequence.

2864
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:13,680
Yeah.

2865
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:16,960
And it would certainly include this for Blood on the Saddle and probably, I think maybe

2866
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:21,480
this moment is one of the weirdest things you can see in the Magic Kingdom.

2867
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:23,400
Well, yes, there's a lot of stuff going on.

2868
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:25,280
For one, there's still a slideshow.

2869
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,520
There's still a 1970s era slideshow.

2870
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:32,560
Oh yeah, that there's a slideshow at all, I guess, is very much dates it.

2871
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:37,960
But that's, you know, one thing I like about all of these versions is seeing them represent

2872
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:41,320
that in slides, they're still drawings.

2873
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:43,000
They are, they don't look like robots.

2874
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Right.

2875
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,840
In the different medium of slides, they are drawings.

2876
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:49,000
They're Mark Davissy kind of drawings.

2877
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:55,880
Also I think for the song, All the Guys That Turn Me On Turn Me Down, I feel like Turn

2878
02:02:55,880 --> 02:03:00,360
Me On used to be a little more chaste or generic, like turn on.

2879
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:01,360
Yeah.

2880
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,680
You're right.

2881
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:05,360
So yeah, that is aged a little bit more aggressively.

2882
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:06,360
Yeah.

2883
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:10,120
Now turn on is full on horny, like ooh, it's a turn on.

2884
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:11,360
I think that is right.

2885
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:15,360
So yeah, when that song was written, it wasn't quite as aggressive as it sounds now.

2886
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:18,480
Turn Me On is like mentally, like make me perk up.

2887
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:24,760
Yeah, I mean, it is a horny song, but it is not meant to be as aggressive as it sounds

2888
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:28,360
in the parlance of our time in the language of now.

2889
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:29,360
And that's what it is.

2890
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,400
It's aggressive.

2891
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:33,600
This is aggressive sexuality coming from the Sunbonnet trio.

2892
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:34,600
That's right.

2893
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:35,600
Yeah.

2894
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:36,600
So it's hard.

2895
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:40,560
It's jarring at first and it might take you five, six viewings to not have it feel so

2896
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:41,560
aggressive.

2897
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:42,560
Yeah.

2898
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:43,560
Be prepared.

2899
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:50,720
A nice, like a different tone than Heart We Did All That We Could and Tears Will Be the

2900
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:52,000
Chaser to My Want.

2901
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,680
Those are both pretty sad ballads from the female coded bears.

2902
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:59,280
This one's kind of sad too, because they're getting turned down.

2903
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:03,400
I think all the females, nobody's like having a lot of luck in general.

2904
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,880
Yeah, I mean, a lot of the bears are singing sad songs.

2905
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:08,840
Even some of the jauntier ones, if you listen to the lyrics, are sadder.

2906
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:09,840
Yeah.

2907
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:11,600
Like how long will my baby be gone?

2908
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:13,400
That's a sad one.

2909
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:15,120
But yeah, yeah.

2910
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:16,400
These are all pretty sad.

2911
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:20,800
And this one, yeah, this is, so in case you don't know, again, listen to this probably

2912
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:26,000
before, like go to YouTube and find this, like look up Sunbonnet Trio and they do a song

2913
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,400
called All the Guys That Turn Me On Turn Me Down.

2914
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:34,560
And they're just upset that they can't get one of these gentlemen bears to give them

2915
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:35,560
the time of day.

2916
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:36,560
So they're all missing.

2917
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,320
In the original version of this show, there's banter.

2918
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:41,200
Trixie is like flirting with Henry.

2919
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:44,200
Well, no, he still flirts with Henry.

2920
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:45,200
She's still-

2921
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:46,200
Yeah, that thing of if I had a ladder.

2922
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,200
Yeah, yeah.

2923
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:48,200
That's the one there.

2924
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,200
No, that's Teddy Bearer.

2925
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:50,200
Oh, okay.

2926
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:51,200
Oh, Trixie.

2927
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:52,200
You're right.

2928
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:53,200
You're right.

2929
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:54,200
Trixie flirts with Henry in the uncut version.

2930
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:55,200
Yes.

2931
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:58,400
And then they're like, well, I'll be up as soon as I can find a ladder.

2932
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:03,160
That's kind of sad because like, although all the mounted heads, that's kind of sad because

2933
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:04,160
she wants him and he wants her.

2934
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:05,160
Because he doesn't have a ladder?

2935
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:06,160
No, no.

2936
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:11,360
I mean, that Trixie wants Henry, but Henry wants Teddy Bearer.

2937
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:12,360
Oh, I see.

2938
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:16,480
Although the mounted moose heads are very taken with Trixie, the moose and the buck

2939
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:17,480
and the other one.

2940
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:18,480
Yeah.

2941
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:19,480
But they don't have bodies.

2942
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:20,480
So what are they going to do?

2943
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:21,480
A kiss.

2944
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:22,480
It's all sad.

2945
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:23,480
Yeah, you can do mouse stuff.

2946
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:25,480
Yeah, you're right.

2947
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:27,480
You could kiss.

2948
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:30,240
We want to give people what they want to see.

2949
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:35,320
Show Trixie the bear kissing all of the mounted heads.

2950
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:36,400
That's for Disney Plus.

2951
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:37,880
That's a Disney Plus show.

2952
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:39,880
There's no story.

2953
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:41,560
It's just kissing.

2954
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:49,480
The Sunbonnet Trio, Bunny, Bubbles and Bula, they are tiny bears and they're wearing bonnets.

2955
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:52,840
They feel young probably from the way that they dress.

2956
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:56,040
From the bonnets and the little blue skirts.

2957
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:57,760
That's what's crazy because they look like babies.

2958
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:00,840
They look like children.

2959
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:04,000
And I've confirmed there's a blurb that was on one of these wikis.

2960
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,360
The Sunbonnets are the babies of the country bear Jamboree.

2961
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:13,400
They begin singing in public school in Clint, Texas in Miss Grizzly's class.

2962
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:17,320
We know the town that the Sunbonnet Trio comes from.

2963
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:21,380
From there they appear five weeks running on Major Bears Amateur Hour and were booked

2964
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:22,960
into Walt Disney World.

2965
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:25,440
Backstage they study their lessons.

2966
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:30,440
In their spare time they are knitting a scarf for Big Albert which they hope to have finished

2967
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:35,320
for Christmas three years from now.

2968
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:38,880
Is there this level of detailed backstory for every country bear?

2969
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:39,880
Like if you were to dig?

2970
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:44,160
I think it depends because I honestly I had to look a couple places to find this.

2971
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:48,440
And then this is another thing we've run into where I think even with Haunted Mansion where

2972
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:53,400
you're like it's canon according to like a comic that was written but I don't know if

2973
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:56,040
it's technically like Disney canon.

2974
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:59,320
Like Disney proper I don't know what they consider official.

2975
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:05,360
Yeah because I walked through a gift shop and they had the Disney World game of life.

2976
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:06,360
The board game life.

2977
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:07,360
Oh yeah yeah.

2978
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:14,080
And Big Al is on that and he looks so like happy and very healthy and I'm like was that

2979
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:17,400
canon like he looks like a totally different character.

2980
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:20,040
No it should be canon that he's unhappy.

2981
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:21,040
He should look like shit.

2982
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:23,360
He should be like a little cutesy.

2983
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:30,560
Yeah but yeah so these these like I guess okay bears live to be I look this up 25 years

2984
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,560
old.

2985
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:32,560
Okay.

2986
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:36,600
Okay so if they're students I mean what they could be five to ten.

2987
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:40,720
I'm just trying to retcon this to be not so bizarre.

2988
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:41,720
So you know.

2989
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:42,720
I'm sure it's not.

2990
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:45,320
I'm sure they did their this is a public show.

2991
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:48,080
They're not going to do anything that anybody's gonna get in trouble for.

2992
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:49,080
You're right.

2993
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:50,520
These are there of bear age.

2994
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:54,080
Now we don't know what bear age is and I don't want to go saying it.

2995
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:56,400
But this is yes this is just guessing.

2996
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:57,760
This is high school.

2997
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:02,860
This is you know high school feeling of crushes and not being reciprocated.

2998
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:03,860
That's all this is.

2999
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:04,860
Yeah.

3000
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:05,860
Yeah.

3001
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:06,860
But it's funny.

3002
02:08:06,860 --> 02:08:07,860
This isn't pornographic folks.

3003
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:08,860
I didn't say that.

3004
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:09,860
I'm just saying this is just.

3005
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:11,560
No what Henry wants to do with that ladder.

3006
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:12,560
That's pornographic.

3007
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:13,560
That's disgusting.

3008
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:14,560
Henry goes like.

3009
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,320
Like Henry makes like a like a he's smelling a stew or something.

3010
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:23,960
He makes like that type of a satisfied noise after he goes like I'll be right up.

3011
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:26,320
He goes like a real.

3012
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:27,800
That's aggressive.

3013
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:31,560
They make some growly bear like they all make some grunts and stuff.

3014
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:32,560
Yeah.

3015
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,560
He is.

3016
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:34,560
It's a disturbing sound.

3017
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,560
It is horny.

3018
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:36,560
Yeah.

3019
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:37,560
That's for sure.

3020
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:40,420
Can I call just to get the sounds of the episode going.

3021
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:53,760
Can we get a quick jug and then I want to hear your that sound in response to the jugging.

3022
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:58,720
Now that's an appropriate use of that kind of sound approval of great jug music.

3023
02:08:58,720 --> 02:08:59,720
Yeah.

3024
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:02,080
It's not to be used in lewd settings.

3025
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:03,080
That's good.

3026
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:04,080
That's proper.

3027
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:06,320
That's nice and proper.

3028
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:07,320
So yeah.

3029
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:11,920
This song not not this is not originally there the guys are really on.

3030
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:12,920
Well there you go too.

3031
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:14,440
They don't even know what they're singing about.

3032
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:16,560
That's the other thing.

3033
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:18,360
So they can't be held responsible.

3034
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:19,360
Can't be held responsible.

3035
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,360
Somebody I don't know.

3036
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:21,800
Maybe they're not being protected here.

3037
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:25,080
Maybe you know Henry shoved these lyrics in their hands.

3038
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:28,120
They go sure we just want to say we just want to be part of the show.

3039
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:29,120
Right.

3040
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:34,040
And they aren't even aware of the potential you know what you could infer from it.

3041
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:36,280
This was written by Plot and Powell.

3042
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:38,280
Those are the last names of the songwriters.

3043
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:41,080
Is it men?

3044
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:42,560
Not sure actually.

3045
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:44,120
There wasn't.

3046
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:45,480
I'll look into that.

3047
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:48,240
That'll be coming coming up on another episode.

3048
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:54,240
Well is this what I'm worried about is that like you know suggestive lyrics are being

3049
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:59,400
put in front of these young singers and is the sunbonnet trio a Britney situation.

3050
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:02,280
Is it possible that they're yeah are they in some case.

3051
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:07,160
Is Henry in charge of the conservatorship and do they need to be freed from it.

3052
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:08,160
That's a good question.

3053
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:09,160
That's something to look into.

3054
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:10,160
We can look for it.

3055
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:15,600
Well when we go through the hint that Christmas or if we go through the Christmas and summer

3056
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:22,400
show if we can look for clues there as well to see what's going on.

3057
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:27,480
Whatever we can do if we need to start a separate podcast about that to get the sunbonets freed.

3058
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:28,480
Sure.

3059
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,480
We'll do what we can.

3060
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:30,480
We'll do what we can.

3061
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:32,880
So here's what it stands let's just read these lyrics.

3062
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:38,320
Every time I meet a guy who gets me shook all I ever get from him is a dirty look.

3063
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:43,880
It's the same way everywhere I've found all the guys that turn me on turn me down.

3064
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:46,600
All the guys that turn me on turn me down.

3065
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:50,720
Nothing works for me I've found the same way everywhere I see nothing ever seems to work

3066
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:51,880
for me.

3067
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:56,160
Doodle doodle do bum bum.

3068
02:10:56,160 --> 02:11:00,280
I think this is the three part harmony is very pretty on this.

3069
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:02,040
I'll say it's pretty.

3070
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:03,040
I think it's pretty.

3071
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:04,040
Yeah.

3072
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:09,760
There's a gag in one of the slides where she's like waving a handkerchief at a guy and in

3073
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:16,000
the next one he's like walking on top of the handkerchief which is such a bird.

3074
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,080
I don't know if it's a reference that old thing where it's like oh you lay your coat

3075
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:23,760
down in case there's a puddle but it was just like he's just trampling the handkerchief.

3076
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:28,240
Well this is where like I know I don't have that image in front of me I don't have copies

3077
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:29,840
of these slides.

3078
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:33,400
I wish I did but the you know how handsome is that bear.

3079
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:41,240
How good looking is this bear that he can thumb his snoot at all three of the sun bonnets.

3080
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:47,560
Well who I mean yeah I don't know what the standard is for male bear beauty.

3081
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:55,740
Yes Henry the most attractive his big owl his big like he's all set for hibernating.

3082
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:57,000
Is he the most attractive?

3083
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:01,160
Because he's going to survive through the winter.

3084
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:06,360
Well let's we should all make our we again we don't have a meter of bear attractiveness

3085
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:12,480
but just going off of your gut if you get some of the pictures in front of it who do

3086
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:15,080
you think's the most handsome bear?

3087
02:12:15,080 --> 02:12:16,560
Which bear can get it?

3088
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:20,760
Which there you go which country bear can get it?

3089
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:28,240
I think that Gomer is kind of quietly handsome like there's nothing you know he doesn't

3090
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:35,900
have like the you know he's well dressed he doesn't have like kind of the goofy smile

3091
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:37,360
or the odd lips.

3092
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:42,680
I think he's just like solid and putting his head down he's an artist and you know I'd

3093
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:48,160
like to I'd like to get in his head learn his you know what makes him tick his piano

3094
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:50,400
theory what made him passionate about music.

3095
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:54,920
He's not a showboat so I'm gonna say Gomer can get it.

3096
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:57,000
Okay Jason do you know?

3097
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,920
I mean swinging teddy bear is a knockout you know the confidence alone I think we can all

3098
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:02,920
agree.

3099
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:06,640
I'm just talking male we can cover that territory separately.

3100
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:11,200
I think part of the humor of Libra Lifts McGraw is him going my woman ain't pretty but you

3101
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:15,920
don't swear none and he's like looked like he just got like punched in the face.

3102
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:20,520
He says she ain't pretty but I ain't too.

3103
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:23,120
That's yeah so at least he's in on in on it.

3104
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:24,120
Yeah.

3105
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:31,240
Do we think that he has maybe kind of like a kind of a rock star swag again I was earlier

3106
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:37,040
we were saying it's the scruffy hair I'm sure is there is there anybody this guy looks I

3107
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:39,200
mean is there sort of a Mick Jagger vibe to.

3108
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,200
Or like Dylan?

3109
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:42,640
Like Dylan's kind of got a weird.

3110
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:45,720
Oh sure yeah he's a little scraggly.

3111
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:48,960
You know a little rough he's not for your parents you need an entertainer and a nice

3112
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:49,960
suit.

3113
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:54,560
Yeah maybe I mean the rebelliousness to him right.

3114
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:56,880
I think that's yeah I think I can see what you're saying there.

3115
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,440
You can say that I think Henry though.

3116
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:05,520
The sleepy eyes a little bit you know do we consider he's an interesting odd looking fellow

3117
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:10,480
but is Steve Buscemi attractive in some notable in some way.

3118
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:15,320
Yeah I think look everyone is attractive on some I think you know everybody has different

3119
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:20,840
tastes you know there's not really one standard of beauty so yeah for Steve Buscemi a real

3120
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:23,440
talented guy I could see it.

3121
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:24,440
You know so.

3122
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:25,920
Kind of looks like Steve Buscemi.

3123
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:29,720
Really we're just talking like who can get it when we say who can get it we're just saying

3124
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:31,120
for us personally.

3125
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:36,440
I mean Henry I think that's probably the easy choice but like you like a leader you like

3126
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:37,440
that confidence.

3127
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:39,600
I like Tennessee Bear a lot.

3128
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:41,240
Yeah I'm a big fan of Tennessee Bear.

3129
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:43,080
Sorry Tennessee is one of the bear rugs.

3130
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:44,920
He's got the one string bass.

3131
02:14:44,920 --> 02:14:45,920
Okay okay.

3132
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:53,080
Yeah and he's just he's like he's definitely hammered but he's got like he's got a nice

3133
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:57,720
grin on his face and he seems like he'd be fun to talk to.

3134
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:03,080
There's a by him there's a jug that says do we say this E flat it's a moonshine jug next

3135
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:04,080
to him.

3136
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:10,760
Oh like you can like they have them tuned differently like the way if you play glasses

3137
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:14,280
filled up with different amounts of water that makes different notes so.

3138
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:17,840
Yeah there's one that says B flat here too.

3139
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:18,840
Oh okay.

3140
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:21,400
So there's multiple different jugs that have different notes.

3141
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:24,640
They can perform a different again Jason B flat.

3142
02:15:24,640 --> 02:15:28,800
Can we have a quick B flat.

3143
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:33,720
You're lucky to get any letter.

3144
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:34,720
Great as opposed to an E.

3145
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:35,720
Could you give me an E yeah.

3146
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:40,040
I think actually you made an octave up.

3147
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:45,600
I just realized this glass jug looks like the sad up like jug that they they put the

3148
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:52,240
change in that they have to constantly dig into to not take their trip.

3149
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:57,440
Well if he was you know he could look at it half empty and say that's a trip I'll never

3150
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:01,240
get to take with my dead wife or he can look at it half full and say maybe I could start

3151
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:02,240
a jug being career.

3152
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:03,240
That's true.

3153
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:04,240
Yeah.

3154
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:05,240
Yeah.

3155
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:06,240
Get with it Carl.

3156
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:07,240
Here's the thing I want to say.

3157
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:08,240
Do have we talked about maybe we haven't I'm forgetting.

3158
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:10,440
We talked about Disney on parade.

3159
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:11,440
Hmm.

3160
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:14,320
Well I don't know because I don't think I know I fan what it is.

3161
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:17,600
Okay I don't know much more than there at least there's okay.

3162
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:22,240
So I was looking up some bonnets and some bonnets appear as like a trapeze act and something

3163
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:24,480
called Disney on parade.

3164
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:29,640
And this is by far this is not an episode on Jambor week but this is an episode.

3165
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:34,760
This is an hour long live Disney circus from the set in Epcot.

3166
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:37,220
I should know where it was traveling the country thing.

3167
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:38,220
I don't know.

3168
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:41,000
I don't know where I just know there's a special that's recorded.

3169
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:46,160
There's a scene in it where goofy or her be the love bug is trying to run over goofy.

3170
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:47,320
Whoa.

3171
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:51,120
And it is wild and the goofy hits her be on the top of the head and her be like has a

3172
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:55,000
little bump that grows and it is bizarre.

3173
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,680
Disco bare necessities happen during it.

3174
02:16:58,680 --> 02:17:03,960
Mowgli like dancing like crazy during it's it's I it's wild.

3175
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:08,840
I found it toward the end of today before we had to come here so.

3176
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:14,840
Okay forgive me the the name of the toy that's the red goggles where you flip through and

3177
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:16,120
you see different slides.

3178
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:17,120
View master.

3179
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:18,120
View master.

3180
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:20,120
I had a view master of this.

3181
02:17:20,120 --> 02:17:24,640
They took stills from this experience or from the special or something.

3182
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:25,640
Right.

3183
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:31,120
Yeah because I like oh Disney stuff that sounds neat and I remember it being so dark and like

3184
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:35,920
not just in the way it was shot because it's like a live theatrical presentation in the

3185
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:37,560
70s that wasn't very well lit.

3186
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:38,560
Right.

3187
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:41,920
Then also like yeah on it her be attacking.

3188
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:42,920
Yeah he hits him.

3189
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:46,960
A real car drives into somebody dressed as goofy.

3190
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:47,960
Yes.

3191
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:51,560
Like hits him in the butt and he flies forward and there's a whole scene.

3192
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:52,560
You know what I'm talking about?

3193
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:53,560
You've seen this?

3194
02:17:53,560 --> 02:18:03,440
I think what I was talking about was a different circus themed special called Epcot's Daredevil

3195
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:06,600
Circus Spectacular that is from the later 80s.

3196
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:07,600
Oh interesting.

3197
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:10,040
Where they set up circus acts in the middle of World Showcase.

3198
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:12,520
If you want to talk about hat on a hat.

3199
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:13,520
Wow.

3200
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:15,200
Yeah so that's different than Disney on Parade.

3201
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:16,200
Disney on Parade.

3202
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:18,440
Which is also circus themed.

3203
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:21,040
Circus like country music it was okay.

3204
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:23,920
You could just anyone could use it.

3205
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:26,040
You know anyone could get away with it.

3206
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:29,200
You mean the tropes of a circus or the acts of a circus?

3207
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:33,240
It was like a go to theme for like variety stuff.

3208
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:37,040
It was seen as family friendly and widely popular I feel like.

3209
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:40,560
What was the Disneyland 90s circus thing?

3210
02:18:40,560 --> 02:18:41,560
That was.

3211
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:42,560
I forget what that was.

3212
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:43,560
You know what I'm talking about?

3213
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:44,560
Yeah.

3214
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:45,560
Where like it was just like circus acts set up.

3215
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:46,560
On Main Street right?

3216
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:47,560
Everywhere.

3217
02:18:47,560 --> 02:18:48,560
Yeah.

3218
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:49,560
Right right.

3219
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:50,560
Something like that.

3220
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:51,560
Like a male married.

3221
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:53,160
Like that was like a come to Jesus moment.

3222
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:54,160
What are we going to do?

3223
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:55,160
Okay circus.

3224
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:56,160
Circus.

3225
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,160
But sorry the country bears are part of Disney on Parade.

3226
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:00,160
Yes.

3227
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:01,320
There's just I saw a picture.

3228
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:03,400
I saw honestly because I was scrubbing through it.

3229
02:19:03,400 --> 02:19:06,680
I just saw a picture of the sun bonnets like hanging.

3230
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:09,720
They were like a trapeze act and I don't know if there's multiple.

3231
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:12,200
I don't know there's multiple maybe there's multiple Disney on parades.

3232
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:13,880
Maybe it was just one I was watching.

3233
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:14,880
I'm not sure.

3234
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:18,080
So it's people in suits of the sun bonnet trio?

3235
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:19,400
That's well let me I'll find a picture.

3236
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:25,520
Are they thinking because female gymnasts are often very tiny is that the like this

3237
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:29,440
is they can be as small as the sun bonnet trio?

3238
02:19:29,440 --> 02:19:30,440
Perhaps that's correct.

3239
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:31,440
Oh here we go.

3240
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:32,960
Let's see here.

3241
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:33,960
It is unclear.

3242
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:35,960
I think these are not people.

3243
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:38,440
I think these are like these are I don't know if you can see this.

3244
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:43,240
These are the country bears suits people in those but then hanging from the ceiling it

3245
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:45,720
looks like it could possibly just be like dummies.

3246
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:47,320
Okay.

3247
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:49,320
You really concern me when you said they aren't people.

3248
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:51,840
I was picturing some like a dog in a suit.

3249
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:57,360
Well or something like you know if you like some country like needed gymnasts so bad that

3250
02:19:57,360 --> 02:20:02,920
they like bred a species that are tall smaller and sleeker than a human could ever be so

3251
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:09,640
they could win all the gold medals bred a human with a mule.

3252
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:12,800
They cracked it to get the mule out of its dead end.

3253
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:14,240
Yeah.

3254
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:17,120
So we got to look into this because this is a nightmare.

3255
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:20,600
This whole thing was just scrubbing through it is a nightmare.

3256
02:20:20,600 --> 02:20:21,600
It was great.

3257
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:24,440
I remember how much it scared me in view master.

3258
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:25,840
Yeah I'm sure it did.

3259
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:28,360
But I kind of would keep doing it.

3260
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:30,800
It scared me but I like needed to process it.

3261
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:34,320
Yeah yeah it was a good kind of scary kind.

3262
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:36,120
So yeah Disney on parade.

3263
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:37,120
Okay okay.

3264
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:41,480
I well what have we missed?

3265
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:46,520
I mean besides all the other stuff we're going to talk about throughout the week.

3266
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:49,480
I any other moments numbers characters.

3267
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:53,480
Yeah I'm looking through here.

3268
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:59,440
And by the way I yeah I'm looking at the merch display that I saw in Japan and I think there's

3269
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:01,560
no big L representation.

3270
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:08,440
But there's a massive there's so much merch but I think it's Sunbonnets and Henry and

3271
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:13,560
Teddy all in different sizes and a cute little display of them all together.

3272
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:17,840
I'm trying to remember if I got I think I bought Henry I think there's a Henry around

3273
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:21,800
some with the raccoon with Sammy popping out of his hat.

3274
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:26,800
So they're covered on the and good for Tokyo again this is so well positioned in Tokyo

3275
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:30,600
it seems like a perfect crazy thing to be in Japan.

3276
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:35,240
A weird robot show full of darkness and sensuality.

3277
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:41,560
Yeah there's been so many rumors of this thing going away in Disney World.

3278
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:49,280
It has survived up until now but I am more I am still thinking like luckily every like

3279
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:52,800
they're so slow at building anything I think we probably have to at least 10 more years

3280
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:53,800
of it.

3281
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:57,040
Yeah I mean it was very popular the day I was there.

3282
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:02,740
It helps that it's adjacent to Pirates of the Caribbean Splash Mountain Big Thunder

3283
02:22:02,740 --> 02:22:07,960
Mountain like there's so much in the area that you likely need to wait for or need to

3284
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:10,680
do something in between or afterwards.

3285
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:18,600
I just want to say real quick the the changes done in 2012 banter cut down fractured folk

3286
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:21,280
song was the big one that was removed.

3287
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:25,680
Pretty Little Devilish Mary right is the name of the other song that was removed and then

3288
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:30,680
if he can't bite don't growl was moved up in the lineup.

3289
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:36,360
Yeah but you can hear the full version of the show and that old record that is is you

3290
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:39,600
can buy digital copies of now.

3291
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:44,280
It's on Spotify too but I think only some of the songs are playable.

3292
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:45,840
It's yeah you can't do the full full.

3293
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:47,280
It's on Apple Music.

3294
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:49,240
You could listen to the whole chunk.

3295
02:22:49,240 --> 02:22:50,880
But for some reason that's not on there anymore.

3296
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:54,360
I don't know why you can be a buy it or it's just it's still on YouTube.

3297
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:56,400
Somebody ripped it and put on YouTube.

3298
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:57,400
So listen to it.

3299
02:22:57,400 --> 02:23:03,440
Yeah there but I do think I do think this is unless they come up with a TV show or movie

3300
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:07,160
this thing is gone and within within the decade in here.

3301
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:09,040
I think in Tokyo it'll last.

3302
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:10,040
Sure.

3303
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:11,040
Yeah.

3304
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:18,520
But it's in a weird spot like you exit in in Orlando you exit into a rest to a restaurant.

3305
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:23,960
So like they'd have to like shut that down like a pretty busy quick service restaurant

3306
02:23:23,960 --> 02:23:27,440
and you don't get I feel like you don't get a lot of room back.

3307
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:29,320
It's kind of in a busy area.

3308
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:30,320
I mean yeah.

3309
02:23:30,320 --> 02:23:31,320
Florida.

3310
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:32,600
Yeah but that doesn't mean they're not going to do they wouldn't do that.

3311
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:35,320
I mean the rumor was a couple years ago was it was going to be a toy story they're going

3312
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:37,560
to turn into a toy story show of some kind.

3313
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:40,480
Some like Mary and then round up sort of.

3314
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:41,480
Yeah.

3315
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:42,480
Sounds fun.

3316
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:43,480
Don't get me wrong.

3317
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:48,480
But yeah but like the idea of losing this that we love and enjoy for it like you just

3318
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:50,000
want them both to exist.

3319
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Sure.

3320
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Yeah.

3321
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
If possible.

3322
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:57,440
So Disneyland I think the what you're saying about how it's an odd space in Disney World

3323
02:23:57,440 --> 02:24:00,680
and how do you really get it out of there and how much space do you really gain from

3324
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:01,680
it.

3325
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:04,680
Again it comes into Disneyland with the two theaters.

3326
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:05,680
Yeah.

3327
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:08,000
It's not filling those two theaters pretty quickly.

3328
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,440
I think by the 90s they are discussing how do we get that space back and do something

3329
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:14,440
else with it.

3330
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:15,440
It just never.

3331
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:17,200
And maybe there's something to the music of it too.

3332
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:22,400
Maybe they were right with that calculation that country music's bigger in Florida and

3333
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:23,400
less so in California.

3334
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:26,000
It just was never the blockbuster here that they wanted it to be.

3335
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Yeah.

3336
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,360
And it's also I can't remember if I heard Tony Baxter say this or somebody else say

3337
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:30,360
this.

3338
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:38,080
So since Disneyland is such a local crowd you don't go to a show that's the same often

3339
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:40,400
as often as tourists would.

3340
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:41,400
Absolutely.

3341
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:44,520
So like if you're there's a lot more tourists in Florida so they're going to they're more

3342
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:50,760
likely to see that show versus like how often would I be seeing the Country Bear show if

3343
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:51,760
it was still here.

3344
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:55,920
I'm sure a couple times a year especially if they were doing the multiple versions but

3345
02:24:55,920 --> 02:25:00,200
yeah that's another thing that hurt it especially with two theaters.

3346
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:05,720
Yeah was what you were saying before like one theater didn't change a land around to

3347
02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:08,600
make it theme to that.

3348
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:10,320
Maybe it's still there.

3349
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:16,600
Yeah but it's smaller more less of a burden of what it has to support and the amount of

3350
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:18,880
crowd it's supposed to eat up.

3351
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:23,560
So I think and being that it's such a big building they start talking about I think

3352
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:28,920
this building is big enough to get a ride in but there are all of these great animatronics.

3353
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:34,200
Can we do something else with them right leading to a pitch of an attraction called the Critter

3354
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:36,080
Country 500.

3355
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:38,720
Yeah not aware of this before this week.

3356
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:39,720
Yeah.

3357
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:40,720
So great.

3358
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:43,480
A couple photos of this.

3359
02:25:43,480 --> 02:25:50,680
So this would have been that the broader name Critter Country 500 because the area got renamed

3360
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:52,640
when Splash Mountain moved in.

3361
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:55,800
But basically this is a little like race and ride.

3362
02:25:55,800 --> 02:26:02,160
Like there's they show kids in a car that says Bearcat Racer and it's made of barrels

3363
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:05,760
and wood and it's falling apart and there's a weird stove powering it.

3364
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:08,160
Like great idea for a vehicle.

3365
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:10,200
This all feels very Knott's Berry Farm.

3366
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:12,560
Yeah like wacky Soapbox Racers.

3367
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:17,000
Wacky Soapbox Racers or Berry Tales for sure.

3368
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,340
Kind of like Kooky and Psychedelic but it's hard to picture them.

3369
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:23,000
The 90s is like as late as they're going to do something this weird.

3370
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:26,440
They didn't do it then so they didn't do it at all.

3371
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:31,640
Henry is on the radio calling the ESBN.

3372
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:32,640
Yeah.

3373
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:35,240
The Sports Bear Network.

3374
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:36,240
That's really great.

3375
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:38,960
The Sammy the Raccoon's in his hat.

3376
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:42,120
He's waving a flag.

3377
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:45,760
Like crazy contraptions being operated.

3378
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:48,120
What's the thing where all the Hanna Barbera characters race?

3379
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:49,120
Wacky Races?

3380
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:50,120
Yeah yeah.

3381
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:51,120
It seems so much like that.

3382
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:57,720
In the spirit of that this is a vehicle with a pig up front in goggles like protecting

3383
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:58,720
him from the wind.

3384
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:03,080
This is the most like claptrap made out of a train engine.

3385
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:04,080
It's bizarre.

3386
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:07,760
It's being operated by two cranks by one of the bears.

3387
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:09,440
Handsome Gomer is driving.

3388
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:12,760
Gomer who can get it can also get it on the road.

3389
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:18,600
He's kind of like got a Mad Magazine Sergio Argonis vibe to it.

3390
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:19,600
Very much so.

3391
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:21,200
It's like fun chaotic.

3392
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:24,280
A lot of details.

3393
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:29,120
This is is this Liver Lips who's just blowing giant overalls.

3394
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:31,720
He has a big sail made out of overalls.

3395
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:34,480
I hadn't meditated on what's actually happening in these photos.

3396
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:35,480
They're fantastic.

3397
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:36,480
Yeah.

3398
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:40,400
It's being held up by a broom and there's an outhouse that's part of the car.

3399
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:42,480
So I don't know if you're racing against the bears.

3400
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:46,080
You're just kind of it's you're alongside probably and you know they probably let you

3401
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:47,640
win because you're a guest.

3402
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:48,840
You would think.

3403
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:56,120
But this seems like a weird like a kooky proto Radiator Springs racers that reuses the animatronics

3404
02:27:56,120 --> 02:27:57,400
puts them in a different light.

3405
02:27:57,400 --> 02:28:00,600
I mean this seems like a great unbuilt attraction.

3406
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:01,600
Oh yeah.

3407
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:02,600
What a dream.

3408
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:03,600
But it didn't happen.

3409
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:09,000
Of course they discovered there is a critter who needed representation.

3410
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,560
Representation on the merch front.

3411
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:15,640
A bear even a fellow who stabbed other bears in the back.

3412
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:22,240
Alia Kazan affairs named names.

3413
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:23,240
That's right.

3414
02:28:23,240 --> 02:28:27,000
A man took yet took bodies.

3415
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:31,080
The the mounted animal heads are in his ride.

3416
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:32,080
That's right.

3417
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:33,080
Yeah kept them.

3418
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:34,080
Yeah.

3419
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:35,080
No they're staying here.

3420
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:36,080
They're my prisoners now.

3421
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:39,360
Winnie the Pooh moved in and if you didn't know all this time we were talking about this

3422
02:28:39,360 --> 02:28:44,800
this this show was in the space where the Winnie the Pooh attraction is now in Disneyland.

3423
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:47,280
It's hard for me to hate on Winnie the Pooh at this point.

3424
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:48,560
I love Winnie the Pooh growing up.

3425
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:50,760
I've started to show my son Winnie the Pooh.

3426
02:28:50,760 --> 02:28:52,480
Winnie the Pooh is in my heart recently.

3427
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:56,000
I'm excited to take him on that ride maybe in the near future.

3428
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,800
But we'll you know we'll talk about that ride down the road.

3429
02:28:58,800 --> 02:28:59,800
I like the ride.

3430
02:28:59,800 --> 02:29:06,280
Is it worth losing this beloved like theme park IP specific for.

3431
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:07,760
I don't know if it is.

3432
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:12,680
No because it's a little off the shelf when you're also talking about broken dreams of

3433
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:16,600
the Winnie the Pooh ride there is a version of it that was a water ride.

3434
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:22,400
There was like a little like a rapids and a flume ride that was tame that kids could

3435
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:28,020
do where you're in a honey pot and it's floating because you're along the rivers of America.

3436
02:29:28,020 --> 02:29:30,520
So there would have been like a little drop off of that hill.

3437
02:29:30,520 --> 02:29:31,520
Oh wow.

3438
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:34,680
Down into the river for a second and that sounds like a better ride than what we got

3439
02:29:34,680 --> 02:29:36,480
which a little bit of a stock.

3440
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:38,080
I don't think it's anybody's favorite.

3441
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:39,280
It's fine.

3442
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:45,000
It's not as bad as everybody makes it seem but I always come off all smiles on that.

3443
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:49,800
Yeah but it's still like OK but kind of a lateral like I think they thought they had

3444
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:52,400
a hit and maybe short term they did.

3445
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:57,200
But I think now you look back and you look at Mr. Toad and country bears and you look

3446
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:02,480
at poo and it's like you look out wise it's a it's a lateral move and you look at the

3447
02:30:02,480 --> 02:30:07,560
Tokyo version and you look at yeah yeah they have a better poo ride and country bears still

3448
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:09,480
intact the dream scenario.

3449
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:11,400
It's the dream realized yeah.

3450
02:30:11,400 --> 02:30:15,840
Yeah it's why that I think that Tokyo Park is underrated as a magic kingdom.

3451
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:17,480
It's a strong magic kingdom.

3452
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:18,480
Yeah for sure.

3453
02:30:18,480 --> 02:30:21,360
Just for those reasons alone.

3454
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:29,720
And what the Southern California fan base now is of like nostalgia and I feel like the

3455
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:34,160
people really into it if you get them going they'll go like yeah country can't believe

3456
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:36,080
they got rid of country bears you know.

3457
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:37,080
Sure.

3458
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:43,040
Yeah there's been many fan requests or fan whatever you would call it blue sky of like

3459
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:46,120
put the country bears on grizzly river rapids.

3460
02:30:46,120 --> 02:30:49,160
Yeah no idea if that was actually an idea they ever talked about.

3461
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:50,160
You say don't know.

3462
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:51,160
The characters show up around there.

3463
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:52,160
They're hanging out around there.

3464
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:54,160
But it's not going to happen now.

3465
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:56,440
Yeah there's probably no way it happens now.

3466
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:57,800
I don't think the robots exist.

3467
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:59,800
I don't think they're all sitting somewhere.

3468
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:00,800
No no no no.

3469
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:01,800
No.

3470
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:02,800
They would indicate if they were sitting.

3471
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:10,120
I saw a thing that the mechanics for swinging teddy bear are used for poo and the hot air

3472
02:31:10,120 --> 02:31:11,120
balloon going up and down.

3473
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:12,600
Yes I had no idea of that.

3474
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:14,760
That's a pretty clever reuse.

3475
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:16,760
That's cool.

3476
02:31:16,760 --> 02:31:21,720
It's a pretty famous fact as was said but the if you're on the Winnie the Pooh ride

3477
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:26,440
the mounted heads Melvin Buff and Max you can see them.

3478
02:31:26,440 --> 02:31:31,660
It's right before the honey room and on the way out of heffalumps and woozles.

3479
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:35,000
Good thing to impress some pseudo impress somebody that you're with.

3480
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:36,280
I can never see them.

3481
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:37,280
I always try.

3482
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:38,600
I always miss it.

3483
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:40,720
I feel like I'm always I'm never sure.

3484
02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:42,200
I'm like is this it.

3485
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:43,600
And I think I look out and get it.

3486
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:44,600
It's a little dark.

3487
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:45,600
It's a little tough to see.

3488
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:47,560
I don't know exactly the spot but I like that.

3489
02:31:47,560 --> 02:31:49,960
I like that they kept them there.

3490
02:31:49,960 --> 02:31:53,240
And it's in the you got to know where that it's a particular angle.

3491
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:54,560
That's a pretty good.

3492
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:57,120
Well a very good Disney Easter egg.

3493
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:58,680
But of course you wish they were around.

3494
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:03,720
Why can't they still be talking in one of those shops next door.

3495
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:07,280
There's no reason they have to be off.

3496
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:08,280
Keep them alive.

3497
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:11,560
But there be a whatever 19th century magic was.

3498
02:32:11,560 --> 02:32:12,560
Yeah right.

3499
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:14,760
Drawings in the Hungry Bear restaurant.

3500
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:15,760
OK.

3501
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:17,560
Not a ton of representation there.

3502
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:18,560
Right.

3503
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:19,560
Certainly drawings.

3504
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:20,560
Yeah.

3505
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:22,480
So they have this plan.

3506
02:32:22,480 --> 02:32:25,880
We're going to get rid of this.

3507
02:32:25,880 --> 02:32:29,440
But the Country Bear Theater turned it into Winnie the Pooh.

3508
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:34,760
Country Bear Jamboree's last day of operation in Disneyland September 9th 2001.

3509
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:35,760
What did they know.

3510
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:36,760
What did they know.

3511
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:37,760
We got to get out of town.

3512
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:38,760
We got to get out of town.

3513
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:43,240
This shit's going to hit the fan in the cities.

3514
02:32:43,240 --> 02:32:44,840
We're going to head back to the holler.

3515
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:49,160
That's Bob Iger resigning like a week before Covid started.

3516
02:32:49,160 --> 02:32:51,080
That's like if you and that's not a little fishy.

3517
02:32:51,080 --> 02:32:52,080
Look it up folks.

3518
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:56,400
It's like a week before everything shuts down Bob Iger's like I'm out.

3519
02:32:56,400 --> 02:33:01,840
Hey Zeke and Zeb we still got that underground bomb shelter.

3520
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:02,840
Yeah.

3521
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:03,840
Who?

3522
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:04,840
Calpac Clint Texas.

3523
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:08,360
Hey Tennessee Bear you're getting a call from Langley Virginia.

3524
02:33:08,360 --> 02:33:13,880
You know anything about that?

3525
02:33:13,880 --> 02:33:14,880
We're not telling.

3526
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:17,600
We know even if we do know something we ain't telling.

3527
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:20,760
Some weird sign ups for flight school I've been reading about.

3528
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:22,280
Bush White House is calling.

3529
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:26,480
You getting a call from the switchboard of Bush White House?

3530
02:33:26,480 --> 02:33:28,480
Scooter Libby was one of the bears right?

3531
02:33:28,480 --> 02:33:29,760
Yeah Scooter Libby.

3532
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:33,000
George W used to jam with us.

3533
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,000
He goes way back.

3534
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:37,680
We haven't seen Big Al in a while but he was muttering about jet fuel not melting steel

3535
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:38,680
beams on the way out.

3536
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:39,880
We didn't know what that meant.

3537
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:45,840
We jammed with John Huntsman and Mike Huckabee too.

3538
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,040
We get a whole thing going here.

3539
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:51,640
I'm telling you September 2001 shit's gonna hit the fan.

3540
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:54,000
The twin theaters are gonna go down.

3541
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Oh God.

3542
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:00,240
Our two theater we got two theaters for the Jamboree.

3543
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:01,240
It happened.

3544
02:34:01,240 --> 02:34:02,240
It did happen.

3545
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:07,360
Also a weird like you think of Disney as like a real corporate synergy like divisions knowing

3546
02:34:07,360 --> 02:34:10,360
what others are doing sometimes not knowing what they're doing.

3547
02:34:10,360 --> 02:34:14,800
But the movie was they everyone knew the movie was coming in 2002.

3548
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:19,040
You'd think they would have given the theater another year to like.

3549
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:23,600
How does it hurt them to keep it around to plug and this is not now they're trying to

3550
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:27,640
get as much IP out of the parks as they can and there's a billion other ways to promote

3551
02:34:27,640 --> 02:34:28,720
things.

3552
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:33,960
But like this is at this point in time the first or second major movie made out of a

3553
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:35,320
theme park attraction.

3554
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:40,800
Do you not want to keep said attraction open with a sign at the end that says if you liked

3555
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:42,880
this maybe you'll like the movie.

3556
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:44,240
Now that would have been a lie.

3557
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:46,600
They probably wouldn't have liked the movie.

3558
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:48,600
We'll find out soon enough.

3559
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:49,600
Yeah.

3560
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:52,880
You would think you would think that would have made sense.

3561
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:53,880
But no.

3562
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:56,840
Yeah I guess I guess no one was paying attention.

3563
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:58,160
I don't know.

3564
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:04,080
So strange and as this movie comes out and just flounders just eats it just did not too

3565
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:05,420
well at all.

3566
02:35:05,420 --> 02:35:06,420
Do you not think.

3567
02:35:06,420 --> 02:35:09,400
Well you know I have an idea.

3568
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:13,960
There's a place that we own that thousands people go through every day.

3569
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:14,960
Yeah.

3570
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:18,160
Maybe we could keep our living advertisement for this movie there.

3571
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:19,720
Was there anything in Florida.

3572
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:20,720
Do we know.

3573
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:26,480
Was there any sort of ad for I mean well maybe if if we talk about the movie we'll look into

3574
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:29,200
that because I'm wondering is there a flyer outside.

3575
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:34,520
I think it's also interesting just in the sense of I think Country Bears is like Pirates

3576
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:40,200
or Haunted Mansion or Space Mountain where it becomes a shorthand for either Disney World

3577
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:42,520
Disneyland or theme parks at large.

3578
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:43,520
Yeah.

3579
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:48,680
There's a lot of reference in the popular popular consciousness popular culture to this

3580
02:35:48,680 --> 02:35:50,560
attraction.

3581
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:52,360
So to like shut it down.

3582
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:57,420
It does feel yeah I think like to a person who doesn't have theme parks memorized to

3583
02:35:57,420 --> 02:36:00,840
a John Lennon who probably didn't go terribly often.

3584
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:01,840
Right.

3585
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:04,240
I think your vague sense of like what's Disney World.

3586
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:08,200
Well there's a castle and there's tea cups and there's the country bear jamboree.

3587
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:10,960
It is a thing where a bunch of bears sing songs.

3588
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:18,680
It does oddly feels like a Disney tent pole even if it hasn't been treated as such and

3589
02:36:18,680 --> 02:36:20,640
yeah he isn't to a lot of people.

3590
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:25,800
I feel like there was a point in time where it was Mr. Toad's wild ride country bears

3591
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:27,040
pirates.

3592
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:32,200
I even think like phrases that right like to that like jump out at you more.

3593
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:34,360
Nobody would call it the utopia.

3594
02:36:34,360 --> 02:36:39,560
Nobody uses the real term man tea party but I think the phrase is Pirates of the Caribbean

3595
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:43,720
and country where jamboree are so weird they like stick with people.

3596
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:44,720
Yeah.

3597
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:45,720
Went even if they don't care.

3598
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:49,280
I would think actually probably if you were pulling people more people would know country

3599
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,200
bear jamboree than tea room.

3600
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:52,200
Yeah.

3601
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:53,200
Yeah.

3602
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:54,200
Maybe so.

3603
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:55,200
And yet you know what is weird about it.

3604
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:56,720
I was gonna bring this up.

3605
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:59,880
I don't know that there's like the hit single you know what I mean.

3606
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:01,320
You know the Tiki room.

3607
02:37:01,320 --> 02:37:02,720
So I see what you're saying.

3608
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:04,120
No great big beautiful tomorrow.

3609
02:37:04,120 --> 02:37:09,040
That's the only song in the fit but like yeah these songs are all good but there isn't

3610
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:10,040
the one.

3611
02:37:10,040 --> 02:37:12,280
Well, the Crockett but that was a hit on it.

3612
02:37:12,280 --> 02:37:14,800
So that was a huge hit for you.

3613
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:15,800
Yeah.

3614
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:21,680
But there's not like here's the I would maybe say great outdoors maybe but it was only one.

3615
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:25,720
I think that hurts it a little bit too that there isn't the small world.

3616
02:37:25,720 --> 02:37:26,720
You probably right.

3617
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:27,720
Yeah worm.

3618
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:29,920
There is something up to that I think.

3619
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:33,080
Songs are all good again but it's not like great I would say but you're right.

3620
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:34,880
It's not it's missing its hit.

3621
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:39,960
I told the families did not come out of the park they like drove in from Arizona and on

3622
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:42,280
their way back home they're all singing.

3623
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:45,760
Yeah that's true.

3624
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:48,340
That's a very good point that I think is right.

3625
02:37:48,340 --> 02:37:53,560
When I had not been there in a while then went back around the time you did Mike.

3626
02:37:53,560 --> 02:38:02,520
I thought the transition from the Davy Crockett song to old slew foot is pretty smooth.

3627
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:05,600
Like I thought like wait is this a verse of the Davy Crockett song.

3628
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:06,600
Yes I agree.

3629
02:38:06,600 --> 02:38:07,600
I thought that too.

3630
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:08,600
Yeah.

3631
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:14,000
Because it's just so so like slick the way those two transition and then blood on the

3632
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:19,280
saddle also still going in the background like pairs pairs with all of those kind of get

3633
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:21,320
meshed together in a big finale.

3634
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:28,000
I also just like to encourage the future use of old slew foot as a nickname for Jason Sheridan.

3635
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:36,360
I did there there is a term I did look up the meaning of that old slew foot.

3636
02:38:36,360 --> 02:38:39,840
Oh God.

3637
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:46,520
Someone a someone treat lover who gets exhausted walking through theme parks readily.

3638
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:49,280
Oh yeah.

3639
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:51,360
Having big clumsy or turned out feet.

3640
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:56,160
Well I haven't told my feet like tilt a little like I'm trying to correct that.

3641
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:57,160
Oh sure.

3642
02:38:57,160 --> 02:39:01,400
Oh mind you too actually I had cast when I was a child I guess I'm the slew foot.

3643
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:06,000
Oh my sister had cast too and like sad hard saddle shoes with a connected with like a piece

3644
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
of metal.

3645
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,920
I hope there was never blood on the saddle.

3646
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:10,920
Blood all around.

3647
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:14,400
I don't have the saddle shoes.

3648
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:15,800
She kicked me with them.

3649
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:18,060
Yes my blood.

3650
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:23,100
One thing also to say in terms of how the country bears are represented in the parks

3651
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:29,080
to this day Oogie Boogie in Haunted Mansion Holiday is big Al.

3652
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:31,240
He was de skinned.

3653
02:39:31,240 --> 02:39:34,120
His organs were removed and he was turned.

3654
02:39:34,120 --> 02:39:35,840
He was a large ghost.

3655
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:41,560
On his driver's license though he was a donor so it's okay.

3656
02:39:41,560 --> 02:39:50,080
I would love to see Oogie Boogie program to say that puddle like I always love that delivery

3657
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:51,080
of puddle.

3658
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:52,080
Puddle.

3659
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:53,080
Yeah.

3660
02:39:53,080 --> 02:40:00,320
Yeah so I would be interested I'm sure there's plenty of like parts because they just sub

3661
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:03,320
out parts of animatronics all the time from my understanding.

3662
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:09,040
So you could have like Zeb's shoulder is somewhere.

3663
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:10,040
In Millard Fillmore.

3664
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:11,040
Yeah.

3665
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:12,040
The whole presidents.

3666
02:40:12,040 --> 02:40:15,840
They're like oh shit we need to oh yeah just take it out of Zeb.

3667
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:21,560
Poor Zeb is like half half like not even there half missing.

3668
02:40:21,560 --> 02:40:22,560
Really depressing probably.

3669
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:27,720
We were yeah Jane and I were talking about that we were in Florida of like what is preserved

3670
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:33,200
what is safe because I saw pictures from that destination D23 event they did recently and

3671
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:36,160
they had the dream finder like machine.

3672
02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:37,160
Yeah.

3673
02:40:37,160 --> 02:40:41,840
And and we're always trying to figure out what was demolished what was you know stripped

3674
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:44,840
for parts and what was just you know.

3675
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:47,000
I was thinking about how annoying that actually is to me.

3676
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:50,760
I love seeing that dream finder thing but it's such bullshit that they just bring that

3677
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:52,040
stuff out at conventions.

3678
02:40:52,040 --> 02:40:54,040
They're like hey remember this.

3679
02:40:54,040 --> 02:40:55,800
Yeah we do this at any time.

3680
02:40:55,800 --> 02:40:57,560
Anytime we just put it back in the right one.

3681
02:40:57,560 --> 02:41:00,680
We're not we're just going to put it in a fucking showroom.

3682
02:41:00,680 --> 02:41:01,680
Enjoy it here.

3683
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:05,120
We know by the way we know you want it.

3684
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:09,440
Like this is the thing with D23 and anytime they trot all this stuff out we know you want

3685
02:41:09,440 --> 02:41:10,440
this.

3686
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:11,440
Yeah.

3687
02:41:11,440 --> 02:41:12,440
But this is all you're getting.

3688
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:16,120
We know the dream finder is from a park that is mostly construction walls.

3689
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:17,360
Yeah.

3690
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:23,360
But we know that we have gutted his ride to turn it into the worst ride that exists perhaps

3691
02:41:23,360 --> 02:41:24,360
on the planet.

3692
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:25,360
We know.

3693
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:26,960
We know it.

3694
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:31,120
But the good news is we are now selling t-shirts that look like the construction walls.

3695
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:32,120
So pretty good.

3696
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:33,120
It's got the stripes.

3697
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:34,120
People are going to be nostalgic for him someday.

3698
02:41:34,120 --> 02:41:38,560
They're going to miss the yeah they're going to miss the stripes on the walls.

3699
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:41,360
So yeah they they they know.

3700
02:41:41,360 --> 02:41:43,520
That's what it's doing to me that they know.

3701
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:54,560
And that's why yeah look Gomer's foot shouldn't just be turned into Andrew Carnegie's right

3702
02:41:54,560 --> 02:41:59,200
elbow in American Adventure.

3703
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:01,280
These are not interchangeable.

3704
02:42:01,280 --> 02:42:08,520
These are perfect characters who sing pretty songs, catchy songs, honest songs, songs about

3705
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:13,720
their experiences, about all the blood they've seen and all the moonshine they've drank.

3706
02:42:13,720 --> 02:42:14,720
Yes.

3707
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:19,880
This is one of the most honest raw pieces of theme park entertainment that exists.

3708
02:42:19,880 --> 02:42:25,360
And if yeah and if look it sucks but like if you need if they to exist they need to

3709
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:28,560
sing fancy like and Red Solo Cup.

3710
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:29,560
That should be the case.

3711
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:30,560
They should do that.

3712
02:42:30,560 --> 02:42:31,560
I'm fine with them.

3713
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:32,560
It's on you.

3714
02:42:32,560 --> 02:42:35,640
Keep your eyes on the country contemporary charts.

3715
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:36,640
Yes.

3716
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:42,360
I have some goofy voiced guys sing it with an occasionally change words into bear.

3717
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:47,960
Yeah Zeekers somebody or Henry singing like lyrics of Chicken Fried about a cold beer

3718
02:42:47,960 --> 02:42:52,760
on a Friday night and the touch of jeans that fit a pair of jeans that fit this right in

3719
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:55,000
the touch of a precious child.

3720
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:58,940
All the things that the character that Zach Brown loves that he says in that song Chicken

3721
02:42:58,940 --> 02:42:59,940
Fried.

3722
02:42:59,940 --> 02:43:04,520
We definitely spent some time examining like what does he mean the touch of a precious

3723
02:43:04,520 --> 02:43:05,520
child.

3724
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:10,400
It's just such an odd for it not in there's anything on toward just that it's like it's

3725
02:43:10,400 --> 02:43:11,400
such an odd thing.

3726
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:14,400
I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think

3727
02:43:14,400 --> 02:43:19,080
ten years ago to my friend's wedding is just I was I was making fun of that song and she's

3728
02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:22,800
like I like that so I go but let's let's listen to the lyrics without the words and I said

3729
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:25,320
I just said them to I go doesn't that sound like if you were on a date with a guy and

3730
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:29,520
he was like you know what one of my favorite things is the touch of a precious child you'd

3731
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:30,520
be like oh God.

3732
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:32,520
And she's like yeah you're right.

3733
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:36,920
It's like I do agree that's a weird lyric out of that context extremely creepy.

3734
02:43:36,920 --> 02:43:37,920
Okay.

3735
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:39,640
So maybe we don't do that one do fine.

3736
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:42,080
Look I'm just Googling country songs do.

3737
02:43:42,080 --> 02:43:44,800
I was on a boat that day by Old Dominion.

3738
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:45,800
Fantastic.

3739
02:43:45,800 --> 02:43:47,160
I see the thumbnail on Vivo.

3740
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:50,120
They're all on about this five of them just like the bear rugs.

3741
02:43:50,120 --> 02:43:51,880
The parts are already divvied up.

3742
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:57,880
You just have to make one part for a single string bass and turn one guitar into a jug.

3743
02:43:57,880 --> 02:43:59,100
Stop being lazy.

3744
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:00,540
The songs you need are there.

3745
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:05,440
They're on the album Time Tequila and Therapy by Old Dominion.

3746
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:08,320
Just get busy bearifying it you lazy imagineers.

3747
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:09,320
Oh yeah.

3748
02:44:09,320 --> 02:44:13,840
I want to light up Lake Nona with this call.

3749
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:19,020
Just get him you know you know who's bored and not doing anything is that rockafire creep.

3750
02:44:19,020 --> 02:44:20,520
Get him on it.

3751
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:21,520
Wait no don't.

3752
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:22,520
No no.

3753
02:44:22,520 --> 02:44:28,840
All right well ask him if he knows a less creepy animatronic guy and yeah steal a phone

3754
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:34,640
number if the rockafire explosion could be reprogrammed so easily for too many music

3755
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:37,720
videos then why not do it with the country bears.

3756
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:44,760
Yeah get one song past the year 1980 into that thing and maybe you'll start packing

3757
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:47,440
the crowds in again.

3758
02:44:47,440 --> 02:44:52,040
Well the only thing that we can do is keep the country bears relevant and you know what's

3759
02:44:52,040 --> 02:45:00,680
a good way to do that is by having America's hottest theme park podcast.

3760
02:45:00,680 --> 02:45:01,680
That's true though right.

3761
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:02,680
Yeah that's right.

3762
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:03,680
We are the hottest.

3763
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:06,080
Well I can't think of anything that would.

3764
02:45:06,080 --> 02:45:08,920
That's a pretty specific word.

3765
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:13,120
It's a narrow category so why not put ourselves as kings of that hill.

3766
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:17,040
Podcast the ride is no longer hot.

3767
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:18,040
That's where he lost my vote.

3768
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:19,040
Yeah.

3769
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:20,040
When he called out our podcast.

3770
02:45:20,040 --> 02:45:23,760
You can go after grace and Carter whatever the hell his name is all day.

3771
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:25,480
You don't come after us.

3772
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:27,440
Say what you want about that.

3773
02:45:27,440 --> 02:45:28,440
Greed and Carter.

3774
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:29,440
Yeah.

3775
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:36,080
We breathe our souls into this very hot theme park podcast and what we're going to do all

3776
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:43,360
week long is keep the country bears relevant and I think after what we do with this week

3777
02:45:43,360 --> 02:45:45,480
you know I think it might be a different story.

3778
02:45:45,480 --> 02:45:50,920
I think 2022 is going to look very different for these 50 year old bears because if you

3779
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:57,920
didn't get enough out of this what the amount of time episode almost 250 Jesus really.

3780
02:45:57,920 --> 02:45:58,920
Yeah.

3781
02:45:58,920 --> 02:45:59,920
You know.

3782
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:00,920
Okay.

3783
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:05,000
Well then let's not wrap this thing up forever.

3784
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Wow.

3785
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Okay.

3786
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:11,640
So if that didn't give you your fill of the country bears then the week certainly will

3787
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:12,640
not done.

3788
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:13,640
We got more.

3789
02:46:13,640 --> 02:46:14,640
Can you believe it.

3790
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:19,360
You survived day one of country bear chamber week.

3791
02:46:19,360 --> 02:46:21,440
I'm really questioning what are we doing.

3792
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:22,440
Yeah.

3793
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:23,440
I don't know.

3794
02:46:23,440 --> 02:46:24,440
It's a little silly.

3795
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:27,080
I'll say that was that.

3796
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:28,720
It's nearly three hours enough.

3797
02:46:28,720 --> 02:46:29,720
Hell no.

3798
02:46:29,720 --> 02:46:30,720
No.

3799
02:46:30,720 --> 02:46:32,560
We got vacation overlays to talk about.

3800
02:46:32,560 --> 02:46:34,880
We got feature films to talk about.

3801
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:39,400
There's all kinds of odd manifestations of this attraction and we're going to keep going.

3802
02:46:39,400 --> 02:46:40,400
We're going to keep deep diving.

3803
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:43,040
So you survived night one.

3804
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:44,040
Stay tuned.

3805
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:45,040
We haven't said this in a long time.

3806
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:46,040
We'll be back tomorrow.

3807
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:47,040
Oh yeah.

3808
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:49,440

And if you aren't sick of content from us in general I now get to start plugging Saturday

3814
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:11,240
morning all star hits on Netflix.

3815
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:15,960
The new show from Kyle Mooney with a little help from me eight episodes streaming on Netflix

3816
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:20,680
right now at this point with this amount of podcasts and that show going you have no excuse

3817
02:47:20,680 --> 02:47:23,400
but to only absorb content from us.

3818
02:47:23,400 --> 02:47:24,400
Yeah.

3819
02:47:24,400 --> 02:47:25,560
In the next week or so.

3820
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:27,480
This is your whole holiday break folks.

3821
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:28,480
Really.

3822
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:29,760
Unless you're doing it daily.

3823
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:30,760
Yeah.

3824
02:47:30,760 --> 02:47:31,760
Yeah.

3825
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:32,760
You could.

3826
02:47:32,760 --> 02:47:33,760
But we all say I think we're loading you.

3827
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:34,760
This is how we're ending the year.

3828
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:36,200
So we're loading you up with goodies to take home with you.

3829
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:37,200
Yes.

3830
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:38,200
Yeah.

3831
02:47:38,200 --> 02:47:39,200
To your holler.

3832
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:40,200
What are you going to do?

3833
02:47:40,200 --> 02:47:41,200
What?

3834
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:42,200
Come on.

3835
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:43,200
Everyone in America already has.

3836
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:44,200
We already all watched it.

3837
02:47:44,200 --> 02:47:45,200
Seventy million.

3838
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:46,200
We're all.

3839
02:47:46,200 --> 02:47:51,400
We're all embroiled in the tale of Cleopatra's eggs.

3840
02:47:51,400 --> 02:47:53,080
Finding Cleopatra's eggs.

3841
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:56,560
The movie which is the most popular movie of the decade is about.

3842
02:47:56,560 --> 02:47:57,560
Is that what it is?

3843
02:47:57,560 --> 02:47:58,560
Does she lay eggs?

3844
02:47:58,560 --> 02:47:59,560
Yeah.

3845
02:47:59,560 --> 02:48:00,560
Yeah.

3846
02:48:00,560 --> 02:48:01,560
It's about finding.

3847
02:48:01,560 --> 02:48:02,560
I don't know.

3848
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:03,560
It's in the trailer.

3849
02:48:03,560 --> 02:48:04,560
She lays eggs.

3850
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:05,560
Cleopatra lays eggs in this movie?

3851
02:48:05,560 --> 02:48:06,560
Watch the trailer.

3852
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:07,920
The Rock says Cleopatra's eggs.

3853
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:09,920
They've stolen two of Cleopatra's eggs.

3854
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:11,920
Fabricate, like the decorative.

3855
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:12,920
Faberge.

3856
02:48:12,920 --> 02:48:14,760
Faberge, that's what I was looking for.

3857
02:48:14,760 --> 02:48:15,760
Not her leg.

3858
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:16,760
Eggs from her ovaries.

3859
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:21,560
And also in this movie's universe, Cleopatra lays eggs.

3860
02:48:21,560 --> 02:48:23,520
It's a different human.

3861
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:26,040
This movie supposes human beings laid eggs.

3862
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:28,040
It's kind of frozen in previous centuries.

3863
02:48:28,040 --> 02:48:30,360
Well, that's how you bring country bears back.

3864
02:48:30,360 --> 02:48:34,000
Just in the opening of the show, he's like, well, we got to do a little show for you while

3865
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:35,920
we wait for our eggs to hatch.

3866
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:44,520
And everyone just has questions about, wait, why do the bears lay eggs in this show?

3867
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:47,880
So the premise is they play bluegrass music, but also they lay eggs.

3868
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:51,560
So they're freak bears in multiple regards.

3869
02:48:51,560 --> 02:48:53,000
All right.

3870
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,900
So again, no excuse.

3871
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:56,000
Only content from us.

3872
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:57,000
We're giving you plenty.

3873
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:58,960
We'll be back tomorrow.

3874
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:04,640
Y'all come on back now, you hear?

3875
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:07,120
This has been a Forever Dog Production.

3876
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:13,240
Executive produced by Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner, Brett Boehme, Joe

3877
02:49:13,240 --> 02:49:15,840
