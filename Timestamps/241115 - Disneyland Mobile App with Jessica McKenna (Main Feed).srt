1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Warning! The following podcasts may contain

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
surprising sheet cakes,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
eye contact disagreements,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
evil little laughter,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and trivia questions about Walt Disney World drainage situations.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All that plus, Jessica McKenna returns to talk about the Disneyland app

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
on today's podcast, The Ride!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a theme park podcast whose lore is as hard to navigate as the Disneyland app.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi! Yes, very difficult to navigate both.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We have a lot of unnecessary animations that really slows everything down

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and heats your phone up.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah. I was thinking about, I actually was thinking about this.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This joke must have come from the fact that I was listening to Doughboys earlier today.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And I was like, yeah, they don't throw out as many weird references

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that must confuse a new listener.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We're like, there's like, yeah, it's a theme park podcast,

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but they talk about Grandpa Munster a lot.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And there's lore about Grandpa Munster that they are talking about.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What do they mean? I just want to hear about The Ride.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I just want to hear like, does it go fast or slow?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Tell me if it goes fast or slow and if they like it.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let me ask you a question.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is this integrated marketing for Doughboys?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is this like on the office when they would talk about their new HP computer?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So you think I'm advertising for Doughboys right now covertly?

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But trying to make it seamless?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
For our friends. Yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I wish it was doing that because they would be paying us, right?

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's how it works.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Correct. That's how integrated marketing works.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I guess, no, it's not.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm just giving them a free plug and saying their show is funny.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's bring in our guest from the off-book podcast.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I can barely say it because it's so good.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's Jess McKenna is back on the show.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's been ages, Jess. How are you?

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, Jess, welcome back.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, thank you so much for having me.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I have a lot of opinions about Doughboys.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, go ahead, please.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No, I don't.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Love Doughboys.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's good.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Today we do have a very important topic.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And I'm not saying that facetiously.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is a topic that, so Scott is gone.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is an episode that we've been calling it Scott Free.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Here I am getting off.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Scott is on hiatus.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, you're getting off Scott Free.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We've been getting off Scott Free for a few weeks now,

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
being little rascals, talking about all sorts of off-topic things.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Exactly. You get it.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, yeah.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't even need to explain it more.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, no, no.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We do have a little giggle that happens,

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
a fiendish little giggle that happens.

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But people probably will see the title of this episode and think,

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
oh, this is Mike and Jason getting away with something

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
they've wanted to talk about for a long time,

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and Scott has been stopping it.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That is not the case.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Not true.

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is a guest-suggested topic.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah.

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Disneyland app.

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I pitched this.

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You pitched this.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah, I think we talked a couple, like two months ago maybe.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And boy, I was so excited because Scott would be here if he was not on hiatus.

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He would be doing the episode with us.

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But that gave us the license to do it.

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And now people are going to think that we're doing something.

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is not like a recess appointment when Congress is gone

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and we just get to force something through.

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Topical.

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We're at friends, Mike.

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I love talking about recess appointments,

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
even not during the hellish few weeks of politics that we're going through right now.

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm a big recess appointment joke maker.

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I make this reference a lot.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All right.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So I just want to be on the record for liking that joke.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So yeah, you texted and I said, is there anything you want to talk about?

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And you said, Disneyland app.

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It was like the first thing.

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And my heart swelled.

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I was so excited about it because, boy, have I want to talk about this app forever.

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And we've talked about it in little like pieces,

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
but finally we're going to dedicate three, four, five hours,

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
however long it goes to talking about the Disneyland app.

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So yeah, Jess, tell us why this was your choice.

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
OK, so I think, you know, we share.

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I love theme parks and I love Disneyland.

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I love giving people in my life a positive experience at Disneyland.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I take that role very seriously.

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I grew up 15 minutes from Disneyland.

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can hear the fireworks from my childhood home.

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I like grew up with an annual pass, you know, used to go a ton.

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And I've watched like, you know, if people come here from not growing up here

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
or they only got to go to like Disney twice in their whole growing up,

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
whether world or land, and they don't have the like dexterity of knowledge

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
that someone who's gone a bunch has. Right.

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So it falls on you to be the leader because, you know, you have the ability.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But what I have found is that the app is just like I just end up feeling

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
so like handcuffed to this like completely joyless experience with

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
because you were saying when you get the goods, it feels amazing.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah.

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So it's like a double edged sword because obviously it's created like a certain ease

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
because before the app, I was also the person in the party who'd be like,

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
give me all your tickets.

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to sprint to Big Thunder to get us fast passes.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're not going to move through the crowd as well as I will on my own.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You guys take your time in the trail line.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Meet me like meet me back at Star Tours.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll one person getting back through the lines, not the end of the world.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go get in line for Star Tours.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm going to sprint over to get fast passes for Big Thunder.

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You know, I would gamify it that way.

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And that was a little more exciting.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Maybe that was also age, like maybe I was like 17 showing like cousins

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
from out of town around or something like that felt exciting or like my first summer

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
back from college, my college boyfriend came out and I was like,

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
you're not going to believe how well I know my way around here.

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And that, you know, there's a certain pride in being able to do that.

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Pride and be able to be a good guide for disneyland.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
People are like, oh, it's going to be so crowded.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's going to be so tough.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And you're like, hey, I got you.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm going to minimize the negatives and optimize the positives.

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But I think just like everything else in our society, we fall into this like

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
faux trap of maximum optimization that is depriving me of the joy.

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Not to mention that I'm here with my nephews and niece wanting to make glorious

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
memories and I have to have my face down in a phone literally the entire day.

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes, yes.

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That all that rings a lot.

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Very true to me.

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I still feel like on some level I'm the hero of the group and I still feel like

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I went with family a couple of weeks ago and Rise of the Resistance had been

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
closed and all of a sudden we saw it was open and like we now have our daughter

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
with us, but she can't obviously go on that.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
She's not old enough yet.

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But I just start yelling at the family.

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Go, go Rise of the Resistance open now.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll stay behind.

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll watch her.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't worry.

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You haven't done it yet.

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So like I'm still, I feel like I get my like hero moments here and there in the

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
park, but I've always felt like I wanted to be the ambassador because how many

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
times did you run into somebody go, why do you go that often?

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, totally.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And you go, go with me.

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes, you haven't gone with me.

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Exactly.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because like I don't know what it is.

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
My sister like didn't get bit by the bug.

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Like my mom was a great theme park mom.

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This was back when like the only navigation you had to decide was which way you

172
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
started the circle.

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Are you going down mainstream?

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You starting left?

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You starting right?

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know, like that was the big decision.

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And then you worked through the park.

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
However, however you want it.

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I would choose chaos back then.

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Really?

181
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Watch.

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, I would go to, I would like, all right, we're going to tomorrow land and

183
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
then we're going to cross the hub and go to adventure land.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's totally reasonable.

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Just trying to hit.

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're trying.

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Exactly.

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're like, can we sprint to Space Mountain and try to get it and then start our

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
circle the other way?

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes.

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

192
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Totally.

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And my brother and his wife love, love it.

194
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
They going once like in a February break with my brother, his wife and their

195
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
three kids and my mom, they have gone to world a bunch.

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
My sister-in-law was, that's the only time I've gone where I felt like I had a

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
partner in the app where she like knew how to navigate it too.

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This was also right.

200
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Coming out of COVID where you literally couldn't get food without the app.

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Like, yeah.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

203
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So that was also a dark time where you'd be like, seriously, I just want a

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
skewer from Bangle Barbecue and the next opening is three 20.

205
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah.

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And I can't just like walk up and get a skewer.

207
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah.

208
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Remember this?

209
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That was a dark, a dark time.

210
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
One of the darkest parts of the pandemic.

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes.

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Was I just couldn't get a skewer at Bangle Barbecue.

213
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And not to mention you couldn't sit anywhere around there.

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes, right.

215
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You had to kind of roam.

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You had to roam.

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The most annoying thing was going out to cast members and go like, hey, I'm a

218
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
little early, but can I get my skewer?

219
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But they were probably more annoyed by me banging on pots and pans when they

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
delivered the skewer to thank them.

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
They let you bring pots and pans into Disneyland.

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah.

223
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If it's to thank essential workers.

224
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah, of course.

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Which I still do every day.

226
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
My neighbors hate me.

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And they're all essential workers.

228
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

229
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They're like, I worked the most insane double shift and you are waking me up.

230
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, please stop.

231
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Please stop.

232
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Please stop.

233
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, that has gone back down a little bit, which that part's OK.

234
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

235
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The fact that you can maybe pre-order food or I still find the reservation

236
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
game extremely hard to crack.

237
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Like everything's always gone by the time I've bought tickets.

238
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Like in terms of if I wanted to reserve it, like a sit down restaurant.

239
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But then, like, I'll just walk up and they'll be like, yeah, we can get you

240
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
into Oga's Cantina.

241
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Like I feel like they can always get me into Oga's Cantina.

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Right.

243
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You can. Yes.

244
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That is something that happens a lot where you look at it and it says you can

245
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
come back in six hours or you can ask a person.

246
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But then what I've noticed lately is that if you sometimes like refresh, you

247
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
can get different times.

248
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Like there's a couple of different places in Disneyland where you can just

249
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
add yourself to the wait list right there in the app.

250
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Right.

251
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you're close enough.

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes, you have to be close.

253
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You have to be inside and you have to be close.

254
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But if you refresh it, sometimes the time will change because some other people

255
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
will have their time in like their cart essentially on the map.

256
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So then they'll let it go.

257
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And all of a sudden it was 60 minutes.

258
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now it's 15 minutes.

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So then that's another element that I just started picking up on recently.

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Another element to checking that both satisfies my brain, but also makes me

261
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
have a worse time.

262
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Right.

263
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So because you're looking at your phone.

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I mean, I think I always bring up is there was a time at Disney World and I

265
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
would guess it's between like 2010 to 2014 and they were really trying to get

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
people off their phones.

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You know, the iPhones are starting to get like mass adopted.

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Android's coming out.

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The first few Android phones are out.

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And so they're like, all right, we'll put little games in the queues for people

271
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
to play.

272
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We'll put games or statues with plaques and like an interactive stuff.

273
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And by 2014, they're like, no app.

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Use phone.

275
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah.

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

277
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There's so many.

278
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't know.

279
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I guess they were like people get these animals get so bored in this cage that we

280
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
need to do something to entertain them.

281
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So they tried having like exterior things to have fun with and that didn't seem to

282
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
work.

283
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And then they did the phone thing.

284
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then it was like there was that space mountain game you would play and you

285
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
could get to the front of the line if you won.

286
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't even remember.

287
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But it was the worst game you've ever played in your life on your phone.

288
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And like it took up the whole time.

289
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes.

290
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In line.

291
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And meanwhile, most people in line, if they're like in a big family group,

292
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
they're just playing like heads up.

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes.

294
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Everybody's playing till still there was a time when I feel like I saw every

295
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
other four people, but now it's like still pretty popular.

296
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah.

297
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But that is more fun than at least you're engaged with everybody.

298
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah.

299
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah.

300
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But this was some like game where I'm like flying a rocket and I'm trying.

301
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't even remember what it was.

302
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
My favorite was when I was like in second grade and Indiana Jones came out and I

303
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
would just, you know, wait in a two and a half hour line as like an eight year

304
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
old.

305
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And that was just the reality of the situation.

306
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And they gave us these AT&T sponsored decoder cards.

307
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The decoder cards.

308
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah.

309
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And that was like pretty fun to be like, yeah, yeah.

310
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This message says drink water.

311
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's above a water fountain.

312
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's funny.

313
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You know, like that's the other part is like taking my nephews and nephews

314
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and niece, if they have to wait for 20 minutes, they're like, oh, this line.

315
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And I want to just like scream.

316
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah.

317
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Because I'm like, I, well, your parents have spent so much additional money to

318
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
keep you from having to wait in a line, you know, and, and I'm not their parent,

319
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
but I'm like close enough to be like, Hey, absolutely no complaining.

320
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is a very expensive day and people are working really hard to make sure you

321
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
have a good time.

322
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And they'll be like, right, right, right, right.

323
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But how much longer?

324
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Like, so they'll catch themselves on tone or like, right, we can't complain,

325
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
but they still don't internalize the Disneyland used to be.

326
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Right.

327
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You had to wait in so many long lines and you were lucky if you got on.

328
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Right.

329
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Seven, seven, right?

330
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Like I can now curate a day for them where they get on 15 rides, you know,

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
get to repeat.

332
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You have such knowledge and ability.

333
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Eight year rides.

334
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah.

335
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That they don't even realize how good they have.

336
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
No, they don't.

337
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And this is my daughter doesn't know this.

338
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
She's two years old, but she doesn't understand that daddy's giving her a

339
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
better situation than a lot of these kids with parents that don't know shit.

340
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Right.

341
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, that's the other thing is, is like the knowledge gap keeps getting bigger

342
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and bigger.

343
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And like, there's these cottage industries about like, okay, you're not

344
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
good at it.

345
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll make an itinerary for you.

346
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And like, yes, right.

347
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Right.

348
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And just the, and then not to mention the financial bummer of like, okay,

349
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
so now you're just assuming that everyone has to have a smartphone.

350
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Like, yeah.

351
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And you're rewarding people who have more money, who can buy a $20 front of

352
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the line ticket for rise of resistance for part six, spend 120 more dollars to

353
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
get to the front.

354
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I mean, the like bummer capitalism side of it is like pretty tough versus

355
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
like everyone used to get a fast pass.

356
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And as long as you could work them correctly, you'd get two or three a day.

357
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes.

358
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And it would help take the edge off the absolute longest lines, give you a

359
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
couple of breezes.

360
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And then you spent all of the time in between that waiting in lines.

361
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, yeah.

362
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No, it's everything of course is being done because the, the, the like

363
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
business people are just trying to figure out the right configuration to

364
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
steal as much money out of everybody.

365
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And all it's doing, it's like, it's meant to confuse and steal, I guess it's

366
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
meant to confuse and like vacuum money out of your pocket.

367
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And it continued, like it's continuing.

368
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There was like talk of like, oh, maybe the reservations will go away in like

369
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Florida to some degree.

370
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They've gone away.

371
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Disneyland still has the reservations for like, for just even getting in the

372
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
park.

373
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And now, now of course there's like a $400 tier of fast pass that is like that

374
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
just gets you on every ride, which honestly in some ways that is a better

375
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
insult.

376
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's better in some ways because like it's a lot of money.

377
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's too much money to spend if you're already spending money.

378
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And it's just like, you don't have to look at your phone all day.

379
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes, exactly.

380
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Like you're paying for the freedom of, of not having to think so hard about

381
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
this.

382
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Right.

383
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But like, if you buy just regular lightning lane and you're surfing your

384
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
phone all day, which is what I do.

385
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I feel like I'm in like Mission Impossible.

386
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I feel like I'm Simon Pegg.

387
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm Benji in Mission Impossible.

388
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm on my phone.

389
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm doing it the whole day and I'm, I get dopamine hits from it, but then

390
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
everybody else gets to enjoy it.

391
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So you just, I justify my disengaging from the group.

392
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Disney does have the entity working against you.

393
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The villain from the last movie.

394
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I know the entity.

395
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I know the Mission Impossible lore.

396
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We all know the entity, the very, very understandable villain of Mission

397
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Impossible seven part one.

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It was like part one, but now it's not going to be called part one.

399
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's going to be called, it's just going to erase that.

400
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's going to be retroactively.

401
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Good.

402
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes, but the entity, but Disney's entity is shitty too though.

403
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's a bottom of the ocean.

404
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's a nuclear submarine at the bottom of the ocean, but it's also video

405
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
art at a weird European party.

406
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It was a club.

407
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It is a club as well.

408
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah.

409
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The entity is a club, which I like that part a lot.

410
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
They're the greatest movies on the planet Earth.

411
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They're my favorite movies.

412
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Just to address a couple of things that have come up.

413
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Jess, you'll be happy to know that today, Lightning Lane for

414
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Riser is actually $27.

415
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Good, good, good.

416
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The other thing is that first off, I've had this app open for about

417
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
maybe like 45 minutes and I think it's already taken my phone from 90%

418
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to 74% and the other thing I was going to say, oh, the reservation.

419
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So the park reservations, there is a button in the app.

420
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's buried in a spot and it says park reservations.

421
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
When you click on it, it opens a browser window.

422
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You can't just build that into the app.

423
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Jason, this is one of the things that I am upset with this thing every day.

424
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You don't have, it takes you to like GoDisney.com, which is a thing we've

425
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
threatened to do an episode about forever, is that Disney bought Go.com

426
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
like 20 plus years ago and all of its infrastructure is built on Go.com.

427
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Some bizarre thing, some useless Michael.

428
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It was an Eisner purchase, right?

429
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It was an Eisner purchase.

430
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
One of his rare elves.

431
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Flawless except for GoDisney and then Mickey's Kitchen.

432
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I went to Go.com and it's just a rich text website to links to all the

433
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
different Disney departments.

434
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That's amazing.

435
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And then Disney also, if you want to use a gift card, you have to go to

436
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
DisneyGiftCard.com, plug in and then plug that into your app.

437
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I mean, the way that they don't talk is like this past summer when I

438
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
played captain for my sister and her three kids, she got those tickets

439
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
through like a family friend connection who has a Club 33 membership.

440
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So he gifted us tickets, okay?

441
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I had to, there was no way for me, a human, to take that reservation

442
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and import it to an app.

443
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, right, right, right.

444
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I had to, which meant like, if I didn't know any better, I was going to

445
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I would have just shown up that day with these tickets and then not been

446
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
able to access anything.

447
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I think you can do it at retcon once you're in the park, but it meant I

448
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
couldn't make any reservations.

449
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I had to get them to merge this with, I don't know, I had to talk to a human.

450
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
A human had to do it for me.

451
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And they were like, can you give me the receipt for this purchase?

452
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I was like, they're Club 33 gift tickets.

453
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And they're like, okay, let me like backdoor this time one, and like, you

454
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
know, had to create a fake reservation, something for me to even be able to

455
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
use the app because those things don't talk well to each other.

456
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I've had difficulties before where it's like, if I bought a ticket, you know,

457
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
like me and I bought me and my husband's tickets and then my brother bought his

458
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
families, but actually I want to run the app all day.

459
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Merging the reservations is not as intuitive as you think.

460
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I had to eventually scan their physical tickets to put it all in one app

461
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
interface so that you can, because you're not just going to get Lightning Lane

462
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
for two of you, you want to get it for the whole party.

463
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You know what I mean?

464
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And I've had like tons of like running into weird corners there where it ends

465
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
up taking you to your Safari browser.

466
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's like not within the app.

467
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And you're like, this should all be in the app.

468
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
If you're making me use the app, it should all be in the app.

469
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I had to update for an annual pass monthly payment.

470
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I had to update my credit card, which you have to do by calling.

471
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That's crazy.

472
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Or to change it on the internet.

473
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Like it's crazy.

474
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like it feels like if Ethan Hunt was up against the entity, but the entity was

475
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
dumb and bad and like shitty and it would like just fuck up once around.

476
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It was built on 30 year old software.

477
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, the day that I went this past summer was the day that they switched from

478
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Genie Plus to calling it all Lightning Lane.

479
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So, but it was still like that meant it made it some of the reservations in

480
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
lead up kind of confusing.

481
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Cause you'd be like, well, my Genie's telling me to do this.

482
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And they're like, just so you know, Genie won't be here tomorrow.

483
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Or like Genie will still be here, but like it's not called Genie Plus anymore.

484
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But the tipboard I find to be like a such a patronizing interface.

485
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Like the tipboard is so.

486
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh yeah.

487
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Cause that's the, they were plugging the idea that, oh my God, Genie Plus

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
you'll pay for, but Genie regular will tell you what to do.

489
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes.

490
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He'll give you all kinds of tips, which will be like, have you thought about

491
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
getting a balloon?

492
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Like it's so stupid.

493
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Or they're like, are you aware of a topia?

494
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And you're like, yeah, I'm aware of a topia.

495
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Like if everything else is broken, all right, a topia.

496
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Like.

497
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah.

498
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It was acting like the AI would just like direct you to like things with no

499
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
line and like it would like glide you across your day.

500
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Or, but it's like everybody, I don't know.

501
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And maybe they don't, but I'm like, everybody has this base level of

502
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
information.

503
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Don't they?

504
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Most people do by this point, like the Genie Plus, the tipboard, and then it

505
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
wouldn't be where your things were.

506
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You'd have to click on the other.

507
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You know what I mean?

508
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Like the tipboard versus like your itinerary would not be like, they

509
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
wouldn't be talking to each other.

510
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So wouldn't be like, why don't you recommend for me a snack after big

511
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
thunder, knowing I'm going to be on big thunder about two 30.

512
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Why don't you be like, Hey, you know, you can just get fries right here at

513
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
this walk.

514
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Like, you know what I mean?

515
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Like the tipboard wasn't actually tipping me anything good.

516
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
No, it would be like, check out this ride or this or this parade or this

517
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
show.

518
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And it's like, I already did those things.

519
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I just didn't tell you I did those things.

520
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Exactly.

521
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Or you could tell me like trivia, or you can tell me like interesting things

522
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
to do in line, or you could tell me a lot of things that would enrich my

523
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
experience.

524
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But what you don't need to tell me is like, have you thought about booking a

525
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
princess encounter?

526
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm like, no, I haven't.

527
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I don't want to.

528
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm already here.

529
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The best is when they would direct you to like ready-made Apple music or

530
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Spotify playlists.

531
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And it's like, I can search that.

532
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And when I'm home, I'm here now.

533
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm here now.

534
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Exactly.

535
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Exactly.

536
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Or like it didn't ever, if you really want to like do my tip board, you

537
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
should know that I have a park hopper and you should be telling me, Hey, now

538
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
is a great time crowd wise to switch parks, save things.

539
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You like to come back later to this park.

540
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Why not make it a sandwich type day?

541
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You know, like stuff like that.

542
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Although I know that was for strict for a while where you had to only switch.

543
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
There's still kind of a thing.

544
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Like at 11 AM is when you're allowed to switch.

545
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You can't switch.

546
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You get arrested.

547
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But you can switch back, right?

548
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes, you can.

549
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah.

550
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Can I just mention, cause you said the phrase and you haven't, I don't think

551
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
you've said the phrase.

552
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And since we did a country bear jamboree, you said, you just said, I'm here

553
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
now, which was your famous song.

554
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm here now.

555
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And we did the country bear jamboree.

556
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So if anyone thought I was not being sincere on the country bear, on the

557
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
actual jamboree.

558
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

559
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And if you end that lore, we need to, we need to maintain that.

560
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah, we do.

561
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yes, we do.

562
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's lore.

563
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah.

564
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This has been kind of lore free so far, as far as the writers concerned.

565
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That's our version of the Disneyland app.

566
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's like, okay, so this is lore for an episode of another podcast that we

567
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
made an appearance on.

568
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It was kind of tangentially related to our country bear jamboree.

569
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's a pretty good episode.

570
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It was very fun.

571
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It was a blast to do.

572
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I laugh at that song you did.

573
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Like every six months I listen to it.

574
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Okay.

575
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Cause here's, here's what I bring to the table for musical improv that a lot of

576
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
people don't bring.

577
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And that is a panic.

578
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, everybody brings that.

579
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah.

580
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's the eternal flame.

581
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It read as a character, but you were the most, were like, I don't know if I can

582
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
do this.

583
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And then yours was like the most harried, like, but that energy was very good.

584
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It was thematically correct.

585
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah.

586
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
For the country bear.

587
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I feel like there are just seven prompts to what you're describing with Jeannie

588
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Plus where they would just like rotate them.

589
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It was, I'm sorry.

590
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
There's probably a dog here on that or something.

591
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That's all right.

592
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But yeah.

593
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So do you want to go like, go, I don't want, cause there's some stuff in the

594
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
app I'll say I like.

595
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Sure.

596
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Like, you know, yeah.

597
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I mean, we could go through, like, if you just go on the app, isn't that

598
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
listeners, if you have the app, open it up, I suppose.

599
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Cause we'll, we'll, we'll go through it.

600
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Cause I don't want it to be, cause this could easily descend into just, uh,

601
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
making fun of the app.

602
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And like, you know, I want to, I want to both sides of the app.

603
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh, I don't have, I don't, I need the upgrade.

604
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
How long do you think it'll take me?

605
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't know.

606
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's probably on the network, whatever your network is.

607
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Um, but I mean, you can see my, my phone.

608
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's not like we have to be.

609
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Um, but yeah, they give you like the first things that the first thing you see

610
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
when you open up the app is that they're trying to sell you the lightning lanes.

611
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Right.

612
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's either the $36 one, which is the multi pass or just the premiere,

613
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
which is the $400 upcharge.

614
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Which my girlfriend thought.

615
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's $400 on top.

616
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yes.

617
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
$400 on top.

618
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
She thought it was all included.

619
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I was like, no, no, that's on top.

620
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
400 per person.

621
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Per person, not per party.

622
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yes.

623
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Right.

624
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So it's 400 per person.

625
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That is inconscionable.

626
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Did I say that word right?

627
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I think you said inconscionable.

628
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You probably meant unconscionable.

629
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

630
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah.

631
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's that.

632
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's yeah.

633
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It's so yeah.

634
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
$400 for today and the next few days.

635
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Uh, it's a person.

636
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah.

637
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah.

638
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That's so horrific.

639
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So depending on how many people you have, it might make more sense to get like a guide,

640
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
which is still, I forget how much that is.

641
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And that's very expensive, but it might make more sense.

642
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I forget.

643
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Um, but yeah, that's, that's if you don't want to work, that's the no effort choice.

644
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And it depends because like, is the effort on a 12 hour Disney day when you're taking

645
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
a friend from out of town and you want to give them the best day, how much actual physical

646
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
labor and effort am I putting in?

647
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
How much is my time worth?

648
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Is it $200?

649
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Is it 300?

650
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Like, I don't know.

651
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's hard to tell.

652
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Yeah.

653
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I mean, it really comes down to group size because that, if it's just you and your friend,

654
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
that's still $800.

655
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yes.

656
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Like, so that's not-

657
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I mean, I'm never going to do that.

658
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That's not worth it to me.

659
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Unless I like win the lottery, I don't think I'm ever going to do that.

660
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay.

661
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So today's plans, the icon next to it is still a genie.

662
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So-

663
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah.

664
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
We really ran the character genie through the mud for this thing.

665
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah.

666
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Because we talked about this, we did an episode a couple of years ago and we were talking

667
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
about how like, why are you tying a beloved character to this failed part of your app?

668
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah.

669
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's also like, he's free.

670
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
He's free and now-

671
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And now you're basically putting him back.

672
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Back in the lamp.

673
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You're putting him back in the lamp and that's not right.

674
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
No, it wasn't right.

675
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And now I guess he's free again or he's dead.

676
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm not sure.

677
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Pretty easy going day right now at the old D-Land 20.

678
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah.

679
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm seeing some short lines.

680
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Now that's a thing I like.

681
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yes.

682
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I like opening up the app and seeing what the waits are and imagining I'm there enjoying

683
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
a light line.

684
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yes.

685
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Obviously the map and like wait time, that part's great.

686
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yes.

687
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Like that's easy.

688
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I cannot believe it's $400 a person.

689
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That is so nuts.

690
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Showtimes.

691
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Okay.

692
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Virtual queue.

693
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Virtual queue.

694
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I've not been able to successfully get in a virtual queue.

695
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Really?

696
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I always was just fast passing or paying for, or I guess lightning lane.

697
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
They're not, nothing is called a fast pass anymore.

698
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Right.

699
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
There's no fast pass anymore.

700
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It depends.

701
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Virtual queue right now is easy to get for Haunted Mansion Holiday, which you still have

702
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
to get a virtual queue.

703
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You cannot join a regular line because the queue is still under construction and the

704
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
gift shop is under construction, but that's pretty easy to get.

705
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I finally got on a Tiana preview because I have the magic key, but that took four different

706
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
tries, four different day tries.

707
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What'd you think?

708
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I haven't said, oh, are we saving?

709
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I like it.

710
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Okay.

711
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'll say that.

712
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I said I like it, but I'll.

713
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The early T was not enough drama to the story.

714
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Well, I will give a little hint of my feelings is that if I have one complaint is there's

715
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
not, there's no tension in the spot where you go up.

716
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Let's have a, that's what I had heard.

717
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
There's not like a, that moment used to be terrible.

718
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Bunny is tied up.

719
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
This is very scary.

720
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,000
This is like, and those vultures and the tension under the clip going up, very scary.

721
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And you know what?

722
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
We're saying it.

723
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
We're not giving our kids enough scares.

724
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I said this last week.

725
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
This is a common thing because like Snow White scary adventure, which they changed to Snow

726
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
White's enchanted, whatever enchanted wish.

727
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I don't know what it's called.

728
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I like the new version of the ride, the dark ride, but they did take away a lot of the

729
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
scare stuff.

730
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So I do feel like we got to scare these kids.

731
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
These kids should be scared a little more, even though I was afraid of everything as

732
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
a kid.

733
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But look at the man I am now.

734
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Look what it made me.

735
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh, I wrote thunder.

736
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I wrote a Matterhorn till I was like 12 with my eyes closed because the Yeti scared me,

737
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
but I still wrote it.

738
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Right.

739
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It didn't keep me off the ride and I didn't look into his eyes on Indiana Jones till I

740
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
was like 21.

741
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Mara's eyes?

742
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Look into my eyes.

743
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It is your destiny.

744
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You had a blue moon before you looked into the eyes.

745
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I just put my eyes down.

746
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I just say, I'm not looking at that guy.

747
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Do you still look into Mara's eyes now?

748
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
No, I do.

749
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Or is there part of you that still is a little weird about it?

750
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
No, I look into his eyes.

751
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I know it's just for play.

752
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Now I know.

753
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
But sometimes it's fun to play along.

754
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah.

755
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You know what I'm saying?

756
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Sometimes it's fun.

757
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Jason, do you look into Mara's eyes?

758
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Sometimes.

759
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But not always.

760
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Sometimes I'll just look at the other doors and then I get to look into the eyes but not

761
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
be scared.

762
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Mara, the big Mara, not the little Maras.

763
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's the Maras above the door that you get in trouble.

764
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
No, big Mara.

765
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
No, big Mara already.

766
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Indy is already out, isn't he?

767
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
No, that's after Mara.

768
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Okay.

769
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh my God, Jason.

770
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's over the door you're not supposed to look.

771
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
No, it's inside.

772
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Don't look into Mara's eyes inside.

773
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Am I crazy?

774
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's right before you go through the doors.

775
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's right at the beginning.

776
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah.

777
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's the big Mara head.

778
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

779
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
He's saying though, you know how there's three doors and they used to rotate, which was cool,

780
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
but it was the same track, obviously.

781
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But then when you go in and see the giant Mara, that's why it's hard to not look at Mara.

782
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah, I would just look down.

783
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Okay.

784
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So you always thought it was the little Mara eyes?

785
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I thought it was the little Mara eyes because you're seeing the different-

786
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You know what we got to do now?

787
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Indiana Jones episode two.

788
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Well, we've been teasing it for years.

789
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And we've got to do it soon because apparently there's been a miscommunication here about

790
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
what it is, so we have to do a second episode.

791
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Now I'm calling it, I'm calling our shot now.

792
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Let me just say, Haunted Mansion Holiday, no more virtual queues left, no more stand,

793
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
no standby line, no lighting lanes available.

794
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Well, it's 4 o'clock, so-

795
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I guess so.

796
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But you can comfortably, the thing is, the virtual queue, you have to get up at like

797
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
7 a.m. and do it in Disneyland, which is just sucks.

798
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah.

799
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Okay.

800
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So you can do virtual queue before you get there.

801
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Okay.

802
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You have to be on property.

803
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So right now, again, Scott is getting a piercing headache just from us talking about it far

804
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
away.

805
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He's like, ah, he's like clutching his body.

806
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Because he has so many thoughts or he doesn't want to talk about it?

807
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Because he doesn't want to talk about it.

808
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
He doesn't want to talk about it.

809
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
He gets physically ill when we start going-

810
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Because it's too stressful?

811
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yes.

812
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
He hates any of this.

813
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
He, I've seen him get, I was working on figuring out a problem with the app.

814
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I saw he physically got up and walked away.

815
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
He's so like app averse and talking about all this stuff.

816
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
He doesn't like any of it.

817
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So I'm just imagining now he knows that what we're doing to his podcast right now is talking

818
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
about this and he's having a physical reaction.

819
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So virtual queue, generally speaking, 7 a.m. you get up and you get that one if you're

820
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
not in the park.

821
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And then there generally will be a noon chance as well.

822
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Right.

823
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And sometimes even a further three or four.

824
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I remember this when Rise was like, when you could first go back, COVID had to be a California

825
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
resident.

826
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
They had the like, at 7 a.m. you have a chance and at noon you have a chance to get in a

827
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
virtual queue for Rise or WebSlinger.

828
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yes.

829
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
WebSlinger.

830
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Not good.

831
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Disappointing.

832
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Disappointing.

833
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Disappointing.

834
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Disappointing.

835
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Okay.

836
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I've said it a hundred times.

837
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
If you want to make a ride based on Spider-Man, well, what's the thing you want to do with

838
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Spider-Man?

839
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Fly.

840
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Suffer.

841
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Oh, fly.

842
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Suffer.

843
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You want to get like broken up with on the ride or something.

844
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah.

845
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You want to disappoint him.

846
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I want to have the moment where I go, oh no, my scientific mentor is the villain.

847
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah, right.

848
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You want a revelation of some kind.

849
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But the way down the list is shoot your webs like bullets.

850
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And it's just not good.

851
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It doesn't work.

852
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It does.

853
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's too hard.

854
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yeah.

855
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The Spider-Man ride in Islands of Adventure, way better.

856
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The best.

857
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Jason's favorite ride of all time.

858
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
My favorite.

859
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's really good.

860
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Yeah.

861
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's still really good.

862
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I hope it lasts because it's gone now in Japan.

863
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So there's one more left and I don't know.

864
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
We'll see.

865
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,360
A Rise of the Resistance type Spider-Man, I mean, obviously Rise is a massive footprint,

866
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:24,360
but the movement is like the Spider-Man Islands of Adventure ride leveled up where you're in

867
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
a thing.

868
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,360
Now, I don't really like a 3D component, but it works pretty good.

869
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
Yeah.

870
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
And you're moving around.

871
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,360
It's almost like a similar movement feel to Rise, right?

872
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Well, yeah.

873
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,360
It's just that that ride system, like Spider-Man Transformers, and the way I put it is that

874
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
that ride system fucks you up more, which I like.

875
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,360
I feel like Rise of the Resistance, I have a few complaints about it, and one of them

876
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,360
is that it doesn't feel like you're getting jostled enough because it's so smooth.

877
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,360
It is smooth, but the drops.

878
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Yeah, the drop stuff is cool.

879
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,360
I didn't mean like when you're getting shot.

880
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,360
The drop to give the sensation of flight and swing, I think, would be awesome.

881
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Yeah.

882
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,360
Man, I think Rise is maybe perfect.

883
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
I don't know.

884
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,360
I've said it on the show before, but I have a couple problems.

885
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
We don't need to re-litigate it.

886
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Yeah, in general.

887
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,360
It's just I wish the ride vehicle messed you up because my body doesn't feel like it's

888
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
under attack like it does on Indiana Jones or Transformers.

889
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,360
I think I still get it from the stop starts, like when you're going in between the cannons,

890
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
stop start, stop start.

891
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Well, that's the best.

892
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Yeah, it's my favorite one, but those don't work anymore.

893
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
What do you mean?

894
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
The cannons don't work.

895
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360
They're stuck.

896
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,360
They're not moving because they're so big.

897
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,360
I think both coasts, the cannons have stopped working.

898
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,360
They're so heavy and they did move with such force.

899
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,360
Apparently, they shook the foundation when they were a little off once.

900
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,360
I don't know that it's never coming back, but I've seen people say it's never coming

901
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
back to working.

902
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
I don't know.

903
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Well, hopefully that's wrong, but we'll see.

904
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
But those don't work.

905
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,360
That is my favorite room because that feels like a crazy thing.

906
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Yeah.

907
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
And it feels dangerous.

908
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,360
It was very startling the first time.

909
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
And the drop is great.

910
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,360
At the end, you mean when you go, yeah, yeah, that's a fun.

911
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Yeah.

912
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,360
It locks into a different ride system.

913
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,360
I just it's so smooth.

914
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
That Wi-Fi controlled thing is so smooth.

915
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,360
I just like Indiana Jones.

916
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,360
You come out of it and you go like, ah, my neck messed up.

917
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
But I want that.

918
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
I want my neck to be messed up.

919
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
See, I don't want my neck to be messed.

920
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
No, I love Indy.

921
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Indy, I love.

922
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:25,360
But like all of the, there's basically half of Universal I can't ride.

923
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,360
It just makes me too sick.

924
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
There's so much stuff that's 3D.

925
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Yes.

926
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Yeah.

927
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,360
I had the talking about Rise of the Resistance.

928
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
I had the like, go, go.

929
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
You haven't done it.

930
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,360
My dad and brother came out to visit last fall.

931
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,360
And we were down in Disney World end of 2021.

932
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,360
And any time we tried to do Rise, it was down.

933
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Yes.

934
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,360
And I had done it out here right opening day.

935
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:01,360
And I felt so bad for them because it was like, I mean, it was chaotic.

936
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
It was chaotic down there in 2021.

937
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:08,360
So it was like, you know, under a little more understandable.

938
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
But I'm like, you have to get on this.

939
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Yeah.

940
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
This is amazing.

941
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,360
You had to get on this for you're out here now.

942
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Yeah.

943
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
It should be working a little better.

944
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Yeah.

945
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:26,360
I took two friends around last April.

946
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:34,360
And I really fucked them up at the beginning of the day in a way that they basically couldn't recover,

947
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,360
which was that I was like, we can get into Oga's Cantina.

948
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,360
It's the only place you can get alcohol on the Disneyland side.

949
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,360
We did this right as we entered the park at 8 a.m.

950
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,360
And I was like, let's get a fun, blue, funky cocktail.

951
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
Super fun.

952
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,360
I love the Cantina.

953
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
I have a great time every time I go there.

954
00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:00,360
And then I took them on Smuggler's Run and they basically didn't function.

955
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:06,360
You know, the like combination of two alcoholic drinks on like near empty stomachs early in the morning

956
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:14,360
and a very like herky jerky, hard to track visually ride.

957
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,360
So the day was ruined in some ways in many ways.

958
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
Yeah.

959
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,360
And this goes to the like pressure of being the leader.

960
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
We still had a great day.

961
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,360
I like didn't push anybody to go any faster than they needed to.

962
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,360
I was like, I've been here a million times.

963
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
Like there's nothing that I need to do.

964
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:35,360
If you don't want to go at this pace, we can let's go like walk around and do something different, you know, mix it up.

965
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,360
But at the end of the day, like one of them made like a completely innocuous comment and I like completely snapped at them.

966
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,360
I was like, I was like, you have no idea the pressure I've been under all day.

967
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
Actually, I can tell you exactly what I said.

968
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:55,360
I said, oh, man, I just feel like at this point you understand why getting a hotel would be fun because I would just love to get some honk shoes right now.

969
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Oh, yeah.

970
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,360
What do you think I mean when I say that?

971
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,360
That's some a little nap, a little sleep.

972
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
Thank you.

973
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Yeah, thank you.

974
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
They were like some honk shoes.

975
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,360
I was like, yeah, yeah, some Z's, some sleep.

976
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
That's what it honk shoe.

977
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
It's a cartoon way to describe.

978
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
Like a looney tune.

979
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
Yes.

980
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Like if they're not imagining sawing wood, they're imagining snoozing.

981
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
Exactly.

982
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
And then I laughed good naturely.

983
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:27,360
I was like, I guess that's not as clear cut as I and my one friend said, yeah, she's explaining it like we're the dumb ones.

984
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,360
And I was like, the implication there is that I'm dumb and I have just navigated an entire day for you.

985
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,360
So actually what I did is I went quiet for like 20 minutes and then the drive.

986
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
I was like, I have to be honest.

987
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,360
That really hurt my feelings.

988
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:47,360
I have to speak truthfully to you, my two college friends in our late thirties right now.

989
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,360
I didn't appreciate that after a day of navigating your day through the park.

990
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
And part of me blames the fricking app.

991
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:59,360
Like it blames the like the pressure to navigate and optimize every moment.

992
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
Yeah.

993
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Means like even when people are grateful, you're going to feel like I can tell you who had the least fun today.

994
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:11,360
It was me, like the mom who doesn't get to eat a hot meal in 20 years.

995
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,360
You know, that's how I feel at Disneyland because of the damn app.

996
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:22,360
The app heightens the like right before like happy hour, like the 3 p.m.

997
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:30,360
to 5 p.m. like drag where like everyone's trying to eat or take a rest or like get on a ride.

998
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,360
And they're trying to push through if they're not resting.

999
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:40,360
And it makes me also like I've always been like a land Disneyland lover because of growing up in Southern California.

1000
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,360
And I haven't ever done like a big proper world trip like my brother and sister in law have.

1001
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:56,360
And I was like, you know, this also is putting into sharp relief the difference between being people who vacation at Disney versus people who visit Disney in their regular life.

1002
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Right.

1003
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:08,360
Because if you're vacationing there and you're going to multiple parks each day, you maybe aren't you maybe don't need to pedal to the metal each of the parks each day, especially depending on like the age of your kids.

1004
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,360
You could be like we are going to go back to the hotel and take a nap.

1005
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,360
Yes, we literally can do that.

1006
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
And it can be part of our design.

1007
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:22,360
If you're visiting as a day tripper, you're like you have to suck every moment.

1008
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,360
And the more money you spend, the more you feel like you have to do that.

1009
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
Yes.

1010
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,360
And it's but like you said, when it hits, it hits.

1011
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
Well, that's the thing.

1012
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:37,360
When you pull it off, you go, thank God the app is here because I could fix this for us while we all stand in line.

1013
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Well, we're all having a little break to have a churro.

1014
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,360
I can get ahead of this.

1015
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:49,360
And that's the best part of the day with my nephews and niece was when we saw a bunch of ducklings.

1016
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
Right.

1017
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
Well, that's always the stuff.

1018
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,360
Weird little stuff is usually what's the best.

1019
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:06,360
That being said, though, in Disney World, and I said this, I think I'm sure on the podcast, when I pulled a frozen fast pass a couple like whenever we were there a year ago, that it goes those go fast.

1020
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,360
So you got to be checking, checking, checking, checking.

1021
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,360
And it took me an hour.

1022
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:18,360
I was on it for an hour and I pulled it and I may as well have gotten this Pulp Fiction adrenaline shot in my heart.

1023
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,360
Like, oh, my God, I was so excited and I got it.

1024
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,360
And then I was the hero of the day.

1025
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:31,360
And that's the evil of the app because you do get addicted a little bit to the thrill of the chase.

1026
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,360
The artificial scarcity.

1027
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,360
Well, I mean, I guess it's artificial in some ways.

1028
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
But yes, you do.

1029
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:44,360
Yes, there's there's that's the thing that keeps you coming back to the app, unfortunately, because I wish I could just say, no, don't worry.

1030
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,360
Like, obviously, if we're taking a two year old, we're not doing we're not going hard.

1031
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,360
We're not doing we're waiting to see poo and Tigger.

1032
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,360
Yeah, that's the thrill.

1033
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,360
So that's fine. But if a person comes in from out of town, we're doing it.

1034
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,360
And I'm both like, oh, man, I'm going to be on my phone the whole time.

1035
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,360
But then I'm like, I'm going to be on my phone the whole time.

1036
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,360
Yes. No, I listen.

1037
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,360
I agree. And I've been that person for countless groups for years.

1038
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,360
Right. Do you think and I'm not this isn't a challenge.

1039
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,360
I feel like I would I could challenge somebody with my abilities.

1040
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:24,360
If we had a contest at Disneyland to see who could get the optimize the app the most.

1041
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,360
And you don't have to take me up on this.

1042
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:33,360
But we've talked about this before, where I wanted to when we thought Jeannie would actually be an AI that told you what to do.

1043
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,360
I was ready to compete against it. Man versus machine.

1044
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,360
Absolutely. But it's nothing.

1045
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:50,360
I well, because and I thought when it was first announced, they were essentially going to give people some access to their crowd monitoring software.

1046
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,360
Like not the whole thing. Well, they can.

1047
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,360
Yeah. Smart enough to tell you like, oh, this this land's really bad.

1048
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,360
Maybe try this land. Yeah. Sure.

1049
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,360
And that's not really what it was. Yeah.

1050
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,360
But I do wonder, like, what percent what percentile am I in?

1051
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,360
This feels like a sport to me now.

1052
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,360
I feel like you're well, I mean, there's so many blogs and like things and people who are really good at it.

1053
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,360
I'm sure you're still in like the top five percent.

1054
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,360
Thank you for saying that. God bless you.

1055
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:30,360
Because, like, I feel like I have once I'm there, I feel like I can intuit it because I also have I have some like internal metronomes of where I think crowds are going.

1056
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,360
Where I think a parade or a lull or the little kids need a break.

1057
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,360
Now's the time or hey, this time is going to be hard.

1058
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Save a big ride for your last ride of the day if you really didn't get it.

1059
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,360
All that like stuff that's just internal clock stuff.

1060
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,360
I feel like I do that.

1061
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:55,360
And then the app adds to it right where it gives me access to more more lightning lanes where I'm not sprinting around the park anymore.

1062
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:07,360
But I don't feel like like I didn't know the virtual queue thing because like when I tried it, when it was covid rules, I remember being really rigid about it and then like striking out and being able to do the noon one, like not getting the early one.

1063
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,360
Right. Being able to do the noon one.

1064
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,360
And then we got on a rise and it broke.

1065
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,360
Right. And then we got tickets to come back to go on rise later in the day.

1066
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,360
You know, like so I would still put myself only maybe in the top.

1067
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,360
I don't often meet somebody who seems to have a very similar feeling to me about it.

1068
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:35,360
Like it's not a common thing where I run into somebody who like hates and loves the app as well because they feel so important, like not important, but like feel like I have to be in charge.

1069
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,360
I have to take control of the of the day.

1070
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:51,360
So could we have a podcast about like invitational where we invite anybody who wants to see if they like whoever gets the most rides during the day off of the lightning lane, whatever the thirty two dollar one wins or something like was there.

1071
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,360
There's got to be a way to structure that and then like have people far and wide across the land.

1072
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,360
Anyone who thinks they can compete against me.

1073
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,360
I love it.

1074
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Challenge me and I'll say I will beat you.

1075
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,360
I will take you down.

1076
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,360
The best thing would be also to go when it's like terrible.

1077
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,360
Yes, you have to go on a summer day.

1078
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
You have to go during spring break.

1079
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:17,360
You have to go like, you know, you have to go a really, really like intense, intense day.

1080
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,360
Yeah, whatever the worst day of the year is like Super Bowl Sunday is kind of bad.

1081
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,360
Usually now people don't watch Super Bowl.

1082
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:32,360
They go to Disneyland because I feel like that's the that's where I appreciate the app is like, you know, that's just the time of year that my sister and her family can come visit is the summer.

1083
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,360
And I'm like, when we were growing up, we would never go in the summer.

1084
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,360
You know, that's when the that's when the out of town rubes go.

1085
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,360
We're going on like a Tuesday in March when it's drizzling.

1086
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:51,360
And so that is where I really do appreciate the app because I remember going one like lead up to Christmas time and it was like you couldn't walk.

1087
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,360
And then you're like, man, it really is hard to have fun.

1088
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,360
Like you could try to have a good attitude and keep your expectations managed.

1089
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:02,360
But like when you really can't even navigate basic spaces because it's so crowded, it's very, very hard.

1090
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:11,360
And so to be able to throw a little money at the problem, if you're really if you're with family or friends who really it is a scarcity thing, they're only going to go once every couple of years.

1091
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,360
Then you're like, OK, I can throw money at this problem and try to like make a better day.

1092
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:24,360
Whereas I'd be facing a really horrible day otherwise, you know, like I've seen the toughest insurmountable crowds.

1093
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,360
Yes, yes.

1094
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:31,360
I mean, that makes so much sense, because obviously if somebody can only travel on this day, so we have to go that day.

1095
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,360
So we have to do it.

1096
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,360
And that always again, I feel like I would get a little more excited being like, oh, it's going to be bad.

1097
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,360
Let's see what we can do.

1098
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,360
Let's see what we can squeeze out of this tough.

1099
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,360
It felt like because, yeah, a lot of people are like, oh, we got to go.

1100
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,360
My mom especially was like, oh, is it going to be crowded?

1101
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,360
And I'm like, doesn't matter.

1102
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,360
I get I get really cocky, I guess, when we start talking about this.

1103
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:58,360
But yeah, because I because it's given me a sense, finally given me a sense of control in my life in a lot of ways, I guess.

1104
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,360
Because, you know, you can provide at least a certain minimum of a day now.

1105
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,360
You can get like, hey, we might not get on everything.

1106
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
We might have to wait in a couple of long lines.

1107
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:16,360
A couple of the lunches like might be, you know, your experience walking around Main Street at certain times might be a little more crowded than you thought.

1108
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,360
But basically, I can give you a good day, which is different.

1109
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,360
Did you know you said this earlier?

1110
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,360
Did you know you can like drink at a couple of different places around New Orleans Square now in Disneyland?

1111
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,360
No.

1112
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,360
Because I didn't realize you can drink a beer.

1113
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,360
Where was I?

1114
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,360
Would you tell me?

1115
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,360
You weren't with me, but I texted you.

1116
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,360
I.

1117
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,360
The one right, the Terrace.

1118
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
Is it Riverbell Terrace?

1119
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,360
Riverbell Terrace.

1120
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:39,360
I had like a little vegetable thing with some like tomato sauce on it.

1121
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,360
I had a big beer.

1122
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,360
I'm watching the Mark Twain go around and they went, well, this is interesting.

1123
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,360
Interesting.

1124
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,360
Yeah, because for the longest time it was only Club 33.

1125
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,360
Yes.

1126
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
And then Ogas Cantina.

1127
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,360
Yeah.

1128
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,360
I mean, which is hilarious because on California Adventure, you can get alcohol every foot.

1129
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,360
It's so funny.

1130
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,360
Well, right.

1131
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,360
And you could go.

1132
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,360
Everywhere you walk.

1133
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,360
It's just like, here's more alcohol for you.

1134
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
Right.

1135
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
Because that's why it doesn't make any sense.

1136
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,360
I honestly, if they were like, you know what?

1137
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,360
It's all dry.

1138
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,360
We don't want it.

1139
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,360
That evil alcohol should be here.

1140
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,360
I go fine.

1141
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,360
That's your.

1142
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,360
But I can walk a hundred feet.

1143
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,360
Yeah.

1144
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,360
And drink as much as I want.

1145
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,360
Yeah.

1146
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
California Adventure is.

1147
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,360
So I hesitate to.

1148
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:22,120
I don't want to like, I am going to Disneyland and I am going in a group with a guide for

1149
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,120
the first time.

1150
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,120
Oh yeah.

1151
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,120
I've done this once.

1152
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,280
And I am a little bit like, is this going to break me forever?

1153
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,960
Now obviously it won't because I have my own nostalgia, my own love, my own dedication

1154
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,680
to the park, but I'm about to experience absolutely no resistance to a day.

1155
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,320
Like no lines.

1156
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,040
Everything is like, I won't be in charge, which would be like incredible, but it's only

1157
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,480
for a few hours, you know?

1158
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,120
So it's like, I think we get the guide for like three or four hours maybe.

1159
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,120
Yeah.

1160
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,480
And then I'm like, literally what happens after that?

1161
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,760
Will we have tickets?

1162
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,200
Will we even use the app?

1163
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,880
Because like we wouldn't have used the app prior.

1164
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,720
Like should I start getting lightning lanes for the five or six o'clock hour because we're

1165
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,960
not going to have a guide anymore.

1166
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,960
You know what I mean?

1167
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,960
Maybe.

1168
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,960
Yeah.

1169
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,960
Or I think that the group that I'm with won't care.

1170
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,440
We will have written everything under the sun.

1171
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,080
They might also give you a few complimentary for when the guide's done.

1172
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,080
That's probably what will happen.

1173
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,080
That would be choice because it's also kind of big.

1174
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:33,960
It's like eight or nine people, which is like, that's my other question is, has the app made

1175
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,400
you more or less strict about group size?

1176
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,680
As far as inviting people along?

1177
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,320
I mean, obviously you take what you take when it's like your family or friends who want

1178
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,320
to go.

1179
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,200
Like I've always been like, oh, four to six is like ideal.

1180
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,200
I mean, two is a fucking blast, but like it was nice.

1181
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,200
Yeah.

1182
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,200
But four to six.

1183
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,200
You're still you're having fun.

1184
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,200
It's reasonable to navigate.

1185
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,200
Yeah.

1186
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,240
I mean, a big group obviously is a heart is harder.

1187
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,160
I've never put any restrictions on it because like again, I when we bring the two year old,

1188
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,640
it's not like we do this.

1189
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,920
So I haven't yet tried to do the whole family optimization day.

1190
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,760
I haven't done that yet because that's like imagine the scarcity then.

1191
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,440
Like you really are going to get 10 fast passes, lightning lanes all at once.

1192
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,440
You know what I mean?

1193
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,440
Yeah.

1194
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,440
Where you have to keep checking.

1195
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,520
And it's harder because because of course, when they run out, you still can get them,

1196
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,320
but there's only there's not going to be a there's a worse chance of getting seven versus

1197
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,320
two.

1198
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,320
Right.

1199
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,320
Yeah.

1200
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,320
So that's the difference.

1201
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,440
Even numbers are the thing that I'm like, oh, two or four.

1202
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,440
It's going to be easier.

1203
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
Yes.

1204
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
We had a group.

1205
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,000
I remember going when I went in the summer as a party of five, but my youngest nephew

1206
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
is only was at the time four and a half.

1207
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,320
And so there was a couple of dining reservations where I just like tried to make them for a

1208
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,360
party of four and be like, you're going to you're going to turn us away with this little

1209
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,360
kid.

1210
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,080
And then they wouldn't because they were like, yes, just like one more little kid.

1211
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,080
Right.

1212
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,080
Right.

1213
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,080
Yeah.

1214
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,080
It's not like you showed up with four other adults.

1215
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,080
Exactly.

1216
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,040
But it's crazy if I went on the reservations before like trying for dining reservations,

1217
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,920
the amount of things that were open for parties of four and not for five.

1218
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,880
And you're like, man, that's one more seat.

1219
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,880
That's so crazy.

1220
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,880
That's a little that's a little sneak.

1221
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,880
I do.

1222
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,880
Yeah.

1223
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,440
Because if you go, I can't get a reservation five, but I can get one for four.

1224
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,960
And then you just do like a little, can I add a child to this?

1225
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,960
Yeah.

1226
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
Yeah.

1227
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,640
I well, for years, that was a thing I loved was like, you would just call a phone number

1228
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,920
and you talk to a human and they'd be like, OK, well, it's a little full for lunch.

1229
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,440
Do you mind eating at like a late lunch, three or four?

1230
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,920
And like, no, that's no problem.

1231
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,920
Yeah, exactly.

1232
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,920
OK, great.

1233
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:45,040
And now it's just in the like, it's near impossible to get like a Blue Bayou reservation.

1234
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,040
Right.

1235
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,040
Mm hmm.

1236
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,040
But you can still go and ask.

1237
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,040
Yes.

1238
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,040
Mitch went and asked once.

1239
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Scott and the Doughboys.

1240
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,040
Yeah.

1241
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,040
Mitch Magic.

1242
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,040
The Mitch Magic.

1243
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
He showed up and just asked politely.

1244
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,040
Mitch just showed up and asked.

1245
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,040
And it worked for Mitch.

1246
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,920
The ultimate hack that I used to be able to pull back in my day.

1247
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,880
So when I was in middle school, I had an annual pass.

1248
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,280
And but you would also you could.

1249
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,920
This is back when fast passes were done by barcode on your physical ticket.

1250
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,920
Yeah.

1251
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,400
And so you could when you were just checking into the park, you could be like, oh, can

1252
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,520
I have a physical ticket?

1253
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
Because I like it.

1254
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,520
Right.

1255
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,520
Yeah.

1256
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,520
They would give you a physical ticket.

1257
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,080
And I did this a couple of times with just one other friend.

1258
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,440
So we're a party of two.

1259
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,640
And that meant we had double fast pass abilities.

1260
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,640
Oh, right.

1261
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,640
Right.

1262
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,640
Each had.

1263
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,400
Two barcodes.

1264
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Yeah.

1265
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,360
So we could be like, use our annual pass barcode for Space Mountain.

1266
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,360
Right.

1267
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,960
It gives you the window when your next one's available.

1268
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,680
Use your other ticket.

1269
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:49,080
And no one cared about two 13 year old girls pulling this.

1270
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:54,160
Did you feel were you scared doing it or were you just like elated because I would be both

1271
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,160
elated and scared.

1272
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,160
I think at 13.

1273
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,160
I think I was scared.

1274
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,240
One time we tried to like really overreach and be like, I bet we could also additionally

1275
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,960
go up to lines and be like, I have a fast pass, but she dropped hers.

1276
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,960
Yes.

1277
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,960
Yeah.

1278
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,960
Yeah.

1279
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,680
And that felt a little more like bald faced lying in a way that felt a little worse.

1280
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,640
So we only tried that once because the guy was like, OK, but that's something that they

1281
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,040
can avoid now with everything being on an app.

1282
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,840
You know, you used to really be able to be like, yeah, you wanted me to keep track all

1283
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,840
these little papers.

1284
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,440
Oh, it's one of these little papers.

1285
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
I'm sorry.

1286
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
And they'd be like, you're right.

1287
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,240
Like, it's kind of a lot to keep track of all these little papers.

1288
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,240
Right.

1289
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,240
Yeah.

1290
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,840
I mean, and you just make it look like you're about to burst into tears.

1291
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,840
Yes.

1292
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,520
No cast member wants to deal with that.

1293
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,680
Because what's it matter?

1294
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,160
One more person in the fast pass.

1295
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,160
Yeah, whatever.

1296
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,160
Like, who cares?

1297
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,160
It doesn't matter.

1298
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,160
They created the name fast.

1299
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,280
I mean, I assume Michael Eisner, it came to him in a dream, like everything else, everything

1300
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,160
good that he made.

1301
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,480
And then they got rid of this IP.

1302
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,560
That's their IP.

1303
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,560
And they're not using it.

1304
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,920
We all just want to call it fast pass.

1305
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,600
Let's pitch a TV show called Fast Pass.

1306
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,600
I would love to.

1307
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,320
There's so much Disney Parks IP they haven't pitched.

1308
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,400
Dude, I think, Zach and I tell you this, that we tried in just like a general meeting with

1309
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:13,200
Disney to be like, we love Disneyland, anything that, you know, and they won't tell you what's

1310
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,200
in development.

1311
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,360
They're like, if you can guess it, we can confirm or deny.

1312
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,960
We're like, can we have a list of rides that aren't currently being developed?

1313
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,560
And they were like, no.

1314
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,760
And we were like, OK.

1315
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,760
Big Thunder Mountain.

1316
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,920
They're like, already being developed.

1317
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,920
We were like, Tiki Room.

1318
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,920
They're like, already being developed.

1319
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,920
We were like, Matterhorn.

1320
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,920
They're like, already being developed.

1321
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,000
And we're like, but it can't go the other way.

1322
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,960
You can't tell us what's open.

1323
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,960
They're like, no.

1324
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,080
Well, if memory serves me correct, I was a week away from going on a Zoom with you and

1325
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,440
Zach about Country Bears, and they canceled it.

1326
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,440
Yes.

1327
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,880
They were like, never mind.

1328
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,880
Wait.

1329
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,880
Never mind.

1330
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,880
Like they discovered someone working at it in a closet somewhere.

1331
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,880
Probably.

1332
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
Yes.

1333
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,880
Yeah.

1334
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,880
And it was like, oh, yeah, never mind.

1335
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,800
I was asked about rights for a movie.

1336
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,800
I was like, who has these rights?

1337
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,800
It's a 20th century Fox movie that is now also Disney, you know, because they've merged

1338
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,960
or whatever.

1339
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,120
And it was funny.

1340
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,600
People we know have the rights.

1341
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,160
Which is always like a funny situation.

1342
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,320
I'd be like, I wonder if they still care about this.

1343
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,040
And like, should I just email them and be like, you still care about this?

1344
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,040
Yeah.

1345
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,040
Which I might, but.

1346
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,040
Yeah, it's worth a shot.

1347
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,160
The amount of stuff, though, that they were, I've said this recently too, the amount of

1348
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,640
stuff where it's like, oh, this is in development and then you never hear about it is like,

1349
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,640
how much money have they spent on every single property to not make it?

1350
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,640
So much.

1351
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,640
So much money.

1352
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,880
So also I think that they, I don't know that there is Matterhorn anymore, but Expedition

1353
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:45,040
Everest, which might be is in development and that might be too similar, you know, like

1354
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,040
now.

1355
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,040
You think it would be.

1356
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,040
Yeah.

1357
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,040
So it might be like that, that one out.

1358
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,040
Hey, this just remind me.

1359
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:54,720
I've not yet been on the Mickey train.

1360
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,720
Yeah.

1361
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,200
And I hear great things.

1362
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,200
I'm a big fan.

1363
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,200
It's great.

1364
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,200
I'm excited.

1365
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,200
That'll be.

1366
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,200
It's rare that I have something new at the park.

1367
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,200
Yes.

1368
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,200
And the queue is amazing too.

1369
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,880
Like there's, there's like artifacts from cartoons that are now in real life, of course.

1370
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,680
And I, there's one from Lonesome Ghosts, which is like my favorite.

1371
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,680
And then I saw this thing.

1372
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,080
I won't, I don't know if I'm spoiling it.

1373
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,480
Like I saw this thing from the cartoon and I was like, that's cool.

1374
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,800
I got so excited.

1375
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,560
I have basically not even ventured into that section since Toontown.

1376
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:32,000
Like do you, do you, do you guys remember when Toontown for, well, I don't know your.

1377
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,600
I didn't go when it, I was in, I never went to season until I was in my early twenties.

1378
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
Okay.

1379
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,600
Same.

1380
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,600
Okay.

1381
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,600
We're Disney World boys.

1382
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
Right.

1383
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,600
Right.

1384
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,600
Right.

1385
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,960
So when Toontown first opened and you will, you could wait in like a mammoth line to go

1386
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,640
through Mickey's house and it was like crazy.

1387
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,480
And Goofy's house was just a bounce house, which was pretty fun.

1388
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:56,200
And then they had this, they had this thing that I absolutely loved, which was just like

1389
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,080
a topiary garden, but the topiaries were bouncy.

1390
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,440
Oh, that's cool.

1391
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,440
And they got rid of it.

1392
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,000
But that was like one of the only things it would be like, Oh, if you have a bunch of

1393
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,360
little kids Toontown is fun.

1394
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,740
And there were like a couple good restaurants in there would be like, Hey, go have lunch

1395
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:14,120
and your little kids can run around things that are actually more like a playground that

1396
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,720
from like being cooped up waiting in lines.

1397
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,720
Yeah.

1398
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,720
Yeah.

1399
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,720
There is less.

1400
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,080
I guess there's still some stuff like that.

1401
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,240
There's one in California Adventure that's like, well, Grizzly challenge trail.

1402
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,240
Yeah.

1403
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,240
Yes.

1404
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,080
And I, these are two, we are big fans of the challenge trail and just before I had a child,

1405
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,400
but now especially having a two year old wants to run around.

1406
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,400
Yeah.

1407
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,400
I'm in Toontown a lot now.

1408
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,400
Yeah.

1409
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,400
I mean, it's good that we need these, we need these third spaces.

1410
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
We need.

1411
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,400
It's not just about work.

1412
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,400
We need more third spaces.

1413
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,400
In Disney.

1414
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:49,720
The back of Toontown now with fake grass and fake rocks is where we usually go and let

1415
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,280
my daughter run around and pick up leaves and run them to grandpa.

1416
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,280
Great.

1417
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,560
And then as soon as like Pete shows up or Daisy, I pick her up, we go over there and

1418
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,560
we meet the characters.

1419
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,200
Cause that's like a really easy spot to, there's not a long line cause they just kind of pop

1420
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,200
in and out.

1421
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,200
It's a dead end.

1422
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,200
Yeah.

1423
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,600
People aren't venturing back there that much.

1424
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,800
Like Goofy just came out and we walked up on his porch and Goofy's like, like this will

1425
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,800
come on up here.

1426
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,240
And like we were first in line.

1427
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,240
That's great.

1428
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,360
And we hit like four characters within like 10 minutes.

1429
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,360
That's great.

1430
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,360
It was great.

1431
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,680
So, and, and I would say even Toontown though, with the new changes they've made to it, it's

1432
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,840
like, it's even, it's, it's more, obviously there's a big ride you want to go on now,

1433
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,160
but I feel like there's enough for parents and children now.

1434
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,280
Whereas if I didn't have a kid, I would be going back there a lot more because before

1435
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,400
that Roger Rabbit once in a while, but that's not your prime.

1436
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,400
No, no, no.

1437
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,480
And I'm really not, it's, it's also the dead endness of it.

1438
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,320
Like I'm basically not even venturing to that section of the park unless I'm going

1439
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,280
on holiday small world.

1440
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
Yeah, sure.

1441
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:53,360
I'm not even going past Matterhorn on that depth of plane, you know, I'm cutting it off

1442
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,360
like right there.

1443
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,560
That used to be me.

1444
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,560
You know?

1445
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,600
35 minute wait for Runaway We're All Away, not too bad.

1446
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,600
It's not that bad.

1447
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,600
Yes.

1448
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,800
And they play little music versions of like Eye to Eye from Goofy Movie.

1449
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,800
Ooh baby.

1450
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,040
There's a lot of good parody posters in the queue.

1451
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,040
Yeah.

1452
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,520
It's easily one of the best rides.

1453
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,520
I'm excited.

1454
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
I'm excited.

1455
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,200
It's, it's, you don't, you don't get a new one that often.

1456
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Yeah.

1457
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,200
Yes.

1458
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,200
Not often.

1459
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,200
Yes.

1460
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,200
Um, so yeah, go back, especially with a kid.

1461
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
Um, but can we?

1462
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,640
Sorry, I just had, no, I just had a quick memory of going this summer where we, my littlest

1463
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,120
nephew who is now five, but was like, you know, not five yet, but he's very tall for

1464
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:37,520
his age and he, so he can go on almost everything, but he's scared because he's a little guy.

1465
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,640
So we were like, let's just take him anyway and maybe it'll be okay because you never

1466
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,640
know.

1467
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,640
That's how I got treated.

1468
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,440
Cause I was the youngest of not only like my immediate family, but also like the cousins

1469
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,360
we would go with, they would just kind of be like, you have to go cause like no one

1470
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,600
wants to wait with you and like, that's the way of it.

1471
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,520
As soon as you're tall enough, you have to go on it.

1472
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,120
You have, I never got to like sit out for being scared ever.

1473
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,920
And so it's very much like, I don't know, maybe you'll like it once you're on it.

1474
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,600
Maybe you like it once you're on it.

1475
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,560
And they would not, they made us take him off because he was so big.

1476
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,560
Oh no.

1477
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,760
We're on which ride again?

1478
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,520
On guardians, which maybe he wasn't too scared for, but he was okay.

1479
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,520
You mean calving before it started.

1480
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,520
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1481
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,520
They didn't stop the ride.

1482
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,520
No, no, no.

1483
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,840
He was okay in the queue and his brother was like, I'm going to be so proud of you buddy.

1484
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
And he was like, okay.

1485
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,600
And he thought Rocket was cute.

1486
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,760
So we're like, he might be okay.

1487
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,360
He had done a lot better on rides than when he'd got like a year before he was scared

1488
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,880
of, just at universal, he was scared of life of pets, but he had done so much better.

1489
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,000
It wasn't like first ride of the day.

1490
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I was like, I don't know.

1491
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,920
It's kind of a toss-up because like also guardians, it's shocking, but it's funny.

1492
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,600
And it's not that long, but they wouldn't let us keep them on.

1493
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,600
They won't let you make, make kids go on rides.

1494
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,040
I've seen parents make kids go on it though.

1495
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,680
I've seen it a couple of times, but the cast members were like, he can't go on it.

1496
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,640
I wonder if it's cause like it's been too many times.

1497
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,640
Yeah, maybe so.

1498
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,320
We're just sort of like, I think he'll be, there's at least like a fight knowing him

1499
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,720
and his personality.

1500
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,840
There's a fighting chance that he like loves this.

1501
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:14,880
This is like a coin toss for how he's behaved on the rides so far today where he's like

1502
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,040
get scared in the queue.

1503
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,440
And then he's like, that was really fun.

1504
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,440
Right.

1505
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,440
And he's five.

1506
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,440
Now he's five.

1507
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,440
Yeah.

1508
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,480
I have a two year old who is three inches away from being able to go on space mountain,

1509
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,720
big thunder.

1510
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,960
She's in like 95th percentile of height.

1511
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,240
It's really, it's really tricky.

1512
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:36,680
Cause you're like, I don't know, you can go, you know, like last year, a year and a half

1513
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:41,400
ago I took him on, we put him on smuggler's run and he was like horrified and I was like,

1514
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,400
I'm sorry.

1515
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,880
I forget that he's like littler cause he's so tall for his age that I'm like, I don't

1516
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,880
know if you can go on it.

1517
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,880
You can go on it.

1518
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,200
That one's confusing too cause it's kind of a video game and kids like video games.

1519
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,200
Yeah.

1520
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,200
But he didn't like he's, you're in an isolated seat.

1521
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,200
Oh yeah.

1522
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Cause no one's next to you.

1523
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,880
I think that's the scariest part cause like I remember being scared, but my mom would hold

1524
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,160
on to me and I was like, okay, my fear is not deep.

1525
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,160
Right.

1526
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,760
It is like, it's right in the fun zone of like, it's a thrill ride, you know, it would

1527
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,760
get me a little flashlight.

1528
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,800
I could point up my feet if I got scared in the dark.

1529
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,800
That's nice.

1530
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,800
Yeah.

1531
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
That's very sweet.

1532
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,800
I didn't know that.

1533
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,800
Oh, I swear I've talked about this before.

1534
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,800
You probably did.

1535
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,800
I, I.

1536
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,800
Do you shine that at Mara?

1537
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,800
Huh?

1538
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,800
Do you shine it at Mara?

1539
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,800
Do you still have it?

1540
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,800
No.

1541
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,800
Well, first off I was three years old.

1542
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,800
It was 1988.

1543
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,800
You don't keep that flashlight on you still to this day?

1544
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,040
I still have it somewhere at my mom's.

1545
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,900
But yeah, I was terrified.

1546
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,560
They took me on Pirates of the Caribbean.

1547
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,920
I screamed my head off purely because of the dark.

1548
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:44,360
And when we're in the gift shop, they're like, well, just get them a little key chain flashlight.

1549
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,060
And then they got me that.

1550
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,060
We went on again.

1551
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:50,960
If I got scared, I would just shine at my feet and I was fine.

1552
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,960
That's brilliant.

1553
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,960
Yeah.

1554
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,960
That is smart.

1555
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,960
Forever.

1556
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:00,240
When I was like an adolescent, I would just ride Alien Counter Florida over and over again.

1557
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,480
And that's, that was a terrifying ride.

1558
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,480
Did you use the flashlight?

1559
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,240
No, I just knew all the beats.

1560
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,080
I just knew everything that was coming.

1561
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,080
Yeah.

1562
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,640
I like the idea of somebody ruining the experience by shining a flashlight in Alien and Counter

1563
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,640
because it would be so.

1564
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,640
I, yeah.

1565
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,640
Yeah.

1566
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:23,400
Well, now it's just ruining the experience when you go to sit down restaurants at Disney

1567
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,480
and Boomers are just shining their giant Android phone and you read the menu.

1568
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,040
And it's like, what do your parents do?

1569
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,640
Surely they figured it out.

1570
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,640
You know?

1571
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,640
Yeah.

1572
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,640
I don't know.

1573
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,840
My daughter is just getting scared of stuff.

1574
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,680
She was not scared the first time we took her and now she's starting to get scared of

1575
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,680
stuff.

1576
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,720
So I don't think we're going to force a two and a half year old on Space Mountain.

1577
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,920
That would probably be too much.

1578
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,920
No, no, no.

1579
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,920
But Guardians.

1580
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,080
Well, I think she, I think maybe she has to be like five inches away from Guardians.

1581
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,520
She loves getting thrown around though.

1582
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,280
She likes Mater's junkyard jamboree.

1583
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,360
So she likes that, but I think dark and loud is a problem.

1584
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,360
Yeah.

1585
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,360
You never know.

1586
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:10,000
Well, because you can only treat people how you'd like to be treated and I have only positive

1587
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,440
memories of being forced on rides.

1588
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,400
My mom and my aunt and my cousins and my siblings were always right.

1589
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,840
The ride ended and I was like, I'm so glad I did that.

1590
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:21,840
That was so fun.

1591
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,640
I never walked away from a ride being like, I can't believe you made me go on that that

1592
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,320
was terrifying ever.

1593
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:32,080
So I've, it's been, I've had a couple tricky moments where I'm like, Oh, I get to do the

1594
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,080
same thing.

1595
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,760
I get to be like, don't worry buddy, be brave.

1596
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,760
It's all fine.

1597
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,760
You're going to be safe.

1598
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,160
Mama and I are going to hold you.

1599
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,280
Like I can do all the same things and they might not have the same experience because

1600
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,360
not everyone's the same kid.

1601
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:49,200
And I've had my other nephew, Dez freaked out on the Radiator Springs ride when I, and

1602
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,240
I was like, you're going to love it, man.

1603
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,600
When this rides over, you're going to love it.

1604
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,600
He did not.

1605
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,600
And I was like, I don't know.

1606
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,880
I don't know what to do about that.

1607
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,880
I guess I violated your trust.

1608
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,880
Yeah.

1609
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,400
You scarred them for life.

1610
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:07,680
When my girlfriend and I first started dating in 2019, the Jurassic World redo of Jurassic

1611
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:14,720
Park ride opened at Universal and we had gone to a press event for it and I was like, Oh,

1612
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,720
we should go.

1613
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,040
She was working at Universal at the time.

1614
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,000
So I went to go see her.

1615
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,800
She was doing the frog course in Harry Potter and we were just walking around the park and

1616
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,800
doing some stuff.

1617
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,400
And I was like, Oh, we should go to Jurassic World.

1618
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,880
It's awesome.

1619
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,960
And she was still like, we'd only been dating a couple of months.

1620
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,720
And so she was trying to like doing the play it cool thing you do with your friends and

1621
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:46,040
had not fully explained to me that she's terrified of things hanging above her and she's terrified

1622
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:55,040
I believe it's robots in it's called submechanophobia and it's like animatronics in water submerged

1623
01:05:55,040 --> 01:06:00,200
in water and that ride has both.

1624
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,800
And so she was like freaking out the whole ride.

1625
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,240
I'm like, okay, it's good.

1626
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,280
It's not that good.

1627
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,280
What's going on?

1628
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,320
And she's like, no, I was legitimately scared.

1629
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,440
I was like, Oh, okay.

1630
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,440
Yeah.

1631
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,920
It's tricky with little kids when you want to get them to like try something new and

1632
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,000
be a little bit brave when you're like trying to read between the lines, you know, you're

1633
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,880
just like, that's why we had warmed them up on lots of safer rides and trying to gauge

1634
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,320
like especially when you're not going that often, you're like, who knows the growth that's

1635
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,800
happening in a year and a half in your like ability to handle these rides.

1636
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,000
Even trickier with 29 year olds where you're like, are you fucking with me?

1637
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
What's going on?

1638
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,440
Yeah, I will.

1639
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,280
I guess I'm going to have to err on the side of caution going forward.

1640
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,120
Sadly, you know what?

1641
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,240
That's great.

1642
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,440
It's just like you always want to give like that tiny bit of push of like, yeah, are you

1643
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,600
nervous or are you scared?

1644
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,960
You know, she can't say a full like complete sentence.

1645
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,880
So I guess I should give her a little bit more time.

1646
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,640
Yes, yes, yes.

1647
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:04,200
Definitely don't be don't be like me and don't forget that height does not equal maturity.

1648
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,360
I was shocked, though, because I was like, oh, looking at Disneyland website and you're

1649
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,320
like, oh, she can go on almost everything.

1650
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,200
There's like seven or eight things she can't go on.

1651
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,400
Oh, and she can go on those and like when she's two and a half or three, that's wild.

1652
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,200
Yeah, I was like, oh, she'll be like nine.

1653
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,360
Right. When she can go on Guardians.

1654
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,680
Yeah. No, not the case.

1655
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,400
Yeah. DJ can go on everything except for in credit coaster.

1656
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,120
But that doesn't mean he should.

1657
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:29,440
But that's like tough to remember because like I'm just going by like as soon as I was

1658
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,000
tall enough, I went on everything.

1659
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,520
And I was a little tall for my age, but not I guess I just forget he's really tall for

1660
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,240
his age. You're just like completely swayed by short.

1661
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,520
You're like, whoops. It's confusing.

1662
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,560
It doesn't make sense.

1663
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,840
On the app, there is something that says, are you a Disney parks trivia whiz?

1664
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,360
Oh, which I was like, oh, that might be interesting to play.

1665
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,880
So I said, let me just click playing.

1666
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,960
I don't want to spoil the questions yet.

1667
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,120
But I hit play and then it takes you to a different app.

1668
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,080
It doesn't have it takes you to the play.

1669
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,360
It takes you to the Disney play app.

1670
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,200
And that's where you then play guys.

1671
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,160
It says at home fun.

1672
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,120
And then you play in one player and then you select a category.

1673
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,920
Random Walt Disney World characters, Disneyland, film, TV, history.

1674
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:16,160
I mean, we could pick Disneyland just for the hell of it and then say, start playing.

1675
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,560
We can play as a group.

1676
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,200
In what year did the original Disneyland Park in California retire ticket books from use?

1677
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,560
Oh, an interesting question.

1678
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,040
Do we know the answer to this?

1679
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,440
I'm going to guess like it's well, there's choices.

1680
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,400
Two thousand eighty two, nineteen eighty two, nineteen fifty nine, nineteen seventy six.

1681
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,200
I was going to guess the 70s.

1682
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,000
I'm going to guess it's I think it's either seventy six or eighty two.

1683
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,040
And that would be my guess.

1684
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,640
I think it's eighty two.

1685
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,960
That's a it is nineteen eighty two.

1686
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,760
Yes. So that's fun.

1687
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,200
But again, it's another where you're like, why isn't that just not in the app?

1688
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,360
Yeah. And that's how it works.

1689
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,320
If you want to do like all that Galaxy's Edge stuff that I don't find fun at all.

1690
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,960
Yes. Where you just have to go around and like click things and stuff.

1691
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,280
And it's like I understand the idea is maybe fun, but in actual execution,

1692
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,760
it's not so fun.

1693
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:04,040
Well, the one thing have you messed around with play up at all?

1694
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,480
No, that's how much they're doing to play up.

1695
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,920
Are you using it?

1696
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,200
I do like and I think it was Avery Monson, a cutie sin on this.

1697
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:16,760
But like Esmeralda, the fortune teller on the Main Street Penny Arcade.

1698
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,960
So it's normally 50 cents to get a fortune told.

1699
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,920
But if you use the app at it, you can do it for free.

1700
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,360
That is a pretty good.

1701
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,520
You get a little car, you get a little souvenir.

1702
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:32,360
So it gives you a fortune on one side and then like a chapter based story on the other.

1703
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,680
I don't like that chapter three or four.

1704
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,840
I don't hate some of the stuff in here or anything.

1705
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,320
It's just how confusing it is to get to it.

1706
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,360
But like there's the Gifts of Mara.

1707
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,680
There's like so many different like little games and stuff you can play,

1708
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,240
which is like cool.

1709
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,040
But I don't know.

1710
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,440
There's something about it that isn't isn't the best.

1711
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,000
I don't know. I guess it's just they should just within the app.

1712
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,640
They should just have heads up with Disney categories.

1713
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,520
Yeah, I'm surprised they didn't like buy heads up.

1714
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,680
Do we know who owns heads up?

1715
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:05,320
Can we pitch on a heads up show or a movie like Ellen DeGeneres?

1716
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,600
Maybe she said she come up with it.

1717
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,320
I think there was like some sort of Ellen tie in maybe.

1718
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,840
I don't know. But you should just have games for.

1719
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,480
Yeah, games for lines.

1720
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,640
Right. Like I remember trying to do like the QR,

1721
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,920
like the code stuff in Galaxy's Edge when I first went, it was just nothing.

1722
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,120
It is Ellen. You're right. Yeah, she played it on her show.

1723
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,120
Yeah. Wow.

1724
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:29,960
Oh, I didn't know that.

1725
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,160
Ellen owns heads up. Yeah. Wow.

1726
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,560
OK, so she's the one who's going to pitch the movie, I guess.

1727
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,920
Yeah, probably. Heads up movie.

1728
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,320
Yeah, it's big IP heads up the game.

1729
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,920
I mean, that is what they think.

1730
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,240
That is what companies think.

1731
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,000
I know. You're such dummies.

1732
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:51,920
I clicked on that trivia thing and I selected the random trivia option.

1733
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,320
And just even if you're not a big Walt Disney World person,

1734
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,560
you might get this one. True or false?

1735
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,160
Well, it's fun to splash about Epcot in the rain.

1736
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,760
You can always take shelter beneath spaceship Earth

1737
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,400
if you don't want to get wet. True or false?

1738
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,880
Why? Yeah, I mean, yeah, because there's like an overhang.

1739
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,840
So I would say true. Yeah.

1740
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,680
What did you write these questions?

1741
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:21,440
I don't that that one was so odd because it's like you look at a picture

1742
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,880
of space where there's clearly room underneath it. Yeah.

1743
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:30,000
Fun fact, did you know, despite the seemingly round shape of Spaceship Earth,

1744
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,680
the water that runs down the structure during a rainstorm

1745
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,960
gets drained by a specially designed system? OK.

1746
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,800
Well, these are facts that you would learn about.

1747
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,200
This is the type of dry fact you learn on podcast the rise.

1748
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,560
Yeah. Are there more drainage based?

1749
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,360
Oh, that's about the dapper tans.

1750
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,840
Well, I want to know about drainage.

1751
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,400
Keep reading, see if there's more drainage stuff.

1752
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,920
I want to point out something on the app.

1753
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,080
So there's different like there's a pull down menu.

1754
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,000
You can go on the map and see attractions.

1755
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,080
You can see like character stuff.

1756
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,080
And the character stuff is pretty helpful to know where you can meet a character,

1757
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,840
because like if you have kids and you want to you want to do that dining,

1758
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,920
blah, blah, blah. But you go to guest services.

1759
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,280
And then there's a list of different things you can like.

1760
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,840
Where's an ATM? Excuse me.

1761
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,120
Where's an ATM? Where's a baby care center?

1762
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,280
And all of it looks pretty standard.

1763
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,160
And then I get to the one thing on there that says cakes at Disneyland Resort.

1764
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,440
And I go, wait, what? Cakes.

1765
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,560
Then it says cakes at Disneyland Resort celebrate birthdays,

1766
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:26,000
anniversaries, a honeymoon or even the even the every day with a specialty cake

1767
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,200
find on the map.

1768
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:31,160
And there's only one location at the Disneyland Hotel in the Goofy's kitchen.

1769
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,840
And I guess you could just go and get a cake, Jason.

1770
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,200
Did you know about this? I knew there was no, I knew there's like

1771
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,920
if it's a birthday, you can get stuff sent to the room.

1772
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,680
Well, sure. Yeah, there's room service and things like that.

1773
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,400
You could get. But on the app, it's just cake orders.

1774
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:51,160
So you can just get a full like sheet cake at the Disneyland Hotel.

1775
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:56,080
And I guess eat it out in the pool by Trader Sam's.

1776
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,720
I like the filter for spa and recreation.

1777
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,840
Yes, yes. And there's which is just about pools.

1778
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,880
It's mostly about pools.

1779
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,560
There's obviously a spot grand Californian.

1780
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,160
But yes, there's there's that.

1781
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:10,560
Most everything else, yes, like is is basically, you know,

1782
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,280
like there's a thing called this is travel insurance

1783
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,040
and there's no locations to get that.

1784
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,400
So I guess you used to be able to buy travel insurance for your vacation.

1785
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,280
You don't see travel insurance in category.

1786
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,280
Oh, it's a guest services. Yeah, yeah.

1787
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:27,400
So you can get strolled like it says you were stroller, like service animals.

1788
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,160
Yeah, bottle filling stations. There we go.

1789
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:34,840
And they have a bunch of new bottle filling stations and they are themed.

1790
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,800
Yeah, they are nice like Pooh Bear.

1791
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,240
It's like kind of looks like it's a honey pot or something.

1792
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,080
I like that. We're good.

1793
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,320
That's pretty good.

1794
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,720
Hand sanitizer locations, in-room celebrations, locker rentals. OK.

1795
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,640
Yeah, but I was just in the designated smoking areas.

1796
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,400
Those are gone, but it's still on the app.

1797
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,240
So they haven't updated the app to tell you you can't smoke anywhere anymore

1798
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,680
because it used to be used to be a couple of places.

1799
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,480
At least you could do it.

1800
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,720
So that stuff is interesting because I never really looked at that before.

1801
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,480
I mean, there's the you can find all the restrooms on the app.

1802
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,520
Unlock your room door with the Disneyland app.

1803
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,320
Yes, I have not tried that.

1804
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,120
I haven't stayed there since they added that feature.

1805
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,840
But that's pretty standard with most hotels, I feel like these days.

1806
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:21,680
But I also like how they name some of the restrooms, too, like, you know,

1807
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,360
Tomorrowland station restrooms.

1808
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,840
But then this one, I like Wetzel's Pretzels restrooms.

1809
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,600
So it's Wetzel's Pretzels.

1810
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,800
Obviously, it's I don't know actually what that restroom is, but

1811
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,640
that must be in downtown. It is. Yes.

1812
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:37,240
But which can I say, I hate that,

1813
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,640
that if you look for just dining reservations, they'll include

1814
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,760
downtown Disney in your options. Yeah, you should.

1815
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,840
Have to like select like I'm just saying,

1816
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,720
I'm imagining that as a trap for someone who doesn't know better.

1817
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,840
Who's like, oh, right, right. Oh, oh, amazing.

1818
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,120
We can eat at this jazz kitchen.

1819
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,960
That must be in New Orleans Square.

1820
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,800
Ralph Brennan must be a character, a Disney movie character.

1821
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,000
Yeah, no, that's a downtown Disney.

1822
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,600
That's a mile and a half away. Yeah, just walk out of the park.

1823
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,080
Ralph Brennan is one of the rescuers, right?

1824
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,520
Yeah, that was some of the mouses.

1825
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,480
That was a mouse name, Ralph Brennan.

1826
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,720
That's what that's what bums me out is like, yeah, is like

1827
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,400
trying to imagine like a well-intentioned family

1828
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,720
who doesn't know a thousand things about this already,

1829
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,640
trying to navigate this extremely expensive day with high expectations

1830
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:33,040
from their children and getting trapped eating at Ralph Brennan's jazz kitchen.

1831
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,320
Well, we had a lovely meal, Ralph Brennan's.

1832
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,800
I will say that in like 2019. It's delicious.

1833
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,760
I used to eat there before or after seeing a show at the House of Blues

1834
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,560
that used to be there when I was a teen.

1835
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,240
Which concerts did you see at House of Blues?

1836
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,440
Vlogging Molly, one of my first concerts when I was 15. Wow.

1837
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,360
Yeah, I saw them there twice, actually. Wow.

1838
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,000
Is that how many concerts do you think you've seen there? Four.

1839
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,280
It was also like where my we had our

1840
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:03,920
choir banquet there, I believe my freshman year.

1841
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,360
At the House of Blues. Nice. Wow.

1842
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,640
And the House of Blues moved. Yeah.

1843
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:12,600
But it's still kind of an anaheim, but it's like over by that other thing

1844
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,160
called the Grove, the Garden Walk. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1845
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,360
Which I was just spent a lot of time in the other day.

1846
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,920
And it's weird. Yeah. Why? Why were you there?

1847
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,800
Because I was trying a new parking trick.

1848
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,520
I was trying a different parking hack.

1849
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:30,040
And then I which works, by the way, I mentioned this on our Patreon

1850
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,600
that if you park at that Garden Walk

1851
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,040
and you go get something from Starbucks or the restaurant Huckleberries,

1852
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,520
if you have like a pancake at Huckleberries, there's a mysterious

1853
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:44,000
phone number that you text your receipt and your validation,

1854
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,480
whatever parking ticket you got when you came into the parking garage.

1855
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,000
If you text both of those to a mysterious number, they will just text back

1856
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,360
validated and then it's only eighteen dollars for the day.

1857
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,880
And I trusted it out and it worked.

1858
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,120
But it's a pretty good hack, but it's a strange mall.

1859
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,680
It's very, very weird.

1860
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,880
There's a magician I've never heard of's club there.

1861
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,760
And he's got like a whole lounge going on.

1862
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,800
And I promised this on the Patreon, but I'll promise to this on the main feed.

1863
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,480
There's going to be content coming about this Anaheim Garden Walk.

1864
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,360
Content coming. Yeah.

1865
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,880
Prepare for content because it's coming from a mall near Disneyland.

1866
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:24,120
As a Disneyland person, I don't mind us learning lessons from Disney World.

1867
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,720
Like, are magic bands going to really take off?

1868
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,320
You know, like, will there be things that we really love?

1869
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:33,720
But it's just sort of to me like it there's they're different, you know,

1870
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:38,320
so everything like builds up around Anaheim that feels like it's chasing or

1871
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,360
it's just like that's a wildly different massive compound

1872
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:47,520
with a totally different infrastructure site, like amount and scale of hotels.

1873
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,760
Yeah. And I kind of want Anaheim to just like chill out sometimes.

1874
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,400
Yeah. Well, it's a different it's a different culture there.

1875
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,680
It's a whole different it's everything is different.

1876
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,280
They have you can get a magic band now at Disneyland.

1877
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,320
And I would say I like magic band a lot.

1878
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,960
Won't be doing Florida and I still like it, but I don't have a desire to get it here.

1879
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,000
I don't know why that is.

1880
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,160
I think it's because it's not multiple.

1881
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,320
It's not multiple day.

1882
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:11,440
Like the like the idea that you're going to do four parks over four days.

1883
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,600
It's a big trip.

1884
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,640
It just feels different than like it was complimentary.

1885
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,120
Well, that was a nice thing.

1886
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,080
Yes, I didn't buy one charge, but at least if you're like doing a big trip,

1887
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:25,400
you're like, OK, yeah, my own one does work still in Orlando for now.

1888
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,120
Oh, OK.

1889
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,280
All right. I think actually I have a purple one.

1890
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:31,320
I have like a standard purple one and then a gray one.

1891
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,400
But yeah, I don't have any desire to do it out here.

1892
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,120
I don't know. I didn't think that would be me.

1893
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,360
I thought, man, as soon as they come to Disneyland, I'm going to be a guy

1894
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,920
with a thing like a little charm on it as Apple Pay to anyway.

1895
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,160
You're making me use the app.

1896
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,400
My phone's out all the time.

1897
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,880
And now I'm sure we all do this when we go.

1898
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,000
You have to have some sort of charging cube.

1899
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,720
Well, yes. And we've talked about this.

1900
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,720
There was a whole the fuel, the fuel rods and the lawsuit that ensued

1901
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,080
when they tried to change the terms of the deal.

1902
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,600
And then they'd go back on that.

1903
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,680
But I don't even know if they have those in the park anymore after the lawsuit.

1904
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,960
I bought one last year.

1905
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,400
But now that I'm thinking about it, I don't know if I saw it.

1906
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,800
But yes, you have to have that.

1907
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,800
My phone died. I said this on the second gate.

1908
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,000
I said this. My phone died when I was there and I had to text

1909
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,520
everybody for my computer at award wieners.

1910
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,960
So I just had to tell Lindsay, look, my phone is dead.

1911
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,800
My computer is still alive and I'm at award wieners right now.

1912
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,480
And I'm eating film strip fries.

1913
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,880
And I'll be home soon.

1914
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,320
She said, I love you, baby.

1915
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,840
I love you so much.

1916
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,120
She got riled up and she was so excited to hear all that.

1917
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1918
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:38,880
Yeah. That's that's just like that's a real reality is that it really drains.

1919
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,880
Yes. Oh, yeah. No, it's pretty.

1920
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,960
And the fuel rod has not really changed in the fuel rod.

1921
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,120
Gives you 15 percent charge.

1922
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,520
The fuel rod is a big scam.

1923
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,040
And they're they're really bad.

1924
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,480
And there's better.

1925
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:56,000
You have to bring your own little brick or something, or just, I guess,

1926
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,280
keep turning your phone on and off.

1927
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,360
But that's not that practical thing.

1928
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:05,640
I when my family was visiting, I kept like, if we split up,

1929
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,040
I kept texting my dad, like, oh, we're here.

1930
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,080
Just look at the map in the app.

1931
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,440
And he's like, I hate this.

1932
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:16,640
Like any time would explain mobile ordering the app or stuff.

1933
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,440
Like I would just see the blood.

1934
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:22,320
Like, yeah, and he has been going to Disney World since the 70s.

1935
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,840
I know that's how I had that moment with my mom, where she was like

1936
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,240
she was the amazing captain for years.

1937
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,600
And now her knowledge is almost obsolete.

1938
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,640
Like, it's so sad to be like, oh, yeah, my mom has a good attitude.

1939
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,400
She's like, oh, great. Love it.

1940
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,120
But, you know, there used to be a time where she would at least be like,

1941
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,840
well, I think we should go, you know, she's like, I don't know.

1942
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,080
You got to take it.

1943
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:49,960
Because like the learning curve is way too steep to expect her to understand.

1944
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,920
And they train people like FastPass for like 20 plus years.

1945
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,720
And like they train people like, oh, do this.

1946
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,640
Eat it this time. Go this time.

1947
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,640
And so much of that is defunct.

1948
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:08,600
And I bought the Lightning Lane multipass for four of us

1949
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,920
when my family was visiting and they were only here for a few days.

1950
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,280
And they're like, oh, thank God you did that the day we were at Disneyland Park.

1951
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,440
And I was like, yeah, but the trade off was one hundred and twenty dollars.

1952
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,080
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1953
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,920
So they thank you. Yes.

1954
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,400
Like, oh, yeah, you want.

1955
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,200
That's what I want after one of these days.

1956
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,720
My like sister, like the one time that I took a strike.

1957
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,240
She she like bought me a hat.

1958
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,600
They pay for my. Yeah.

1959
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,120
Like they're paying for if any of those up charges that I'm doing

1960
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,040
to help navigate the day for their children, they're paying for it.

1961
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,800
And I'm like, hey, just so you know, I'm I'm spending this money on this thing.

1962
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,280
And they're like, yeah, whatever. Thank you.

1963
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,320
They were paying for a lot.

1964
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:48,280
But this we ran into a thing where you like, oh, I got park hoppers to everyone.

1965
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,320
I was like, well, I think my magic might still be active.

1966
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,240
But I was the one who made all the park reservations.

1967
01:21:54,440 --> 01:22:00,280
So if I deleted the one ticket, everyone's reservations would go.

1968
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,280
And I'm like, I guess because I'm just using the park hopper.

1969
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,920
This doesn't make any sense.

1970
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,080
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

1971
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,600
We're merging. Reservations is not intuitive.

1972
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:13,600
You maybe could have called someone to have them do it for you, but maybe not.

1973
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:17,080
Yeah. But you're just on the phone for five or ten minutes.

1974
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,480
Just going representative, representative.

1975
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:24,400
Yeah. When Apple buys Disney in the next few years, they'll probably fix all of this.

1976
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,840
I'm assuming I would assume maybe they won't.

1977
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,600
Maybe it'll be worse.

1978
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,560
But like, it doesn't feel like Disney has any incentive to like,

1979
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,760
it's going to be still like kind of pieced together.

1980
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,880
It's funny, this changes every few years because years and years ago

1981
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,760
it was Disney will buy Apple and now it's Apple buying.

1982
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,400
Well, everything's there's going to be two companies going forward

1983
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,440
and it's going to be helped by the political situation.

1984
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,160
Exxon Chipotle.

1985
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,640
Just as Parks and Rec.

1986
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,680
And Comcast Apple.

1987
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,200
Yeah, yeah.

1988
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,560
Let's let's brainstorm real quick on our way out here.

1989
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,600
What what do we want from the app?

1990
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,160
What do we what would we like?

1991
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,600
I mean, obviously, we're not getting what we want in the sense that like

1992
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,880
at this point, Lightning Lane going away would be awesome.

1993
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,640
Just let's let's playing field.

1994
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,520
Let's level it. Let's even it out.

1995
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,480
Yeah, I would accept that.

1996
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,480
Like, fine, great.

1997
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,800
We all have the same shot, but they're not going to do that.

1998
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,680
So what do you want from the app?

1999
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,320
What do you want to streamline everything?

2000
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:22,680
Basically, thirty six dollars a person to me is not a crazy upcharge.

2001
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:26,400
Yeah, what I would like to be included in that payment

2002
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,640
would be that I can pre book more things.

2003
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,040
Yeah, the fact that like you're you've paid for this money,

2004
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:36,800
but it is still relying on your effort on day effort.

2005
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,000
Right. Is the downside for me.

2006
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,520
So like even if it was piecemeal where it's like, OK, you've paid for it.

2007
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,480
Pre book four. Right.

2008
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:50,640
And then day of you're going to get whatever more you can.

2009
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,200
You can go, you know, you can garner whatever.

2010
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,760
But like it would be great to know those like certain times of day.

2011
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,800
We're like, OK, I'm going to get like two really big rides

2012
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,680
in the beginning of the day to give us a great start.

2013
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:06,800
And then let me get us to during the three to five, like dreariness

2014
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,440
to like give us another like boost of energy or something.

2015
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,800
We'll take a nice long lunch.

2016
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,760
I think if I could do

2017
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:17,160
if that money got me a little bit more right the time ahead,

2018
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,600
I would like that.

2019
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,680
And I want the app to have weight.

2020
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,760
I don't want the tip.

2021
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,960
The two toggles I don't like.

2022
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:28,880
What do you oh, oh, oh, as far as going back and forth from

2023
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,560
like the like whatever portal, we should say that they're like

2024
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:37,840
they'll say like enter the virtual queue and then there'll be like a port.

2025
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,200
Like there's different words for like clicking on buttons.

2026
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,680
And sometimes it'll be like enter the magic key portal.

2027
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,160
And then some things will just be a virtual queue.

2028
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,240
So there's different names for just clicking to get to another page.

2029
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,880
Like, OK, so this is my welcome, but it's not the home.

2030
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,720
Yeah. Which doesn't make any sense.

2031
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:59,400
And then like today's plans, the tipboard versus my day.

2032
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,840
Right. I don't like that.

2033
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:01,680
Oh, I see what you're saying.

2034
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,240
Like this this toggle is a bummer to me.

2035
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:09,280
So I just want it to be my day, which is my itinerary.

2036
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:14,720
Right. That has tips like maybe a genie icon on that page.

2037
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,560
I could I could click on. Right.

2038
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,600
That's like, hey, we noticed you have a gap here

2039
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,520
and you're going to be in this part of the park.

2040
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,640
Here's the two or three things that are nearest.

2041
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,800
Here's the best snack to get over there. Yeah. Yeah.

2042
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,760
You know, like going back and forth.

2043
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,640
I've watched cast members have to explain this to people. Right.

2044
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,880
Because then you go back to the tipboard and that's where it shows you

2045
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,520
current wait times.

2046
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,800
It's just not good.

2047
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,560
It's not simple.

2048
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,680
There's a little more.

2049
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:49,160
Yeah. A little more intuitiveness. Yeah. Yeah.

2050
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,960
I want yes, because like in Disney World, you can pre book

2051
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:54,880
or at least you could at some point, like book three ahead of time

2052
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,560
and then do it yourself.

2053
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,880
So it would be nice if you could do like six, because then I would feel OK.

2054
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,640
Because it is it is a thing where you pay thirty two dollars

2055
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:06,800
and you could end up like doing three in one day if you're not on top of it.

2056
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,560
Or you could do 15. Yes.

2057
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,840
So that's the problem.

2058
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,800
And it's like in some ways you were like, OK, there could be an extra tier.

2059
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,800
That's fifty dollars where I get six.

2060
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,880
But it's like we can't do that.

2061
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,320
I don't want to do that.

2062
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,360
And but it's but it's fighting my instincts.

2063
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:23,520
Or or like if you if you book, maybe you get rewarded

2064
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,360
for like having a reservation further out or whatever.

2065
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:31,520
Like, hey, if you if you book Lightning Lane two weeks before your visit,

2066
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:34,160
you get five. Yeah.

2067
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,120
Because that's probably going to benefit the planners anyway.

2068
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,840
Yeah. I don't know.

2069
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,320
Just give us a few that we get to pre book, because then that takes the like

2070
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,880
that takes the anxiety down a little bit where you're like,

2071
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,960
OK, I have some footholds.

2072
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,080
I know they're going to get on Space Mountain.

2073
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,000
Thank the Lord.

2074
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,480
Like, I don't have to like, you know, reinvent the wheel.

2075
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:01,080
Yeah. I am like this is I guess this is the silly park maybe.

2076
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,480
You know, so you get you're you're getting you're getting rewarded

2077
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,600
for purchasing a park hopper. Yeah.

2078
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,320
So you pay for Lightning Lane.

2079
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,640
You get three pre books per park that you have a ticket to.

2080
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:12,960
Yeah. Yeah.

2081
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,200
And this is a big part of the vacation experience in Florida.

2082
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,200
Like, oh, you've got like 60 days out or 45 days out.

2083
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,600
You can pre book some fast passes. Yes.

2084
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,840
And then when you use them, then you can get more. Yes.

2085
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,560
And then COVID, they use COVID to like, all right, we're getting rid of that,

2086
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,080
at least for the free level.

2087
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,760
It might not forget whether it's back a little bit.

2088
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,880
Yeah, I've got a couple of things. Sure. Go ahead.

2089
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:44,440
One thing that I find very stressful with virtual queues is

2090
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,640
it kind of doesn't account for your location, despite

2091
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:52,000
you have to have location services on.

2092
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,040
So it's like Sunday, if you book at 7 a.m., you could end up

2093
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,760
being like your virtual queues at 830 or not.

2094
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,360
And it's like, oh, we live in Los Angeles.

2095
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,080
It could take 90 minutes or two hours to get down there at park.

2096
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,280
That's impossible.

2097
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:12,400
So like if there was something in there where it's like, OK,

2098
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,920
you've got a virtual queues spot and when you get within like a mile,

2099
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,960
we'll assign you your time.

2100
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:19,840
That would be great.

2101
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,080
The other thing is that a thing we kind of learned in Florida,

2102
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,800
because we had different ticket types and we were trying to get everyone

2103
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,440
in everyone else's phone so you could try for the virtual queue

2104
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,120
for the Guardians Galaxy roller coaster.

2105
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,840
We learned this and someone eventually described it to us as like

2106
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,400
that is a fail safe.

2107
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,480
But there is a QR code in the app.

2108
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,680
And if everyone scans everyone else's app

2109
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:52,120
or everyone else's digital ticket, then you're all on everyone's phones.

2110
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:57,280
And I would like more things, more fail safes.

2111
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,160
Yeah. More fail safes.

2112
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,720
More idiot proofing, you know. OK.

2113
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:06,040
Because it took us a while of trying to get all our tickets together.

2114
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,320
Yes, that was when Scott got up and he was upset.

2115
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,400
QR codes.

2116
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,920
He was upset with too much too much app talk, which right now

2117
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,040
he's probably like in a hospital right now.

2118
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,480
The doctor's like, what's wrong with this man? His head is swollen.

2119
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,920
We can't tell. He's just screaming out in pain.

2120
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,800
He's like, people are being naughty on my podcast.

2121
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,600
Being a little naughty. Yeah.

2122
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,400
He sent a picture a little while ago and I can't talk about what it is.

2123
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,760
I'll talk about what it is.

2124
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:29,720
I saw the photo as well.

2125
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:30,960
And we'll show it to you.

2126
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,440
Really, really, really good.

2127
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,040
Well, it'll be brought up eventually.

2128
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,480
Here's the thing.

2129
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,920
I was like, I got to kind of some suggestions, but I'm like,

2130
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,280
Disney's going the way of every other business

2131
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,280
where they're just trying to suck as much money out of me.

2132
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,440
And nothing is ever going to get better.

2133
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,560
And here's a solution, I think, to the problem we're having.

2134
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,640
And it's not a great solution, but it is a solution.

2135
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:56,640
I believe there should be a group of checkers.

2136
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,080
I believe I'm a checker.

2137
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,480
This is a self-described checker.

2138
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:00,840
And there's a lot of people out there that are checkers.

2139
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,120
You're a checker as well.

2140
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,200
I think there should be a pool of checkers.

2141
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:09,600
And we sign up for slots to help other checkers on their Disneyland Day.

2142
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:14,680
So basically, say someone say you're going Thursday

2143
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,440
and I'll say and I'll say I'm going Wednesday.

2144
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:21,160
You will check for me on Wednesday from home.

2145
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:25,000
And then I will check from you, check from home for you on the Thursday.

2146
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,040
So I will get to enjoy a full, great day.

2147
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,720
But there's a person like Mission Impossible.

2148
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,600
There's a man and there's a man in the chair.

2149
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,160
There's a man in the van, a man in the chair searching for you.

2150
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,760
Now, that's going to take up a day.

2151
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,240
But it's not you still get some work done in between.

2152
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,200
But that is going to take care of the problem looking at your phone.

2153
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:48,000
So if you exchange days, I'm serious, if you want to do this, I'll do this.

2154
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,400
As long as I don't have if I'm have like somewhat of a free day,

2155
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:52,400
we could exchange checking.

2156
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,040
This is like people who vote swap.

2157
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,080
This is like people vote swap.

2158
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,840
And it's yes, it's called man in the van is good.

2159
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:01,120
I like that. That's that's a clean title for it.

2160
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:06,200
But if all the checkers band together, we could only have to pay thirty two dollars.

2161
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,480
Don't have to do the four hundred.

2162
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,240
Yes. And then from remote, because you can do it from home.

2163
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:13,360
If you gave me your log in, I can log in and still check.

2164
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,520
It doesn't matter. But the virtual queue, you'd I'd still have to be like,

2165
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,960
hey, Mike, get in the virtual queue.

2166
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,360
It's open because it's based on location, right?

2167
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,640
You know what? If you gave me your login for your app

2168
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:28,560
and you were in the park, I bet I could still pull it at noon at seven a.m.

2169
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,880
It would still be I would have to.

2170
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,680
It could be anybody could do it. Right.

2171
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:34,280
Well, the thing I haven't tried is like

2172
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,360
do pay like setting up a VPN

2173
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:42,760
and and picking like an Anaheim tricking it.

2174
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,560
Well, that's thinking you're in an Anaheim signing on from Anaheim.

2175
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,920
But it's smart enough.

2176
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,040
I wonder if it would have to be in the grounds or if it just thinks Anaheim

2177
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,120
in general. Right.

2178
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:54,800
Because I ran into this even trying to like show up

2179
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,400
for an August cantina where they're like, we can tell you're not close enough.

2180
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:01,720
Like, you know, the dining stuff, even the dining stuff.

2181
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:03,400
They're like, you're not close enough to check in.

2182
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,400
Like, I'm like, I got us a reservation.

2183
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,440
We it took us longer to get from parking.

2184
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,120
And I'm like, oh, no, no, no.

2185
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,280
And it's like, hey, go ahead and check in for your dining reservation.

2186
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,600
And they're like, you can't check in yet.

2187
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,600
You're not close enough.

2188
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,960
And I was like in downtown Disney.

2189
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,320
You know, I was like very, very close.

2190
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:22,000
McDonald's tried to do this to me when I ordered a nice coffee

2191
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,280
and I wanted it waiting for me at the counter when I got there.

2192
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,120
But they said, you're not close.

2193
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,200
And then there was an extra prompt on McDonald's app where you can say,

2194
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,120
yes, I am close. OK.

2195
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,480
So but it's not like that at Disney, I don't think. Yeah.

2196
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,520
I mean, again, it was fine.

2197
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,040
I don't know why every single time I can get into August Cantina.

2198
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:37,840
Does no one want to go there?

2199
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,960
It's not a big. Well, it's always crowded when I've been in there.

2200
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,920
But I don't know. It's not as it's not as it's really fun.

2201
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,320
Do you ever do the fuzzy tauntaun? Which one's that?

2202
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,920
That's the one that numbs your mouth.

2203
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,800
Oh, because that's Szechuan in it.

2204
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,720
Yeah, I think that's what it is. It's in the foam.

2205
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,400
And I got one a couple of weeks ago and I took like

2206
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,440
I kind of was like being so funny.

2207
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:56,640
I was being like funny.

2208
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:59,160
And I took like a bite of kind of the foam.

2209
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,800
And there was so much Szechuan or whatever in there that I just coughed.

2210
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,280
I just had a hacking cough immediately.

2211
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,800
I just like sprayed.

2212
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,000
I was like so embarrassed because it's so close quarters in there.

2213
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,040
Yeah, that's my friend.

2214
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,040
And it was fine. But I didn't get it on anybody.

2215
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,080
But like, I was like so funny.

2216
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:18,000
I was being funny because I was taking a big bite of the foam.

2217
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,280
This is huge. You can get a beer at the.

2218
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,800
Yes, and a couple of other places as well.

2219
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:25,400
You can get it at a carnation on Main Street, I believe, as well.

2220
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,440
You can get like a cocktail at Carnation now.

2221
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:29,720
This is huge for me.

2222
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,040
This is a big deal. That's a big deal for me.

2223
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:36,200
It's a limited menu because I enjoy drinking at California Adventure.

2224
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,600
There are some great places to get drinks over there.

2225
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,960
Well, yes, we are big Carthay, Manhattan guys.

2226
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:45,120
Of course, this is this is what's converted many a person

2227
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,480
that we probably all we have in common where I've people.

2228
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,520
I don't know. I go, well, come down.

2229
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,400
We'll do the day.

2230
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,000
And my general thing is midday, you go to the Carthay Lounge.

2231
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,400
You have a Manhattan. Yeah.

2232
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,400
In my younger years, you might have two. Yeah.

2233
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,600
But at least you have one.

2234
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:01,560
And then you come out of there and you're like, I did that with my two friends

2235
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,640
who got motion sick.

2236
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,960
I was like, let's go take a long break at Carthay.

2237
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,320
It was great. Yes.

2238
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:10,400
It's that's a real energizer, like reenergizer.

2239
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,200
Yeah. So anyway, I mean, yeah, there's good.

2240
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,680
Look, there's good things about the app, but it's complicated.

2241
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:17,720
And they're trying.

2242
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,600
It feels like they're trying to actively make everything feel bad.

2243
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,600
They're trying to make us feel bad. Yeah.

2244
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,920
And it would be nice if they could at least just simplify

2245
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,640
some of this stupid stuff in the app.

2246
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:29,880
If it was easier, you would have an easier time making an argument

2247
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:33,760
to your group being like, hey, someone else want to take the next turn.

2248
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:37,640
But I couldn't imagine I couldn't imagine asking my sister to do that.

2249
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,200
No. You know, we'd lose valuable time.

2250
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,160
Well, I was going to say, don't trust.

2251
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:43,600
Don't trust her. I wouldn't trust my sister to do it.

2252
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,880
She wouldn't know because she doesn't she doesn't go enough.

2253
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,040
Like that was the one time my sister-in-law

2254
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:52,200
and it was an issue where our reservations was hard to merge.

2255
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,280
We had to go get someone to help us to do it.

2256
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:56,600
I think we ended up scanning something, but it was still weird

2257
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,280
and not as easy as it should be. Right.

2258
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,040
But we were trying before when we were like, well, we just have to find

2259
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,800
some sort of bandaid for the solution.

2260
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,280
We were simul booking, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2261
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,600
Yeah. So anyway, it's nice to have a partner in the fight, but it's still

2262
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:12,880
solidarity only takes you so far.

2263
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,600
I mean, two people, two alphas can't exist in a group as well.

2264
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,240
So you have to understand, I think.

2265
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:21,120
And then she's bringing her like, you know, in Orlando, it's like this.

2266
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,920
And I'm like, listen, I appreciate that.

2267
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,560
It's great. But like you're in land now. Right.

2268
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:26,960
Put some respect on its name.

2269
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,480
You're the top dog in lands. Yeah.

2270
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:32,560
You're an alpha. You're an alpha checker like I am. Yeah.

2271
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,960
And there's there's I don't know.

2272
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,880
It would be interesting. Let's pull the audience.

2273
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,240
Who out there are alpha checkers of the group?

2274
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,880
And what what do we think the percentage of those type of people are?

2275
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:41,920
And beta checkers.

2276
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,200
What do you think you're bringing to the table?

2277
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,400
And how can I support the beta checker? I think. Oh, for sure.

2278
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:50,800
He knows how to do it to wander around and look at the landscaping.

2279
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:51,920
But you know how to do it.

2280
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,920
If I know how to do it, if I went down in a Disneyland day

2281
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,840
and I said, I can't and I'm going to be at the like first date or whatever.

2282
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:01,520
Jason, I need you to take care, like, take care of it.

2283
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,880
You would be able to do it.

2284
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:07,160
I think I have looked up stuff like I used to have your ticket.

2285
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:10,280
But you will say you will let me be an alpha checker on a day.

2286
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,240
Yo, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2287
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,480
But Scott, we wouldn't.

2288
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,800
He doesn't want any part of it.

2289
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,080
He would kind of reluctantly do it.

2290
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:19,760
But like, yeah, you're a beta checker and then he's whatever.

2291
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,240
Give me another letter in Greek.

2292
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,240
Yeah, yeah. Delta.

2293
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:26,800
He's a delta checker.

2294
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,480
It's pretty far down. That's so.

2295
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,400
Yeah. Anyway, we'll let us know.

2296
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,480
We'll post a poll on whatever social media.

2297
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:34,640
I don't know what social media to use.

2298
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,440
Also, this is a big debate going on.

2299
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:39,840
It's the whole thing of like, do we stay on the thing with the guy?

2300
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:40,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2301
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:41,760
Do we stay on the thing with the guy?

2302
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,160
I don't know. I left the thing before the guy.

2303
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:48,840
I've been off the thing with the guy with the guy for like,

2304
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,880
I think, like five years.

2305
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:51,920
Wow, really? Yeah.

2306
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:55,840
So I'm a other guy is also.

2307
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,960
I heard the other guy isn't good either.

2308
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:58,720
He's not good either.

2309
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:01,400
But right now, he's a little less bad.

2310
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,520
And also the the actual like

2311
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,680
discourse is a little less bad.

2312
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,240
Yeah, for now. For now.

2313
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,600
Because everything gets bad, too.

2314
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:14,520
How do you spend much of your day mad about things out of your control?

2315
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:18,600
Well, then I fell into like I did get on threads a little bit.

2316
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,880
Oh, threads.

2317
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,800
Which is still pretty bad.

2318
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:24,560
But it's very echo chamber in a different way.

2319
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,840
You know, which is, you know, different.

2320
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:33,320
But no, I had gotten sort of post 2016

2321
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,320
and then maybe a couple more years after that,

2322
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:41,760
I had whittled it back down to just Instagram to try to to try to be like,

2323
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:46,120
it's impossible to be a comedian right now and not have a social media.

2324
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:51,160
But I can limit how many I have so that I'm not spending that much time on them.

2325
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:53,560
Sure. I like looking at the pretty picture.

2326
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:57,400
Yes. So in my like good moments, I'm I'm only on Instagram

2327
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,880
and I try to put a timer on it.

2328
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,920
OK. Well, we'll talk.

2329
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:01,760
I'll figure it out.

2330
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,400
See, I'm just not against I'm against being on my phone in general, which is why.

2331
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:07,120
Yeah. Like good for you.

2332
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,160
I'm trying and they're making it hard.

2333
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,680
Anytime I go to anything that wants me to have an every single unique airline,

2334
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,160
I have to have their app every day.

2335
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:18,240
Like I just reject that they all need to be apps.

2336
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:21,080
You know, like, yeah, but they really do make it easier.

2337
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,120
It sucks. Yeah.

2338
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,400
Yeah. If there was just like a magic band for all airlines.

2339
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,880
Yeah. With a little plane on it.

2340
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:31,160
I just want to be able to log in, get my ticket on a browser window

2341
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,920
and then upload it to my Apple Wallet.

2342
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,880
Yeah, that's what you mostly can do.

2343
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,160
But a lot of times they're like,

2344
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:40,960
but don't you want the American Airlines proprietary app?

2345
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:44,040
Yeah. She's like, no, I don't need this shit.

2346
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:49,440
I tried because you can technically get your airline ticket on the Apple Watch.

2347
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,160
And I tried it one like they saw me going to do it.

2348
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:58,960
And I swear I heard a like they're like, it's not kind of OK.

2349
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,480
It on the fifth try worked.

2350
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,560
I think in the next 10 years, like it will.

2351
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,000
There will be some like, I don't know if it'll be like the guy.

2352
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,200
The guy invented the thing in the in your neural link or whatever.

2353
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,160
I don't know if it'll be that.

2354
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:14,120
But there will be like something like it's a chip in your like wrist

2355
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,920
and everything's just in the chip wrist.

2356
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,520
Not for me. Yeah.

2357
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,720
But you're going to it's mandatory.

2358
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,280
Damn it. Yeah. OK.

2359
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,000
I guess for me, that's going to be.

2360
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,800
Yeah. The chip app is going to be intolerable.

2361
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:29,840
I don't think I knew this about myself, like as a young person.

2362
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:34,200
But I'm like, I have no tech like design.

2363
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,600
I'm not an early adult. I'm basically a Luddite.

2364
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,280
I will do what I have to do.

2365
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,160
But I'm like, no, I don't want that.

2366
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,320
I don't want any of that.

2367
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:43,920
Well, it will be a law.

2368
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,720
So it will be a law.

2369
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,920
There'll be a law in the next four years.

2370
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,040
In the next four years, they're going to get to chip law.

2371
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,000
There'll be a chip law.

2372
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,280
What about the chips act?

2373
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,840
Unrelated. Different.

2374
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,280
All right. Well, thank you, Jess McKenna.

2375
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,680
You've survived podcasts to ride app talk.

2376
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,360
Boy, it feels good to be naughty, doesn't it?

2377
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,880
Talking about apps like this.

2378
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,120
Please exit to the gift shop. Plug away.

2379
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:12,640
What do you got going on?

2380
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:15,720
You know, you can still always listen to off book podcasts,

2381
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:18,000
even though we don't do weekly studio apps.

2382
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,760
We got some new live apps that are up and we're touring.

2383
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,600
So you can check those dates out.

2384
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,600
There's a link in my bio at Jess, Jess McKenna on Instagram.

2385
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:31,840
The one I'm on or off book on any socials.

2386
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,480
Yeah. Yeah. Come come see off book live.

2387
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:37,480
It's fun. Yeah, it's great.

2388
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,760
So, yeah, go. Yeah. Instagram.

2389
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,880
Jess, Jess McKenna. Yeah.

2390
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,200
And is there an off book as well?

2391
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,680
And there is. Yeah. OK.

2392
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,520
I mean, like, OK. Yeah.

2393
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:47,680
Yeah. So go check that out.

2394
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:51,920
As for us, we're on the stuff with the guy at podcast, the ride.

2395
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:55,720
And we're on Instagram at podcast, the ride, but patron dot com slash podcast.

2396
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,720
The ride. There's more app talk this month as well.

2397
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:03,000
Different things. Jason and I are really spreading our wings out here. Yeah.

2398
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:05,400
And getting rowdy with it.

2399
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,880
Crazy. Yeah, it's just agreeing.

2400
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,400
And it sounded like a judgment.

2401
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:14,480
And honestly, in the last few weeks, there's been app talk as far as phone

2402
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:18,880
apps and appetizer talk as Jason started talking about chili's appetizer

2403
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,880
and cheese planks and how there's something going viral where people do a cheese

2404
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,560
pull, you know, at the cheese.

2405
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,240
If you are, she's not on social media as much, but Jason was informing me

2406
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:30,360
because he's the one who checks in the most that the teens are going.

2407
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,880
Teens or just people in general are going wild.

2408
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,120
I lost track of all the age group.

2409
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,240
They're doing a cheese pull.

2410
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:39,120
So it's like a phenomenon going on where they do a cheese pull

2411
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:40,920
with like a cheese plank at a chili's.

2412
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:44,360
Well, the cheese pull is kind of agnostic to anywhere.

2413
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,120
Jason was using the term cheese plank to describe a mozzarella stick.

2414
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:50,960
I kept hearing it on TikTok because the chili's mozzarella

2415
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:56,480
sticks are kind of like rectangles as opposed to round, cylindrical.

2416
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:59,720
Yeah. And so it's just how good of a pull you can get.

2417
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:01,280
Yeah. You got to ask this guy.

2418
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,600
But you get a good pull.

2419
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,600
But I never thought those were that good.

2420
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,360
So I guess I have to revisit.

2421
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,480
You have to revisit and we have to get you to go viral.

2422
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:09,880
Yep. I guess so.

2423
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:12,400
Yeah. So we're going to Chili's.

2424
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:27,000
Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner, Brett Boehm, Joe Cilio and Alex Ramsey.
