1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your porch has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's all go to City Walk

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tonight, tonight...

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Folks, let's quantify our situation at the moment

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
As opposed to the usual leisurely, you know, Saturday afternoon recordings

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The kind of things we do, it is 12.30am

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Which is late for us, that's not terribly impressive

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But yeah, the way we're setting it up is like, guys, it's 5am, oh my god, I can't believe what we're doing

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But it is like 12.30am, which is like a reasonable bedtime, but still for us

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, when you run it through the early 30s, you know, time zones, it's definitely...

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
12.30am is the new 5.30am

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, the French champagne is a...

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We know a little place near where Mrs. Buckley lives, oh

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The French, hey, so I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson's here, Jason Sheridan's here

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm somewhere

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, what we're trying to get out is that this evening we went to Howl at the Moon

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The dueling piano bar at City Walk

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And we made the very specific choice to do this one, kind of inebriated

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And again, to set the scale, 12.30am as opposed to 5.30am

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Which for a younger person would be more insane

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What are the level of drinks that we've had? For me, it's three beers and some sips of your blue nightmare

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So yeah, I ordered a mini bucket, which is like a bucket of just like five different kinds of liquor

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I drank a lot of it, I feel like, but I'm doing okay, we're having a beer now

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Which is a little scandalous as well, like we've never drank on the show before

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I'm like, I'm one Coors Light, one bucket of blue and one other, like one eighth of a beer in now

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I had a double vodka soda and then a regular vodka soda and like killed the rest of that bucket

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, you finished the bucket, Scott was like, we gotta get out of here

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And then I was like, I have a bucket to finish

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You had a little more

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Jason was like, I'll help you finish the bucket

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I ate the two cherries, I ate the two maraschina cherries

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And I saw you putting your hands in the bucket to retrieve the cherries

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And I was like, I am out

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't even like the idea of somebody using a straw in the same bucket because somebody could spit, could find its way down the straw

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You had a problem with that and we almost avoided the bucket area altogether

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But then we ended up all using three curly straws and went into that one bucket

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We had a mini bucket

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Which was still a mini bucket

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I can't imagine

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh shit, we left the bucket up there

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I know, we forgot to take the bucket

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
God damn it, we were told we could keep the bucket

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is not like the Good Boys at all

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, this is as bad as you're gonna hear us

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is, yeah, if you want to hear Good Boys after dark, you arrived in the correct sector

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But you know what, before we go much further, though I announced Howl at the Moon

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And we should hear the official sector lineup from our good friend, the Sector Keeper

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Boys, boys, today's sector is Sector 15

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Karl Strauss, Howl at the Moon, BB Kings, and John Lovett's Comedy Club

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And boys, please don't drink irresponsibly

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Good luck, boys!

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Alright, so there you have it

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And what this sector is, is nightlife

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If you have not been to CityWalk LA yourself

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You know that on the ground is where the squares can be found

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But up on level two, much drunken fun for you

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And that's what, we're covering basically the nightclub drinking zone

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah, so

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And not only the clubs that are there currently, which are not many

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But also the clubs of CityWalk past

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Right, so like this is, I'll be honest with you guys, I have not partied a lot at CityWalk

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I love CityWalk, I've been there, I've been going there for many years

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But nightlife-wise, whether it be Saddle Ranch, whether it be Howl at the Moon

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Not a lot of experience, never been like, you know, a young person enjoying life at this place

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, I have to give credit to Karl Strauss, because I've been to Karl Strauss a few times over the years

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I feel like when I first moved to LA, like my college friends, when their parents would come to town

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And we'd go up to like Universal and CityWalk with them

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Karl Strauss was like the place we would end up, it's reliable

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You know, the folks can get a nice beer, a nice local California beer

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I remember Karl Strauss, the few, many years I've gone to Comic Con, I've taken the Pacific Surfliner down

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You go by a Karl Strauss facility on the way, the way to the ocean, beautiful ride, the Pacific Surfliner

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Decent food, I will say Karl Strauss, I have a very funny memory of like one of the times my family was visiting

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
They drove up from staying at Disneyland, and I rode with them, and it took so long to get up from Anaheim

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We got to Karl, like we checked in at Hilton at Universal

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And we're like, alright, let's go eat at CityWalk, and okay, Karl Strauss is pretty good, let's go there

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We got there at like 8.30, 8.35, and they're like, oh, we already did a last call, sorry, we close at 9, last call's at 8.30

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And it was just like us in a very boisterous 12 person party, and we just had to miserably eat like fried chicken sandwiches

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And like cheeseburgers with fried eggs on top, like

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Karl Strauss is, I was saying nightlife specifically, and Karl Strauss, which I've been too many times, yes, does not have nightlife

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You don't go to hang out and party at Karl Strauss

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But it's in the nightlife

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's in the section, I agree, because it's up the stairs, and it occupies some of the area that Wizards at one point did

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The sectors get real muddy around this point, because we talked about Wizards a while ago, we talked about Abercrombie a while ago

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm not even sure why this one's later, I guess by the way, because we're going off of the official CityWalk map numbers

95
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's why

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's only the second story, two Camachos occupies the first floor

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And now, Camachos, I would put next to Karl Strauss in terms of actual restaurants

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
They're right next to each other, one's right on top of the other, and these, you know, I think we've come to find

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Overdoing these episodes that a lot of, in some cases, the best you can expect out of a CityWalk restaurant is it's a good impression of a regular restaurant

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, reliable

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
These ones are actually good

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, I think it surprised all of us

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Karl Strauss, pretty good

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We didn't go there specifically for this, but I recall having good food experiences in the past

106
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, we've eaten at Karl Strauss together, Jason and I, Scott and I have eaten together, Jason and I have eaten at Karl Strauss

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We've all had many meals at Karl Strauss, and we're always like, ah, pretty good

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Pretty good

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And it's, yeah, it's good up there, it's good as a beer truck at California Adventure

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, that's one of the ones

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If anybody who's not been to California Adventure, that's really, you know, my number one and two of California Adventure experiences are the winery and the Karl Strauss beer truck

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's a funny, yeah, we've talked about crossovers before, like Starbucks is at both, Sephora is now at both, Karl Strauss at both properties

113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I'm not going to complain about it because a couple nights ago I learned about the man himself, Karl Strauss

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Do you know anything about Karl Strauss?

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, please

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I've read a little about the founders, but I don't think he was one of the, was he? He wasn't one of the founders, was he?

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, he was kind of prodded out of retirement into starting what became Karl Strauss Brewing Company or whatever it is officially

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Here's a little bit of, here's some drunk history on my part, I'll stumble through this

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But basically, Karl Strauss was studying to be a master brewer in Munich, Germany in the 20s and the 30s, and he graduated

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He like apprenticed with many great beer makers and was like a particularly gifted master brewer

121
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But he, by the time he was out and trying to get work, it's the dead center of World War II

122
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And he is Jewish and a Jewish person is not getting hired to work at a brewery in Germany

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And things escalate and he fleeds, fleeds?

124
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Flees?

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Flees, that would be correct

126
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That might be what it is

127
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm butchering this great man's story

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, you're hammered is why

129
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That is part of it, yes

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Anyway, he escapes, his family does not escape, Karl, like other members of the Strauss family do not make it out of Nazi Germany

131
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He does, he goes straight to Milwaukee and applies for a job at the Pabst Brewing Company

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He does just like real grunt work feeding bottles into a bottling machine

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And then they realize, wait a minute, we have a Bavarian brewmaster in our employ, we have to make use of this

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He ends up working there for 44 years

135
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's incredible

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And he rises up through the ranks from just feeding bottles into a machine to being a person actually affecting the recipe of Pabst Blue Ribbon

137
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He retires in by, I want to say 1980 or early 80s

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He consults for a lot of great other beer companies

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And is, you know, in his elder years and has nothing to prove, just an established great beer dude

140
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And in the late 80s, his cousin wanted to open a new brewery in San Diego

141
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He dove in so headfirst that he designed the facility, he trained everybody, he created the original recipes

142
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And he became their spokesman in radio ads, which he did until he passed away in 2006

143
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He died at 94

144
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
My God

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A storied beer making career

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm just so impressed by this tale

147
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He lands in America in 1939, escapes the Nazis, and has an unbelievable run in the beer industry

148
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And suddenly what goes from a competent restaurant at City Walk and a nice beer truck at California Adventure goes to, oh my God, I have immense respect for this person and his tale

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Wow

150
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's fascinating

151
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I mean, even just reading about the two guys who started the brewery, their whole thing was like, well, we live in San Diego, there's not really a beer culture

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
There's certainly not a local beer culture

153
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And that seems wild now because I think San Diego, living out here, I think San Diego, I think Carl Strauss, I think Ballast Point especially has really grown a lot in a number of years

154
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And yeah, craft breweries in general just across the country are huge

155
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Also shout out to Brian Roth, my college roommate, award winning beer writer

156
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Wow, really?

157
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He writes a lot about beer

158
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I've shipped him beer from a local brewery, Golden Road, out here because beverage distribution is still very segmented

159
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like you can't, like I really like Yingling, like Pride of Pennsylvania, Yingling beer, can't really get it out here in California because beverage distribution is so regional specific

160
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Sure, I studied abroad in Dusseldorf, Germany

161
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh really?

162
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I got to spend four months out there and their swill beer was so mind-blowingly great

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And I got to go there when I could not legally drink in America, I went and studied abroad at 20

164
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And I can drink and I can sit along this beautiful waterfront and for one euro get a gigantic really crazy good beer

165
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This one called Frankenheim especially I really miss and everybody in that study abroad program really likes pines for Frankenheim

166
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah

167
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, it's a bummer

168
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
These things have to cross borders more

169
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Was that your first beer or had you had a beer before that?

170
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No, I started drinking, I wasn't quite, I wasn't cool enough in high school necessarily

171
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Senior year I started to get kind of pissed off so at 17 and I remember, but I didn't know how to do it and I was kind of dependent on my parents alcohol

172
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So I remember like sneaking water bottles into high school and drinking in a class at 1.30 in the afternoon

173
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But that being like gin, like pure gin with no mixer

174
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Wow, that's a bad boy thing to do

175
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That is also like an interpretation of like I don't know how to do this, I guess I'll do it at 1.30 afternoon during classes

176
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And gin which you're you know in some respects it's a little bad boy but in some respects it's pretty grandma

177
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Also never meant to be drank on its own I feel like gin, like you don't hear like one gin meat please

178
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, I had a lot of drinking growing pains and I definitely remember having pure gin in my like childhood bedroom and then just vomiting it up instantly

179
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Cause yeah, you don't ever, especially, gin's maybe number one on the list of what you don't drink on its own

180
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That is one of the first things I drank but I remember being really into gin gimlets a lot when I first drank

181
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Which I would have to, bartenders would say like in college down in Ithaca

182
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You and the other retirees that you were drinking with

183
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Me and the rest of the supporting cast of Chinatown would have to explain like gin, gimlet is just one part alcohol, one part like lime juice

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, that's what that is? That sounds great

185
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's it, served over ice, so like you hear vodka gimlets too or gin gimlets and it's like very simple to make but most people don't order them

186
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And now the idea of drinking that sounds disgusting to me because there's no carbonation

187
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's sickeningly sweet because most places don't have real lime juice, they have rosa's lime juice which is just mostly sugar

188
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Whereas if you can just get a lime wedge and squeeze it

189
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That's fine

190
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Into your beverage

191
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah, that's wonderful

192
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Gin and tonic, gin and soda

193
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:43,000
If we're generally on the topic of drinking as it relates to us, we obviously, you know, we'll cover it thoroughly at some point

194
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But the Carthay Circle restaurant that we're very fond of

195
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Delightful

196
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What is that drink that is like Walt's Scotch Mist?

197
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's what I order

198
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What's in a Scotch Mist?

199
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's funny because that menu has changed like when it first opened it was like Walt's drink of choice

200
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Dark Scotch and light Scotch which I've never seen light Scotch before

201
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But it was like two Scotches over ice with a twist and it's very nice

202
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I feel like it's a very easy way to drink Scotch because Scotch is kind of a harsh liquor

203
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But now I feel like it just says Scotch over ice with a twist

204
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You mean it doesn't say Walt anymore?

205
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No, it still says Walt but I don't think it's, I think they've just gone to like one kind of Scotch

206
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I see what you're saying

207
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I was thinking they took the branding off of it because it does seem weird that you'd be like

208
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Here's what Walt would drink to get hammered every night

209
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I feel like Walt would drink anything also

210
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Like he came of age in a time where people were just like drinking all the time

211
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
He survived the depression

212
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He drank for any reason

213
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah, we have no excuse

214
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We aren't surviving

215
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
We have an excuse, we have a theme park podcast and we decided to do a 19 part series and it involves Howl at the Moon

216
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Well, I mean, yeah, drinking certainly necessary to counter the other effects of Howl at the Moon

217
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I am, I mean just in general this many times up at City Walk recently, what are we on now?

218
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Sector 15

219
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Like I do like, it's crazy how like it's part elation being at City Walk and it's also part dread

220
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, there's like short aspects every time but I've had a lot of good times

221
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I've had a lot of good times

222
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I was walking with Lindsay tonight and we saw a movie before Howl at the Moon

223
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And I said, you know what, it doesn't bother me, I like this, I don't know

224
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I've been up here a lot lately, I'm happy with it, I would have done this if we weren't doing a series

225
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
As everyone knows here, I'm a bottomless pit for things that I like

226
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And I thought maybe by Sector 15, oh my god, I'm gonna hate this place, but no, not really

227
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Only food wise am I wearing down because just pure sodium fuck

228
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You're not getting out of City Walk alive

229
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Do we close with Howl at the Moon? Should we go into the past?

230
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let's go to the past

231
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Let's talk about the, hold on, let's go on to

232
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So BB Kings and John Lovitz have a lot going on, but I gotta say, we've been up there a lot of times recently

233
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I feel like every time I've been up there I've heard this song and I shazam'd it a different way

234
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
DJ Snake featuring Law

235
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Can you play that for us?

236
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No, well I just had the screen grab

237
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
No, we know

238
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Shazam, I gotta find it now

239
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You a lot have heard this song?

240
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Every time we've gone up there

241
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Tell me the name of the song and I'll play it on my Apple Music

242
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's called A Different Way

243
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
A Different Way

244
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
By DJ Snake

245
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
DJ Snake

246
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You do?

247
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah, yeah, I've heard of him

248
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I mean this is a classic theme park trope, you have a loop, you have like, it's an amount of music

249
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Usually played for 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, maybe an hour

250
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And, cause you're not gonna linger in an area necessarily so you won't hear it repeat

251
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And City Walk, like, I have heard a lot of A Different Way

252
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I've heard a lot of Jimmy Buffett

253
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's the ad playing

254
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, I had to go to YouTube

255
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I've heard a lot of Despacito, like, you know, these songs repeat

256
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
By Rock is in the House

257
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
A Different Way has a sample of like an Indian pop song

258
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So, but immediately I got off the trolley tram from Liker's Rim

259
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And I heard this song and this is not the first time I've done that

260
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
On the tram?

261
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Just like tears in the eyes of a man

262
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Sounds like a City Walk song

263
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh baby I'll be right here

264
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Between sea and silence

265
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So breathe easy my dear

266
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You can find sunshine in the rain

267
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This is the kind of song you should only listen to if you're not aware of other music

268
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
By the way, we have to, it's been playing long enough that we owe the money

269
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
God, get it out of here

270
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I wanna wait for the

271
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Jump to the bridge

272
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This is

273
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm not giving a cent to DJ Snake

274
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah, DJ Snake, we'll have to edit this out

275
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So I've heard that a lot

276
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So B.B. King's and John Mendes

277
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Did you hear it, but was that just on the tram?

278
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:45,000
As soon as, no, I said on the tram was an ad for Margueriteville and then an ad for Despicable Me, Minion Mayhem

279
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Including Minion stalking in their nonsense language

280
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And then as soon as I walked off the tram I started hearing that song

281
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Okay

282
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah, it's fine, it's a fine like song

283
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You're gonna hear your fave pop hits in the nightclub sector

284
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What they stopped playing is my old favorite like when I was here like 10 years ago at City Walk

285
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You would just hear like a voice at the big screen at the City Walk stage

286
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You'd hear like, express yourself, City Walk

287
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Like it was a weird whispery like ad for City Walk at City Walk

288
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Do you guys feel like you expressed yourselves tonight at City Walk?

289
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah, I mean, I honestly, this is getting ahead of ourselves

290
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I feel like I never got quite comfortable enough to express myself, but I feel like I got close

291
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Do you ever feel like you're comfortable enough to express yourself?

292
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's a good question, maybe at like a wedding

293
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Once in a while at a wedding, you're far away from where you live, it's like 2am and you've had more drinks

294
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Emotions flying high

295
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Emotions flying high, then you feel like you really like let it out

296
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Well guys, I tried to get you out on the dance floor at Howl at the Moon

297
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And I felt a lot of resistance and Jason bailed entirely

298
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I danced pretty quickly

299
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I was trying to get my groove on to Earth, Wind and Fire's September

300
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Here's the closest thing to the kind of music I would like at Howl at the Moon

301
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Here's what was going through, I know we're going to not close with Howl at the Moon, I guess

302
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Here's what was going through my head

303
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I had ordered, we had ordered a giant blue bucket

304
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Because everyone knows I drink a lot of neon colored drinks

305
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And everybody had a sip of it

306
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And then you were like, I'll leave it there, it'll be fine

307
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And three, we were with our friend Andrew Grissom

308
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You guys all left, went to the dance floor

309
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And I looked at that bucket and I went, I'm not going to drink this if it leaves my sight

310
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And that's another paranoia thing I have

311
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I was thinking somebody's going to drug me, someone's going to roofy me

312
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This is a classic Howl at the Moon scenario

313
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Way too much to unpack there, just too much

314
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
If a fan of the podcast is going to

315
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
No, I didn't say a fan would do it, but maybe a rival podcast perhaps

316
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
They're also at Howl at the Moon

317
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The Bumper Car Boys perhaps were following us

318
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So I said, let me pick up the bucket, I'll take it on the dance floor

319
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It'll be funny, it'll be a funny photo op

320
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But then of course it restricted my movement when it comes to dancing

321
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I like, you know, in a loud place dancing

322
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I like, I enjoy that, but I felt like I was very wooden, so I apologize

323
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I liked being there, it just, I felt very restrictive

324
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Also very early in the night too, so I was not properly loosened up

325
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Sure, Jason maybe not into it at all

326
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I lingered for a bit on the dance floor, but I realized like

327
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, I want to see what the smoking area is

328
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And that had an interesting development

329
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, but that sounds like it's a, your brain was like, how do we get out of here?

330
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
What's the justification?

331
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, yes, I also didn't want to be there

332
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
There you go, thank you, that's what I'm saying

333
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Let's build to that though

334
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Let's look at the smokers area

335
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So BB King's

336
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We're going back now?

337
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't think any of us, yeah, I want to go back

338
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I never got to go

339
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I don't think we have much on BB King's

340
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
BB King's gone for a while

341
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah, never went

342
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Gone pre-John Lovett's Comedy Club, which opened in 2009

343
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Did anyone ever visit BB King's?

344
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
No, nope

345
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Okay

346
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Do I have any notes about it?

347
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I don't know if I do

348
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The joke I always heard, there's a BB King's I think at Times Square in New York

349
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And I always heard like, a lot of dates at that one featuring BB King

350
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Like, not a lot of other people

351
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I don't really know who played City Walk Hollywood

352
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What do you have on that?

353
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's like the Smash Club in San Francisco

354
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Primarily played by Jesse and the Rippers

355
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm not sure there were any other acts besides Jesse and the Rippers at the Smash Club

356
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't really have anything

357
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You know what I have is, we're missing a couple clubs we haven't really called out in Fallen Brother past

358
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The Rumba Room

359
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Which I took a little photo of, whatever it is now, I think it's just cubicles

360
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I took a picture just kind of above the wall and they just put universal employees in there now

361
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But there was something called the Rumba Room

362
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And they were ejected from the space and there were cries of racism in doing so

363
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
They claimed that, you know, we always pay it on time and I don't know why this would

364
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But the next club that opened was called Infusion Lounge and that was also minority owned

365
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But there was like General Hubbub, like B.B. King apparently also were ejected in a weird way

366
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And they came out and spoke for the Rumba Room and said, I don't know, there's maybe something systematic going on at City Walk

367
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And they denied it and I found all this stuff at the movie theater too

368
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's where I get actually interested in the odd politics of this place

369
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And, you know, as a microcosm of the city at large, you know, people feeling disrespected or chased out or whatever it is

370
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Andy Camacho, owner of Camacho's Cantina, advocated for the Rumba Room and was upset about them getting kicked out

371
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So I don't know, yeah, you know, you think you're just going to talk about places that serve hot dogs and s'mores or whatever

372
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But there's some real shit's happened up at City Walk, I'll tell you

373
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That does feel like an actual, like, you know, we've talked about it being a simulated street or a simulated like area of L.A.

374
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But it's like that does feel like L.A. where you're like, well, this is L.A.

375
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
This is a liberal, you know, left leaning enclave

376
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But that also just means like, oh, well, the racism is just much like below. It's much deeper.

377
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's just much it's still there. It's just like weirdly coded.

378
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And I remember even I looked up like, oh, wait, does Howl at the Moon have a weird like racist dress code?

379
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Because any club and not kind of not real any nightclub

380
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
They let Mike in with his flamingo shirt. No problem. That's true. Yeah. But I'm a white man.

381
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, that's true. Any nightclub that like gets a long list of the dress code, like once they start hitting like no jerseys, no duress

382
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
like that. Do you find that? Yeah, it's a dog whistle. It's like a weird, iffy territory.

383
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And Howl at the Moon did not full disclosure did not have that. Oh, OK. Oh, OK.

384
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I think there was something like no overly baggy clothes or like they may have said no jerseys, but it seemed like

385
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I don't know. It seemed a little odd, but like plenty of people in all sorts of dress in there.

386
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It wasn't like. Yeah, people were dressed including a Captain EO shirt. Anybody see that?

387
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah, shout out to the guy in the Captain EO shirt. I thought about tapping him on the shoulder asking what's up, but I didn't want to bother him.

388
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah, no, he was probably enjoying there was somebody. There was one Michael Jackson song played tonight, I think. Really? Yeah.

389
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I think it was what, Billie Jean? I lost track of music. I heard a hey-yah. There was a hey-yah, yeah.

390
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I wrote some down. Yeah, Outkast Roses. That was a deep cut. The more deeper tracks on Love Below.

391
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yes, that was crazy because I look we're going back to what apparently we're doing now is that hold on.

392
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Hold on. I got to use the bathroom. Oh, my God. To throw up or to pee. All right.

393
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Please. What do you mean, please? I've seen you throw up on the Franklin Street. I'm leaving all this in.

394
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm leaving all this in. I'm going to talk about Jason while he's gone. All right. Scott's eating Pringles right now.

395
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah, Jason, I did not want to dance. A little disappointed by that. Yeah.

396
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Which, again, I agree. I was not I was not fully in like is it a self-consciousness? I think maybe.

397
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I mean, it was I think you went to the dance for too early, honestly. I think it was like an hour and everyone was a little looser.

398
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But what really are you doing there? You're walking around. You're kind of waving your arms.

399
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I was fine. I would have stood awkwardly all night with the little bucket full of blue liquids.

400
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I just maybe didn't look so comfortable. I guess I guess I recognize that people are self-conscious about dancing.

401
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah. And yet I don't. I truly I like it. I enjoy it. I like a douchey Vegas pool dancing.

402
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I like a wedding dancing like any time there's loud music and there's people standing up and being excited about it.

403
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm totally on board with it. So not Jason, but not Jason. That's fair. I mean, a lot of more blue shit in his system too.

404
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah, I was worried he was he got mad at me because he had a double vodka at the start of the night.

405
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And I was like, you better be careful, buddy. And he was like acting like I was his like dad or something.

406
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But to be fair, you know, I find from afar watching your relationship, I find a lot of family member roles traded around.

407
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What does he call me about? Usually my relationship with Jason is that he kind of is like a neighbor who like kind of looks over the fence at me and is like, oh, looks like he's bought a new car.

408
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh, that's accurate. That's a big thing with him. Not that I bike. I have the same car for eight years.

409
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm just saying that's a general thing of like, oh, new shirt, huh? Must be doing well.

410
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Like, that's a general Jason with me relationship. But what have you noticed otherwise of the between the two of us?

411
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We were in the car on the way to the Pirates Dinner Adventure and everybody was talking.

412
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You were talking about it was like the rent a car situation. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I know what it was.

413
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It was you. It was I was saying that I was about to go to Disney World and that I had made, you know, six or seven restaurant reservations and that like, you know, these are hard.

414
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Some of these are hard to get. And I didn't know exactly where we would be on a certain day.

415
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So I made a bunch of them and then I would cancel them as we get closer. And he was like, well, you know, they they use those reservations to, you know, really know who's coming into the restaurant.

416
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So I go, I understand that I go, I'm going to be canceling. And he goes, but, you know, you really should you really should cancel those.

417
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And like, Lindsay even was like, Jason, he's going to cancel. Like, he just booked a lot and it's fine. And you were like, OK, but in my memory, Jason said, Michael,

418
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
he used your full name. There was a real back now so he can hold.

419
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You guys can talk. You did keep talking. I thought that was a joke. Yeah, we're loose.

420
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I mean, I think like I was concerned about other people trying to get those. I was also a little stoned on that try down.

421
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You always said we were just a comic. Yeah, you were you were sucking some weird shit at the at the Pirates Dinner Adventure.

422
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You were when you forgot there was a part of the Pirates Dinner Adventure where they came out on zip lines.

423
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And then after the fact that went, oh, you remember when the pirates came out and zip lines, you're like, what?

424
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What are you talking about? I was like the men over your head zipped over.

425
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You're like, I do not remember that. Like this is before the show, though.

426
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
This is in the bar area. They were all yelling. Oh, that was the bar area.

427
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The pre show was a mess. We were just a comic con and we were trying to get into a party.

428
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And you were like, you called me a beta. And then like I was like, well, I was very high.

429
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
What are you talking about? And then you're like, well, I was a little stoned.

430
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So like that seems to be a very common excuse for you. That's all I'm saying. That's true.

431
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It is a good card by a party we couldn't get into. That's not true until your alpha friend got us in.

432
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I think I've said on a different episode that if I am high, I just announced that I am high.

433
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I am not at ease with it remotely. So I could relate to you on this level.

434
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And if anything odd is said, I pointed immediately back to that I am high.

435
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Sure. Yeah. Thankfully, I mean, we haven't built like the foundation of this podcast on like us being high guys.

436
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Like that would be no, my God. Like it's hard to schedule.

437
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And I have I have not been high at a theme park ever. Never. Me neither. Yeah.

438
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I would never I would never have you high boy. Oh, I bet he did.

439
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Universal Hollywood briefly is bad. But I was like, I was cranky. Oh, I guess I.

440
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And now I think about it if we're talking to Hollywood because I gave you candy.

441
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah, because my friend who came out is like a big, like you weren't happy about it.

442
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
No, I wasn't unhappy about it. He was like, let's take a little bit this man.

443
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And then like we went in the House of Horrors. Shady dude.

444
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Well, I'm exaggerating. He's not that shady.

445
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
We went in the House of Horrors, man. We were in the House of Horrors and it was they've torn it down, whatever it was called.

446
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But they've torn it down. It wasn't great.

447
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But it was six like six minutes of just teenagers jumping out and scaring you when I friggin hated all of it.

448
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Chuckie came out, he slashed a knife at my friend's throat and I like lost my mind.

449
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
This is two years ago. Also, this is not like when I was still scarred. Yeah.

450
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So that was horrible. I have a similar House of Horror story.

451
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I went through like the very first time when I was first I've been out here like a month in L.A.

452
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I hate it going through it. My friends dragged me through it and I thought it was done.

453
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It was over. And then at the end, you go through a curtain and they launch a werewolf at you like the guy.

454
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Werewolf? A cannon? It looks like a catapult, I assume.

455
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
He's on a court. He's on a court. So they pull him back.

456
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But like he jumps out at you and he did it right when I was walking through.

457
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I don't remember that. And then they pulled him back. That must have been a thing.

458
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It was like a fake out. They must have arranged that for you specifically because I do not recall launching a werewolf at me.

459
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
All right. Well, let's talk about. That was a hallucination. It didn't happen at all.

460
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Potentially. So let's talk. Should we talk about the crown jewel of this sector?

461
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Should the John Lovett's Comedy Club? Yeah, baby.

462
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yes. Long gone. Let's. Let's do it. I'd love it.

463
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'd love it. Opened in 2009, closed abruptly in 2014 due to an unpleasant business dispute between two partners.

464
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So let's. Yeah. To back you up, there was a club called the John Lovett's Comedy Club.

465
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And if you lived in Los Angeles around this time, you may have seen some advertisements that were him smiling at a big old Hawaiian shirt tarp.

466
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah. And not the only comedy club owned by a comic. Let's not forget Danger Fields or the Atlantic City Institution.

467
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It only lasted about like three or four years. Club Piscopo, the club owned in resorts Atlantic City, run by Joe Piscopo.

468
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Club Piscopo is Atlantic City's newest comedy club dedicated to delivering a retro style comedy club and jazz lounge.

469
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Was. Did Lovett's own his comedy club? Well, it was a co-investment between Lovett's and another guy named Frank Kelly.

470
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah. Yeah. And things did not end well. Right. There was a lawsuit that transpired.

471
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,000
If we're getting into the lawsuit. Hold on. Let me. I've got some very breezy stuff about the opening.

472
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh, hey, get breezy. They had very high hopes for this. Lovett said the this is from The Hollywood Reporter.

473
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I just have from the opening and closing for the Hollywood Reporter. Lovett said the new three level club will differ from existing comedy clubs in L.A.,

474
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:58,000
most of which have a black box feel in that it will be bright and open with beachy decor complete with palm trees.

475
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It sounds like a UCB diss. It sounds like a UCB diss. Later in the article, I like Hawaii and I like the beach.

476
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And here you can almost hear the ocean and smell the cocoa butter, Lovett said. What?

477
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But why is Lovett's and Hawaii tied together? Well, I know this.

478
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:26,000
He also hopes to work closely with NBC's The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien, which is relocating to the Universal lot, which really dates that opening.

479
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
As much as we can mine the relationship with the very fruitful Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.

480
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Yeah. As much as this cornerstone of this club. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

481
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Here I'm going to show you a photo. You too.

482
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Of the the ticket booth for the John Lovett's comedy club.

483
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Can you see a little like hidden thing, a little Easter egg here?

484
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You notice anything in this photo? The top? And think about other sectors when you look at this.

485
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I see lightning on the door. Sure do.

486
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Lightning bolts. Is that the wizards? Wizards. That is a remnant of wizards that John Lovett's left up.

487
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And in fact, you can still see at various points at City Walk, Saturn's and other things.

488
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So he didn't change, though he's in a Hawaiian themed nightclub, it's still lightning bolts.

489
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So you're getting clashing as soon as you buy your tickets.

490
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So let me I got a picture. So this is from a Yelp page for the John Lovett's comedy club.

491
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Again, I mentioned three stories, which is unique for a comedy club.

492
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Here is the top floor, which looks like a cage slash prison.

493
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Can you see that? Yes, it does.

494
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yelp reviewer says third floor seats. This is what you get for the same price. Thumbs down.

495
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Boy, it looks like a cage. Jason is having indigestion from all this liquor.

496
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Indigestion looks like a cage when you're looking.

497
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So it's three stories, but the three stories would all be looking down on one stage.

498
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
On one stage. It wasn't three different stages of different comedians or performances.

499
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
We'll always later change. Here is another picture I have.

500
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:25,000
This is a painting by Gordo painted this picture of John Lovett smoking a big stoke.

501
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And I got to say, if you're doing comedy, if you have a picture of you smoking a big cigar, a big stoke, like you suck.

502
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Like you just suck. Like it's just rethink that photo.

503
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Like if that's your thing, fine. But like a cigar and Hawaii and lightning bolts, these all clash.

504
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Why cigars doesn't seem to line up with the John Lovett's? I know Hawaiian shirts also don't.

505
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I know. What is that? What do you want out of the John Lovett's comedy club?

506
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
He just doesn't have like a particular brand because he's he's an actor.

507
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:19,000
What if I were to tell you at the opening of this, another brand he associated with himself was like young women with like an Avril Lavigne circle mid 2000s haircuts.

508
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yes. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. This is the grand opening press conference.

509
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Let me explain. This is Lovett's in a Hawaiian shirt and three women eating like box lunches looking like bored.

510
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And this is from Getty Images. There are eight more of this identical photo.

511
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
My memory is that John was not a stand up as a younger comedian. He was an actor.

512
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
He was a groundling. A groundling. Character. And then he someone said you should do stand up and he did it a little bit.

513
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And then some, you know, you guys will tell me about this, but some weird business partner was like, let's have a comedy club.

514
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I think that is accurate. Yes. And I now this this partner, I like I don't want to pick sides in this argument, but all I know is that the John Lovett's comedy club ended in a pile of lawsuits.

515
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I think Lovett sued his partner, Frank Kelly. Is that the name? Frank Kelly. And then Frank Kelly countersued.

516
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The Twitter account is still live. I forget the exact at name, but they're they're like handle next to the at name is closed comedy club.

517
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Oh boy. Which is depressing. And it's it's a depressing Twitter account.

518
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Let me say some things from this lawsuit and you can go yourself and read the legal dossier.

519
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The counter suit from of Kelly V. Lovett's. This is but this is an actual quote from a legal document.

520
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
This is like judges and lawyers have to deal with this in this lawsuit.

521
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Lovett's appears to be channeling one of his most recognizable characters.

522
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Yes. Tommy Flanagan, the pathological liar.

523
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I have the same quote like bolded in my notes. It's insane. Also, is that one of his famous characters? Yes, it is. Oh, it certainly is.

524
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The other one being Master Thespian, which you could have easily gone with all of Mr. Lovett's claims.

525
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It is obvious that he is acting exclamation point.

526
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
You could have gone either way with it, but they went with the liar, which is probably the cleaner thing to do.

527
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That makes sense. Legal situation. Other things in this lawsuit.

528
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Let me read some stuff. The club's financial difficulties were Lovett's is false, Kelly alleged.

529
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
He claimed the comedian had agreed to financially back the club, but quickly became unable or unwilling to provide the needed funding.

530
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:51,000
The comic, meanwhile, made irresponsible expenses like a two hundred thousand dollar TV sign promoting the club, which there is.

531
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
This is true. There is a video sign that says Comedy Club that is still up at City Walk.

532
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Have you guys seen this? Yes, it's a video. It's a video screen.

533
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It says Comedy Club and there's nothing ever on the screen.

534
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:15,000
This was paid for by John Lovett's and apparently did nothing to get people into the club and also a twenty thousand dollar advertising campaign that just said the ads just said,

535
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
get happy and didn't actually say the name John Lovett's Comedy Club.

536
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So basically he's doing the work of like a the sign of a homeless person on an off ramp like a smile.

537
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
He didn't direct anyone to the actual business he was trying to promote.

538
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I feel like there is still like there's an elevator on the ground floor next to Johnny Rockets where like you like that elevator would go up to the level that the John Lovett's club was at.

539
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And I think it still says like artists entrance elevator like that would take them backstage, which is still like I mean, that's sad.

540
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That's depressing. That's signed down.

541
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah. And then it still there's another sign that still says Comedy Club that is inactivated in anyway.

542
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
There's a lot going on. I mean, I mean, we got to talk about the Kevin Smith connection.

543
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah, am I right?

544
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:26,000
OK, so to go back, Kevin Smith has had a podcast for a number of years and when he briefly experimented with having his own space, the Smod Castle down on Santa Monica Boulevard.

545
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And the Smod Castle, it only held about 50 or 60 people, 50 or 60 seats, and it would sell out a lot.

546
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So they were looking to expand for like the Smod Castle network.

547
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
To fit more than 60 people.

548
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah, it was a black box theater. They needed more space.

549
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So there at the same time is like the Lovett's Club had been going for a couple of years, a few years and like.

550
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Was it that long?

551
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It was the Lovett's Club was open 2009 to 2014. So it was five years.

552
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So I think it was that long.

553
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So eventually the Lovett's Club kind of expanded and their logo became the John Lovett's Comedy Club and Vodcast Theater.

554
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Vodcast is a video podcast, never really called an non-existent medium.

555
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Non-existent, they tried it for a while, so and they kind of converted the top floor into like a podcasting space.

556
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
So like a second space and Kevin Smith used to record there.

557
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And now briefly that was going to become the Smodcast Lounge and that never happened.

558
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
They just called it the Smodcast Theater.

559
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And of course, there was that plaque when you were walking into the Smodcast Theater that that famous Kevin Smith quote,

560
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Ten years in and we broke bone like we're cheating on each other with each other a decade plus and her clit brown taint area still bones my dick.

561
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
That famous Kevin Smith tweet.

562
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
That was so funny.

563
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
No, I'm lying. I'm making that up. I just wanted to read that Kevin Smith tweet.

564
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
That's the thing he tweeted.

565
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
He tweeted and it comes back every few years.

566
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It just lingers in our mind.

567
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Suppose Kevin claims that his wife because of some sort of bad or something said there was a deal made that he would tweet anything that she wanted.

568
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And that was a thing he was forced to tweet, he says.

569
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
He didn't tweet that under his own.

570
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So there's some Dom Sub stuff going on in their Twitter relationship.

571
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You know all about that.

572
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Oh, sure. Absolutely.

573
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You're the young millennial of the three of us.

574
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yeah.

575
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Kevin Smith was name checked in the lawsuit that transpired.

576
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And let me just read this.

577
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
He was not paid and Levitz claimed that it was because of this guy Kelly.

578
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
But Kelly switched that right back on him, said he is a pathological liar.

579
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And just within the legal dossier, additional facts concerning Levitz's defamatory conduct.

580
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Point 18, Kevin Smith is a well-known director, producer, actor and comedian.

581
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Let me just let me take some words out of that statement again.

582
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Just boil it down to Kevin Smith is an actor.

583
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:28,000
That phrase in and of itself devalues the entire lawsuit that proves that the whole thing is full of lies and statements you can't trust.

584
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm still mad because Kevin Smith was supposed to shoot mall rats to whether a movie or TV show.

585
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
You've talked about this before.

586
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I've talked about this for years.

587
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:45,000
My childhood mall, he said this on the radio, my childhood mall was the Granite Run Mall was going to be demolished.

588
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And they were going to let Kevin Smith film in there and dress it up and then blow it up at the end because they were going to blow it up anyway.

589
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And it just didn't happen.

590
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Look, it still could happen.

591
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
No, that mall is rubble now.

592
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
They could build another mall in your hometown and they blow it up is what I'm saying.

593
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Mall rats too will be a live periscope event.

594
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
That's how he'll end up doing it.

595
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It'll be in pieces.

596
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It'll be an Insta story in 90 parts.

597
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I mean that'd be fine.

598
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
When Mike and I were younger men, we enjoyed the Kevin Smith universe and we liked once a month when he would get online and say like, all right, here's the order.

599
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm going to shoot movies in.

600
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I never liked that part of it, but I liked the first part.

601
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I liked it.

602
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
But once after a year of it, him going like, OK, the order has changed.

603
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
As far as the look, sorry to get away from Kevin Smith.

604
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
As far as what happened with the lawsuit with John Lovitz, there's two people I would like to come on the podcast and explain.

605
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah.

606
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
One, John Lovitz.

607
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Of course.

608
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Love to hear that.

609
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Big fan of his.

610
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
A lot of different things.

611
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Simpsons, the critic, blah, blah, blah.

612
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Number two, Jim Hill.

613
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
The man knows his theme park history.

614
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Yeah.

615
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I would love to hear a definitive explanation of what happened with the John Lovitz in regards to CityWalk.

616
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And I think Jim is the kind of the kind of guy who researches.

617
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
We've heard him on the Disney Dish podcast and he knows exactly.

618
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
He knows how to dig.

619
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
He knows sources.

620
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
He has a deep throat, probably.

621
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
He knows where the bodies are buried.

622
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
That's what I'm saying.

623
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Jim Hill or John Lovitz, come on the show, explain to us what happened with the.

624
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You get, look, you're getting the real deal.

625
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
What we do, it's post 1 a.m.

626
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And we are pleading with Jim Hill to come talk to us about things.

627
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I've gotten a text from Lindsay saying, we are too loud.

628
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
She is trying to go to sleep and we're being loud.

629
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So I'm like, from now on, we'll be very hushed for the rest of the episode.

630
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah, I did notice you take the volume down a little bit.

631
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Yep.

632
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I have let me say one more thing before we depart from the John Lovitz comedy club.

633
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
This may have also been part of the Vodcast endeavor.

634
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yeah.

635
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
The John Lovitz hosted a podcast that was live from his theater.

636
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Guests included Dana Carvey.

637
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And I have an ad in front of me where Dana is spelled with two N's.

638
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Dana Carvey.

639
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That's not how any Dana is spelled, by the way.

640
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Dana is generally spelled with one N.

641
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
No, Dana and also taping is misspelled.

642
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The E is used.

643
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Some of the artwork, some of the promotional work for the John Lovitz comedy club was extremely brutal.

644
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Gene Simmons also apparently a guest on this podcast.

645
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Wow, really?

646
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Would you like to know the name of John Lovitz's live podcast event?

647
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yes, please.

648
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
The Lovkist?

649
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Oh, no, no, no.

650
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
He would call his live podcast Lovitz or Lievitz.

651
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
The year this is being done, 2010.

652
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:05,000
2017 or so rolls around and the very funny, the funny, funny man, John Lovitz comes up with the name.

653
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Obama staff are now doing a comedy, a funny comedy podcast.

654
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Does the title Lovitz or Lievitz?

655
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Lovitz or Lievitz.

656
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I think what's funny about both of those podcasts is I would rather be pushed down the flight of stairs in Mike's townhouse right here than listen to either one of those podcasts.

657
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Like I would rather listen more. I would rather fall down the stairs and go like, well, how can I, as I'm doing this, try not to injure myself more than listen to the milk toast speechwriter or the milk toast comedian?

658
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I'm more curious about John Lovitz's comedy views and how he liked the 2018 election.

659
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Clear favorite and it's John Lovitz.

660
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah, Lovitz is definitely the clear favorite.

661
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:06,000
It's just, you know, it's funny that this comedy writer, this funny comedy writer really put his brain to the mat and he thought of the same name that John Lovitz did eight years prior.

662
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I just, I mean, Ocasio won because she got out there and shook hands.

663
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Like that sort of insight is invaluable from like a guy who will never have to struggle in his life because he, he just phoned it in and every fucking thing he did.

664
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Does anyone care about the crossover between our political views and our views about milkshakes?

665
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Probably not. I hope crooked media goes bankrupt is by only political.

666
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Hey, don't say anything you'll regret when you haven't had two and a half beers and also some blue stuff.

667
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And a couple sips of blue stuff. And a couple cherries soaked in blue stuff.

668
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Let's get into where gave us the blue stuff.

669
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So we all went to see a movie. I don't know if it's going to date. We're going to release this and it's going to be like two months later.

670
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
But we saw a movie. We all loved it.

671
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Crooked media will be bankrupt.

672
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And Lindsay was with us and it was a couple of us walking up there to take, or excuse me, going up the escalator to go to how the moon.

673
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And she was like, yeah, I'll go when there's no cover charge or whatever.

674
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I was like, yeah, there's no cover. And we got there and it was a loud cover of the killer's Mr. Brightside.

675
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Heavy piano.

676
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
She goes, I am out.

677
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Heavy piano.

678
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
She turned around and was like, I got to go to bed.

679
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And this same thing had happened, when Aaron and I, when my wife and I started dating, it was 2006 and I was still a universal tour guide.

680
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And the go-to hangout was Howl at the Moon. And I convinced her up there at one point.

681
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And same thing. She sat down at a table, sat down at the high top and then said, I can't do this and walked away.

682
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And this is the thing that we did tonight.

683
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Now, I would not describe this as any particular torture.

684
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
No.

685
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I think we had a good time and you're benefiting from our good time right now as we speak.

686
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Your now wife asked like, oh, I can't remember what section I was, will you just come with me until I get to the car?

687
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And you jumped at the opportunity to not be at Howl at the Moon for a few extra minutes.

688
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
To delay it.

689
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
To delay it.

690
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I don't know if he jumped. I mean, his wife made a request and he granted it, which is very reasonable.

691
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I feel like his reaction was stirred.

692
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Sure. Any less seconds I can spend at this place.

693
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Howl at the Moon is a dueling piano bar concept.

694
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:39,000
This began in 1990 in the city of Cincinnati at a flagship location that has since closed.

695
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I was trying to find out kind of the history of Howl at the Moon.

696
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And just by Googling Howl at the Moon, I didn't find a lot.

697
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,000
But then I got smart and I added a word to the Google search and the word that I added was arrest.

698
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And then I found the real deal Google results.

699
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Let me pull the notes out.

700
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So Howl at the Moon, there are a number of locations of this.

701
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I only knew there was also one in San Diego, which would certainly follow as there was another John Lovett's comedy club.

702
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
There's a lot of them.

703
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
There's a lot across the country. And let me just give you a couple stats.

704
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And it's not a mind boggling amount of stats for arrests.

705
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But in Orlando on I Drive, the Howl at the Moon, there was a stabbing.

706
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
In Houston, there was a stabbing, which was fatal.

707
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Someone died at the Howl at the Moon.

708
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,000
In Indianapolis, a man was arrested at the Howl at the Moon due to heavy intoxication.

709
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Over the course of his arrest, he tried to punch the officer and grab his genitals.

710
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And now let me take you to the Boston Howl at the Moon piano bar, which complex, the website complex named number 14 Dutius Bar in Boston.

711
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Oh, man.

712
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Here's the thing that happened there.

713
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I didn't write down his name, but a player for the New England Patriots was judging a Halloween costume contest at Howl at the Moon.

714
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Now, to be totally fair to Howl at the Moon, to this fine establishment, he left Howl at the Moon, went to another bar two miles away,

715
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:24,000
but clearly drunk from the initial Halloween costume judging, went to another bar where he assaulted a woman.

716
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Oh, my God.

717
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Was taken to jail. And what is funny about all of this is that he was brought into jail wearing a costume of Lieutenant Dangle from Reno 911.

718
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
So this beloved football player in the Boston area is dressed in the short shirts.

719
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Friend of the podcast, Tom Lennon.

720
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Is he a friend of the podcast?

721
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
He's never been on.

722
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Oh, he's never been on, but we know him. A little, casually.

723
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I've spoken to him for 20 seconds or so.

724
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Sure. Yeah, I think that's enough.

725
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Great. Close enough.

726
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Well, we can say friend of the podcast, Nick Jennings, a man I grew up with, is a friend of the podcast.

727
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
How's Nick doing?

728
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Mini Mouse, friend of the podcast.

729
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Anyone we ever know is not just a friend of the podcast.

730
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
That's not how that works.

731
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
All right.

732
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Breck Eisner, friend of the podcast.

733
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Well, Breck, come on the show.

734
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah, we do want Breck.

735
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Breck for sure is a friend.

736
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Anyway, a lot of debauchery has transpired at various health locations, and over the years, 15 locations have closed nationwide, but many are left, including at City Walk.

737
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And how would you guys evaluate your evening?

738
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I will say that I, you know, when you get older, like me, I'm the oldest one of the three of us.

739
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Oh, is that right?

740
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It is right. Is that you get a little tired sometimes when you're drinking.

741
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
So it's not.

742
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I had a good time.

743
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I do think if I had gotten more sleep, I would have had a better time because I never got to the point where I was like, oh, wow, hell yeah.

744
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm drinking some blue liquid and I'm having a great time.

745
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I'm very excited.

746
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It was just kind of like a slow like, but it's not the fault of Howl at the Moon.

747
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I do feel like Howl at the Moon if I was a young person, if I was 22, 25 years old coming up there for Thursday night, I think I would have had a pretty decent time.

748
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
The people there were very excited.

749
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I was expecting a place, honestly, on a Thursday night at City Walk to be like kind of sleepy.

750
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Not the case at all.

751
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Pretty wild, pretty rowdy, not wild, but like pretty, you know.

752
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You know, I didn't find it there.

753
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I never saw anything that sketched me out.

754
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yeah, right.

755
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I didn't see people stumbling over.

756
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I didn't see sloppiness.

757
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
No stabbings.

758
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
A very nice gentleman named Connor came up to us.

759
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Yes.

760
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Shout out to Connor and his girlfriend.

761
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I was too far away to catch her name.

762
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yes, I can't remember her name.

763
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But they came up to us and were very nice.

764
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And he was, he is a regular on Thursday nights because they have dollar beers.

765
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
They have dollar Coors Lights.

766
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And I, for one, am no snob.

767
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I don't mind a Coors Light.

768
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Sure.

769
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But a buck a beer, that is a good deal.

770
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
A very good deal.

771
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
And I can see why you'd make a point of coming up the hill to get that.

772
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Great deal.

773
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I splurged, you know, I'm a thrifty man, but I cannot do, I do not like the taste of Coors Light,

774
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
but it was also a $4 Sky Vodka.

775
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Not bad.

776
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And I had a double Sky Vodka and then a single Sky Vodka.

777
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
And so that's where I'm coming from.

778
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Yeah.

779
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So that's why you're getting hella political.

780
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah, you're getting really rowdy.

781
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I'm getting hella political and saying, Hey, that guy that's not very funny sucks.

782
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So I was earlier in the day, I was looking through Howl at the Moon and I looked at Facebook.

783
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
So this is the disappointment on at least my part.

784
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And on Facebook, there was an event and it says at Howl at the Moon Hollywood,

785
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
which is the one in Universal City.

786
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But tonight, according to Facebook, there was supposed to be something called a stoplight party.

787
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And I texted this excitedly to everyone because I looked it up.

788
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
What are the terms?

789
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And what that means is that everyone gets a wristband that is either red, yellow or green.

790
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So red would mean you're in a relationship.

791
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
You're not looking for anyone.

792
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Yellow means it's complicated, like inquire, maybe it's possible.

793
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And green means go ahead.

794
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So I was very excited because Jason is, of course, single.

795
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Of course.

796
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I'm all about go ahead.

797
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And Jason is all about go ahead, according to him.

798
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Right, right, right.

799
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
But I was very excited.

800
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
With screen grab.

801
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And it says the Facebook event, zero going, zero shares, one interested.

802
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Yeah, but that's the case.

803
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And when we got up there and I looked around, I did not see any wristbands.

804
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So I feel like.

805
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
No, no, that's what I'm saying.

806
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So there was a Facebook group here, or Facebook, excuse me, event, and they did not follow through.

807
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
None of us got wristbands.

808
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I was excited to get a red wristband saying hands off, ladies.

809
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
No hands off, gentlemen.

810
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I am taken.

811
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
But Jason over here, green, go.

812
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Yeah, I was excited to give you the green light.

813
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I was very excited about it, but it did not happen.

814
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
So that is the first thing really going into Hall of the Moon.

815
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I was disappointed that the stoplight party did not seem to be actually happening.

816
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
But it didn't really seem like an environment for mingle.

817
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I feel like most people were watching the band.

818
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Like people weren't mingling.

819
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
There was a lot of couples.

820
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
There was a lot of groups.

821
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:40,000
There was a lot of men that even as a man, I wouldn't leave my drink attended around.

822
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
What does that mean?

823
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Just a vibe.

824
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
You get a vibe from certain kinds of men.

825
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
What do you what kinds of men creeps?

826
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I don't know what you want me to say.

827
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I don't know what you're like.

828
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I'm just I'm trying to remember.

829
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I feel like there was a big.

830
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Yeah, there were some creeps.

831
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I felt a strong possibility of one of the howl men slipping something into our big blue blue bucket full of curly.

832
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I have never I was not carrying the blue bucket full of blue liquid around because I like saw someone specific.

833
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:24,000
If I was in an Applebee's full of priests, I would have still carried that blue bucket around because that's just how I'm wired.

834
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
It's not.

835
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
It has nothing to do with the clients.

836
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
He's full of priests.

837
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
If there was an Applebee's full of priests, they're having they're having they rented it out for the.

838
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Yeah, they can't.

839
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
They're not drinking.

840
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I should have said honestly, I should have said nuns because priests have there's some creepy priests.

841
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Let's be honest for sure.

842
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Unless nuns are aggressive, but not in the way that the priest I trust is Lenny Bellardo, the young pope.

843
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Go fuck yourself, Jason.

844
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
It's all coming out.

845
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I watched Michael.

846
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

847
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
We're salty.

848
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
It's, you know, very late.

849
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I mean, by the way, you guys told me I'd be willing to stop this recording within the next 45 seconds.

850
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
But let's everybody say whatever you feel like saying.

851
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
What else about Hell at the Moon?

852
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I have very little.

853
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,000
You know, we were Connor, our listener told us he's very impressed by the band, by their musical dexterity.

854
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
He was talking about that.

855
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Any request and they'll basically figure it out.

856
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
And I agree.

857
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I'm impressed with them and no knock on them.

858
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I don't know if the dueling piano concept in general is anything that appeals to me.

859
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And you are guaranteed to hear a don't stop believing.

860
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Yeah, it was a good way to chase me out of anywhere.

861
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Was very savvy because he was saying him and his girlfriend, they live a few stops down the metro red line stop.

862
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:02,000
So it's easy to pop on the train, have a few drinks, not worry about driving home, pop back on the red line to get home.

863
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So I thought that was smart.

864
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
You're right.

865
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It is smart.

866
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yeah.

867
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Good job.

868
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Not drinking drive.

869
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
We got a notion of public transit.

870
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It's great. We got to talk about the patio, the care.

871
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
So, OK, all right.

872
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Talk about the patio.

873
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Talk about the patio.

874
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Well, you wanted to know what else I go for.

875
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I died, but the clock stick.

876
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I investigated the patio.

877
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I stepped outside the house, the moon and one of the security guys said, oh, sir, I have to take that from you.

878
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Oh, yes.

879
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
This is good.

880
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You're right.

881
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And they thank you.

882
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I deserve that apology.

883
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
They took the drink and they're like, I was like, I wasn't sure what was going on.

884
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
And they're like, oh, just right this way.

885
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And they like because there is a gap between the bar and the smoking patio.

886
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
And they're like, and then they we we got to the patio area.

887
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
They handed me back the drink and they're like that, like five feet is public property.

888
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So we have to take the drink and then give it back to you, which I thought was interesting.

889
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I've never experienced that before.

890
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So, yes, as you were coming outside, they would say, hey, put the drink on this little serving tray.

891
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And it was confusing because you're like, what are they talking about?

892
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
They would set it down.

893
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:24,000
And then as you walk to the like three feet away, they would just surf it on their little serving tray to you and then go, here you go.

894
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Yeah.

895
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And it wasn't like I think I've been to one or two fancy restaurants where they put your drink on a little a little stone tablet and they carry it to your table.

896
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
This was kind of that.

897
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
But like it was essentially saying like, please stop getting hammered in the bar.

898
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Now you can get hammered in the battle.

899
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
This was just getting by a liquor by like skirting by a liquor, skirting liquor law.

900
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
That's all it was.

901
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:56,000
A sheriff's station and the universal talent office, because that's what's in between hell and the moon.

902
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Yeah.

903
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So this it was fun.

904
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So like you could really make somebody like surf your drink back and forth, back and forth if you wanted to go in and out.

905
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
But we were not so cruel.

906
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
We would not do that.

907
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
A little howl hack.

908
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
A howl hack for you.

909
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Another howl hack.

910
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Hashtag howl hack.

911
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
You can get five dollar woo woo shots.

912
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Did anybody see a woo woo shot being poured?

913
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
No.

914
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
We were mostly in each other's sight lines.

915
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So I think you would have noticed if we had woo woo shots.

916
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I got the adios mofo drink.

917
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
That's what it was called.

918
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Sky vodka.

919
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Cruzen.

920
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Cruzen rum.

921
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Cruzan rum.

922
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Sorry.

923
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
This is the blue bucket.

924
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah.

925
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
The blue bucket.

926
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Cosé cuervo especial tequila.

927
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Cosé cuervo.

928
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Oh is that cool.

929
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Yeah.

930
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
It's especially a relaxed version.

931
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Cosé.

932
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Pinnacle gin blue.

933
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Pinnacle.

934
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
By the way I'm looking at a flyer and the sponsors of this club.

935
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Pinnacle, Sky, and Bud Light.

936
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
That makes a lot of sense.

937
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So we all got tricked and it tricked me into promoting their products right now.

938
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Sure.

939
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And people will now run out and try.

940
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
They're like I want to try the liquor that Mike tried.

941
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Like I want it in the bucket.

942
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Mike's bucket.

943
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Yeah they definitely will.

944
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So they'll try that.

945
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Hey tap the Pinnacle everyone.

946
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
So.

947
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I gotta say that bucket did not taste great.

948
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
That was some shit.

949
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
It was bad.

950
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And Mike didn't like it either.

951
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Although a very funny moment.

952
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I don't.

953
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
We asked our bartender like do you like any of the bucket.

954
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Like any particular bucket.

955
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
She was like I'm not gonna lie.

956
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
This is a new menu.

957
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I got.

958
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I found out I was pregnant right before it was introduced.

959
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
So I haven't tried any of them.

960
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And then we were all like well congratulations the buckets don't matter.

961
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Because that's so much more exciting.

962
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
And then we're like.

963
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
We were truly trying to make her feel good.

964
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
About being pregnant and not being able to try the different buckets at Howl of the Moon.

965
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
You should honor the sponsor and name the baby Sky.

966
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I think that it'll be nice that the baby will know all the covers of popular songs by the time it comes out.

967
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It'll have heard so many different versions of.

968
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Mike wanted to recommend some songs.

969
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Oh yeah.

970
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Well I tried first of all I thought it would be funny for the podcast if I put like down a Disney song and see what they would play it.

971
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
And everyone made fun of me.

972
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And when I say everyone I mean you guys.

973
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
It seemed too broad.

974
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It's a small world down thinking like OK maybe they won't know that but they'll know it to their like Disney song or something.

975
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And then you guys like shut up.

976
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
They fuck you don't.

977
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Well I didn't think they were going to break from playing no scrubs to play.

978
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It's a small world.

979
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
But maybe like oh it's a jokey little thing.

980
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
One of the piano players would be like the do do do do do.

981
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And then we'd be able to talk about the podcast and be great content for the listeners.

982
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Well we're talking about this.

983
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So the failure.

984
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
So I said OK fine.

985
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I'm an idiot.

986
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I'll put something down that maybe they will know.

987
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So I wrote down I'm trying to think of something like that would be kind of theme park related but also Disney related.

988
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And I wrote down life is a highway Rascal Flatts version.

989
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Which is a stronger joke.

990
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Like that's a better.

991
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I don't know that it's a strong joke.

992
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I just mean it's a pop more popular song that maybe like if they were like a lot of these are popular song a bunch of drunk universal cover version of the song.

993
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Right.

994
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Like more specific joke.

995
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
So I put it down on the piano.

996
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I think I put a dollar down like as a tip like come on let's play this.

997
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And I know what a one dollar a yes no I'm in business.

998
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
And I think the woman playing the piano she picked it up.

999
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I think she walked over to the other guy and maybe I'm project she looked annoyed and she showed it to the other guy.

1000
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And I think they were just like waved it off and they never played it.

1001
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
They did not know that song.

1002
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,000
So like as much as Connor was like oh my god these people can play anything like they can play like 12 things.

1003
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Let's be honest.

1004
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
They can play a bunch of you know popular number one song.

1005
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
They've heard it.

1006
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:12,000
To put it another way you manage to find a song lame enough that a dueling piano bar band refused to play it.

1007
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I don't know if they refuse you cracked the code.

1008
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,000
But like that's a life with life as a highway was a hit before that like they should know life as a highway.

1009
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
So all I'm saying is like you like that song.

1010
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
No I don't like that song.

1011
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
You did.

1012
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I like the original.

1013
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Turn my attention this way.

1014
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I like the original song.

1015
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
What's the original Rascal Flatts version.

1016
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
What's the original.

1017
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Who does the original original.

1018
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I think I have it in my head.

1019
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:46,000
They rolled their eyes because you said Rascal Flatts and their purists and they wanted to play the original song as it was meant to be played.

1020
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
The original song is by Tom Cochran Tom Cochran.

1021
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Yeah and I liked it.

1022
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Tom Cochran money now.

1023
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Oh god.

1024
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:03,000
It was on the loop at the Hard Rock Orlando and I used to hear it all the time and I was like yeah the songs a banger.

1025
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It's good.

1026
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Was that also in the treadmill rotation when you were working out.

1027
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Oh yeah it would.

1028
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I think that was pre iTunes store.

1029
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
But yeah it would it would have been.

1030
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Just Will Smith and Tom Cochran for you on the treadmill.

1031
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Will Smith nod your head.

1032
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Do you agree that with the sentiment that life is a highway.

1033
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Yeah I think that's right.

1034
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Here's.

1035
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Sometimes look sometimes easy sailing you're doing a 65 just cruising along sometimes there's backup.

1036
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Yeah.

1037
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Sometimes you've had too many woo woo shots and you get pulled over.

1038
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I had no woo woo shots.

1039
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Thank you very much.

1040
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I think I should call the lift now while we're on the air and then help us when the lift gets here.

1041
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
So we exactly that's what I'm saying.

1042
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Swifter exit.

1043
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
So Scott you call the lift.

1044
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Are we sharing one Jason.

1045
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I think you have to.

1046
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I think we are.

1047
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
OK.

1048
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Well let's figure out this.

1049
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
So how let the moon.

1050
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I mean you know what you're getting into whatever you imagine you're getting into.

1051
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yeah it was not as it was not honestly it was not as trashy as I thought it would be.

1052
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I thought it would be kind of like trashy or aggressive and it was honestly just like you know some standard covers of things and like they were playing Maroon 5 this love and you know I don't know what you expected.

1053
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I don't know what I expected either.

1054
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I like I guess there's trashier bars like even in Chambord Illinois.

1055
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
We're like much more low rent and had like a shitty cover band and it felt much dingier.

1056
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Yeah.

1057
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
By the way we got three minutes Abdul is coming.

1058
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Okay.

1059
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
So what's this.

1060
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
This stone is appearing.

1061
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Oh yeah there is.

1062
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Oh my god sector 15 stone.

1063
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's in the shape of.

1064
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Well it's been looking annoyed.

1065
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,000
This is also the stone now is zipping it's actually in the lift that you called.

1066
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Oh yeah.

1067
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:10,000
So we have to go catch the stone now to make sure you're on time and we can get the tiny Lindsay annoyed with our volume at 2 a.m.

1068
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Almost.

1069
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's like one of us has a job in the morning and two of us do not.

1070
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Can you guess which.

1071
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Can you guess which.

1072
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Extrapolating from listening to us.

1073
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Well we wanted to go short.

1074
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
We went an hour and 15.

1075
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Well life is a highway.

1076
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Highway.

1077
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
All right.

1078
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Well we'll catch you next time on sector 16 whatever that is.

1079
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Tomorrow.

1080
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Yep.

1081
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Bye.

1082
