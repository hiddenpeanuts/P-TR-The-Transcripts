1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,440
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,200
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the Second Gate's historic third Munster-based episode.

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,840
I am our grandpa, as established with costumes a while back,

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,680
and we've got Herman here, Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,960
I am Herman, hello.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,460
Hello.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,960
I guess.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,640
Yeah, no, it's not. It's really a size-oriented thing and not a voice-oriented.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,760
I mean, I could sort of maybe, I'm grandpa.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,480
Yeah, I can only do Billy West's impression of grandpa, which is just like,

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,840
look what you did, you big jerk, you big dummy.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,800
That's pretty good.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,360
Pretty good.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,280
We've got to switch it up then.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,560
You can, look, if we have to do the voice at some point,

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,560
which means, so can I switch to Herman?

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,280
Can I like, maybe?

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,240
Yeah, maybe.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,280
I think so.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
I think we could be flexible in what we're doing.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
I mean, there's the only two really that have such distinct voices.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,240
Lily kind of, but then, you know, Eddie is just kind of a little boy's voice.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,240
And Marilyn is certainly just, no, the rest just sort of talk.

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,740
Yes.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,800
So you got nothing there.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,320
Although even Fred Gwynn as Herman also just kind of talks, but just like,

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,720
very stiff and polite.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,160
I don't know if that's not good either, but you know what I mean, right?

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,120
He does that and then he kind of has this low status thing he does that's really,

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,440
that's funny, but he's not doing such a voice like Al Lewis's.

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,160
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,240
But Al Lewis then is just that character all the time too, in real life.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,680
No, it's not particularly a character.

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,720
So it's not a character, just because of his days in the vaudeville,

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,400
when he was in a vaudeville, as he says on the many interviews I've watched with him,

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,200
where he discusses his vaudeville training.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Wow, it's always vaudeville.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,400
He calls it vaudeville.

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,720
Wow.

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,440
Yeah.

41
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,920
So.

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,320
Which then that is his vaudeville training.

43
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,720
Yeah.

44
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,760
Training step number one, pronounce it vaudeville.

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,880
Vaudeville, yeah.

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,280
So, but yeah, so he, no, he just seemed, I don't know, the monsters,

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
I love the monsters, but it is funny.

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,640
This is an interesting special because I feel like it takes the monsters out of the normal

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,720
context of the monsters to some degree.

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,280
Yes.

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
To some degree with the way, just the way that the show was shot.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,240
They're kind of out in the world a little bit, but still, but only to a degree that is like

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,440
detrimental to the viewing experience.

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
What if the monsters was filmed badly?

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,280
That's true, yes.

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,320
It is filmed badly on like video tape I read.

57
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,720
Yeah.

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,920
And like bad work, like I don't know, is monsters on film probably?

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,520
Like everything was on film?

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,160
Yeah, I think so.

61
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,640
Probably.

62
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,120
That seems right.

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,640
As far as old sitcoms, yeah.

64
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,680
Oh, so that's the, yeah, because there's, this thing's full of like weird

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,360
flare outs or burn ins or seemingly just like digital weird jumps in restoring it.

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,240
It's a strange little piece of material, I'd say.

67
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,760
Yes, but they all, I will say they like, they don't phone it in, in a way I've seen sometimes.

68
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,800
Like, and I don't want to put him down, but you see the clip of Adam West where he's in Memphis

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,440
wrestling and it's a little while after the Batman show and he's still hilarious,

70
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,760
but he's like drunk and he's clearly just not quite in the zone like he used to be.

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,600
I was going to say, yeah, I'd pin that on being drunk.

72
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,280
It's very possible it's partly because he's drunk, but I'm just saying sometimes you see

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,720
some of these characters, these people out of context or out of their regular show,

74
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,880
and it loses the magic.

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,280
I would say it doesn't lose the magic, even though this might be a bad watch.

76
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
No, it's definitely, yeah, it's definitely them.

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,160
Well, because they were in the zone, as opposed to the Adam West thing you're

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,160
describing way after the fact, this was in the run.

79
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,720
That's true.

80
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,360
Between the two seasons.

81
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
So they're locked in.

82
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,200
They don't get like a summer break in which to lose Herman.

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,080
No, yeah, that's true.

84
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,640
And Rambo.

85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,680
That's true.

86
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
To lose the character they developed.

87
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,320
Yeah.

88
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,680
That's such a hard character to do.

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,880
Highly specific.

90
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,600
Yeah, yeah.

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,680
No, with a long summer break, God, he might start pronouncing Vaudeville.

92
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Vaudeville.

93
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,960
Right.

94
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,480
You would lose that character completely.

95
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,600
They say Seth MacFarlane goes into the booth sometimes, and they say,

96
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,360
oh, Seth's Stewie sounds a little weird right now, and he has to kind of readjust

97
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
because it's been a while since he did Stewie.

98
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,120
He does 30 other voices.

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,600
He's recorded three music albums in the interim.

100
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,920
So he's lost Stewie for a second, and now he has to get Stewie back.

101
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,840
No, it didn't have to do that.

102
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,160
Yeah.

103
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,920
Well, that's like, it takes Jason a second to fire up the stitch,

104
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,480
but you just have to key in on Ohana means family as the keyword,

105
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,560
and then out comes a perfect stitch.

106
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
That's a very good point.

107
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,880
Jason's not with us, by the way.

108
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,680
Yes, we've said that, yes.

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,560
Any of our Munster family is not with us.

110
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,200
But I'm not concerned about it because there will be

111
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,560
clearly at this rate many more opportunities to talk Munsters.

112
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,640
Yeah, we're up to three.

113
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,760
Right.

114
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,280
This franchise in the podcast, The Right Franchise,

115
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,680
will go as long as Fast and the Furious, I think.

116
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:11,840
Sure.

117
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,720
At least as long.

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
Which is what, did I mean 10?

119
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,440
Or I guess Hobbs and Shaw, I don't know if that counts as one of the 10.

120
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,240
Right.

121
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,720
Well, I guess The Right presents Munsters episodes, presents.

122
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,960
Yes, and there's more Munsters being made.

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,000
They're going to keep trying, too, which is what really is important.

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
They're going to crack at one of these days, yeah.

125
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:29,920
Yes.

126
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,200
They're going to finally bring the Munsters back.

127
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,280
After 60 years of remakes, remake attempts.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
That's something I wanted to bring up was the kind of the age of the show.

129
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,680
In one of the times, I don't know if this was one of the Munsters-oriented episodes

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,240
or if this was just kind of a separate Munsters detour, which it very well could have been,

131
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,760
but at some point, I don't remember if it was you or Jason or the both of you,

132
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,480
there was discussion of, well, maybe we should get a hold of one of the Munsters writers,

133
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,440
either to ask them a question or for them to help us out with something

134
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
or to get their punch up on something.

135
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,080
And I responded, I don't know anything about anything,

136
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,720
but I would imagine that the majority of the Munsters writing staff is dead.

137
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,120
And I was thinking about that in this and while looking at some Munsters IMDB pages,

138
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,240
and I was like, can I figure that out officially?

139
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,280
Can I make the official call there?

140
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,720
And I got into a list.

141
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,760
I was like, all right, I'm going to click on every credited writer for the Munsters

142
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,040
and see where we get.

143
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,320
And there was a while there.

144
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,640
Basically, I made it 15 in and every single one I clicked on has been dead for some time.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,080
In many cases, some have been dead for like 50 years.

146
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,720
Wow.

147
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,600
Some of the Munsters writers died 10 years after the show.

148
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,800
I believe one died like almost immediately after.

149
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,640
Maybe that was the tragic circumstances.

150
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,880
I don't know, but a lot were dead in the 70s

151
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,000
because a lot of the writers were born in the 1910s.

152
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,480
They were in their 50s writing.

153
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,600
Yeah, that's a good point.

154
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,480
So the notion that an original Munsters writer is still with us.

155
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,360
Now, I was like, oh my God, I'm going to be able to report in this episode

156
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,200
that every Munsters writer is dead.

157
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:22,000
And then I got to the last three, strangely coincidentally, and they were not listed as dead.

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,640
However, it does seem possible that maybe just the fine folks at IMDB have not been

159
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,160
notified of the passing of these three Munsters writers.

160
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,080
And I would still say, I think smart money's on every Munsters writer is dead.

161
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,400
But if you can just prove it out there, let us know.

162
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,960
And they're not, yeah, they're not like famous writers.

163
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,720
There wasn't a bigger credit maybe they had where they would have notoriety.

164
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,920
What's bigger than that?

165
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,640
What's bigger than the Munsters?

166
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,440
Where do you go from there?

167
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,640
I don't know, it's a good point.

168
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,000
I found also no information.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This started because I was looking up the writers of this,

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,560
who were not regular Munsters writers.

171
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,840
And that might, you know, if, this is an if, I don't know.

172
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,840
If there are any questions as to the quality of the special we're talking about

173
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,080
and it not matching the quality of the series.

174
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,200
Well, maybe the outside hires could be the issue there.

175
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,760
Yes.

176
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,400
I looked this up.

177
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,080
There was something like one of them had an Arthur Godfrey credit.

178
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,280
I forget which Arthur Godfrey show there was.

179
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,600
Oh, sure.

180
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,400
Uh-huh.

181
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Viewboost staple, Arthur Godfrey.

182
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,200
Right.

183
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, exactly.

184
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,280
So there was some, yeah, older credits.

185
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,840
I see.

186
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
Than this special.

187
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,480
Yeah, I think mostly we are dealing with this.

188
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,400
Maybe they decided to go older this time.

189
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,160
Let's get people like, we've been given these young whippersnappers.

190
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,880
Too many breaks.

191
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,680
Let's get some writers who were born in the 1800s.

192
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,960
Well, that's the reason that they can't crack this Munsters reboot

194
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,160
is these people are too young.

195
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Rob Zombie was 58 years old.

196
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,480
Yeah.

197
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,840
When he did this new Munsters, probably 57, whatever.

198
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,520
Ultimately, yeah.

199
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,160
It's just not, it's not really a thing that 1900s writers understand.

200
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,200
And that's too bad because I can't imagine that in the year 2025,

201
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,800
anyone is still alive from, well, I say, okay, you know, that was unfair.

202
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,360
I think anybody born past the 20s, it's true.

203
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,400
But there's probably some people still alive who were of Munsters writing age.

204
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,280
It's possible.

205
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,280
I mentioned this on the show before.

206
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,960
I go and see once in a while, Jimmy Angel, an 89-year-old rock and roll singer.

207
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,440
Yep.

208
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,680
He's the last of the 50s Bobcats.

209
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,080
Listeners, can you believe what Mike is telling you?

210
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,720
Does this seem strange?

211
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
He goes to see an old rock and roll singer.

212
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,480
There's a guy who I often see sitting and watching the show who is 104.

213
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,240
He's a World War II veteran.

214
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,960
Whoa.

215
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,080
So he's like, Jimmy's a young man to this guy.

216
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,880
And this guy still gets up and dances too, this 104-year-old.

217
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,280
Really?

218
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,960
So every other couple songs, he gets up with what I assume like is his young 87-year-old wife.

219
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,120
Because she looks younger.

220
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,960
Maybe I'm wrong, but she looks younger.

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,680
So I do sometimes, I do wonder, are any of the...

222
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,840
And believe it or not, an 89-year-old rock and roll singer attracts an older audience often.

223
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,880
Some months there will be a bunch of young people.

224
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,680
I don't know why.

225
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
Don't know what they've heard about it.

226
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,600
Sometimes you're at a couple tables where your hip youthfulness is matched.

227
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,000
Exactly.

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,440
But in many cases...

229
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,560
No, many cases it's old folks, a lot of old folks.

230
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,720
And I do often wonder, are there old sitcom writers here?

231
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,080
And I've never gone table to table, but I do have that thought that like,

232
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,280
maybe there's a Munster's writer among all these old people.

233
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,880
At least Adobe Gillis.

234
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
At the very least Adobe Gillis.

235
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,680
Or at the very, very least, someone whose memory has decayed so much

236
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,800
that they now believe they were a writer for Adobe Gillis.

237
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,720
Would be fine to talk to that person.

238
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,240
If they can give you a minute of details and like,

239
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,600
Yeah, my favorite driver was Mater G. Cribbs.

240
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,880
We'd laugh and laugh and we'd order sandwich after sandwich.

241
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
And you look it up and like, he didn't even...

242
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,240
He moved to Los Angeles nine months ago.

243
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,200
He was dumped here by his family.

244
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,840
They just dropped him off at the smokehouse.

245
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,880
They figure it out.

246
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,000
Ask some bartenders.

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,760
They'll find you somewhere to live.

248
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,160
My picture's on the wall over that booth over there.

249
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,600
And you're looking, it's like Jimmy Stewart.

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,120
That's not you, sir.

251
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,480
Yeah, it is.

252
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,880
I looked different when I was younger.

253
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,320
Maybe it's an eyesight thing.

254
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,040
I don't know.

255
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,240
But yeah, smokehouse.

256
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,600
Smokehouse is a time machine.

257
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
Yeah, yeah, in general.

258
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,840
Yeah, we've referred to this place.

259
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,800
I don't know if people know.

260
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,280
The restaurant that's across from the Warner Brothers lot,

261
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,240
where there's the rumor is that there's a tunnel

262
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,880
that takes you from the Warner Brothers lot to the restaurant.

263
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,520
That's the rumor.

264
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,240
Let's try to decipher that.

265
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,520
I don't know where that ends up.

266
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,400
God, if we could determine if that's real, that's an episode, I bet.

267
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,760
The smokehouse tunnel to the Warner Brothers studio.

268
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,720
Smokehouse, separate, tunnel, separate.

269
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,600
Weird poster on the wall for an independent short film

270
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,320
called Martinis at the Smokehouse, separate.

271
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,960
Which seems to be a, from what I can tell,

272
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,720
a Midnight in Paris type thing,

273
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:10,000
where all of the ghostly legends of smokehouse yore all come back.

274
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,320
Was that word right that I used?

275
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,120
I think so.

276
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,080
I didn't want to say lore.

277
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,120
I want to say yore.

278
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,520
Is that like the past yore?

279
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,560
Oh, yeah.

280
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,280
Days of yore.

281
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,520
That's usually how it's-

282
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,240
Yeah, there you go.

283
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,800
All right.

284
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,520
Days of yore, yeah.

285
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,360
Sometimes something comes out of your mouth.

286
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,840
I know.

287
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,480
And you don't.

288
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,520
I'm instantly feeling that in the two host format that you sort of,

289
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,080
because I think-

290
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,720
A little more pressure.

291
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,440
You know, now I know you had a bunch of episodes without me.

292
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,800
Just to keep the ball in the air.

293
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,320
You cannot take a break and pass it over to-

294
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,000
No, there's no, yeah, no.

295
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,680
It's not a triangle offense anymore.

296
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,600
There's a basketball term, triangle defense.

297
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,240
I don't know.

298
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,880
It's not that anymore.

299
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,640
I bet Jason would know because he's been trying to figure out the pop fly rule.

300
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,880
So if he's been trying to figure out that,

301
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,760
then he's probably like a few years from figuring out what the triangle offense is.

302
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,160
So the Munsters.

303
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,600
Today we are talking about the Munsters at Marineland.

304
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,320
And this has actually been on my to-do list for a little bit.

305
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,840
Not just the Munsters thing, but I've been wanting to talk about,

306
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
and maybe this is a good context to talk about before this special a little bit,

307
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,760
the park that this is filmed and set in, Marine Land of the Pacific.

308
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,960
And again, just to clarify, this is not an episode of the Munsters,

309
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,160
but like a summer special where they go to this theme park,

310
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,600
which is kind of a Sea World-esque aquarium type of theme park.

311
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,520
And Marine Land of the Pacific, I guess growing up around here,

312
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,760
I knew that there was such a place, but I didn't know where it was.

313
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
I didn't know anything about the history of it.

314
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:59,520
And this all kind of moved to top of mind for me last year because about a year ago,

315
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,160
Aaron and I got a little break from our then one kiddo.

316
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,520
And we got to spend the day kind of exploring Orange County in the South Bay

317
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
and just kind of like wandering around.

318
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,880
And so we were in Orange County and we're making our way up to like more kind of the

319
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,400
Marina Del Rey neck of the woods.

320
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,680
And we're like, what can we do in that?

321
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,320
Is there like a kind of a fancy bougie lunch we could do?

322
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,840
Is there like some weird hotel that we've never been to?

323
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,560
And we looked it up like, all right, what's along the coast?

324
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,600
There's something with a beach view.

325
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,080
And we found this place with this very odd name

326
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,600
that we're staring at, like, Tyrannia.

327
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,960
And it's turned at TerraNaea is how you say it.

328
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,600
You ever heard of TerraNaea Resort?

329
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
So this is in Rancho Palos Verdes.

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,880
So we got excited when we saw this, like, okay, what's the way the hell out there?

331
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,480
But we got the whole day to explore.

332
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,360
That sounds great.

333
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,520
It seems like there's tons of restaurants there.

334
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,320
And it's like big winding path, like takes forever.

335
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,400
And you're climbing and climbing and climbing up to like the top of like you're very it's ocean

336
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:10,800
front and it's cliff side and like such high dazzling cliffs with just shimmering infinite

337
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,680
ocean views as we climb and climb to this place.

338
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,520
It is crazy beautiful.

339
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,400
And like a type of beautiful, I don't usually ascribe to the LA area.

340
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,640
It's very like Hawaii.

341
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,080
And we're just like, who knew this was?

342
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,120
I mean, I guess we've been over there once, but like didn't really know the deal.

343
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,480
And when we get to this resort, especially and like this is insane.

344
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,440
It's just like it's like sprawling so many buildings, immaculate ocean views wherever

345
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,760
you go, it's fancy, it's marble, it's smooth jazz playing everywhere.

346
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,720
That's what we want.

347
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,040
You don't always have to stay at the fancy hotel to get a little taste of the fancy hotel.

348
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
And we're walking around and we're trying to figure it out.

349
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,920
And like, so why have we never heard of this place?

350
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,120
And then we get a little afraid.

351
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
We go, oh, is this Trump?

352
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,400
Is this a Trump resort?

353
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,320
I really hope it's not a Trump resort because he does have a golf course around there.

354
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,960
Look it up.

355
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,680
No, thank God.

356
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:03,920
All right.

357
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,040
This is a fairly new place.

358
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,960
This is maybe like 2009 on kind of new spot.

359
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,600
And in looking it up, we realized, oh my God, this is the spot where Marine land of the

360
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,960
Pacific was.

361
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:24,960
There was this massive 100 acre theme park property was here and has now been converted

362
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,840
into this bougie resort.

363
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,320
We keep going and we end up at a restaurant, which I'd recommend to any, if you're trying,

364
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,520
if you're wandering around this neck of the woods and want like a cool, not even break

365
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,000
the bank kind of restaurant, really great waterfront restaurant called Nelson's.

366
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,440
Nelson's, huh?

367
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,400
What does that name mean?

368
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,080
And then we're looking around and all of the art in the restaurant is devoted to one

369
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,200
really specific actor with a very memorable face and very memorable, intense eyes.

370
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,280
And that is Lloyd Bridges.

371
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,800
Everywhere we look, old photos of Lloyd Bridges who like, and Lloyd Bridges, what are his

372
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,720
big, he was in a lot of spoof movies.

373
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,120
Like that's kind of, he's been the most relevant to us for, what are they?

374
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,320
Is he hotshots and is he an airplane?

375
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,040
Seinfeld is the like intense.

376
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,760
Mantle bomb.

377
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah, yeah.

378
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,800
Mantle bomb.

379
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,300
Is he a mantle bomb?

380
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
So like what's going on here?

381
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,160
Nelson's, and it turns out that this is a restaurant that acknowledges the Marine land

382
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:29,360
history because Lloyd Bridges played a character named Mike Nelson on a series called Seahunt.

383
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,600
You ever heard of Seahunt?

384
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:31,840
No.

385
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,360
I've never, in old TV wanderings, never run into Seahunt before.

386
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,800
Seahunt ran from 57 to 61.

387
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:38,880
Wow.

388
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,600
One of these like hundreds of episodes and still like how have I never come across this before.

389
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,360
Now this is a year ago that we went to this place and I've done a bad job of

390
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,480
looking into what's actually going on with Seahunt, but I just really liked the vibe.

391
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,080
Are you seeing anything interesting as you look up Seahunt?

392
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Because I just loved, all the posters on the wall of this place were so great where it's

393
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,720
that he's just got these like beady, crazy guy and we think of him for the spoof movies.

394
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
We see Lloyd Bridges and we're kind of laughing already.

395
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,920
So seeing him in scuba gear and then it's like old pulpy magazine covers and it says

396
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,960
Mike Nelson loved danger and he found it deep down and he's looking at you like he's about

397
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,000
to snap. He's like, I'm going to have to go buck wild on an army of crabs.

398
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,400
I'm going to fight them all hand to hand combat.

399
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,040
And then like things like here's him on the rocks.

400
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,320
Every piece of art also seems to be him shirtless in tiny, tiny shorts.

401
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,760
And in this case, like another scuba guy is punching him in the face.

402
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,720
That looks awesome.

403
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,200
It looks so awesome. So Seahunt was filmed on this property.

404
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,280
Marineland was the like filming home of Seahunt.

405
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,600
Here's another one. Like this guy was fucking, he had one of those.

406
00:18:59,600 --> 00:18:59,920
Oh yeah.

407
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,440
Just like, you know, like diver kind of bodies.

408
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,760
Here he is in even tinier shorts.

409
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,160
Like he looks like tanned up, greased up, holding a weird little machine gun in front of a sea cave.

410
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,360
Wow. Seahunt.

411
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,860
Seahunt.

412
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,240
Bring back Seahunt.

413
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,480
Oh, Leonard Nimoy was on it. Eight episodes.

414
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,720
Yes. Leonard Nimoy was on it. His kids were on it.

415
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,000
Jeff and Bo were on a bunch when they were really little.

416
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,120
One of Jack Nicholson's first TV credits.

417
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,840
Was on Seahunt.

418
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,560
I found a really great YouTube channel of like an old.

419
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,880
This guy befriends the Jimmy Angel.

420
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,960
This is like an old diver who's sitting in front of some film canisters.

421
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,440
And he's talking about all the stars of Seahunt, all the old actors.

422
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
And he frames it in the same way every time.

423
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,120
He kind of like daughters on and on.

424
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,200
He says, Leonard Nimoy was on it, you know?

425
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,880
And people didn't know who he was back then.

426
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,840
They'd say, who's that?

427
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,920
Oh, Leonard, he's just a nobody.

428
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,720
He's just a nobody getting his start.

429
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,880
And then before you know it,

430
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,520
he becomes one of the icons of American screens.

431
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,960
The one he's Leonard Nimoy as we know him today.

432
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,680
He says the same thing. Who's that?

433
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh, that's this kid, Larry. Larry Hagman.

434
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,960
He's a nobody. He'll do Seahunt for us.

435
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,880
He needs it. He's hungry and desperate.

436
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
He'll come here anyway.

437
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
But now he's he's what's his name?

438
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,320
He played on the Sean and J.R. He's J.R. on the.

439
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,720
I was like, I was enamored.

440
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,760
I think it's not described in this old divers YouTube.

441
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,280
He's the guy who owns the most Seahunt

442
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,480
memorabilia in the world.

443
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,600
If that's not a YouTube channel you got to subscribe to.

444
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,080
I don't know what it is.

445
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,360
Seahunt memorabilia.

446
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Yeah. Yeah. Well, he might own that gun.

447
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,440
He might own pieces of coral.

448
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,040
Where Lloyd Bridges got his head smashed in.

449
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,360
Wow. I wonder if they have like action figures

450
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,640
or something for Seahunt.

451
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,680
I don't know. It might not have been.

452
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,040
It was like syndicated.

453
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,160
I don't know if it made it to like,

454
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,560
I don't think it was one of the primary shows.

455
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,040
No.

456
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,160
Well, you know what it was.

457
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,680
Syndicated show with beefcakes on the beach.

458
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,600
This was the Baywatch of its time.

459
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:01,920
Right.

460
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,600
This was Baywatch before Baywatch.

461
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,280
So anyway, I've already let everybody down.

462
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,320
This has been a year and I've not done the deep dive on.

463
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,840
I haven't gotten greased up.

464
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,240
Wow.

465
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,600
Much more jacked and dove off the cliff and explored Seahunt.

466
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,240
But anyway.

467
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,600
Is Seahunt streaming anywhere?

468
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,440
Pluto TV.

469
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,240
It's a Pluto.

470
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,040
We got Pluto.

471
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,760
Hey, they got to flesh out these lineups with something.

472
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,520
Which by the way, the Munster special that we'll talk about

473
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,480
is pretty accessible.

474
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,760
I think 2B was one of them.

475
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,960
I think this is some real like streamer bait.

476
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,040
If you have a streamer and you're looking to populate it

477
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,680
with something, I think you can get Munster's Marine Land

478
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,960
Carnival pretty easy.

479
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,640
There was a show called The Aquanauts in 1960.

480
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,280
Ooh.

481
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,080
And then a show called Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea

482
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,840
and ran from 64 to 68.

483
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,400
So there were a lot of sea-based shows

484
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,680
that I really have never heard of or never seen.

485
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,640
Well, things maybe trying to tap into the Jacques Cousteau

486
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,140
thing.

487
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,040
Yeah, a little odd.

488
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,840
The sad thing is I started poking around.

489
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,600
I just got bored because I didn't immediately counter

490
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,960
Lloyd Bridges bludgeoning an octopus to death in scene one.

491
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,200
Like that's what I wanted to be.

492
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,520
I know.

493
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,960
I'm worried it's boring.

494
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,240
I think probably.

495
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Well, and which is the magic of Baywatch for me,

496
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,920
that it is not boring for the most part.

497
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,280
Early on, it's when they were trying to be more of a real show.

498
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,520
Yeah.

499
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,480
But Sea Hunt didn't make it.

500
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,960
Sea Hunt didn't get to its shark-jumping sixth, seventh,

501
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,920
eighth seasons that just turn into long music videos

502
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,680
that Lloyd Bridges is doing, which is really a shame.

503
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,240
But yeah.

504
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,760
I want to see him getting electrocuted by an electric eel

505
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,320
and then he retains the electricity of the eel

506
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,960
and turns into kind of an evil electric Lloyd Bridges

507
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,600
and starts zapping his family and friends.

508
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,760
That's what I want the show to be.

509
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,480
And then Jack Nicholson's part of it

510
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,520
and he becomes some sort of electro figure alongside him.

511
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,880
That's what I want the show to be.

512
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,480
But you can't get everything.

513
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,640
Yeah.

514
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,840
You want it to be lost in space, Batman 60s mixed with Sea Hunt.

515
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,320
Yeah.

516
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,880
Yeah.

517
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,200
Yeah.

518
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,920
Not yeah.

519
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,920
But it sucks because often, and this isn't always the case,

520
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,080
but sometimes when I see old stuff I go,

521
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,120
there's probably a reason I haven't seen it yet.

522
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,680
Like no one's recommended Sea Hunt to me yet.

523
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,120
Because somebody would have championed it before.

524
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,280
I would love to be wrong, but I feel like it's probably kind of boring.

525
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,400
There's not an episode where Lloyd Bridges gets fooled

526
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,640
because a piece of trash draped onto the head of a walrus,

527
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,200
which made him believe it was a sexy lady

528
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,680
and then he married the walrus for a while.

529
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,180
Yeah.

530
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,600
Just like Lloyd Bridges going to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis,

531
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,560
like swimming down to Atlantis and seeing what a 60s Atlantis set is.

532
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,040
Yeah.

533
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,000
And him fighting like the king of Atlantis for the throne.

534
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,920
Like that's what I want.

535
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,760
Because he fell in love with the princess of Atlantis.

536
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,720
Of course, yeah.

537
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,400
He fell in love with his wife, stabs him with a trident.

538
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,600
Guy who has like a half bass head is like,

539
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,200
they're already engaged to be married and he has to punch his way to her heart.

540
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,760
Right.

541
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,600
And then, yes, he has kids that are half mer-baby, half Lloyd.

542
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,240
Well, we'll see.

543
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,280
But it's not that show.

544
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,600
Yeah, that already, that's what it could have become in season eight, I think,

545
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,000
is we have left, he's no longer a marine biologist or whatever the hell he is.

546
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,240
He's now the king of Atlantis.

547
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,120
Yes, exactly.

548
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,360
Yes.

549
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,920
Oh, why doesn't, oh my God.

550
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,880
My new goal needs to be like Trojan horsing a show.

551
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,360
It's just a relatable kind of like, you know,

552
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,760
and it's about three guys and they work at the post office,

553
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,560
but they're very different, but they make it all work and they,

554
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,440
and it's very refillable, you see, and every second of that,

555
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,080
I have the intention of turning the show in success to becoming about the king of Atlantis.

556
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,560
Yeah, of course, that is the dream.

557
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,960
I know, it's a bummer.

558
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,840
What if something like The Bear like eventually become like,

559
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,240
it's all a long con and like, no, no, no, the Chicago restaurant era is long over.

560
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,400
They've been in Atlantis for six seasons now.

561
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,440
Yeah, well, and as we've discussed, like they, the genres had to scatter from the network,

562
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,520
from the major networks too.

563
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,520
So it's like, they're even more adverse usually, unless it's like a drama now,

564
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,280
like they've put things in boxes.

565
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,120
I'm trying to think it wasn't the last like silly mainstream super,

566
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,800
like things with supernatural elements on like NBC or ABC.

567
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,160
I think you got to go back to the TGI.

568
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,720
You have to go back to waning TGI shows about like genies and angels,

569
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,040
but then those weren't, those weren't good either is the thing.

570
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:41,840
Right.

571
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,680
Super Teenage Witch, I think of some quality writers on it.

572
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,480
That was silly, but like those moved to like Nickelodeon more.

573
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,160
I guess there was like that DC, like superhero cleanup show,

574
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
but like no one, I don't know.

575
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,640
That's kind of like, there's some silly thing.

576
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,280
I don't know.

577
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,120
I just mean, there's not a high concept.

578
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,800
What show is that?

579
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,600
Wasn't Jenny Pearson on it?

580
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
The one that Jenny Pearson was on, yeah.

581
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,100
Yeah.

582
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,600
I mean, I'm just trying to, like if there's going to be a mainstream monsters TV show now,

583
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
it's got to be a drama for some reason.

584
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,120
I don't know why.

585
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,960
It is my hope.

586
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,680
I don't know.

587
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,280
With the state of the world as it is, that we can all just commit

588
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,120
to getting sillier and sillier.

589
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,600
That actually, I think I can kind of weave us back to-

590
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,080
Hold it.

591
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,040
Can I say my pitch again?

592
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,320
I've said it on the show before.

593
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,200
Southern Munsters.

594
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,800
That's my pitch.

595
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,920
You've said Southern Munsters on the show before?

596
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,960
I think so.

597
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,680
This is my pitch.

598
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,400
Southern Munsters.

599
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
It's like, I mean, Reba's on TV, but like Reba,

600
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,000
it's like Tim Blake Nelson dressed as a Frankenstein.

601
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,520
Sure.

602
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,560
Same thing as the Munsters.

603
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,440
There's not much to it.

604
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
Southern Munsters.

605
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,320
So kind of a Beverly Munsterbillies is what you're describing.

606
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,680
Sam Elliott's in there.

607
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,440
He's like grandpa, I guess.

608
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,240
That is a good one.

609
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,360
Also, because this is the thing, like kind of a new Trump era.

610
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,600
Right.

611
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,960
We think we got to be like all the streamers are going to be kind of like,

612
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,960
you know, desperately courting the red states again.

613
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,280
So that's a, yeah, yeah, you bring back Munsters, but then like-

614
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,480
Summer, some Southern Munsters.

615
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,880
You could call it Southern Munsters, I suppose.

616
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,280
You feel like Tyler Perry might go in on Munsters?

617
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,080
Sure.

618
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,320
Like kind of a Munsters with heart?

619
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,240
The only thing is he would just probably make his own

620
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,560
because he wouldn't get as much money because he has to split it with-

621
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,040
Oh, yeah.

622
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,680
What am I saying?

623
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,960
There's no IP going on.

624
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,200
Yeah.

625
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,760
Why would he?

626
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,560
Yeah.

627
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,520
He wouldn't waste his time.

628
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,960
He would do his own monster show.

629
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,360
Yeah.

630
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,600
Yeah.

631
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,800
Oh, a thousand percent.

632
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,080
So yeah, that's my pitch.

633
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,040
We're quickly understanding.

634
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,320
We're reminding ourselves the economics of Tyler Perry world.

635
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,680
But anyway, I just found all this interesting.

636
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,200
It was really nice being at that place.

637
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,160
And then I started discovering, okay, well, tons of stuff filmed around there.

638
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,560
Partridge Family, Mannix, The Six Million Dollar Man, The A-Team,

639
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,240
and why Batman 66, one of our favorite films, something filmed at Marine Land.

640
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,080
I'm not sure what, but you know, there's a bunch of,

641
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,120
because they're dealing with submarines and bat boats and stuff.

642
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,240
Not the dock though.

643
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Not the famous bomb dock scene probably.

644
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,160
That is, ah, I always forget what that is.

645
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,320
It might be like Santa Barbara or Malibu.

646
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,800
I don't, yeah, it's not where Batman's running around with the big bomb.

647
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,040
Right.

648
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,760
One of the finest scenes in movie history.

649
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,480
This did remind me of the fact, and reminding myself of Munster's stuff,

650
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,360
Munster's mega hit, like huge, huge hit for two seasons.

651
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,600
It was only on for two seasons, but the seasons were all like north of 30 episodes.

652
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
60 episodes.

653
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,360
Yeah.

654
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,120
They jammed that all into two years.

655
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
And the special, we're talking about this Marine Land special,

656
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,880
was done between those two seasons.

657
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,600
I didn't realize, I did not know this chronology,

658
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,240
that Munster's huge hit season one, whichever other network,

659
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
I'm not even sure, ABC?

660
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,280
I don't know.

661
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,680
I don't know what was on what network, but the other networks,

662
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,800
like we got to bring Munster's down.

663
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,360
What do we do?

664
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,040
Hey, I got this new thing, Batman.

665
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,560
Let's get Munster's in the crosshairs, because I didn't know that.

666
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,800
Yeah, Batman killed off the Munster's.

667
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,040
Wow.

668
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,320
Isn't that disturbing that two of our favorite things were enemies,

669
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,200
that they were fighting so much of the same spirit?

670
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,840
It is true.

671
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,920
But then Batman kind of burns out quickly too,

672
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,840
in the way that they did that as well, where they,

673
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,360
it's like a ton of episodes in one season,

674
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,960
and then that's done after three years too.

675
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,040
And they're two episodes a week, so that they had every opportunity

676
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,640
to just like burn people through.

677
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:16,960
Yeah.

678
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,200
Right.

679
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,040
Flash phenomenon.

680
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:28,400
Someone might say that perhaps the Munster's had said all it had to say by year two.

681
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,040
I don't know that I'm saying that, but perhaps.

682
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,000
Worthy years.

683
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,440
Well, I mean, what it would have had to say around this time is like,

684
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,800
they would have had to address kind of like the Flower Generation,

685
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
and the Sunshine People.

686
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,120
Is there ever anything like that?

687
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,760
Do we know?

688
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,240
Does Herman put on long hair?

689
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,880
Oh, yeah.

690
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,600
Yeah, that's one of them.

691
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,880
I feel like that is one of the episodes.

692
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,600
I know, I think so.

693
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,320
I mean, there's definitely, there's a Beatles stand-in episode,

694
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,560
there's a fake Beatles episode,

695
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
where they're even performing a Beatles song.

696
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,320
There's some dealing with youth culture.

697
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,120
Is it a made-up Beatles type band,

698
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
or isn't like a good band?

699
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,360
I want to say that one of these duo bands,

700
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,520
like Chad and Jeremy, or Peter and Gordon, were on the Munsters.

701
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,480
Chad and Jeremy were on the Munsters,

702
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,680
but I think it's a different...

703
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Chad and Jeremy also on Dick Van Dyke's show,

704
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,200
I believe there's an episode.

705
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,440
But I believe there's a different episode I'm thinking about.

706
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,000
Beatles analoged Munsters.

707
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,400
I think they were...

708
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,080
Fifth Beatle Herman Munster, I forget.

709
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,600
Munsters, I don't know.

710
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,120
This is going to take more research to do it,

711
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,720
but I believe both existed.

712
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
I don't think that was the same episode that I'm talking about.

713
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,200
Well, because none of these episodes have been about the show.

714
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,720
One was about the Rob Zombie movie.

715
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,720
One was about his restaurant in New York,

716
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,800
in which I saw one ad in which Grandpa Munster calls himself Grandpa,

717
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,600
and I will never not call him Grandpa from now on.

718
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,520
And now they saw Marine Land Special,

719
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,000
people have recommended, I think, over the years,

720
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
or maybe it's snuck into the Club 3 suggestions,

721
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,320
but I figure this might be a fun time to do it.

722
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,920
I want to talk about my Marine Land stuff,

723
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,240
which I'll dovetail back around to that,

724
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,480
what happened to Marine Land and why

725
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,440
we have Terra Nega Resort and no Marine Land today.

726
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,080
But I guess let's focus on the special for now.

727
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,400
You're going to find it if you look it up on 2B or wherever else it is.

728
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,160
I think Munsters Marine Land is going to get it for you.

729
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,960
I think Munsters Marine Land Carnival is one of the names,

730
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,040
but when it was playing on 2B,

731
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,520
there was a huge block of text on the screen,

732
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,560
and I wrote it all down.

733
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,760
It said that what I was watching was called

734
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,520
Marine Land Carnival with the Munsters TV show cast members.

735
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,720
It's not a very economical use of words there.

736
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Anyway, but don't bother typing all that.

737
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,680
That's a big effort.

738
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
Just put in Munsters Marine Land and you'll find it.

739
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,840
This was a special film in 1965,

740
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,120
which somehow has to bring together the family of monsters,

741
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,000
the family where there's a Frankenstein and several vampires and a wolf man,

742
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,720
and we have to get them to a park that is where you see dolphin races.

743
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,200
So I had the question going in,

744
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,960
how narratively do we tie all of this together?

745
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,780
Yeah.

746
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,640
I guess the overarching story here, the why,

747
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,360
is that they believe that they are at the world's largest pet store.

748
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,080
Fish store.

749
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,960
Fish store.

750
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,720
Fish store is what they say.

751
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,800
Okay, yeah, and that they are looking for a pet for Eddie,

752
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,960
their wolf man son.

753
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,080
So that maybe some of the more monstrous creatures

754
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,160
who you can see at Marine Land,

755
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,320
like walruses or electric eels,

756
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,600
might be suitable pets for Eddie to take home.

757
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,080
Right.

758
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,720
And this is the dense narrative web that is woven.

759
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,560
It's pretty good, honestly, as a premise for the Munsters.

760
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,920
It's a pretty good premise.

761
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,240
That's all I need.

762
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,000
And then I get to watch that crazy coach pull up

763
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,920
to between a bunch of fish tanks.

764
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,480
Sounds good to me.

765
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,600
Which looks dangerous.

766
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,480
The Munsters coach, not the Dracula,

767
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,000
the Munsters coach pulls up.

768
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,560
Just spelled with a K, is that how you make it scary?

769
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,680
The Munsters coach pulls up with Eddie, Marilyn, and grandpa on the back,

770
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,080
like on the chair where granny sits on the Beverly Hill billies,

771
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,040
like that elevated part of a car.

772
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,680
And it looks like, you got to hold on to that thing.

773
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,320
That doesn't look like it's so secure.

774
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,800
All these shows establish that the funniest place

775
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,000
for the oldest person to sit is up top on the perch,

776
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,720
but it's also the most dangerous place by far.

777
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,400
Yes, and they're right.

778
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,520
That is funny.

779
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,240
I don't know that they didn't lose a couple of grannies.

780
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,200
Possibly, yeah.

781
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
Although they all look the same.

782
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,080
There might have been several granny hillbillies.

783
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,580
Yes.

784
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,560
In my mind, their last name is Hillbilly.

785
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,920
What's their name?

786
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,960
Clamp it, I believe.

787
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm not a big Beverly Hillbillies guy.

788
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,080
Though I do like Hillbilly nonsense,

789
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,760
so maybe I need to get into the Beverly Hillbillies.

790
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,640
Yeah, that's confusing.

791
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,520
I remember kind of enjoying the film with Jim Varney and Floris Leachman.

792
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,520
I remember, yeah, maybe I've only seen a little bit of the film,

793
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,800
but not 30 years ago.

794
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,960
I mean, I'm positive it's not good.

795
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,240
No, I don't think it's good.

796
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,920
I did like Green Acres okay, though.

797
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,640
Okay, sure.

798
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
I do like Green Acres to some degree.

799
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,720
It is probably for the best that you want,

800
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,560
because if you were more into these things,

801
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,640
like then we're fully edging out all of the theme parks

802
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,720
that are barely making it into the show these days.

803
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,760
If we have to devote ample time to Petticoat Junction,

804
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,400
like we're like, all right, sorry.

805
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,360
What have we not done yet?

806
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,800
Radiator Springs Racers.

807
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,560
Well, the only, like Radiator Springs Racers is lucky

808
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,720
that it's got a Hillbilly character in there.

809
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,440
That's true.

810
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,160
Because otherwise.

811
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,880
And Radiator Springs, sorry, I was going to cut you off,

812
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,520
but Radiator Springs Racers is partly why I started

813
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,600
really getting into the old Hillbilly nonsense

814
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,360
is because Roly Poly plays in the line.

815
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,160
Oh, that's right.

816
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,720
Radiator Springs Racers figured out what it was.

817
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,520
There was, I think in one of those Scott Free episodes,

818
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,440
I think Jason just like quoted something

819
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,560
that was like three verses deep into one of those songs.

820
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
And I'm just like lost.

821
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,600
I am beyond, he's like assuming knowledge of the deep,

822
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,960
like the third of five verses of Roly Poly.

823
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,920
Trying to remember what that is.

824
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,120
Daddy's little fatty.

825
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,720
Eating corn and taters.

826
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,160
I think something like, yeah, yeah.

827
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,920
It was a joke of the nature of like,

828
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,000
well, I'm always eating my corn and taters.

829
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,800
And even you were like, what's that now?

830
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,720
I don't remember.

831
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,680
Look, I don't remember it.

832
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,720
When you're doing two, I like,

833
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,320
I won't remember any of this later either.

834
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,680
When you're doing two, you got to be focused.

835
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,920
So I'm just, it's, I'm just having it happen to me.

836
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,800
And then it comes out.

837
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,080
No, it is interesting.

838
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,160
I mean, what we could do is just like,

839
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,640
kind of like take breathers here and there,

840
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,040
just like kind of both of us just drift,

841
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,920
allow our voices to break and then chop all those out.

842
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,960
Maybe that's what happened.

843
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,000
Maybe what you're listening.

844
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,840
Yeah, we could have done it.

845
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,240
Yeah.

846
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,720
Yeah.

847
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,280
Yeah.

848
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,080
I don't know though.

849
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,440
I think we've got to, we've got to become a rapid fire.

850
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,240
This is, you know, we got to,

851
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,480
we got to be a middle ditch in Schwartz.

852
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,360
You know, we got to be locked in rapid fire.

853
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,080
I know.

854
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,960
Guns blazing.

855
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,760
And this is the problem too,

856
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,880
because right now I'm like,

857
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,920
I cannot find confirmation that Chad and Jeremy were on Monster.

858
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,280
So maybe I'm wrong about that,

859
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,320
but I believe that the fake band is the Standells

860
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,760
who performed I Want to Hold Your Hand

861
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,200
in the Munsters living room.

862
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,400
They do I Want to Hold Your Hand.

863
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,160
They do I Want to Hold Your Hand, yes.

864
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
And I believe I said it on this show before.

865
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,800
I've mentioned that they do the actual Beatles song.

866
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,960
I fully, fully believe that.

867
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,200
I see no reason not to believe that.

868
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,960
Well, in this special, you have a real band,

869
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,520
a real great band, a wonderful band,

870
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,520
you know, kind of taking some of the work away from the Munsters.

871
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,400
The Munsters are the hosts and their little stories,

872
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,400
the wraparounds that take you into the different aquatic exhibits.

873
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,760
But as the beginning tells you,

874
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,480
you also are going to be getting a lot of musical treats

875
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
from the new Christy Minstrels.

876
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:10,980
Yes.

877
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,240
This, which is a new level of lame old reference even for us.

878
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,400
I don't think, I think somehow we've never talked about

879
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,840
the new Christy Minstrels.

880
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,560
I don't think so, yeah.

881
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,840
This is some real like up with people kind of,

882
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,200
I mean, clearly the basis for The Mighty Wind,

883
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,400
the new Main Street Singers,

884
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,800
the group with like way too many people.

885
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,680
And they're all the whitest people with the whitest smiles.

886
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,520
And I don't think I realized till watching this

887
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,440
how exactly right on that is.

888
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,800
The parody is perfect, yeah.

889
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,440
Yeah, yeah, it is precisely what this is.

890
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,720
So new Christy Minstrels are in this.

891
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,800
They, they perform, yes, some of the, you know,

892
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,480
the whitest music you've ever heard.

893
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,880
Got me wondering, what is the deal with this group?

894
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,000
And also like, okay, the new Christy Minstrels,

895
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,640
what were the old Christy Minstrels?

896
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,440
Quick check of a couple of links.

897
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,520
Uh-oh, real Minstrels.

898
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:07,840
Yeah.

899
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,240
Whoops.

900
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,120
I mean, I guess I should have known,

901
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,480
but you know, don't go looking into the old Christy Minstrels.

902
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:14,560
No.

903
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,840
The new Christy Minstrels improved on the model by, you know,

904
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,120
not doing that.

905
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,280
Somewhat upsettingly,

906
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,840
and I'm kind of glad Jason's not here to hear this,

907
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,040
that old, the old Minstrel tradition of this.

908
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,280
Apparently that group was the group that popularized

909
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,520
some of the biggest songs of the 1840s,

910
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,200
such as Camp Town Races and Swanee River,

911
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,000
very much in the Jason Sings the Old One's pocket.

912
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,320
Yeah.

913
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,800
And I'm just, I'm sorry that some of his Spotify raps,

914
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,800
six and seven of the year tied up into kind of an unsavory tradition.

915
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,640
Yes.

916
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,120
I will.

917
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,600
Well, we'll see.

918
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,000
Maybe.

919
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,400
I don't know, but we'll see what I look.

920
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,120
I'm still digging for his actual top 10.

921
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,200
You know, I dug, I dug last.

922
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,160
I want to find it.

923
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,240
I don't know where it last night.

924
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,760
Or I meant last episode.

925
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,120
I guess depending on when this comes out.

926
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,480
Are you hacking into his file?

927
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,760
Are you from afar?

928
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,040
That would be a little weird.

929
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,480
Trying to tap into his phone.

930
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,720
No, I haven't like, so like sat outside with some sort of equipment

931
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,360
trying to hack into his wifi.

932
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,320
Look, just to see what

933
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,520
just to see what the last five songs are.

934
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,040
The answer, the answer is going to be new pornographers.

935
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,480
The only band that he has enjoyed in the last 40 years.

936
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,640
There was a brief window of time where he was interested in new music.

937
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,520
He found that it closed that chapter.

938
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,480
No need to go back.

939
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,360
It's probably what it is, but I just think there's something in there.

940
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,000
That's fun.

941
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,560
I don't know.

942
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,280
I don't know why.

943
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,560
I don't know what I was drawing.

944
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,920
I just feel like there's going to be a song in there.

945
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,200
You go, whoa, what's that?

946
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,680
Yeah.

947
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:49,840
Yeah.

948
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,680
And then we got a whole, well, and then we're off to the races.

949
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,480
Yeah.

950
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,600
To the camp town races.

951
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,240
Exactly.

952
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,480
Yeah.

953
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,040
Well, I was trying to see if there was a cover of camp town races by Chapel Roan.

954
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,840
I'm just making sure that in Jason's absence, we still get our

955
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,240
every episode reference to Chapel Roan.

956
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,440
And I want to make sure we're still checking all the boxes.

957
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:11,940
Yeah.

958
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,120
So I could be wrong about Chad.

959
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,960
And Chad and Jeremy maybe didn't appear.

960
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,240
I can't get it confirmed.

961
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,440
And I'm saying that's the tricky thing about doing two people.

962
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,400
One episode, because I can't fully get that.

963
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,360
And I don't want to be wrong.

964
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,200
You can divet.

965
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,040
I can talk and you cannot listen.

966
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,440
Yeah.

967
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,560
But I like to listen.

968
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:30,800
Yeah.

969
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,360
It's more.

970
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,320
Listening is better.

971
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,680
It's certainly more awkward.

972
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,640
But Far Out Monsters is the rock and roll episode

973
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,800
where they're dealing with youth culture.

974
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,040
The 50-year-old writers are all figuring out what they think about these beetles.

975
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,080
I don't know about these beetles.

976
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,320
Well, you get a little bit of beetles reflected in this at some point.

977
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,960
You do, yes.

978
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:51,920
Hey, wait.

979
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,560
Look, why not?

980
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,920
I think what happens is, OK, so there's a lot of little vignettes

981
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,640
where the monsters pop around and see different types of fish.

982
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,080
And at some point, one of the more entertaining ones

983
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,160
is that they run into a wall-talking walrus.

984
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,400
And they say that the walruses want to break into show business.

985
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,120
Yeah.

986
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,480
And that they all, it's a tough road for them

987
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,560
because they are walruses, first of all.

988
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,560
And then, second of all, that they only speak blubberies.

989
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,360
Yeah.

990
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,920
And then they perform kind of like a jazz scat song for the monsters.

991
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,440
It's really weird.

992
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,800
So a bunch of walruses perform a jazz for an all-monster audience to hear.

993
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,240
And then when it's over, somebody says, well, it was better than the beetles.

994
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:40,560
Yeah.

995
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,720
Grandpa says it?

996
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,080
I think, yeah, sounds right.

997
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,440
It's better than the beetles.

998
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,760
And then because it's easier to understand what they're saying,

999
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,120
and they're much better looking.

1000
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,880
Was that a big complaint that you couldn't understand the beetles?

1001
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,800
I know, so like Bob Dylan, I guess, there's all been famous bands

1002
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
where they're mumbly-mumbly.

1003
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,680
I don't know.

1004
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,040
But maybe the beetles, just because you would enunciate as a singer

1005
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,840
up until that point, and then just like, I'm trying to think

1006
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,920
of what the most mumbly beetle song even is.

1007
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,200
I can't think.

1008
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,800
The main music that I know from kind of the pre-beetles era is holiday music,

1009
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,680
because it's when it kind of like grows its head again every year.

1010
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,920
And then because all flash to like, I guess a hit song before the beetles was,

1011
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,760
it's the holiday season, the holiday season.

1012
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,720
And in that, that's not only one singer, but then more,

1013
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,760
then like 20 more singers all come in, and they all super enunciate too.

1014
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,400
Right.

1015
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,640
So yeah, the beetles with their screaming.

1016
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,440
There'll be a song where they just go, wah!

1017
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,360
What did they even say?

1018
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,680
It was just a scream.

1019
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,120
Don't worry about it sometimes.

1020
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,240
They didn't even say what season they were enjoying.

1021
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,200
What holiday is this celebrating?

1022
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,920
Nowhere in that scream did they say if they were excited that friends and family are near.

1023
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,720
Rock and roll music is trash.

1024
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,800
They all come from broken homes, and they're going to make new ones.

1025
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,720
And they're ugly too.

1026
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,680
So ugly.

1027
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,560
Look at that hair.

1028
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,520
That's another, yeah, they're ugly.

1029
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,760
And then also like, they look like girls.

1030
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,440
They look like beautiful girls who I can't take my eyes off of, but also they're ugly.

1031
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,120
Every sitcom in these years had an episode like this,

1032
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,680
where they would just make fun of the beetles' hair,

1033
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,080
and they were too loud, and what they would do to the girls.

1034
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,240
And it's just like every like old TV writer who was 38 probably,

1035
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,400
was just like, what is this shit?

1036
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,760
What is this fucking garbage?

1037
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,320
I'm going to take them down a peg using the Beverly Hillbillies.

1038
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,680
I have my pulpit.

1039
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,240
My pulpit is a petticoat junction.

1040
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,400
I'm going to show how foolish this rock music is once and for all.

1041
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,120
Uncle Fester's going to put on a mop top wig,

1042
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,440
and he's going to stick it to these beetles.

1043
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,920
Go fuck yourself, beetles.

1044
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,520
He's going to sing a song that's like what they do.

1045
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,400
Here, listen to him.

1046
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,000
Be-bop-a-doo.

1047
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,280
Be-bop-a-doo-pee.

1048
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,000
See, this is what you sound like, idiots.

1049
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,560
You'll change your tune.

1050
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,680
You get old like me.

1051
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,640
I'm trying to think there is a Batman.

1052
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,400
Batman is cool too.

1053
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,440
He dances the Batusi, but I'm trying to think what that episode is.

1054
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,680
There are relevant depictions of youth culture like the Batusi,

1055
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,160
but they weren't always so on the mark.

1056
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,280
Yeah, yeah.

1057
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,240
Not perfect.

1058
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,800
Well, look, I imagine the same people who programmed,

1059
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,200
who like, well, let's make sure we get a lot of anti-beetles material in there,

1060
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,640
are also kind of overseeing the new Christy Minstrel side of it,

1061
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,400
where at some point they said, now here to perform one of their greatest hits,

1062
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,640
and then they just do, this land is your land.

1063
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,440
You're like, wait a minute.

1064
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,400
I think they had a hit with it.

1065
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,200
That's what I read.

1066
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,800
That's not their song.

1067
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,760
And it probably did.

1068
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,960
The new Christy Minstrel's cover of This Land is Your Land,

1069
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,840
I was going to say like beat out Sgt. Pepper for the Grammys.

1070
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1071
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,360
But probably not even.

1072
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:19,360
It probably like somehow beat out Run DMC for best hip hop performance in 1986.

1073
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,960
Like revival of it in there.

1074
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,760
Well, they didn't get enough Grammys when they were around,

1075
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,040
so we slunk them into a category in 1987.

1076
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,280
There's nine people in that group.

1077
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,960
They require a lot of Grammys.

1078
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,720
We're doing them a disservice by not shoveling Grammys their way every year.

1079
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,640
And Kenny Rogers in the group here?

1080
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,200
Is that right?

1081
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,480
It says he's in the, on IMDB, he's in there,

1082
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,480
and it does list that like his career was started with this band.

1083
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,840
Is he one of these nine?

1084
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,720
That's what I think.

1085
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
That's what it suggests.

1086
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,600
Wow, that's wild.

1087
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,120
Yeah, I think, let me see, Munsters.

1088
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,720
Yeah, I think on, well, he's for sure listed on IMDB.

1089
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,320
And then on the Wikipedia, it says that this group launched his career.

1090
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,560
So this is before New Edition, First Edition.

1091
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,240
I mean, it was before New Edition.

1092
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,880
Yes, but First Edition was the Kenny Rogers band.

1093
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,760
Okay, I didn't know that.

1094
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,600
Which is just stopped into check or whatever.

1095
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,320
My condition is in from, people know it from Big Lebowski.

1096
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,200
Oh, he's in that?

1097
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,840
Yeah, that's him.

1098
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,240
That's him.

1099
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,360
So he had like a, he kind of had a trippy rock and roll band

1100
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,960
before kind of just being like, you know, like the guy you'd see on infomercials.

1101
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,080
And that's from a movie starring Jeff Bridges, Son of Siemens.

1102
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,800
Right, there you go.

1103
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,320
Son of Mike Nelson himself.

1104
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,960
Now I can think of it.

1105
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,840
I just dropped in to see what my condition, my condition is in.

1106
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,400
Yeah.

1107
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,440
Which is a cool song.

1108
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,400
I know, it is.

1109
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,040
Wow.

1110
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,400
In fact, I didn't know.

1111
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,440
So he's had a couple different phases.

1112
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,680
Here's a really unconfirmed fact.

1113
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,600
First of all, I think we've, we're so deep into the episode,

1114
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,520
I don't want to veer us into this tangent too much.

1115
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,480
But I do think that we've undermeditated on this crazy information that

1116
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,120
Frank Marshall's dad, Jack Marshall, wrote the Munster's theme song.

1117
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:07,440
That is wild, yeah.

1118
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,920
I forget if we've even fully addressed that on the show.

1119
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,320
Right.

1120
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:14,080
Well, among the strange like connective tissue that is like, who gets,

1121
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,400
we talk about Grandpa Munster a lot and then who gets cast to play him in the movie.

1122
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
The guy who played Jay Leno in Wait, Shift.

1123
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,960
Again, we talk about Frank Marshall a bunch,

1124
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,080
then it turns out his dad wrote the Munster's theme.

1125
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,720
But also then I was just watching this John Williams documentary on Disney Plus

1126
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,440
and they bring up that, well, Frank Marshall is interviewed and he brings up how

1127
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,440
his dad, Jack Marshall, writer of the Munster's theme,

1128
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,080
was in the army band with John Williams.

1129
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,800
Oh, wow.

1130
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah, so they went way back.

1131
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,840
So when Indiana Jones comes up, the opportunity to collaborate

1132
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:56,400
and create an iconic score with his dad's cool friend was an incredible experience.

1133
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:56,880
So there you go.

1134
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,120
So there are interesting Frank Marshall stories out there.

1135
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,400
They do exist.

1136
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,000
He, to Frank's credit, there's a lot of interesting stuff about him that I don't talk about.

1137
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,160
That's less interesting to me, even though I like the things he was involved in,

1138
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
which is less interesting to me to talk about.

1139
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,400
Sure.

1140
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,200
To Frank's credit, there's plenty of interesting things he's been involved in in his life.

1141
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,920
You just choose a deeper, a deeper cut of that's, you know,

1142
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,520
if you're a purist and seeking information that is interesting.

1143
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,400
This is a wrong podcast if that's what you're looking for.

1144
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,080
Interesting information.

1145
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,360
That's not this podcast.

1146
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,360
But this one here, this one might be interesting.

1147
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,920
All of that was a roundabout way to say, and this was only,

1148
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,280
I only saw this in comments, so this is unconfirmed,

1149
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,520
but in the Munsters theme song, before the electric guitar kicks in,

1150
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,640
it kind of starts with a big ba-ba-bum, which is a timpani.

1151
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,320
And there are people who believe that that timpani was played by John Williams' dad.

1152
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:54,880
Really?

1153
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,080
It was also a John Williams.

1154
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,600
But that's a rumor.

1155
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:57,840
Yes.

1156
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,720
That's just a rumored, yeah.

1157
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,400
We combine a lot of, okay, so is it interesting to hear

1158
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,040
liner notes information about who played on what?

1159
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,840
Possibly not.

1160
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,480
But what if that information is not credible?

1161
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,320
Now we're talking podcast the ride.

1162
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:12,560
Yeah.

1163
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,800
Podcast that was once about theme parks.

1164
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,400
One, a long time, days of yore, when podcast the ride was about theme parks.

1165
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,960
It feels like when the Munsters writers were still alive.

1166
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,280
We are about theme parks, though, here, because this was filmed at Marine Land at the time.

1167
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,520
At the time, this is filmed, one of the most thriving theme parks in the state, in Los Angeles.

1168
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,600
Marine Land opened in 54, it got the jump on Disneyland.

1169
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,440
I believe this site, according to that Disneyland coffee table book,

1170
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:48,480
the site of Marine Land was once scouted by Walt for Disneyland.

1171
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:55,040
This was one of the prime open areas where you could fit a big crazy theme park development.

1172
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,320
But they grabbed it, and they were decently competitive, I'd say, with Disneyland for a

1173
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:00,800
little while.

1174
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,920
This special shows you a little bit of why.

1175
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,920
You get to see what they had to offer that isn't just Munsters related.

1176
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,400
Because, by the way, a lot of it is the Munsters drive around.

1177
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,440
They talk about how they're going to try to find electric eels for Eddie.

1178
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,840
And then you just kind of get to watch Eddie watch a bunch of shows.

1179
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,440
There's so much watching Eddie watching shows in this.

1180
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,240
Yeah, yeah.

1181
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,480
Well, they cut to him once every 15 minutes.

1182
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,280
And that is meant to sell that you are becoming Eddie.

1183
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,480
You are Eddie's POV.

1184
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,880
Like, OK, first, imagine there's a wolf man boy.

1185
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,200
My god, what a terrifying, though.

1186
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,680
Imagine the capers he would get into.

1187
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,440
Well, yes, for example, sometimes he sits politely with his regular friend and watches

1188
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,800
dolphins swim around.

1189
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,600
Yes, he also doesn't seem that excited.

1190
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,480
Most of the shots.

1191
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,160
Yeah, he kind of just has a blank expression on his face.

1192
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,880
He's tired.

1193
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,640
He's like, why I don't get the summer off?

1194
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,440
I just filmed 36 episodes in a row.

1195
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,800
There's no laws yet.

1196
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,920
Preventing illegal.

1197
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,280
Well, all of it.

1198
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,000
The orcas aren't going to be allowed to be here.

1199
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,520
And I'm not going to be allowed to be here for 20 hours a day.

1200
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,480
The legislation is on the president's desk currently.

1201
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,360
This is going to be illegal soon.

1202
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,520
Yeah, something that luckily Trump is going to turn it.

1203
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,240
That's one of his.

1204
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,440
That's in the first 100 days.

1205
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,760
He's going to get kids back to work without breaks for school and sleep.

1206
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,360
Anti-Jackie Coogan laws.

1207
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,160
Repeal the Jackie Coogan laws.

1208
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,640
Creepy Coogan, we say.

1209
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,480
Children need to work harder.

1210
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,160
He's depriving children of that.

1211
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,280
Children want to be working in the mines and they want to be working in this.

1212
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,120
Sometimes both at once.

1213
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,400
We send them and they pick out some coal and they come out

1214
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,160
and they do some mines for Disney Channel.

1215
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,480
Manny on Modern Family would have been on more episodes when he was little.

1216
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,440
We love Manny.

1217
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,400
We would have had him more on those early seasons when he was so tiny and adorable.

1218
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,360
We won't happen again.

1219
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,400
When I was on set of Little Rascals, I said,

1220
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,160
you're doing it all wrong.

1221
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,640
You could be getting so many more hours out of bug hall.

1222
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,080
Bug hall.

1223
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,120
You're missing precious alfalfa.

1224
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,560
You could be swallowing more bubbles.

1225
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,280
This movie could be two and a half hours.

1226
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,680
But they wouldn't let me direct.

1227
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,960
I tried to take it over.

1228
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,720
They said, do your lines, sir.

1229
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,320
I'm trying to find this vintage.

1230
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
You can buy vintage beetle wigs.

1231
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,040
I found when I was looking for merchandise.

1232
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,920
What does that mean?

1233
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,120
Not as opposed to?

1234
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,760
I don't know.

1235
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,800
Authentic is authentic.

1236
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,480
I guess it was actually a licensed product.

1237
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,760
Oh, you're talking.

1238
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,400
So in the like, in the actual phenomena,

1239
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,240
which I can only assume there was no mechanism yet to get them any money.

1240
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,080
No, there was no way to do that.

1241
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:52,960
For this.

1242
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:59,040
So whatever bizarre like Texas oil man who despised the Beatles,

1243
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,160
who like prayed for them to fall down dead.

1244
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,720
But he was willing to make a buck with their name.

1245
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,600
This looks like what Jimmy Angel's hair looks like.

1246
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,920
He bought one of those wigs and just kept it up.

1247
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,200
Kept mothballs out of it.

1248
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,720
Kept it from being devoured by silverfish for 60 years.

1249
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,560
I was heading somewhere with this.

1250
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,680
Oh, the kind of thing.

1251
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,560
Now, here's OK.

1252
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,840
As we said, this is not done with the film quality

1253
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,960
that we expect of the Monsters television show.

1254
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,240
It's kind of in this weird.

1255
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,960
It's, you know, if you've ever seen the Disneyland opening special,

1256
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,520
which we talked about a long time ago, it's kind of the like.

1257
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,560
It's not done live, but it's done with kind of like

1258
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,400
as good as cameras could shoot outdoors at that time.

1259
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,560
So things like get all bright and flare and it'll look like somebody

1260
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,160
like jumps five feet in one single frame.

1261
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,960
Like odd little bugs happen all the time.

1262
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,760
And I say all this because this is a special that is largely padded by

1263
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,160
let's just watch the shows that happen, you know, let's watch seals do tricks

1264
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,320
and let's watch dolphins swim around at marine land.

1265
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:13,200
But just the quality of camera, the water is just too bright.

1266
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,400
The water is just getting hit by the sun far too much.

1267
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,920
And you just all you just can't see and it's and it's we aren't.

1268
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,440
We haven't figured out like, you know, Super Bowl angles yet.

1269
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,440
Like the cameras are further back than the spectators.

1270
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,560
So you're watching like a thousand yard away

1271
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,680
footage of two shimmery of SEAL shows.

1272
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,480
You can't make this is not very interesting to watch.

1273
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,280
I'm going to be honest.

1274
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,840
Imagine it's on an old TV.

1275
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,240
We're watching it on like amazing technology.

1276
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,520
Anyone's ever seen Munster's.

1277
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,000
Right.

1278
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,320
No way you saw the seals on your old ass black and white TV 60 years ago.

1279
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:54,560
Yeah.

1280
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:55,680
So, yeah.

1281
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,960
No, that I looked at.

1282
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,440
I hit a couple zoom forwards on those seal parts.

1283
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,160
Yeah, I did.

1284
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,640
Yeah.

1285
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:00,800
Yeah.

1286
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,640
I said, let's get a little more grandpa.

1287
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,120
I did.

1288
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,240
I did technically make it all the way through as opposed to the last Munster's thing.

1289
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:06,880
All right.

1290
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,120
Yeah.

1291
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:07,360
Yeah.

1292
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,560
For you, the movie.

1293
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,040
Yeah.

1294
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,600
Yeah.

1295
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,680
I heard there were parts I thought about fully.

1296
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,360
I kind of undersold it in the club through you that we just put out the

1297
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,680
when the medley of songs about bananas.

1298
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,480
I really was almost like, is this Munster's two for me?

1299
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,720
Do I have to stop watching this special?

1300
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,560
I am being driven insane.

1301
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,160
I think like, yes, we have no bananas.

1302
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:28,560
Horrible.

1303
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,200
Then it becomes that banana fana fofana.

1304
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:31,520
Yeah.

1305
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,360
This is this is too much friend Anna Carmen Miranda comes out.

1306
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,480
Jason is like Jason's writing down his notes.

1307
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,280
Delightful.

1308
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,080
Stupendous.

1309
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,720
The name game.

1310
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,760
That's what you're missing on his Apple music.

1311
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,080
Yeah.

1312
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,040
It's just he just listened to name games for lots of.

1313
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,240
Jane, Jane, Boba.

1314
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,360
Just put in anyone he likes.

1315
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,480
Chapel, Chapel, Boba Apple.

1316
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,000
This is we're going to be missing.

1317
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,840
We're going to be doing Jason fan fiction.

1318
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,440
And I think a lot of the time, it's understandable.

1319
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,760
Let me let's talk though about something that.

1320
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:12,960
All right.

1321
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,840
I'll speak for myself of a lot of things in this.

1322
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,800
I thought that the weaving together of animal stuff,

1323
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,360
monster stuff was sometimes done not so gracefully.

1324
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,280
And I think they found themselves searching for.

1325
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,480
OK, whatever entity forced the monsters to be here,

1326
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,960
maybe they could never really figure out the why

1327
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,800
and how are the monsters compellingly combined with what we have in Marine land.

1328
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:42,960
Then it all changes because grandpa has to go fly to rescue something.

1329
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,920
I don't remember what.

1330
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,880
Yeah, he's got like the flag.

1331
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,760
He's getting the flag.

1332
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,400
He's just going to help with a flag problem.

1333
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,000
Yeah, there's a flag problem.

1334
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,280
So all right.

1335
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,800
So grandpa flies.

1336
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,120
All right.

1337
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,880
Well, is this some kind of like George Reeves Superman sort of like,

1338
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,160
do we cut to him in front of the footage of sky?

1339
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,800
No, no, no.

1340
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,040
Well, he just leaves or he just leaves frame.

1341
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,520
I don't think he even jumps and he just walks away.

1342
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,240
He walks away.

1343
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,960
They're not going to make Al Lewis like jump two centimeters.

1344
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,480
No, kill him.

1345
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:12,980
My God.

1346
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,840
He's barely, barely hanging together.

1347
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,440
Uh, but, but so he just kind of disappears off camera and then it cuts to,

1348
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,560
he is up at the top of what seems to be like 150 foot pole.

1349
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,920
It's so big.

1350
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,560
It's Paul.

1351
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,600
Crazy eye.

1352
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,280
And when it first cuts to it, you're like, okay, this is some weird illusion.

1353
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,560
I'm looking at a Batman thing, the way they would crawl up the side of a building.

1354
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,720
They just like painted a line and then had a guy just kind of like crawl,

1355
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,040
but he's just crawling on his hands and knees.

1356
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,720
But then it cuts wider and the pole is so high.

1357
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:52,080
And then the pole starts wobbling back and forth wildly, wildly.

1358
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,440
This was crazy.

1359
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,880
And I'm getting my head around like, okay, this must just be like something they had.

1360
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,760
This must've been part of their show is that they would send divers up or stunt people up

1361
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,360
to go wobble around in this pole.

1362
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,000
And in this case, they put somebody in grandpa Munster makeup and did it

1363
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
because like, Jesus Christ, this was, I loved this.

1364
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,200
Yeah, this is the best part.

1365
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:13,760
Yeah.

1366
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,240
Yeah.

1367
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,520
Grandpa wobble on a pole.

1368
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,560
It's not, yes, it's not Al Lewis.

1369
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,560
You can tell it's not Al Lewis.

1370
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,680
No, certainly not.

1371
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:26,000
And it's, it looks, you know, sometimes you see something that's very dangerous

1372
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,760
and people make it look effortless and it's still impressive and still cool to watch.

1373
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,520
This does not look effortless.

1374
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,640
This looks effortful.

1375
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:40,720
There are such like long unbroken takes of just this performer trying to like,

1376
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,680
like keep their body up.

1377
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,880
I'm trying to describe it where they hold the pole with their two hands

1378
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,800
and then stick their legs out in the air.

1379
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,160
And it looks so difficult.

1380
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,200
And there's points where like, it seems like maybe they got caught.

1381
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,160
They get like kind of stuck with their legs moving around and like, you're like, oh God,

1382
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,280
oh, I guess, okay, they're all right.

1383
00:58:59,280 --> 00:58:59,760
All right.

1384
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,160
Like there's a little court, I think, tying the Al Lewis impersonator to the pole.

1385
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,920
Should be a hell of a racket to get into these days.

1386
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,360
It is, yes, it is crazy to watch this.

1387
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,880
And then they have to be dressed as grandpa monster in addition to this.

1388
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,000
They got a cape to deal with.

1389
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,800
They got to figure out where that cape is going.

1390
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,960
Yes, and the cape keeps getting in the way.

1391
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,840
Yeah, you do sense the cape is actually a problem.

1392
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,880
The person's annoyed with the cape because it's getting in the way

1393
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,200
as they try to like turn over on a pole.

1394
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,160
There are some on-frame like, yes, like exasperated movements.

1395
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,240
You can watch the guy mouth like, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1396
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,760
Yeah, because I could die.

1397
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,800
If this cape fucks with, I'm going to die.

1398
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,320
I'm going to fall and kill myself.

1399
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,640
His leg is just in some kind of like little invisible loop or something.

1400
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,120
Something, yeah.

1401
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,040
He's barely got anything going on there.

1402
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,840
Yes, this is the best part of it for sure.

1403
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,920
Yeah, and it lasts a long time.

1404
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,240
Yeah, it goes and goes, but I was not complaining.

1405
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:56,960
Not in a bad way.

1406
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,720
I'm just saying it's like a long stunt.

1407
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,680
This to me is the forefather of all of the TGAF shows going to Disney World and saying,

1408
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,600
we're just going to do the full Indiana Jones.

1409
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,400
Oh, you're right, right, right.

1410
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,680
Stunt sequence of the boulder.

1411
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,000
Like, let's just, let's give ourselves a break here.

1412
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,880
We have built-in production value with the theme park we went to.

1413
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,320
Let's just let this, let's all, let's take a writing breather.

1414
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,200
Let's have a couple extra sandwiches today and take a long nap.

1415
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,760
Is it too late to get this stunt into Mission Impossible 8 coming out this summer?

1416
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,400
Tom can go on the top of a pole dressed as a vampire

1417
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,800
and do all these tricks as the pole wobbles back and forth.

1418
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,840
I think this would have certainly happened in Dark Universe.

1419
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,120
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1420
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,680
Yeah.

1421
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,560
That would have been good.

1422
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,440
Yeah, what are we going to do?

1423
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,000
Like the, like there's a, there's a cursed amulet up at the top of that pole.

1424
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,560
Yeah.

1425
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,720
Hey, let's get the mummy to fly up there.

1426
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,040
Yeah, mummy goes up the pole.

1427
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,400
And then he's got built-in, he's got the bandages so he can, he can like,

1428
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,920
rappel down at the very least, slide down with the bandages.

1429
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,720
Yeah, yeah.

1430
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,160
But if not, did he become a mummy?

1431
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,520
I haven't seen the Tom Cruise mummy.

1432
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,320
No, I mean neither.

1433
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,280
I don't think he becomes a mummy at the end, which is what you would want.

1434
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,240
He's not the mummy.

1435
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,840
Or was he going to be the mummy?

1436
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,360
Or is it just about the mummy?

1437
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,000
I don't know.

1438
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,200
Is he hurting the mummy?

1439
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,080
This is something Jason would talk authoritatively about,

1440
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,160
but then it revealed he doesn't even know it either.

1441
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,360
He's a Brendan Fraser mummy guy.

1442
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,560
What are you saying about Barbara Stanwyck?

1443
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,880
He's exploring the works of Barbara Stanwyck.

1444
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,040
I'm exploring the works of the Dark Universe.

1445
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,960
You mean you looked at the mummy Wikipedia?

1446
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,160
Yeah, yes.

1447
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,480
So I would hope Tom Cruise would become the mummy, but I don't know.

1448
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,440
I don't remember.

1449
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:33,940
Yeah.

1450
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,400
Also like did he not want to be covered, his face covered because like an actor thing.

1451
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,280
Is there any possibility that the success of Epic Universe

1452
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:49,280
propels the Dark Universe back into and that a Tom Cruise navigating a confused franchise

1453
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,640
that had to decide that the next movie isn't a part two,

1454
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,680
that he goes back to whatever the mummy plan was going to be?

1455
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,080
I think that would be funny.

1456
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,440
They're like Johnny Depp back.

1457
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,360
Tom Cruise back because of the success of this theme park, but I don't think so.

1458
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:06,880
I would hope so.

1459
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:13,200
I didn't realize the two of these lands are Johnny Depp oriented.

1460
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:13,840
Yeah, that's correct.

1461
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,960
The picture in Fantastic Beasts.

1462
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,920
Grindelwald and...

1463
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,920
And I mean, I guess, you know, Dark Universe, not specifically, but it could be.

1464
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,600
Yeah, well, it's vaguely associated because of the photo.

1465
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,560
Because of a picture.

1466
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,720
Because of a picture that they took to promote.

1467
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,400
I guess it's a stretch, but yeah.

1468
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:29,920
But it's not.

1469
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,840
Well, he's got a lot of theme park.

1470
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,000
I mean, pirates.

1471
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,040
Is there another one?

1472
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,560
Isn't there something else I'm missing?

1473
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,040
Maybe not.

1474
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,480
There's no Edward Scissorhands land, I guess.

1475
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,520
I don't believe so.

1476
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,600
No, they never built a ride that's like the Chocolate River from the...

1477
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,640
You don't get to meet his.

1478
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,920
Hi, I'm Willy Wonka.

1479
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,960
Hey, Lello.

1480
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,120
I'm Willy Wonka, the chocolate guy.

1481
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,280
So much better.

1482
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,360
Oh, see, yeah, that Gene Wilder.

1483
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,400
What a piece of shit.

1484
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,380
What a...

1485
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,520
We got to do this thing right.

1486
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,440
We got to do it the way Roald Dahl wanted.

1487
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,240
All right, here it is.

1488
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,520
I'm Willy Wonka.

1489
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,400
I got a bob haircut, I'm Willy Wonka.

1490
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,320
Can I bring up an actor that's in this?

1491
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:08,960
Yeah, yeah.

1492
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,240
Named Sid Gould.

1493
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,080
Do you know who I'm talking about?

1494
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:12,560
I don't.

1495
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,840
And who was Sid Gould in this?

1496
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,840
He's like a guard and it's just the same gag.

1497
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,200
Every Monsters is basically the same gag where a human looks at the Monsters and goes,

1498
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,200
what are you, excuse me, I'm scared.

1499
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,040
And then they pass out because they're so scary.

1500
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,480
They must have been afraid of something else because they don't think of themselves as scary.

1501
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,120
Yes, and a big thing with Monsters is they're situationally stupid about a lot.

1502
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,400
They never seem to learn that, oh yeah, our appearance is a little different than everyone

1503
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,040
else's. They never learn that.

1504
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,480
And then they're all idiots in this.

1505
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,600
Would you want them to?

1506
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,080
No, I don't want it.

1507
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,280
Because then the show's over.

1508
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,840
I would say that all the Monsters are stupid and think it's a fish store.

1509
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,680
Not a single one is really like, this is kind of an amusement park.

1510
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,760
I know you're Monsters, but you've been in a store before.

1511
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:04,800
You know that there's a place where there's a cashier with a cash register.

1512
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,320
And then they go, why would a bunch of people be in an audience at a fish store?

1513
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,360
Right, and they think, and then there's a part where I forget if it's Herman or somebody,

1514
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,640
they go like, look at all the fish in their stores.

1515
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,680
I mean, it's the ocean.

1516
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,920
And then Lily goes, oh yeah, look at all the people.

1517
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,120
And she points to the people in the stands.

1518
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,360
She goes, there must be a sale.

1519
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,080
You're like, are the Monsters this stupid?

1520
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,040
This is insane.

1521
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,160
This is insane.

1522
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,440
They're not, okay, I know that they are Monsters, but they aren't,

1523
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:36,080
the backstory, as far as I know, is not that they landed from space.

1524
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,720
They aren't Monsters also from Mars.

1525
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,880
You know what the ocean is, right?

1526
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,280
They had the ocean in, are the Monsters old?

1527
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,240
They talk about this in the special.

1528
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:50,640
They do.

1529
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,040
They say, how old is your grandpa?

1530
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,800
And then she says, he's like 62, give or take a thousand years.

1531
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,760
And that's the joke.

1532
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,760
Well, even that, they had the ocean a thousand years ago.

1533
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,320
Yeah.

1534
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,320
I mean, maybe there's some Bible timeline.

1535
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,960
Maybe they're also fundamentalist Christians.

1536
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,000
They'd make a joke about Jonah and the whale in this as well.

1537
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,960
So they are.

1538
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,440
All right.

1539
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,160
So we learn.

1540
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,280
But it's a joke.

1541
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,800
This is another problem I have with it.

1542
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,920
Sometimes with the writing of the Monsters is that grandpa goes,

1543
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,560
I knew a guy who lives inside a whale and his name was Jonah.

1544
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,880
And then Lily's like, oh, grandpa, you're joking.

1545
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,520
And you're like, but sometimes he's not joking about knowing

1546
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,840
like an old, some old thing, historical figure or whatever.

1547
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,600
Like, so it's inconsistent.

1548
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,320
Sometimes are they saying that the, that there were,

1549
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,720
did they go back to the Bible times?

1550
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,840
Well, grandpa might have the crucifixion of Christ.

1551
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,160
Yes.

1552
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,080
Grandpa Munster was at the crucifixion of Christ.

1553
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:44,640
The rabbit.

1554
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,920
That looks like it hurts.

1555
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,960
Glad it's not me.

1556
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,960
They've been for the grace of you know who.

1557
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:57,840
Check, please.

1558
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,360
They've been for the grace of his dad.

1559
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,560
This is more Woody Allen.

1560
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,560
Yeah, we're a lot more, I'm a lot more.

1561
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:02,960
Yeah.

1562
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,240
You're rearing me into Woody too.

1563
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,080
I feel like, yeah, yeah, I don't know.

1564
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,520
Maybe that's a Mel Gibson's passion of Christ too.

1565
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,720
I guess they show the crucifixion of the first one.

1566
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,520
Maybe there'll be a flashback.

1567
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,120
Yeah, they blew all the good material.

1568
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:15,680
Yeah.

1569
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,920
Unless you do it as a sequel where it happens again.

1570
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:19,520
Maybe, or you get flashbacks.

1571
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,560
They're back for more.

1572
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,080
This time it's personal.

1573
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,840
You can do some good retcons when you flash back to the first movie

1574
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,920
and then you show like in the crowd there was like,

1575
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,400
grandpa Munster was there and you didn't show him in the first movie.

1576
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,400
So you can kind of add things that way.

1577
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,600
When he thought he saw the devil in the form of that creepy baby,

1578
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,160
he was actually looking at grandpa Munster.

1579
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:38,660
Yeah.

1580
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,360
What are we here for, gladiator fights?

1581
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,160
This guy's going to betray you, Jesus.

1582
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,320
I'm telling you, three wooden tees.

1583
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,240
He's up to no good.

1584
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,280
Sid Gould.

1585
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,080
Oh yeah.

1586
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,440
He's the guard.

1587
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,040
He's afraid of the Munsters.

1588
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,680
So I'm looking, he's, you know, he's in stuff.

1589
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,360
He's in love boat.

1590
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,120
He's in all these different old things.

1591
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:13,120
He was on police academy four was the last thing he had as a credit.

1592
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,600
And then I scroll down and I see 44 episodes of here's Lucy.

1593
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,320
And then I scroll down 49 episodes of the Lucy show.

1594
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,120
Who is Sid Gould?

1595
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,480
Man, I made it out of,

1596
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:32,080
I didn't tell you that there's an episode of the Lucy show called Lucy at Marine land.

1597
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,480
I was like, let me try to skate by this one.

1598
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,920
No, no, here we are.

1599
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,040
He is cousin by marriage to Lucille Ball.

1600
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,640
His cousin, Gary Morton was Lucy's husband.

1601
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,400
And so he was on all these little bit parts in the family.

1602
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,280
He's in the family.

1603
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,320
So he got all these little bit parts on all these different Lucy shows.

1604
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:50,960
Wow.

1605
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:51,460
Yes.

1606
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:56,240
And if you want to drag the episode length out even more,

1607
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,480
and I won't even get into more.

1608
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,080
Hold on.

1609
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,360
Now I got to find the exact year because I want to be.

1610
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:08,880
I got to say, I'm really, I'm really happy that one thing in Jason's absence is that the

1611
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:15,600
percentage of hosts uninterested in talking about Lucy all the goddamn time goes up to 50%.

1612
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,720
As opposed to a mere 33.

1613
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,400
It just really helps my numbers.

1614
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,520
There's more pressure, right?

1615
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,360
We're kind of at logger, it's kind of like, like we're at a perfect tie,

1616
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,040
which presents its own conflict.

1617
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,360
Well, wait till you hear this credit.

1618
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:33,760
He played Zumba on the Paul Winchell show in 1953.

1619
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:34,720
Zumba.

1620
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,760
Zumba must have run into Jerry Mahoney.

1621
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,120
And Knucklehead Smith.

1622
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,760
Now what I realized by watching an episode,

1623
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,120
scrolling through an episode of Paul Winchell show for the first time is that

1624
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,560
Knucklehead Smith's voice very similar to Tigger.

1625
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,800
It's almost the same thing.

1626
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,240
It's basically the same thing.

1627
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:55,440
So Tigger and Knucklehead Smith have the same voice.

1628
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,520
That's a sort of interesting fact.

1629
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,600
That's sort of an interesting thing.

1630
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,280
If you know Tigger in the old days.

1631
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:05,120
It's interesting assuming that you think anything about Knucklehead Smith is interesting.

1632
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,040
Well, I think the audience thinks Knucklehead Smith is interesting.

1633
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,440
I bet they like Knucklehead Smith a lot more than Madam.

1634
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,640
I bet there's a lot more Knucklehead Smith fans out there.

1635
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,920
I just don't know if Knucklehead Smith has been around and discussed enough.

1636
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,360
I think people are less fine.

1637
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,120
I think they like him initially more than Madam.

1638
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,320
I do think there's a lot of hate for Madam.

1639
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,280
We're still in only the third episode where Knucklehead Smith has come up.

1640
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,640
One of them is Club 3.

1641
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,920
People haven't heard that.

1642
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,420
Yeah.

1643
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,200
I don't like what's happening here.

1644
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,200
I don't like that Knucklehead Smith is becoming a recurring presence on the show.

1645
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,000
I'd like to try to turn this ship around if I could.

1646
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,040
There's a section of the Paul Winchell show where Knucklehead Smith and Jerry Mahoney are

1647
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,840
sitting at a talk show, like a late night talk show desk.

1648
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,200
And it says Tootsie Roll on the front because I assume they were sponsoring them.

1649
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,040
And then they interview people together.

1650
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,240
Which I use pretty good.

1651
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,920
I was enjoying watching this.

1652
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,080
Now, you told me that, and then I thought there was more story to go.

1653
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,200
So I just said, okay.

1654
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,200
It's a ventriloquist talk show.

1655
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,040
It's a kid's show.

1656
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,800
It looks like the Bozo show with a big kid audience, but then they do little skits.

1657
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,880
And they have human performers.

1658
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,760
But then there's a part where the dummies interview people.

1659
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,600
And again, I didn't present this as a big story.

1660
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,400
I'm just explaining to you what the Paul Winchell show was like

1661
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,440
because you'll need to know when we do future Paul Winchell show content.

1662
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,440
This is we can't.

1663
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,080
We're already we're already covered.

1664
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,760
We already do too much of the of like famous old shows.

1665
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,000
Now we're starting to delve into.

1666
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,720
Look, I guess.

1667
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,280
Okay.

1668
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:43,920
Well, see, I know I brought up Sea Hunt, but I'm not saying that cleared out Sea Hunt for me.

1669
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,880
I'm not saying we know we haven't investigated Sea Hunt.

1670
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,360
That's true.

1671
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,000
You think there's a Sea Hunt episode where there's a ventriloquist dummy?

1672
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,920
I hope there's a haunted fish, like the ventriloquist dummy or like a merman.

1673
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,560
If there was an episode where he like where Mike Nelson

1674
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:05,520
shatters a ventriloquist dummy against a cave wall, then now I'm interested.

1675
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,440
A ventriloquist dummy was used in the 1959 Sea Hunt episode

1676
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,720
Monte Cristo to portray Mike Nelson when he was thrown into the sea.

1677
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,440
Okay, we know that actors can't just be thrown into the sea.

1678
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,600
So maybe you use a dummy, right?

1679
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,720
But a dummy equals a six foot dummy.

1680
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,520
Maybe not a little ventriloquist dummy.

1681
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,560
That must be wrong.

1682
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,320
They just tossed a little dummy.

1683
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,200
That must be wrong.

1684
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,720
That must just be a regular dummy.

1685
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,400
Maybe it was a wide enough shot that they figured as long as something's going,

1686
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,520
as long as you see limbs in a head, you're good to go.

1687
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,240
That's so funny.

1688
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,840
Before the development of stunt doubles that are the size of the actor.

1689
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,040
This is cut to a dummy.

1690
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:57,120
And this is the people, the thing one, viewers are idiots.

1691
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:02,320
Thing two, no one will ever watch this again, do whatever the fuck gets it done.

1692
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,760
This in the IMDb, it says it just refers to it as a dummy.

1693
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,880
So when two crew members are throwing Mr. Nelson into the sea,

1694
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,440
a dummy is obviously being used because Mr. Nelson hits some shallows before diving

1695
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,040
and hitting an immovable object from a significant height,

1696
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,120
which would otherwise result in injury or death.

1697
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,000
And they just left it in a dummy hitting the rocks.

1698
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:26,960
So this isn't, they are not trying to pass off a small ventriloquist,

1699
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:32,480
they aren't trying to pass off a knucklehead Smith size dummy as hulking tan Lloyd Bridges.

1700
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:39,360
If they really sculpted a ventriloquist dummy that was like jacked, like a shirtless dummy,

1701
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,440
what if Jerry Mahoney was jacked?

1702
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:48,560
Yeah, I don't know how many more just standard dummies I can look at and pretend to care,

1703
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,280
but I would like a really ripped.

1704
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,440
Who is the hunkiest dummy of all time?

1705
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,560
That's a good question.

1706
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,640
Is it probably a newer dummy, I'm guessing?

1707
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,080
Because I don't think of any dummies as being big hunks.

1708
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,680
Attractive ventriloquist dummy.

1709
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,280
It's also, it's just filling in attractive ventriloquist,

1710
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,600
which I believe there may be no results for as well.

1711
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:18,160
Well, that's why they need to distract you whenever you look at something else.

1712
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,600
Maybe a young Terry Fader.

1713
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,800
What Terry Fader looked like when he was young.

1714
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,840
Okay, so I Googled attractive ventriloquist dummy,

1715
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,520
and now I'll turn around my laptop and show you Google results that are 30

1716
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,960
of the most horrifying images I've ever seen.

1717
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,160
And they aren't, none of them are what we're looking for, like cut.

1718
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,920
It's all just a bunch of different types of scary fucking dummies.

1719
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,720
Why? These results make no sense.

1720
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,960
If we had a dummy final four in April.

1721
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:53,440
No, no, some of this show has to be about theme parks, for God's sake.

1722
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:57,440
April? April's a far, you're barely even, it's a timeline.

1723
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,080
Is it the issue that that's not the issue?

1724
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,560
I know you think it's too much dummy content, but I'm just saying like,

1725
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,480
if we really, what if we determine the hunkiest dummies of all time?

1726
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,280
Start with a field of 64.

1727
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,880
When's Jason going to be back?

1728
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,360
When can I get a movie going again?

1729
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,840
By the way, I just clicked one of the results of this,

1730
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,520
of attractive ventriloquist dummy.

1731
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,720
Look at this eBay result.

1732
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,360
Antique, 1938, Frank Marshall pro ventriloquist figured.

1733
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,080
What do you mean?

1734
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,480
Oh, Frank Marshall is a different, we looked, oh, I said this on the,

1735
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,640
I said this one on your episodes, we went there.

1736
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,240
Frank Marshall is a dummy maker, but not that Frank Marshall.

1737
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,200
Oh, it's a brand.

1738
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,800
It's a different Frank Marshall.

1739
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,280
Okay.

1740
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,120
Cause I was, I almost fell out of my chair too.

1741
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,880
Cause I was like, oh my God, Frank Marshall from the age of five was making dummies or

1742
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,560
something, but that is not the case.

1743
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,000
The different Frank Marshall, who was a dummy maker.

1744
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,800
If we have a new.

1745
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,520
It's a new sounding Marshall.

1746
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,000
Yeah, I think I might've listened to this and did one of my classic auto erase.

1747
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,320
It was being erased as it was occurring.

1748
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:00,960
Dummy.

1749
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,640
Hoping that it would never come up again.

1750
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,880
And here I walked right into it again.

1751
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,520
Yeah, I know there's been, you know what?

1752
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,320
There's been a lot of talk of making us as action figures on this show, which I

1753
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,680
still would love to do one day.

1754
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,800
But what if somebody were to make us as ventriloquist dummies?

1755
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,360
What if somebody were to make you and Jason as ventriloquist dummies?

1756
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,800
Do not, I don't care who you are.

1757
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,480
I don't care if you're Frank Marshall.

1758
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,000
I do not want to see myself.

1759
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,120
If you're Frank Marshall himself, other one.

1760
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,840
I don't want to see myself as a ventriloquist dummy.

1761
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,160
Okay.

1762
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,840
I guess not now, not in April.

1763
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,200
What if you're Jack though?

1764
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:34,240
All right.

1765
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,960
Sharon, you sold me in one note.

1766
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,160
You got me back on board.

1767
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,520
What have we missed about this thing?

1768
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,640
So we got to the poll.

1769
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,600
I wrote down the phrase, maybe we can get a markdown whale.

1770
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,320
The special is sponsored by Minute Maid and Hi-C.

1771
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,200
I like at the beginning, we love our variety show intros.

1772
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,640
Here's everybody who's going to be on the show.

1773
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,480
The Monsters, the new Christy Minstrels.

1774
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,560
But I like that there's nobody else.

1775
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,960
So they just have to credit the animals.

1776
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,440
Yes.

1777
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,040
So then you just get big titles coming at you and it says,

1778
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:09,840
Walruses.

1779
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,480
Right.

1780
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,200
Saw a fish.

1781
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,400
And then one of them, it just says Monsters.

1782
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,120
Yeah.

1783
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:15,520
Huh?

1784
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,880
That's a real insult to the kind of fish that it is.

1785
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,040
I don't think it was just a monster.

1786
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:21,440
No.

1787
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,120
That's really insulting.

1788
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:28,000
Yeah, somebody classified them as sea life if they're in marine land.

1789
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,640
I get it, maybe if they were in the sea and they saw something

1790
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,640
they never saw before, was never discovered.

1791
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,000
I think whoever had to make that credit sequence just looked at it like,

1792
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,360
just put Monsters.

1793
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,440
Let's get this done, put Monsters.

1794
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:48,720
We didn't talk about, they did the mermaids like Disneyland to some degree.

1795
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,600
Oh, okay.

1796
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,200
There's mermaids in there, but the mermaids were swimming under the water

1797
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,080
because there's a part where they go and look at the sea life under,

1798
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,160
like it's the living seas or something, or I don't know, an aquarium.

1799
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,520
Doesn't have to be Disney.

1800
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,800
And then there's mermaids where they have like a big air tank on the back

1801
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,160
and they're swimming or whatever.

1802
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,120
And then there's some joke, it's Marilyn and Eddie are watching them.

1803
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,560
And then he said something about like, you wouldn't want these as a pet.

1804
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,520
And Eddie's like, grandpa would like one of these as a pet or something.

1805
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:20,720
Like, okay.

1806
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,220
You.

1807
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,340
Yeah.

1808
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,480
And then grandpa would like to kidnap a mermaid.

1809
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:33,200
Uh, and then, so I guess, yeah, I guess they had some like fantastical stuff

1810
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,120
because he was just thinking of a Marine land.

1811
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,040
It's very straight ad.

1812
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,120
There's big fish tank seals.

1813
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,720
There's fun, the shows, but there is not like an imaginative quality,

1814
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,520
but like, this is like, at least there were mermaids here.

1815
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,680
Yeah, that's pretty, that's pretty theme parky.

1816
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:48,160
Yeah.

1817
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:48,400
Right.

1818
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,800
This is more theme parky than everything else.

1819
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,120
Well, they kept going in this direction too,

1820
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,200
because just a little other Marine land history,

1821
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,680
it passed through a lot of owners and among the owners,

1822
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,480
Hannah Barbera, it was Hannah Barbera's Marine land.

1823
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:00,800
Right.

1824
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,200
At one point.

1825
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,840
So you could meet who's the shark, Jabberjaw.

1826
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,320
Yeah.

1827
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:04,480
Yeah.

1828
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,720
I think there's a photo of some kid getting their face bitten off by Jabberjaw.

1829
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,720
Yeah, that's really good.

1830
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,840
You know, that's a big shark.

1831
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,120
I don't want my head in its mouth.

1832
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:21,200
So, you know, so yeah, it was not just like a clinical aquarium facility.

1833
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,400
They had their fun.

1834
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:22,900
Sure.

1835
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,640
Especially that pole show.

1836
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,440
My God.

1837
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,960
Yeah, that pole show is interesting.

1838
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,560
I wonder, I wonder if, I wonder what that is even called.

1839
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,120
I wonder like, was it like one guy like that guy

1840
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,520
who would get shot out of the rocket at Disneyland?

1841
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,160
Oh, that's right.

1842
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,400
I wonder if it was like a one person specialty.

1843
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:38,960
Yeah, maybe.

1844
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:43,440
Was doing pole shit, high up pole shit and then dressing up as a vampire.

1845
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,080
Or it was a number of underpaid 19 year olds.

1846
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:46,480
Could be.

1847
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,200
Yes, they could send somebody up there one day.

1848
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,080
Here's what you got to do.

1849
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,600
We built that pole to pay for the pole costs.

1850
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,000
Yeah.

1851
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,920
We need constant 19 year olds up there.

1852
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,040
They should have made Al do it.

1853
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:00,960
He might have been able.

1854
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,360
Well, he seemed to.

1855
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,000
Well, as I said, he made it a long time.

1856
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:06,320
Yeah.

1857
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,040
He was 45.

1858
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,400
He was like 45 years old here.

1859
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,440
Oh, I'm fine.

1860
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:09,680
Yeah.

1861
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,640
You could climb up that pole.

1862
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,800
I could climb up the pole.

1863
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,960
I'm sure there was pole, like some sort of pole work in the vaudeville days.

1864
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:19,440
Yeah.

1865
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:19,840
Yeah.

1866
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:20,720
Certainly something.

1867
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,240
Probably.

1868
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:22,740
Right?

1869
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:25,060
That's why they built it into the special.

1870
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:25,220
Right.

1871
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:27,460
I heard that he had a vaudeville pole act.

1872
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,780
And so we better devote a lot of real estate to that.

1873
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:31,540
And then they got to the day and he chickened out.

1874
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:32,980
Yeah.

1875
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:35,620
Well, that's why his career never took off after.

1876
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:36,020
Yep.

1877
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:36,340
Yeah.

1878
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,460
He was not a team player.

1879
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:39,620
All downhill besides restaurant ownership.

1880
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,500
That's a high, high.

1881
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,460
What else?

1882
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,300
Seal show that's hard to watch.

1883
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:49,620
Yeah.

1884
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,780
I mean, they eventually, oh, there's like a surfing dog.

1885
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:54,580
Yeah, that's good.

1886
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:54,820
Yeah.

1887
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:58,020
Probably dog didn't like it, but yeah, that's fun to watch.

1888
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:01,940
I wrote down the phrase, idiots who dive badly.

1889
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,420
I'm sure.

1890
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:02,660
Yeah.

1891
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,980
There's like a little like goofy show they do.

1892
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:05,540
Yeah.

1893
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:08,100
Like a bunch of knuckleheads who bump into each other.

1894
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,580
Yes.

1895
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:09,140
Yeah.

1896
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:09,380
Yes.

1897
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,340
Which is fun.

1898
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:10,840
Fools.

1899
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:16,580
The new Christy Minstrel sing fake underwater in a fish tank.

1900
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:16,900
Right.

1901
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:17,860
Saturday night.

1902
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:19,700
Saturday night.

1903
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,260
We'll get together on a Saturday night.

1904
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:26,100
Again, things like this really make you understand why the Beatles were important.

1905
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:30,260
There was a way to be filled of exciting music.

1906
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:30,740
Yeah.

1907
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,300
Yeah.

1908
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:31,700
Yeah.

1909
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,940
People with even 2% sex appeal.

1910
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:35,380
That's true.

1911
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:39,700
It's the most neutered, sprayed down people.

1912
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:39,860
Yeah.

1913
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:44,500
I've said this before, but there's these YouTube clips of just every song that was number one on

1914
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,060
the charts, starting in whenever the charts.

1915
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:52,980
So you just go through the 40s and it's like every time the song would change, it changes.

1916
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:58,340
So you hear all the songs that were popular in America and man, is it dry up until the

1917
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:59,460
Beatles show up.

1918
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:03,300
Like once in a while you get a song and then obviously Elvis is there and then there's

1919
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:08,740
some stuff you know, but man, there's some like, you're like, this was some song about

1920
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:12,420
like a carnival we've never heard for 12 weeks on the charts.

1921
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:13,780
This is 1948.

1922
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:17,060
Now we're getting away with this because Jason would be livid.

1923
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,300
Carnival caper.

1924
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,180
Carnival caper.

1925
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:23,220
It's been a year on the top of the charts.

1926
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,660
By Slimmy Billy Morgan.

1927
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:26,900
Yeah.

1928
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:33,140
What was the number one song of 1946?

1929
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,940
I mean, there is holiday stuff.

1930
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:40,180
I don't want to know anymore about the song Dr. Lawyer Indian Chief.

1931
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:40,740
Oh yeah.

1932
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,300
And that happens a lot too where you go, I've never heard this song.

1933
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,180
It's problematic.

1934
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:46,420
I don't know why, but it is problematic.

1935
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:54,100
And yeah, then the Beatles show up and you go, oh man, like they really changed the deal.

1936
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,940
Obviously the people that influenced them really changed the deal, but they weren't

1937
01:21:57,940 --> 01:21:59,380
as popular sadly.

1938
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,420
I'm like your Chuck Berry.

1939
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:01,140
You know what I'm saying?

1940
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:05,460
These girls who look like walruses, they need to cut it out.

1941
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:06,980
I can't understand a word they're saying.

1942
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:11,940
Can't they play good old fashioned music like Old Buttermilk Sky by Kay Kaiser and

1943
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:12,660
his orchestra?

1944
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:13,380
Yes.

1945
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:13,940
What year?

1946
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,820
With Michael Douglas and the Campus Kids.

1947
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:22,980
That's the number one song in December 1946.

1948
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:23,460
Yeah.

1949
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:26,340
These are truly, that is a fun, like put it on.

1950
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:31,140
These are long videos on YouTube and you just go through all these songs you've never heard of.

1951
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:34,100
Old Buttermilk Sky was nominated for an Oscar too.

1952
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,220
This was cleaned up.

1953
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:36,500
Some of it's good.

1954
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,780
I'm not saying it's all bad.

1955
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:41,780
This was the, what's the Shallows of its day.

1956
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:42,280
Yeah, yeah.

1957
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,220
There's songs like, sometimes we'll come across things like this.

1958
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:52,820
And I, you know, I think Jason enjoys the kind of the identity of the liking the old

1959
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:53,700
timey stuff.

1960
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:57,860
But I think if you like, if we made him sit down and listen to all of the number one songs

1961
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:01,620
of 1946, I think by the time we made it to Old Buttermilk Sky, whatever that is, he'd

1962
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,460
be like, fine, I don't like this.

1963
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,060
You got me.

1964
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:05,620
To prove it.

1965
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:06,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1966
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:08,260
We'd break him down.

1967
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,540
Here's what it actually was.

1968
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,420
Or he comes out more.

1969
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:14,740
Yeah, it could be either or.

1970
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,020
It's a song that described my dreams.

1971
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:16,580
Right.

1972
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:20,420
Sometimes I hope I wake up and the whole sky's full of buttermilk.

1973
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:20,920
Yeah.

1974
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:23,140
It's probably that second one.

1975
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:23,780
Yeah, I'm mortal.

1976
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:24,280
All right.

1977
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:29,220
Let me, let's, let's veer to the exit here a little bit with this.

1978
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:34,100
So they, they end up, the monsters end up leaving because they, they don't want any

1979
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:40,660
more fresh air and they drive away and they drive away in an unsafe manner where it seems

1980
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,180
like Eddie's going to fall out of the car.

1981
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:42,820
Yes.

1982
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,340
There's a lot of unsafe driving.

1983
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,180
And they don't get a second take of that.

1984
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:46,420
Yeah.

1985
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:47,540
And that's that.

1986
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:53,300
But in case we never revisit Marine Land, do you know this, the end of the Marine Land

1987
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:53,620
story?

1988
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:54,180
I don't actually.

1989
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,540
Do you know why it's not there anymore?

1990
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:58,820
So they passed through a lot of different owners.

1991
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:03,620
It was jointly owned by Taft, which owned all those Kings Island parks,

1992
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:05,220
and that's why they had a rare thing.

1993
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:08,660
And Kroger's Markets, they were together owned it.

1994
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,020
20th Century Fox owned it at one point.

1995
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:13,060
The people who owned Hollywood Park Racetrack owned it.

1996
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:16,980
And you know, it like thrived decently in that time.

1997
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:22,180
I think it fell by the time Disney was getting real solid with pirates and Haunted Mansion

1998
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:27,060
and SeaWorld obviously really cut into its business whenever SeaWorld opened up.

1999
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,700
So like on the decline, but they still did amazing.

2000
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:33,300
They built this giant tower even higher than that pole.

2001
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:38,500
A 240 foot observation tower, which must have been, again, having been on that property,

2002
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,340
those views must have been unreal.

2003
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,100
This is like, this is paradise.

2004
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,940
This is so it's crazy.

2005
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:45,140
Get down.

2006
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:47,780
If you're ever wandering around, it's such a great place.

2007
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:53,140
But anyways, and then they installed this thing called the Baja Reef Exhibit where you

2008
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:57,300
could like snorkel and actually like go through, like they themed a little like rock environment.

2009
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,940
So they're adding stuff and then and it's all kind of on the backs of

2010
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:07,940
pre SeaWorld's two killer whales, Orky and Corky.

2011
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,980
They're the stars of the show.

2012
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:19,540
And eventually like laws are passed that you can't go capture any more of these whales.

2013
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:24,020
So to see any in captivity becomes like such a rare commodity.

2014
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:26,900
And the fact that they had them was such a big deal.

2015
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,060
Right.

2016
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:30,180
But then SeaWorld in like 87.

2017
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:31,700
Well, I don't know.

2018
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:31,860
Okay.

2019
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:37,460
At some point, SeaWorld is taken over by a hardcore publishing new owner and they are

2020
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:42,260
a lot more aggressive about the expansion of SeaWorld than whoever the previous owners were.

2021
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:48,180
And they know that SeaWorld and opening new SeaWorlds is dependent on having

2022
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:52,100
whales that you can call Shamu in any of their parks.

2023
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,020
And now there's these laws in place, right?

2024
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,500
They can't just go capture a new Shamu.

2025
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,460
So they're looking around.

2026
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:58,740
How are we going to get a Shamu?

2027
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,580
Well, I got Corky and Orky over there.

2028
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:01,380
Marineland.

2029
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:05,380
Maybe we can go, let's see what we can hook up with them.

2030
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:10,500
So they go to Marineland and they say, hey, we see you're struggling a little bit here.

2031
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,380
Times have been better.

2032
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,540
Would you be interested in maybe selling us Corky and Orky?

2033
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:18,740
And they say, no, no, they're the fabric of this place.

2034
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:21,700
That's why this place works and it's so important to us.

2035
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:25,780
And we would never sell you Corky and Orky.

2036
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:30,100
We would, however, sell you the entire park with Corky and Orky,

2037
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,220
with the provision that Corky and Orky would stay here

2038
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:35,860
because it's where they live and it's where they're comfortable.

2039
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:40,420
And so would you, SeaWorld, want to buy all of Marineland?

2040
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,260
And they said, sounds all right to us.

2041
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,380
Very good.

2042
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,020
And there was a little bit of concern about this plan

2043
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:52,260
because this is a big tourist boon for the Rancho Palos Verdes area.

2044
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:59,460
And it's a big centerpiece of why anybody would go there and spend money in that town.

2045
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:04,900
So SeaWorld, you do promise to keep the park open and in good condition, right?

2046
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:05,780
Yes, of course.

2047
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:10,980
We are no nefarious whale purchasers, you can trust us.

2048
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:15,620
We will keep it open and it'll be a vibrant part of the city forever.

2049
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,740
One month later, oh, sorry, looked into it, closing it.

2050
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,860
It's just going to be a lot of upkeep.

2051
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:20,500
We're not going to do it.

2052
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,340
We're closing up shop.

2053
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:26,260
People were very, very mad about this news.

2054
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,820
And then forgive me, I'm a little bit confused about the timeline here

2055
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,860
because I know that they just immediately closed it.

2056
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:36,180
But also something they did was in the middle of the night,

2057
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:41,220
load up Corky and Orky and ship them out of there, send them over to SeaWorld.

2058
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,740
They stole the whales.

2059
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:47,140
SeaWorld bought Marineland and did a killer whale heist.

2060
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:48,020
Holy shit.

2061
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:52,500
Yeah, that's one of the most nefarious things I don't think we've ever run into

2062
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,860
in theme park ownership.

2063
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:55,780
So it was just a handshake deal, basically?

2064
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,900
Because it would be a legal thing if they said, well,

2065
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:01,060
this is what you have to do in order to buy it.

2066
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:05,700
Or maybe it was kind of on paper, but there was some clause about,

2067
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:10,900
as long as it's reasonably in good condition for you to even start repairing.

2068
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,900
And they were like, it's not, can't do it, bye, sorry, whales are moving.

2069
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:15,860
We got them.

2070
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:21,140
And then not only that, they took, this is so crazy to me,

2071
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:28,660
they poured concrete into the drains so that no one could ever open a new park there again.

2072
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:31,460
They salted the earth.

2073
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,260
Which nothing would grow.

2074
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:35,060
Yes, yeah.

2075
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:36,420
Wow.

2076
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,420
This is crazy mob shit.

2077
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:38,980
Wow.

2078
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,460
That's so brutal-y.

2079
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:46,100
Yeah, I know in a new way that, I mean, it's only partially a new way because we, you know,

2080
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:50,500
I guess stealing killer whales in the middle of the night seems far from the course for them.

2081
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:55,220
But yeah, they concreted the land.

2082
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:57,540
No water park can ever be here again.

2083
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:01,460
And then they still had like a little bit of time to go before they were going to close it.

2084
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:05,220
And people were so mad at them for all of this stuff, rightfully so,

2085
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,060
like the community was really upset.

2086
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:09,060
And then they were like, all right, we're just closing it now then,

2087
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,820
like way earlier than they were going to.

2088
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:11,460
And they said, why?

2089
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:15,860
And they said, well, these angry, these residents, they're such animals.

2090
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,540
They've been sending in bomb threats.

2091
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:18,900
Whoa, whoa.

2092
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,580
You got bomb threats here at Marine land?

2093
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:22,900
Who do you think made the threats?

2094
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:24,660
Don't worry about that.

2095
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:25,300
We got them.

2096
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,260
We got them.

2097
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,460
And we definitely got them.

2098
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:28,260
They were real.

2099
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:30,100
We got real bomb threats.

2100
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:32,900
This is not an alibi to try to steal all the whales.

2101
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,700
Nobody ever found out who made the threat.

2102
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:42,500
So they stole whales, concrete in the drains, made up bomb threats in order to just like

2103
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:46,260
scorch this place and never deal with it again.

2104
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,900
That has to be the tip of the iceberg for like SeaWorld behave.

2105
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,860
I mean, we know some of it, but like, I wonder if there's a whole like

2106
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,420
shitty thing SeaWorld that episode.

2107
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:58,100
I mean, I'm sure there is, but I'm worried.

2108
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,340
Yeah, you know, we were in our SeaWorld episode.

2109
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:04,020
We ran into things that we had to bleep because we found them so disturbing.

2110
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:04,820
So disturbing.

2111
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:04,900
Yeah.

2112
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,660
So I think we might very well be.

2113
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:08,340
Maybe that's too, too dark.

2114
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:08,740
Could be.

2115
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,340
Jesus, they salted the earth.

2116
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:14,500
SeaWorld stole the whales.

2117
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,940
Do we know how long the whales live?

2118
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:17,620
Right into the eyes of the old owners.

2119
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:22,580
So they could never, they put concrete in the, down the throats of the old owners.

2120
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:24,580
I'm picturing like follow that bird too.

2121
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:28,660
They're like, they like painted a blue, like big bird in a cage.

2122
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,420
They weren't even black and white whales.

2123
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:30,900
Right.

2124
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,300
They had to put a bunch of paint on them.

2125
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:33,460
Right.

2126
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,300
They painted them like Shamu.

2127
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,180
Do we know where they went?

2128
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:41,540
I don't think one of them died kind of soon after horribly.

2129
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:43,860
And, but one of them is one of them still alive.

2130
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:44,580
Really?

2131
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:49,700
It's all happened in 87, but either Corky or Orky is still one of the SeaWorld Shamus.

2132
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,220
So there's still Shamu.

2133
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:51,860
Yeah.

2134
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:52,340
Yeah.

2135
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:52,740
Wow.

2136
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:53,060
That's interesting.

2137
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:54,260
Because that's the deal with Shamu, right?

2138
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:56,740
You just, there just won't be any new Shamus.

2139
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:57,540
I think so.

2140
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,940
Those old Shamus are grandfathered in.

2141
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:00,580
Yeah.

2142
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:00,740
Yeah.

2143
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:03,220
But they really, their clock is ticking, I think.

2144
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:03,700
Again.

2145
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,660
How long do those?

2146
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:07,460
Trump SeaWorld on the White House lawn.

2147
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,100
Oh yeah.

2148
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:08,980
Shamu will be back.

2149
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:12,500
We're bringing America back into Shamu's doing flips in the.

2150
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,620
He's going to be on the boat.

2151
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,580
He's the new bald eagle.

2152
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:17,940
Hunting for the new Shamus in a full captain's outfit.

2153
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,180
Hey, I see one over there.

2154
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,860
In a big, like the fisherman and the.

2155
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:22,100
Yeah.

2156
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,500
Or he's dressed like a sea hunt.

2157
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,460
He's dressed like.

2158
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:25,960
Oh yeah.

2159
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:28,820
Kurt Douglas looking for Shamus.

2160
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,860
Being president, more boring than I remembered.

2161
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:34,740
I will be starring in a syndicated action show.

2162
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:35,700
I will be shirtless.

2163
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:37,220
Everything's on the table.

2164
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:38,660
You never know.

2165
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,180
Choppy seas await.

2166
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:47,940
But anyway, that's what, so that place, it just, having been concreted, it just sat vacant

2167
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:53,300
for like, from 87 to like 95 and they kept the tower up.

2168
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:56,580
So imagine like that kind of tower that's at knots or magic mountain.

2169
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:57,060
Yeah.

2170
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:00,260
They're inaccessible, just rusting away.

2171
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:03,380
You could just go into the Baja reef drained.

2172
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:07,940
Like it's, you could just walk around and do graffiti and an empty aquarium.

2173
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:08,980
And that's the sad.

2174
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:09,220
Yeah.

2175
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:16,100
Once a thriving hub of production, this place turned into a, into a real graveyard until

2176
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:23,540
the fine people at Terra Naya took over who have merely been the target of a multimillion

2177
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:28,100
dollar lawsuit by employees alleging misconduct and overworking.

2178
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:28,420
Okay.

2179
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:29,220
Any other things.

2180
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:33,860
So besides that, so it's still not the due to the sea world stuff.

2181
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:36,500
Terra Naya will never lawsuit or no lawsuit.

2182
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:41,220
They'll never be responsible for all the worst things ever to happen on that land.

2183
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:41,620
Yeah.

2184
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:42,020
Wow.

2185
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:43,620
Yeah.

2186
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:48,180
Well, I, you know, that might, we, maybe we won't do much more Marine land, but when you

2187
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:49,780
did, you did say Lucy Marine land.

2188
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:50,420
So I don't know.

2189
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:50,820
We'll see.

2190
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,380
You did say it.

2191
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:54,100
I did.

2192
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:59,380
I mean, I, I felt like, like, hopefully you ultimately regarded that as a show of good

2193
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:02,180
faith that I can hide that information from you.

2194
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:05,940
However, is my interest to do Lucy and Marine land very high?

2195
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,460
I can't say that it is.

2196
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:08,580
Is Sid Gould in it?

2197
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,620
That's what I have to ask.

2198
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:14,020
Is Sid Gould or her husband, Gary Martin involved?

2199
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:15,140
Get me in.

2200
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:16,820
I already did Munsters down there.

2201
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:17,860
I know the directions.

2202
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:19,540
You don't even have to send me a call sheet.

2203
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:22,020
I'm well, I'm, I'm familiar.

2204
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:23,620
I'll camp there.

2205
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:26,020
I know a cave I can hide in.

2206
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:28,340
There's a, there's a, they got a spare reef.

2207
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,420
I can spend the night in.

2208
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:35,140
Isn't that nice of Lucy to throw Gary's cousin a bone?

2209
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:35,620
Yeah.

2210
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:35,940
You know?

2211
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,540
Shows you the kind of lady.

2212
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,780
80 different episodes of like bit parts.

2213
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:42,500
No one else wanted to hire poor Sid.

2214
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,860
She's a classy dame.

2215
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:47,140
Ah, Gary's annoying me about Sid again.

2216
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:49,940
Just make him the postman.

2217
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:50,980
Will it shut you up?

2218
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:52,260
Gary.

2219
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:54,420
Another Sid episode.

2220
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:55,940
Fucking hack.

2221
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:56,440
Whatever.

2222
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,220
Untalented fuck.

2223
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:03,220
If it prevents another Gary bitch fest.

2224
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,580
Gary always whines in the worst way.

2225
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:10,180
Gary, one of these days, I'm going to fill your lungs up with concrete.

2226
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:11,620
At least Desi was a man.

2227
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:14,740
He'd scream and be mean.

2228
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,700
Gary just whimpers like a little dog.

2229
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:19,700
It's pathetic.

2230
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:22,340
He's more pet than husband.

2231
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:26,740
All right.

2232
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,500
Well, I, yeah, all right.

2233
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,820
Lucy in Marineland to be negotiated.

2234
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,660

2243
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:01,140
More if you want to pick Gary Morton as a topic.

2244
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:02,900
That is now that we've talked about.

2245
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:05,540
What's the one that can get less than 1% of the vote?

2246
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:10,340
Gary Lucy's second husband, Gary Morton, who I think I'm the only one who's ever thought

2247
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:12,660
that I think Lucy wasn't that thrilled with him.

2248
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:14,660
And the thought of him is like, ah, he's fine.

2249
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:17,540
Because of interviews I've seen with the two of them.

2250
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:20,900
That might be originating for me.

2251
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:21,540
You know why?

2252
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:24,340
Because I stopped listening at the beginning of the sentence.

2253
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:29,140
Well, if you want to hear more, Gary Morton vote for him as a topic for club three.

2254
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:34,100
And let's see if we can get that to the world record of club three of zero

2255
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:39,300
of the ocean where only Mike Nelson on a sea hunt could find it.
