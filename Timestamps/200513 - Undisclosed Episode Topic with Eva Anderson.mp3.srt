1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,060
Now, if you've noticed the title of this episode,

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,580
we should note we have elected to hide

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,780
this episode's topic from the title

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,980
and any searchable metadata

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,420
so that anyone we discuss in this episode

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,300
does not find out about the episode and have us killed.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,800
So with that in mind,

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,180
I'm gonna put the option on the table.

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,060
We can all say our names or not say our names

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,140
or use a pseudonym, whatever you wish.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,700
I'm gonna risk my life and mumble my name.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,740
I'm scaring, who else is here?

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,380
Oh, hi, I'm Jay Sheridan.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,100
Jay Sheridan, huh?

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,940
Okay.

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,780
Jay Sheridan, yeah.

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,140
Thanks for being here, Jay.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,380
Who else we got?

21
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,740
I am, I'm gonna go by the name Boom Boom

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,300
after Bobby Darin's longtime talent manager,

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,240
Steven Boom Boom Bloudner.

24
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,060
Well, that's a pretty good clue that might lead us into,

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,220
but again, I think we're protected

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,500
by keeping the topic secret.

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,380
And now I'll do the courtesy of asking our guest,

28
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,660
would you like to use a pseudonym

29
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,340
or are you comfortable saying your real name?

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,320
I'm Verbal Kent.

31
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,300
Nice.

32
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,820
All right, thank you, all right.

33
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,860
Hello guys, it's me, Eva Anderson.

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,500
Whoa, whoa, so brave.

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,860
Oh, the bravery on display.

36
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,980
Eva Anderson, our first quarantine guest

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,460
who purchased a microphone, seemingly mostly to do this,

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,900
what we're doing right now.

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,820
Damn straight.

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,700
Wow, that is commitment.

41
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,780
It is much appreciated.

42
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,780
It's so good to hear you and see you.

43
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,220
We got video up and we have very special backgrounds

44
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,220
up as well, most of which including our guests,

45
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,060
or not our guests, our topic today.

46
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,300
I guess are we comfortable, are we now deep enough into it

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,900
that we can disclose the topic?

48
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,380
And this is the long awaited episode about Kevin Spacey.

49
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,060
Kevin Spacey novelties.

50
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,180
Kevin Spacey, the true name, the real name.

51
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,820
I think when this came up during the Downtown Disney ordeal,

52
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,100
I asked which feed is this going on?

53
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,740
I guess I should have been more specific and said,

54
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,380
which podcast is this going?

55
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,300
Which podcast is doing this?

56
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,060
The theme park podcast.

57
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,900
The theme park podcast.

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,740
Okay, yeah, okay.

59
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,860
The theme park podcast is doing an episode

60
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,220
about all the weird things Kevin Spacey's done

61
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,060
over the years.

62
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,460
Do we feel the need to justify this in any particular way?

63
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,460
I was trying to figure out what the angle is,

64
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,180
and I feel like maybe this is the first one

65
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,260
that we can't justify at all.

66
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,300
Maybe we just say, you know what, no justification.

67
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,180
You're along for the ride, just strap in.

68
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,700
Yeah, I thought about like, oh, year three,

69
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,540
sort of like a little treat for ourselves.

70
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,700
And then I think the real justification

71
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,260
is the world just got insane.

72
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,380
So we're allowed to get a little crazy too.

73
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,500
We're allowed to be a little like the clown prince of crime,

74
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,060
the devious joker.

75
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,620
Well, that's my thinking is, I mean,

76
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,060
and what I thought when we first talked about it

77
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,420
was that we did an episode about the Green Goblin

78
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,580
coming into the David Letterman show.

79
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,780
And I just think that Spacey is so Green Goblin-esque.

80
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,340
I think he is our real life Green Goblin.

81
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,820
He doesn't burst into studios in the same way,

82
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,540
but he bursts back into our world every Christmas Eve

83
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,860
and tells and alludes to his malicious plans.

84
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,980
He's the closest thing we have.

85
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,820
Yeah.

86
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,860
To a real life supervillain?

87
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,660
A real life theme park stunt show supervillain.

88
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,300
Unfortunately, he cannot be defeated by children yelling,

89
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,140
like behind you, look behind you.

90
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,860
He can't be pushed into a pit and confetti comes out.

91
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,700
It's not that easy.

92
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,620
Unstoppable.

93
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,460
He's unstoppable.

94
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,300
I feel like he might hate music.

95
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,860
That's a good point.

96
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,940
Yeah, yeah, that could be his.

97
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,540
Although as we're going to learn, Kevin loves music.

98
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,340
He loves the most.

99
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,340
He loves music.

100
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,060
He loves impressions.

101
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,660
I learned things about his music appreciation

102
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,580
that I didn't know.

103
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,660
I'm so excited to reveal all of them.

104
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,940
I think we all learned a lot of stuff.

105
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,220
Some of the most fun research

106
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,740
I think we've all gotten to do.

107
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,340
Including from Eva, who traditionally has been the guest

108
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,700
who does the most research.

109
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,180
Oh yeah, I went hard.

110
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,940
Well, thank you.

111
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,900
And not only that, but you came in with a plan

112
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,180
that I think is a good plan,

113
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,740
just so that this doesn't get so unwieldy.

114
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,660
But it was your proposal that we all,

115
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,420
within the school of spaceology,

116
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,220
that we all have a particular major,

117
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,100
that we all focus on an area of spacey culture.

118
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,980
Yes.

119
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,020
And then, but then we also said

120
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,580
there would be little minors as well

121
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,820
if you had a smaller section as well.

122
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,220
So you can major in something

123
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,820
and minor in something as well.

124
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,660
Yeah.

125
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,740
Yeah, and we might have some shared minors.

126
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,180
Yeah.

127
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,420
The minors are like the quick bites of spacey.

128
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,260
Yes.

129
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,580
I inadvertently did a minor years ago

130
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,980
when I watched all five seasons of House of Cards

131
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,940
as they aired.

132
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,900
Yeah, I watched it.

133
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,700
I kind of liked House of Cards.

134
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,740
Who was the biggest spacey fan here, do we think?

135
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,060
I was in high school.

136
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,460
That was, I told you guys last time

137
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,140
that I went very obsessively through his entire filmography

138
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,580
after I saw him in the year.

139
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,620
He did Seven Usual Suspects and Swimming with Sharks.

140
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,220
I went back and I watched every movie he'd ever been in

141
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,140
and I had to find them because the internet

142
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,980
wasn't a thing yet.

143
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,300
I had to like find hard copies of them.

144
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,140
Wow.

145
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,940
What was it about it?

146
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,620
What was so alluring about him at the time?

147
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
I think I was like a confused, obsessive teenager

148
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,260
who just wanted to focus on something.

149
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,180
He was also a really good actor back then.

150
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,100
And even in, I'll show something from my minor later,

151
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,420
from 2000, even though it's a bad movie,

152
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,380
I was like, oh man, he used to actually be very good

153
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,500
before he just checked out and stopped caring.

154
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,420
Is it? Yeah, I don't know.

155
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,740
Is it maybe, is this whole thing a study

156
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,260
in the poisonous nature of celebrity

157
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,300
and what it can do to the brain of an artist

158
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,380
when an artist crosses into being a celebrity,

159
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,100
how much stupider their body of work becomes?

160
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,420
Yeah, maybe.

161
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,620
The confidence rises.

162
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,940
Yeah, as people stop saying no to them.

163
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,780
And I feel like we can see a trajectory

164
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,980
of when people stop saying no to Kevin Spacey

165
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,100
to ideas he had.

166
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,740
Eva, I did much the same thing in college,

167
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,820
or in high school in college, like going back.

168
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,660
Usual Suspects was one of those DVDs

169
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,340
that was everywhere and $10.

170
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,020
So I feel like everyone who had an interest in movies

171
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,380
bought that, bought Seven.

172
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,140
And then the American Beauty, like Oscar win,

173
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,300
kind of was huge.

174
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,060
His political capital, he spent it all on

175
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,300
the stupidest possible thing,

176
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,300
and then laid low at the old Vic for 15 years or something.

177
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,620
And I was excited when he kind of came back

178
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,460
to the fold with House of Cards,

179
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,780
the combination of him and David Fincher.

180
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,900
Very quickly it became apparent

181
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,100
he was playing a cartoon character

182
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,140
and was being out acted by Robin Wright Penn

183
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,460
and the guy who plays Doug Stamper and-

184
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,300
Crystal.

185
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,980
Yeah, Rachel Brosnahan plays a high end call girl in it,

186
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,620
right, and then would go on to Marvelous Miss Maisel.

187
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,700
Oh, I didn't realize that was her.

188
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,540
Oh, right, right.

189
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,820
Yeah, and she's great.

190
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,260
All of that later on, Campbell Scott joins the cast.

191
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,900
Kate Mara is in it for one season and one episode

192
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,980
before she meets her sudden end.

193
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,660
Yeah.

194
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,700
Though the sudden end ended up being a lot less sudden

195
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,260
than the end of Kevin.

196
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,820
It was the most sudden end of any character,

197
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,700
perhaps in television.

198
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,060
But you never saw him die.

199
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,540
Coincided with an end that just won't end.

200
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,620
He refuses to stay canceled.

201
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,300
That's true, and if we consider the yearly Christmas video,

202
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,060
I have to give Jason credit

203
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,700
for coining the term Christmas threats.

204
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,060
Because when we were talking about what areas to cover

205
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,660
and we were saying, all right, well, what do you know

206
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,460
is like as a war shows an area,

207
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,180
as nine lives an area,

208
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,940
Christmas threats, is that an area?

209
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,860
That made me so happy.

210
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,540
But the Christmas threats,

211
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,860
in addition to being just wonderfully entertaining

212
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,780
and I guess murder clues,

213
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,780
it is a way to keep Frank Underwood alive.

214
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,580
We do get yearly check-ins from this character

215
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,620
who just dropped off the face of the earth.

216
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,940
Unless that's not, the lines are so blurry.

217
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,060
Where does Kevin end and Frank begin?

218
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,340
Yeah.

219
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,220
I feel like he will produce content more and more

220
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,260
as the years go on.

221
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,380
I feel like though he'll figure out a way

222
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,900
to finance full TV shows, I feel like it'll just happen.

223
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,740
I don't know.

224
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,620
He's gonna push it forward.

225
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,580
I feel like he and a lot of guys like him

226
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,500
are gonna end up making movies in Bulgaria,

227
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,820
like, financed by the mob.

228
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,260
And they just sort of will leak out slowly

229
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,940
and we'll just be like, who made this?

230
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,740
And it's like, oh, it's just a bunch of canceled people.

231
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,380
They'll be on Russia Today, that RT channel

232
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,100
with like a talk show.

233
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,820
The canceled equivalent of the underground comedy movie.

234
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,020
Oh yeah, exactly.

235
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,780
I was gonna say the best we can hope for

236
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,140
is written, directed and starring Kevin Spacey.

237
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,300
That would be my,

238
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,260
that's the only like silver lining to that happening.

239
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,180
Yeah.

240
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,020
We can hope.

241
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,140
Here's hoping.

242
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,060
It would be nice.

243
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,660
And there's all, it's nice that he's like,

244
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,300
he didn't write House of Cards,

245
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,020
but you watched the Christmas Threat videos

246
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,220
and presumably he's writing it.

247
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,620
So it is nice to hear Frank Underwood

248
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,340
using Kevin Spacey's words.

249
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,580
He's got the voice down.

250
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,420
His voice, writer-wise and literal voice.

251
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,060
You knew of it back.

252
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,660
I would like to hear from, you know what?

253
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,460
I would like to hear on different holidays

254
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,780
from different characters of his.

255
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,820
Let's not just do Frank, let's get, you know,

256
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,620
his LA confidential character.

257
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,580
Let's hear from him on Easter.

258
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,700
Like different updates for different holidays.

259
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,580
Yeah, I don't have as many of the characters names

260
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,900
at the ready, but you know,

261
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,060
I'd love to hear from Nixon anytime.

262
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,940
He of course was Nixon and Elvis and Nixon.

263
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,900
Of course.

264
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,380
So, you know, hearing a President's Day message

265
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,780
from, or, you know, get it off, you know, make it,

266
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,780
I don't know, like a Good Friday or a Passover.

267
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,740
Lex Luthor.

268
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,900
Yeah, what's K-Pax?

269
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,580
K-Pax, yeah, I was gonna say K-Pax too.

270
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,300
Happy Martin Luther King Day from K-Pax.

271
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,220
And they don't, yeah, some of them will be like nice.

272
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,220
They don't have to be sinister

273
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,260
like the Frank Underwood one.

274
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,100
Yeah.

275
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,140
K-Pax is just signing to check in and be nice.

276
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,180
Who's K-Pax?

277
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,220
K-Pax is nice.

278
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,060
Yeah.

279
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,980
Yeah.

280
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,060
I'd love to get a St. Patrick's Day message

281
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,060
from original billionaire boys club.

282
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,020
No way, that's no, that's the movie that came out.

283
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,300
That was the last, what movie?

284
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,660
What's the, the spaghetti movie?

285
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,700
Where you got replaced by Christopher Plummer?

286
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

287
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,660
I can't think of the name of it.

288
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,740
It's the Ridley Scott movie.

289
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,060
Anyway, I'd love for Kevin's J-Paul Getty

290
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,660
to wish us a happy St. Patrick's Day.

291
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,900
Right, full makeup.

292
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,020
Which he has to do himself.

293
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,100
He has to do his own prosthetics.

294
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,220
He has to do it.

295
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,220
That movie is called All the Money in the World.

296
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,180
That's right.

297
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,980
I got confused.

298
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,460
Fourth of July from Baby Driver's Boss.

299
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,460
Yeah.

300
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,620
I forgot.

301
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,060
Doc, you mean Doc.

302
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,020
Of course, Doc.

303
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,980
When I was rewatching the Christmas threats,

304
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,860
the next video that auto played

305
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,220
was a clip from the Joe Rogan experience.

306
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,540
And they were, Joe Rogan says,

307
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,340
he was good at Baby Driver.

308
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,220
I was like, oh my God, I forgot about Baby Driver.

309
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,820
That was the last thing, right?

310
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
That was like the last thing we saw him at

311
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,180
by the skin of his teeth that came out.

312
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,020
Yeah.

313
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,300
Billionaire Boys Club was right at the end.

314
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,140
I'm looking at his IMDB right now.

315
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,220
And somebody took the time to add

316
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,500
Let Me Be Frank and KTWK,

317
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,820
AKA Kill Him With Kindness to IMDB.

318
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,660
They're on.

319
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,500
Oh my God.

320
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,220
And he's listed as Frank Underwood uncredited.

321
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,300
I wanna know more.

322
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,340
Who filmed it?

323
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,500
Who did the music?

324
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Yeah, that's the question.

325
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,300
Somebody edited it, lit it, all of that.

326
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,580
My favorite thing about those videos

327
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,020
is that they both have this sound cue at the end,

328
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,860
this suspense cue,

329
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,060
the bum, bum, bum,

330
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,700
which I recognize as being like a stock music cue

331
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,460
from Final Cut Pro.

332
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,100
Like that's the thing that's been at every editor's

333
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,860
disposal since 2005.

334
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,660
And they just see just dragged and dropped

335
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,740
this really default, put in something scary.

336
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,780
And he's used it like, it's like,

337
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,260
I remember it from YouTube videos a decade and a half ago.

338
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,340
And now he's using it in videos where he's alluding

339
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,620
to real murders he's going to commit.

340
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,340
Yeah, that's all obviously very strange.

341
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,180
I think that what I've really learned

342
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,620
from doing all this research is he thinks he's very good

343
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,780
at almost everything a human could do.

344
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,900
So I could see him literally learning Final Cut

345
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,260
and finding that sting and going,

346
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,740
I've got the perfect sting for this.

347
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,940
Like that seems very possible.

348
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,860
I'm my own Hans Zimmer.

349
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,140
Yeah.

350
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,780
So, but he's still got a friend or two there to help him.

351
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,740
It has to have, that has to be going on.

352
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,780
Well, this camera moves.

353
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
So somebody is helping.

354
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,460
And this is before the quarantine.

355
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,860
This is before all the talk show hosts wives

356
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,260
had to film the show for them.

357
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,940
He was really ahead of it.

358
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,580
It's a former personal assistant.

359
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,940
I'm sure that he just gets a favor out of,

360
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,660
and it's like, Jerry, come on Jerry.

361
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,140
Also just an hour.

362
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,020
It's also possible he's in Europe.

363
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,420
He's in Europe and like people don't,

364
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,820
Europe I feel like is a little more lax

365
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,300
with their cancel celebrities.

366
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,500
Polanski is operating the camera.

367
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,860
Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.

368
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,420
Polanski won an award in Europe, right?

369
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,340
Didn't he win a movie award very recently?

370
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,740
He won the, he beat portrait of a lady on fire

371
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,380
for like the French Oscar.

372
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,500
And yeah.

373
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,580
She's, by the way, I can't,

374
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,020
I also just have to say that they,

375
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,540
I like that there's a really detailed full IMDB profile

376
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,420
for let me be frank that where they put in plot keywords,

377
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,420
like kitchen, kitchen sink, ring, talking to the camera,

378
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,340
Santa Claus.

379
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,140
So if you went on IMDB to look for movies about Santa Claus,

380
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,220
you would find, you know, here we go.

381
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,700
Madagascar, how the Grinch stole Christmas,

382
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,820
made in Manhattan and let me be frank.

383
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,980
Let me be frank.

384
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,940
All my favorite Santa movies.

385
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,580
So strange.

386
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,580
I'm so excited to talk about him for a while.

387
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,420
I guess we should start getting into our majors.

388
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,660
I think one question that we should ask at the beginning is,

389
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,060
and it depends on everybody's time,

390
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,780
but I just wanna throw it out there.

391
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,780
Should we go for the record?

392
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,860
Should we go for longest podcast episode?

393
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,300
Because we know it's already gonna be in competition,

394
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,100
but do we just like make that decision?

395
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,380
And then even, I know you gotta go.

396
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,620
You guys can keep talking after the three hour point

397
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,220
when I leave.

398
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,140
Well, three hours would get us there.

399
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,020
If you consider Dogpatch USA, our longest episode,

400
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,660
that was two hours and 40,

401
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,620
but I don't know if technically it's Wallinor

402
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,420
and failed parks,

403
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,620
because it was an accidental two.

404
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,540
It's really, I'd be curious to see how people

405
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,780
wanna make that division,

406
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,620
but either way, we have a shot here.

407
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,460
Yeah.

408
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,620
I think there's a good shot, but I don't know.

409
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,220
We shouldn't, I don't wanna call the shot

410
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,460
like the babe used to.

411
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,020
I don't wanna shoot for a home run and then not get it.

412
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,740
So I say, I think we're in contention.

413
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,500
It's a shame Spacey didn't have a chance to play the babe

414
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,700
before he got canceled.

415
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,260
I think there's a good chance that he will play the babe

416
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,260
in a self written and self directed film.

417
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,380
In Romania.

418
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,060
In Romania.

419
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,900
Yes.

420
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,980
He will win a Romanian Oscar for playing the babe.

421
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,060
Romanian mafia money, Roman Polanski directed,

422
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,980
Kevin Spacey starring, perfect.

423
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,700
No, Kevin has to direct.

424
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,540
Oh, Kevin has to direct.

425
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,380
Kevin has to direct.

426
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,660
He's got experience.

427
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,780
He's got experience.

428
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,500
And you know, when babe points that bat,

429
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,060
it's gonna be pointing right down the barrel of the camera.

430
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,140
He's gonna be looking right into the camera

431
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,740
because he loves it.

432
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,460
He loves to do that.

433
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,020
It's also a threat.

434
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,220
You thought I couldn't hit it, didn't you?

435
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,220
Kevin should teach master classes as characters as well,

436
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,340
I think.

437
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,340
Oh, that'd be good.

438
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,180
Yeah.

439
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,260
The babe, he should, Kevin Spacey as the babe

440
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,900
teaches you how to play baseball.

441
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,740
Christopher Walken teaches you how to bake.

442
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,180
Right.

443
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,100
Which incidentally would be a great SNL audition.

444
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,420
That's sitting there for anybody who wants that.

445
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,260
Perfect.

446
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,100
Yeah.

447
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,820
Kevin Spacey as Christopher Walken teaches you how to bake.

448
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,660
Yeah.

449
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,580
Yeah, if you can pull off multiple impressions at once,

450
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,420
then yes.

451
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,340
I'll say that.

452
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,900
I think like Scott,

453
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,340
Scott was almost gleeful about the potential

454
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,660
for how long this episode could be.

455
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,340
So now if I have something, and now I realize like,

456
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,180
okay, so if one of us is I in a really long subject matter,

457
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,260
the way to psych Scott up for it

458
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,860
is to include a mugging deep state sex freak.

459
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,140
Like, well, there's a mugging,

460
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,020
there's a hammy deep state sex weirdo in this one,

461
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,060
and he does a one man show.

462
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,940
Like that is the trick.

463
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,100
You got it.

464
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,140
You got, hey, you know, I got to stick with my people.

465
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,260
Yeah, I know.

466
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,100
I don't understand.

467
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,700
I guess the chart is bizarre.

468
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,580
Harbor hoedown, I could not want to do less.

469
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,700
Spacey episode, I'll go till midnight.

470
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,780
It's as long as anybody wants.

471
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,860
Spacey and Rex, Spacey and Rex, you know.

472
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,220
I had, who's the, who's Davy Crockett?

473
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,500
What's Davy Crockett's whiner?

474
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,740
What's Fest Parker?

475
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,580
Fest Parker.

476
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,860
Fest Parker, whiner, yeah.

477
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,980
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,540
Do you guys have an idea of what order we should go in?

479
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,900
Hmm, I don't.

480
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,420
I think we should announce our major and minors

481
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,740
and then decide sort of as we go,

482
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,620
what makes the most sense.

483
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,780
All right.

484
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,820
That's sort of, unless you have a feeling, Eva.

485
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,740
I think I need to go after Scott is my only thing.

486
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,580
Oh, interesting.

487
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,740
Okay, okay, sure, sure, sure.

488
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,380
I'm happy to start if I can start.

489
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,220
Okay.

490
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,060
Let's just start here.

491
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,900
Yeah, go ahead and start.

492
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,340
We should unfold slowly too.

493
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,020
Yeah, yeah, thank you for being brave.

494
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,740
I'll go after Mike.

495
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,580
Okay, that's perfect.

496
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,420
That's perfect.

497
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,260
Great.

498
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,340
So I will say my major and minors,

499
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,340
I am majoring in short films that Kevin Spacey is in

500
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,460
that I had never heard of before a few days ago.

501
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,300
Whoa.

502
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,540
And you shocked us with this

503
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,460
because I didn't know about this general area.

504
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,940
Let me ask the three, like the three of you,

505
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,860
have you ever heard of the films,

506
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,860
The Ventriloquist, Envelope, or A Spirit of a Denture?

507
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,860
Absolutely not.

508
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,260
Only because I'm currently on his IMDB.

509
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,060
I've certainly heard of Tom O'Dell, Here I Am.

510
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,740
Yes.

511
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,020
But you know, that was only four minutes ago.

512
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,700
I've heard of A Spirit of a Denture,

513
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,420
but I don't remember what it is.

514
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,580
I think I've seen it.

515
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,420
Ooh.

516
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,260
Okay, these are all shorts.

517
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,940
And I will say I'm minoring in just a couple

518
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,180
Kevin Spacey out in the real world,

519
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,740
live appearances that I just think are so strange.

520
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,860
So let me-

521
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,740
So can I Kevin Spacey pop-ups?

522
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,300
Yes.

523
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,860
And yeah, so-

524
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,700
Flash mobs.

525
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,540
Yeah.

526
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,380
Yeah.

527
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,420
Spacey flash mobs, great.

528
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Okay, so I will, yes, we will share the screen now

529
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,460
and I will show you just, I will start with the live.

530
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,740
We'll start with a live appearance.

531
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,260
I'll call them the live.

532
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,340
Oh, we'll call them the pop-ups.

533
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,460
That's a better name.

534
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,700
Okay, and this is what I referenced before.

535
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,900
This is just, this is post some sort of like victory

536
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,540
in one of the trials.

537
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,540
Is Kevin Spacey playing with a mariachi band, La Bamba?

538
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,420
Yeah.

539
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,800
Yo no soy marinero.

540
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,640
Woo.

541
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,860
Yo no soy marinero.

542
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,300
Soy capitán.

543
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,640
Soy capitán, soy capitán.

544
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,720
Soy capitán.

545
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,800
Ba, ba, ba, ba.

546
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,040
Ba, ba, ba, ba.

547
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,220
Ba, ba, ba, ba.

548
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,160
Hi.

549
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,000
Hey.

550
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,840
Hi.

551
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,120
Hi.

552
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,240
What a thrill for those guys.

553
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,760
They are thrilled to be playing.

554
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,080
He's got some news that someone is not gonna be suing him

555
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,160
for $10 million or something,

556
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,920
or maybe that they've been, you know, taken care of.

557
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,120
Wearing like a peach shirt.

558
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,520
His button down shirt collection is so odd.

559
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,040
It's what most of his musical performances are in,

560
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,000
seemingly. Yeah.

561
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,080
And who knew he played guitar?

562
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,920
A little tease of mine.

563
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,200
I learned about some instrumental abilities from him

564
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,560
that I'm delighted to share.

565
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,840
Yeah, so that's what I was saying.

566
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,000
Like he's a, he considers himself a jack of all trades.

567
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,880
He plays guitar, he does the impression.

568
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,700
Who knew?

569
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,440
It's limitless as far as what he can do.

570
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,000
I imagine that without giving it away,

571
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,040
Jason will teach us all about his soft shoeing.

572
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,880
Oh man.

573
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,720
He's a dancer.

574
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,240
There's a little guitar too.

575
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,740
You get soft shoe and guitar in my major.

576
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,600
Okay.

577
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,600
So this is just another little, little quick bite.

578
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,000
This is him at a Florida Panthers game.

579
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,560
And it was like,

580
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,400
there was some sort of meme going around with Kevin Spacey

581
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,820
at the, I guess like in the basketball games or whatever.

582
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,920
And I think it's basketball.

583
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,760
And check it out.

584
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,800
That's how much I don't know about sports.

585
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,680
Is not only in the house,

586
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,920
but he's right there in the seats with the fans.

587
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,440
And this place is going absolutely bonkers right now.

588
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,440
He had the Spacey Facey and then he took it off.

589
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,280
And there he is.

590
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,760
Panthers give that Spacey in space sweatshirt

591
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,280
in the locker room to the player of the game.

592
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,320
He's loving it, Denny.

593
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,760
Loving it.

594
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,600
And let's take a look.

595
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,640
This is how it all materialized here.

596
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,480
So he had the mask going and then all of a sudden,

597
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,320
peekaboo.

598
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,140
I know, look at that.

599
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,280
It's president Underwood.

600
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,120
Yo.

601
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,920
Oh man.

602
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,320
So I said basketball.

603
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
It's a hockey, it's a hockey team.

604
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,600
I'm an idiot.

605
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
There apparently, it was,

606
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,360
they were called like the Spacey Facey.

607
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,800
Like there was some, I looked it up.

608
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,200
There's no real explanation for why they started wearing

609
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,480
a picture of Kevin Spacey, but then he showed up.

610
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,560
And as you saw, the crowd lost their minds.

611
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,760
It's great.

612
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,720
It's a recurring thing that crowds lose their minds.

613
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,680
Like in so many of the clips I saw, just adoration.

614
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,040
People cannot believe he's there.

615
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,320
People loved him.

616
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,880
People loved him so much.

617
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,920
Which is another thing I was thinking about was,

618
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,920
is the, there are certainly like more powerful people

619
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,160
who got Me Too'd, but was there anyone more beloved?

620
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,600
Like just like all of these clips show you

621
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,360
that everyone's so delighted to have him around.

622
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,240
And then his was like the biggest fall and the fastest fall.

623
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,640
It was gone in that one awful apology he did.

624
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,080
And he's off the face of the earth.

625
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,960
I think it's like the most like severe whiplash

626
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,240
of any of the Me Too's.

627
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,600
Yeah, maybe.

628
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,360
I mean, he had, I think he just had one of those,

629
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,000
like that 90s honeymoon period

630
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,800
that everyone remembers so fondly,

631
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,480
which is why people are losing their minds there

632
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,280
at the Panthers game because of the, you know,

633
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,000
his run in the 90s.

634
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,080
I would guess that's a guess.

635
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,920
Is that before or after everything?

636
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,640
Oh, the game that's before.

637
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,480
That is before.

638
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,320
Okay, okay.

639
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

640
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,400
That would be wild.

641
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,240
They're like, we don't care.

642
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,440
The escape from the sex rehab.

643
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,440
But the La Bamba was after, right?

644
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,760
Yes, that's after.

645
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,440
That's like a year ago or something.

646
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,520
That's so strange.

647
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,760
Eva, you taught me a little something about the rehab

648
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,400
that he's been doing.

649
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,160
Can you illuminate that for our audience?

650
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,360
Well, he ended up at the same rehab as Harvey Weinstein.

651
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,760
And part of the therapy for sex addiction

652
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,320
is that you ride horses around.

653
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,080
And there was like a New York Post article

654
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,960
about how lux it is,

655
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,920
but they're just horse therapy for sex addicts.

656
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,440
So they'll shake the urges right out of you,

657
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,400
like with each bounce.

658
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,200
Crush your genitals into distraction.

659
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,800
Well, like our vice president said,

660
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,240
or says, you know,

661
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,760
there's nothing helps the inside of a man

662
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,280
like the outside of a horse.

663
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,360
Ew, he said that?

664
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,520
Yes, he did.

665
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,360
Yes.

666
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,960
Like good for the spirit.

667
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,040
He meant like good for the spirit is horseback riding is.

668
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,560
Inside of a man, ick.

669
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,280
This is our phrasing.

670
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,080
Anyway, excellent, Minor, Mike.

671
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,080
We all gotta get our spacey space hoodies too.

672
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,800
He was like a very meme,

673
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,880
he's like he's floating in space in a very like jiffy way.

674
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,800
He looks cool.

675
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,760
Okay, so let's get to the major stuff here.

676
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,440
I'm gonna start with a thing called the spirit.

677
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,840
I need to make sure, spirit of a denture.

678
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,040
Can I just say really quick?

679
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,120
The Florida Panthers retired the spacey

680
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,080
and space sweater in 2016, immediately.

681
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,920
Okay, why?

682
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,760
Sorry, sorry.

683
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,720
Pretty.

684
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,920
Okay, go on.

685
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,200
Okay, I don't know a ton about this,

686
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,400
but all I know is it's a short film.

687
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,680
Kevin Spacey plays a dentist

688
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,480
and we're gonna all sort of try to figure out

689
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
what this is together, but here we go.

690
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,480
Kevin Spacey just punched a pirate.

691
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,120
Punch a pirate.

692
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,760
He's punching a pirate.

693
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,600
Ah!

694
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,440
Ah!

695
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,280
Ah!

696
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,120
Ah!

697
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,960
Ah!

698
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,800
Ah!

699
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,640
Ah!

700
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,480
Ah!

701
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,320
Ah!

702
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,160
Ah!

703
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,000
Ah!

704
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,280
Ah!

705
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,300
I'll grind it down.

706
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,680
Okay.

707
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,920
All right.

708
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,160
With a dentist drill, he scared a pirate till he fainted.

709
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,160
Now the pirate's waking up.

710
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,920
Good morning, Mr. Crow.

711
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,000
Mr. Crow.

712
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,840
Dean.

713
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,120
It's gone.

714
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,960
I took advantage of the situation.

715
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,680
Dr. Middling.

716
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,040
Eh, eh, what happened in here?

717
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,200
A nurse has shown up.

718
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,320
But I do think I'm ready to have that drink with you now.

719
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,720
Ew.

720
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,040
That's lovely, sir.

721
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,920
Cause you're gonna need a drink.

722
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,040
Maybe you should take a look in the waiting room first.

723
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,160
Oh no.

724
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,320
The waiting room is full of pirates.

725
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,800
There's so many pirates.

726
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,360
They're all pointing to their gold teeth and such.

727
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
I

728
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,560
Are you Bob?

729
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,600
Yes.

730
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
Dr. Robert Middling.

731
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,320
Right you are.

732
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,760
I be Bob too.

733
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,840
First mate Bob.

734
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,440
Don't be forgetting it.

735
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,280
Here.

736
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,800
And I be first.

737
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,200
Bob, how do you feel about needles?

738
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,040
Hello.

739
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,600
He punched him.

740
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,440
What?

741
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,280
What?

742
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,120
Then he punches him.

743
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,960
Why does he do that?

744
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,240
That's a weird, that was weird.

745
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,520
What in the world?

746
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,240
Was this for Nickelodeon?

747
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,760
That was the broadest thing.

748
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,200
He's got that nine lives puffy face too.

749
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,720
This is like in the last three years maybe?

750
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,480
Three or four years?

751
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
I believe so.

752
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,040
I should look up the exact date of it.

753
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,400
There's not a ton.

754
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,200
No, no, sorry, 2012.

755
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,040
Okay.

756
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,200
The spirit of a denture.

757
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,760
Spirit of a denture.

758
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,080
So yeah, still in the last,

759
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,600
his name of course is Dr. Middling.

760
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,440
Was this filmed in 3D and played at SeaWorld?

761
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,600
Was this a SeaWorld 3D movie?

762
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,320
Is that why he punches the camera?

763
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,560
I like that a plot point is taking advantage

764
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,720
of an unconscious person and literally saying,

765
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,600
I took advantage of the situation.

766
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,440
He gave us all the clues.

767
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,360
Mr. Police.

768
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,200
It's a 6.5 on IMDB.

769
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,800
Who directed this film?

770
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,600
I have it.

771
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,920
It's not him.

772
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,200
Alan Shelley, who has just directed

773
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
a couple different shorts.

774
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,200
So it was like a competition short

775
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,280
that he got someone to be in.

776
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,640
And as you'll see, he loves to do shorts.

777
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,160
He loves to do shorts with up and comers, I think.

778
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,440
Okay.

779
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,280
I think.

780
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,080
I'm looking at it.

781
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,080
They made a poster for it, even though it's a short.

782
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,120
And the tagline for Spirit of a Denture

783
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,200
is the tooth is out there.

784
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,440
I also see something that says that this is a,

785
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,920
oh boy, Trigger Street Productions

786
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,640
presents a Jameson first shot film.

787
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,360
So I think what this might be

788
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,120
is like a Coke Young Filmmakers kind of competition.

789
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,760
But for Jameson, like an alcoholic version

790
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,840
of the weird Coke movies before the movies play in a theater.

791
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,280
But guys, Trigger.

792
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,120
Sorry.

793
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,240
I like those movies just because it reminds me

794
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,240
that I can get snacks in the lobby.

795
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,560
Trigger Street Productions is a American entertainment

796
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,640
production company formed by Kevin Spacey in 1997.

797
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,040
Yes, hooray.

798
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,880
Yeah.

799
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,080
What?

800
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,920
So that's it.

801
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,840
It's his company.

802
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,200
He called it Trigger Street before,

803
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,160
way before the PC police invaded America.

804
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,640
Even his production company name has a threat in it.

805
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,800
That's so weird.

806
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,480
Yeah, Jameson first shot.

807
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
This is, yeah, this is a filmmaking competition

808
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,320
like no other.

809
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,760
It's giving fresh fearless filmmakers a chance

810
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,080
to take center stage and very bizarre.

811
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,440
They produced Captain Phillips and the social network.

812
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,760
His company did?

813
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,600
Yeah.

814
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,560
Whoa, Trigger Street.

815
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,520
There are, you know, there are a lot of interviews

816
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,840
where he says, well, I have a production company.

817
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,600
I have, like they were asking him if he takes it easy

818
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,680
while he's performing, maybe for instance,

819
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,560
his Clarence Darrow one-man show.

820
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,760
And they go, oh, so do you like on the day of show,

821
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,600
are you taking it easy?

822
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,680
He goes, I can't, I can't take it easy.

823
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,080
I got a production company to run.

824
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,200
I'm like, I'm mentoring people.

825
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,600
He's like, I can't, I don't have time.

826
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,640
He loves being a mentor.

827
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,920
He loves.

828
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,960
Well, he clearly, I mean, so he,

829
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,920
Jameson first shot, he was like,

830
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
and Trigger Street were like,

831
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,480
this is all in cahoots.

832
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,920
Like he was, he kind of ran this competition, I think too.

833
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,400
And the film, the winner, the winning filmmaker

834
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,840
would have their movie turned into a script starring,

835
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,440
into a film starring Maggie Gyllenhaal.

836
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,120
Like she was participating in that.

837
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,040
Like your reward was you get to make

838
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,600
a Maggie Gyllenhaal movie.

839
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,400
This is such a bizarre find.

840
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,280
And every website that I find about it,

841
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,440
you have to enter your birth date to look at

842
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,000
because it's all about alcohol.

843
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,560
Yeah, that's why he wants to know your birth date.

844
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,840
That's exactly why.

845
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Kevin Faisy is always very careful

846
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,960
to check if someone is underage.

847
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,640
So, okay.

848
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,280
Here's short film number two.

849
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,280
This is called Envelope.

850
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,800
Now you could tell me, I'm only gonna play a little scene.

851
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,480
You'll tell me if you want more.

852
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,920
If the audience demands it encore, I will play more.

853
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,760
Or do I just want a quick bite or not?

854
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,080
Maybe I just want a quick bite.

855
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,920
Yeah, exactly.

856
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,080
Can I shift the aspect or can I turn it

857
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,320
horizontal and vertical?

858
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,160
No, this is only vertical unfortunately.

859
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,000
No, this is only vertical unfortunately.

860
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's so limiting.

861
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,760
I hate watching any content where they decide for me.

862
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,520
Yeah, I agree.

863
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,960
Okay, yeah, I won't even set this up.

864
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,120
Hopefully, oh, I'll explain what happened.

865
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,280
Okay, I'll just play.

866
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,160
He's in a kind of a pastel vest.

867
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,880
He was messing with the postman

868
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,920
by pretending to give him a clip, a piece of mail.

869
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,320
He's like a child man.

870
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,640
I am foreign person.

871
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,680
I make everything up, the city, the street,

872
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,720
the people's names, only the country is real.

873
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,560
I send one out and four weeks later, it comes back to me.

874
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,840
But now it is beautiful.

875
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,680
That's insane.

876
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,760
With all the different marks that mean the same thing,

877
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,360
wrong address.

878
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,040
Only New Zealand left.

879
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,280
Then it is finished.

880
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,040
It's from the terminal country, Precosia.

881
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,720
The prequel to Derek, to Ricky Gervais.

882
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,160
It is, he would be friends with Derek.

883
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,400
We're like, I am Sam.

884
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,080
I got the letter from Derek.

885
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,840
Man, Mike, that was crazy.

886
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,720
Envelope, and so I guess the plot,

887
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,880
the rest of the short is about then the government

888
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,040
thinking he's up to nonsense by sending coded letters

889
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,920
and he gets taken to Moscow.

890
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,680
That feels like one of those where he was like,

891
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,600
oh, got it, Russian accent.

892
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,360
Don't even need to practice.

893
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,920
Done.

894
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,120
I have that in there already.

895
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Really confident in the accent work, yeah.

896
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,000
The irony is that in real life,

897
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,960
Kevin Spacey does have compromise on people.

898
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,920
And assorted world leaders.

899
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,360
So this is from 2012 as well.

900
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,000
He was busy.

901
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,840
This is a short film by a Russian filmmaker.

902
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,680
What?

903
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,960
There's a link on the Wikipedia for it that just says,

904
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,480
in the references to an article,

905
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,240
it says Spacey stars in young Russian director's film.

906
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,400
And you click on it and it says, page not found.

907
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,400
There's an IMDb poster.

908
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,680
It's also a Jameson first shot.

909
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,760
Yeah.

910
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,280
He got Jameson to pay for all these weird short films.

911
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,040
Oh man.

912
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,920
I assumed the, I was gonna say,

913
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,640
I assumed the last one I have is because it's from 2012

914
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,720
is also a Jameson first shot.

915
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,640
And there's probably more,

916
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,920
honestly, there's probably more out there.

917
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,600
I didn't do an exhaustive search for it.

918
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,360
So there's plenty of meat on the bone for Spacey oddities too.

919
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,760
Spacey novelties too.

920
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,600
Oh yeah.

921
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,080
I like Spacey oddities.

922
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,920
Oh yeah.

923
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,360
Spacey oddities.

924
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,040
Yeah. Yeah.

925
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,560
I'm controlled to Major Frank.

926
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,720
Has he done any Bowie at any live award shows?

927
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,880
Ooh.

928
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,760
That was sitting there.

929
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,680
Oh, he should have.

930
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,200
And he, if, oh God, if the, well, was that,

931
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,920
now he was still around in 2016.

932
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,160
If he'd like on the Grammys, like dressed as Bowie,

933
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,800
the way Lady Gaga did.

934
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,920
It's Kevin Spacey as Fame.

935
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,480
You've seen the clip of him playing with Billy Joel, right?

936
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,320
Oh, yeah.

937
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,840
That might be part of my major.

938
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,760
I ruined something.

939
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,720
I'll edit this out.

940
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,760
No one will hear it.

941
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,600
Sorry. So sorry.

942
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,440
All right.

943
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,560
So this is the last short I have.

944
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,640
It's from 2012.

945
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,360
And I almost want to just play all of it.

946
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,560
It's 10 minutes long.

947
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,800
Oh Jesus.

948
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,360
You could tell me to stop whenever you want.

949
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,200
Oh man.

950
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,360
Under 10 minutes, it's still a quick bite.

951
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,560
It's still a quick bite.

952
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,960
It's called the Ventriloquist.

953
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,720
And as you can imagine.

954
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,560
Oh no.

955
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,240
Trigger Street.

956
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,760
You know what, Frank, the world is full of mysteries.

957
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,360
Things that really keep me up at night.

958
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,920
Jameson first shot.

959
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,520
Counting sheep and it's no help at all.

960
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,800
That's his Jack Lemon voice.

961
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,880
Are you kidding?

962
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,040
Questions.

963
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,040
He's got a puppet.

964
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,120
He's dressed like Peewee.

965
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,240
Sliced bread.

966
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,360
What was the best thing?

967
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,160
He's bad at ventriloquism.

968
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,200
Mysteries, Mr. Higgins.

969
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,040
All right then.

970
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,240
What about infants?

971
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,040
What about infants?

972
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,920
Do you think infants like infancy

973
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,080
as much as adults like adultery?

974
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,400
No.

975
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,760
He might be taking things a little too literally.

976
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,320
He's like a street ventriloquist.

977
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,200
Has he become a thief all he entered?

978
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,080
I changed my mind.

979
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,240
This episode's over.

980
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,080
Why?

981
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,240
Because it's not politically correct, that word.

982
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,080
No!

983
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,920
Doesn't matter anyway.

984
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,760
Not much of a crowd today, huh?

985
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,840
Nope.

986
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,280
Ew.

987
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,160
And around the corner,

988
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,440
there's a bunch of jugglers and other street musicians.

989
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,640
What world is this?

990
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,160
I'm so confused.

991
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,440
You should do it today.

992
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,160
No, I'm not ready.

993
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,520
You'll never be ready, just ask her.

994
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,560
No, I'm just feeling a little queasy.

995
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,920
Oh, for the love of God.

996
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,400
Like a coffee cart.

997
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,240
I'll ask her.

998
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,400
No, no, look.

999
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,520
I'll ask her when I'm good and ready, just not today.

1000
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,360
Thank you.

1001
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,520
The coffee girl is very cute.

1002
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,160
Mr. Higgins, large coffee, one sugar, no milk.

1003
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,000
Come in right up.

1004
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,840
Hey, Stephanie.

1005
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,680
She greeted both of them.

1006
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,520
Thank you, would like to ask you a question.

1007
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
What?

1008
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,600
What he's trying to say is,

1009
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,880
would you like to have dinner with him sometime?

1010
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,960
You know, a date.

1011
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,720
Oh, that's really sweet,

1012
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,840
but I think I may be a little too young for Frank.

1013
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,680
Come on, Steph, he's a good looking man

1014
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,120
under all that self-loathing.

1015
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,560
I swear, I've seen him in the shop.

1016
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,400
No!

1017
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,080
Oh, he winked, he winked.

1018
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,080
I thought we had a future together.

1019
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,600
It would never work, sweetheart.

1020
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,400
You couldn't handle this much wood.

1021
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,920
Here's your coffee.

1022
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,800
Welcome.

1023
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,640
They see all of our thumbnails.

1024
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,360
We're all groaning, all of our eyes bugged out.

1025
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,800
Can't believe you did that.

1026
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Oh, come on.

1027
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,040
You were never gonna do it.

1028
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,560
At least now you know she's not into old guys.

1029
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,640
I'm not old.

1030
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,360
Maybe in dog years you're not.

1031
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,200
That's funny.

1032
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,600
Well, one of us has to be.

1033
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,920
What is that supposed to mean?

1034
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,760
Are you kidding?

1035
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,360
Hey, buddy boy.

1036
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,080
The guy just put a tissue in his tip jar.

1037
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,200
What'd you say?

1038
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,120
Oh no, my friend here.

1039
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,280
He's not doing a street act, like he's just yelling.

1040
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,400
You think you can just throw your trash anywhere you want?

1041
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,240
They're just talking to each other.

1042
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,480
He's got a little bit of a temper,

1043
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,560
but he doesn't mean it.

1044
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,760
I sure as hell did mean it.

1045
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,640
Why are you apologizing to this idiot anyway?

1046
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,000
Would you stop calling him names?

1047
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
That's right, you better walk away.

1048
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,080
You're nothing but a lumbering oaf.

1049
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,640
A big, fat, dim-witted jackass.

1050
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,280
Handsome blue collar man.

1051
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,320
Off screen punch.

1052
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,760
Oh, now he has a black eye.

1053
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,520
It's got a very indie film poster black eye.

1054
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,600
Okay, so I'll zoom a little bit here.

1055
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,440
Oh, please.

1056
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,280
Okay.

1057
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,080
Come on, that guy was an asshole.

1058
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,680
I only, by the way, zoomed 30 seconds.

1059
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,520
Zoom more.

1060
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,680
Stephanie, well, we gave it our best shot.

1061
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,920
No, no, no, you need to see this.

1062
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,120
You need to see this play out in real time.

1063
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,520
Why don't you take a picture, baby?

1064
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,360
Aw.

1065
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,400
He lit it.

1066
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,240
We're in his apartment.

1067
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,080
His apartment's creepy.

1068
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,520
We have to describe this for the audience.

1069
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,200
His apartment's very creepy.

1070
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,440
He just laid the puppet down.

1071
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,960
He's taking his jacket off.

1072
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,120
It's like it's a hotel room,

1073
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,360
but they have a workbench in there,

1074
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,760
like Geppetto's workbench.

1075
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,600
Yeah.

1076
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,480
It's like he made the puppet himself.

1077
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,360
You have to stop doing this. Right.

1078
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,840
Ooh. He came to life.

1079
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,680
You know what?

1080
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,520
He's moving.

1081
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,840
I'm tired of you telling me what to do all the time.

1082
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,160
I'm not your puppet.

1083
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,360
Okay, I walked into that one.

1084
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,120
But seriously, Frank,

1085
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,520
maybe the black eye is the best thing for you.

1086
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,480
He's Frank again.

1087
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,440
When are you gonna wake up

1088
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,480
and realize we're going nowhere?

1089
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,920
We've got to move around the corner

1090
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,880
and really work a crowd.

1091
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,880
We're not ready.

1092
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,840
We've been in the same spot for three years.

1093
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,680
When are we gonna be ready?

1094
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,480
Three years.

1095
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,880
Besides, there's already an act over there.

1096
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,720
Francis and Bornstein? Hacks!

1097
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,600
Our act spins circles around theirs.

1098
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,560
Look, I'm out there every day telling jokes,

1099
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,720
trying to put on a show,

1100
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,720
but what are you doing? For who?

1101
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,560
Nothing.

1102
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,600
You can't even talk to a girl.

1103
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,440
I gotta do it for you. Stop talking.

1104
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,360
I do not need you to lecture me.

1105
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,120
Hey, I'm just telling you the truth.

1106
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,840
One day you're gonna wake up and realize it's too late.

1107
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,960
You had your chance.

1108
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,800
Go to a mall.

1109
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,320
Go to Third Street Domino.

1110
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,160
Talking.

1111
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,160
I hope you're ready for that. Stop!

1112
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,000
I love when he screams.

1113
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,720
I for one can't wait to meet Francis and Bornstein.

1114
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,720
That was the worst one.

1115
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1116
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,200
2012, the year of the shorts.

1117
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,680
Everyone say your favorite at the same time.

1118
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,600
Spirit of a Denture Envelope and what was that one called?

1119
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,720
Ventriloquist.

1120
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,680
Everyone yell your favorite.

1121
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,400
One, two, three.

1122
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,240
Ventriloquist.

1123
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,880
Spirit of a Denture Envelope.

1124
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,240
I'm the only one who voted Spirit of a Denture.

1125
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,200
Only one who did Envelope.

1126
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,200
Oh man.

1127
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,120
Or Envelope.

1128
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,040
There is something called Inseparable from 2011,

1129
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,200
starring Kevin Spacey.

1130
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,600
That's okay.

1131
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,600
Yeah, I'm good.

1132
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,040
All right, fair enough.

1133
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,360
We have to vote these first.

1134
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,280
Those are my major and minors.

1135
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,120
Major number one.

1136
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,600
Great job.

1137
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,840
It's a major and minor.

1138
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,160
You should, it's majors and minors

1139
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,360
that your parents would be very proud of.

1140
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,160
I think all of ours would be.

1141
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,120
More than my communications degree

1142
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,720
with a minor in Cinema Studies.

1143
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:46,160
That's a degree Spacey would probably have.

1144
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,000
Probably more than a.

1145
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,840
That's true.

1146
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,000
I mean, his cinema skills are off the charts.

1147
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,280
Does that, as we will see, I believe, in Jason's major.

1148
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,280
Oh yeah, is it my turn?

1149
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,800
Yeah.

1150
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,000
Okay, so my major,

1151
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,080
my major is the bulk of what I have.

1152
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:10,080
I watched the 2004 Kevin Spacey starring,

1153
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,120
directed by, and co-written by film Beyond the Sea,

1154
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,880
which is a biopic about the life

1155
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,880
of the singer Bobby Darin, who sang Splish Splash,

1156
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,960
I Was Taken a Bath, and Set the World on Fire.

1157
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:33,120
Now, this movie has intrigued me for years and years

1158
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,600
because this is what he spent his Oscar Goodwill on.

1159
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,600
He won a best supporting Oscar for Usual Suspects, right?

1160
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,880
Is that how it went?

1161
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,840
And then he won best actor for American Beauty.

1162
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,280
So he took all his American Beauty Goodwill

1163
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,280
and was like, I wanna make a movie

1164
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,560
about the life of Bobby Darin,

1165
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,440
and I wanna play Bobby Darin.

1166
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,120
The only issue was, in the early 2000s,

1167
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,960
when this movie was being made and coming out,

1168
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,440
Kevin Spacey was 43, and Bobby Darin,

1169
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,400
at the height of his success, was about 22.

1170
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,920
And Bobby Darin also noticeably died at 37.

1171
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,760
And...

1172
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,160
And...

1173
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,000
Noticeably?

1174
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Noticeably died because for that entire arc,

1175
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,120
Kevin Spacey remains 43.

1176
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,960
This movie also features Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee,

1177
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,160
the popular star of the time, who was married to Bobby Darin.

1178
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,480
Kate Bosworth was playing Sandra Dee.

1179
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,480
Kate Bosworth was 21, while Kevin Spacey, again, was 43.

1180
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,280
Oh, oh.

1181
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,120
God.

1182
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,120
Now, this is 2000, probably shot in 2003, came out in 2004.

1183
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,240
So not a lot of CGI Irishman Dee aging.

1184
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,520
It's just kind of like, he just does.

1185
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,760
They just don't acknowledge that Kevin Spacey

1186
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,480
is playing a character 20 years younger than him.

1187
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,320
And I gotta say, Martin Short did a better job

1188
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,680
playing Clifford, playing a child,

1189
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,480
as a man in his 30s and 40s,

1190
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,960
than Kevin Spacey as a 21, 22-year-old.

1191
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,960
But this is a star-studded, Bob Hoskins is in this movie,

1192
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,040
as Kevin Spacey's de facto father figure.

1193
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,760
John Goodman plays his talent manager.

1194
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,160
And I remember when this was coming out,

1195
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,600
because the coverage of it on Entertainment Tonight

1196
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,160
or whatever was like, and funny fact,

1197
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,160
40-year-old Kevin Spacey is playing 22-year-old Bobby Darin.

1198
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,320
They just thought it was very cute, but not very, very odd.

1199
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,840
And the movie is very odd,

1200
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,840
because it tries to do the thing of, it's a biography,

1201
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,480
but old Bobby Darin meets child Bobby Darin multiple times.

1202
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,920
And it also tries to do the movie within a movie thing,

1203
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,760
and it also tries to just be a straight, walk the line

1204
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,400
kind of musician biopic.

1205
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,240
And it doesn't succeed at any of them,

1206
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,520
because it's trying to do all of them.

1207
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,760
Yeah, that's right, it's meta,

1208
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,360
and there's parts of like, wait, wait,

1209
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,960
that's not how it went.

1210
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,760
Yes.

1211
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,120
And there's, I mean,

1212
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,120
and there is a large card at the end of the credits saying,

1213
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,280
now, some of this stuff was slightly fictionalized,

1214
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,160
and some of it out of order.

1215
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,520
They really went to lengths to say that.

1216
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,880
They also, the dedication at the end of it

1217
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,600
is just a screen that just says, to mother.

1218
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,440
Shabal.

1219
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,920
That's weird.

1220
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,280
He called his mother mother in his Oscar acceptance speech

1221
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,560
for American Beauty too.

1222
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,840
He says like, mother, I don't care what anyone says.

1223
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,800
I will always invite you to award shows.

1224
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,920
It's very, it's like a, it's a gesture of love

1225
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,440
that he's doing with a lot of pointing,

1226
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,440
and it's the most aggressive love of a mother

1227
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,960
I've ever seen.

1228
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,480
Yeah, and that Oscar speech comes up in my mind,

1229
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,680
or I just rewatched the Christmas videos a bunch of times,

1230
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,720
and then I found some weird just factoids,

1231
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,680
and the Oscar speech has a clue in it

1232
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,440
that we all should have seen.

1233
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,280
Okay.

1234
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,800
It's a very Norman Bates way to refer to your mother.

1235
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,280
Yeah, there's a lot of Norman Bates-esque stuff

1236
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,240
that didn't crystallize until like perspective,

1237
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,800
until looking back.

1238
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,960
He kind of looks like Norman a little.

1239
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,480
Yeah, and mine, he has when he's young, handsome.

1240
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,640
Oh, and in your photo background, he looks exactly like,

1241
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,560
I wouldn't, you think he was in consideration

1242
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,080
for shot for shot remake, Psycho?

1243
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,000
He must've been.

1244
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,920
Oh, that's, he had to have been.

1245
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,760
Yeah.

1246
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,360
He wanted to write it though.

1247
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,480
He wanted Norman Bates to sing

1248
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,080
and do an impression of Kevin Christopher Walken.

1249
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,480
Mother.

1250
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,520
Jason, Jason, you want me to play the clip here?

1251
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,240
Yeah, can you, there's a minute long clip

1252
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,400
with a woman in a floral dress.

1253
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,960
I hope that's the first one.

1254
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,800
Is the image?

1255
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,640
Yes.

1256
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,840
Oh yeah.

1257
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,680
Yeah, play that one.

1258
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Okay, so this is in, very early in the movie.

1259
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,120
So Bobby Darin's mother was a former vaudeville performer

1260
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,640
and she's very encouraging.

1261
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,880
Young Bobby Darin had, I believe it is rheumatic fever.

1262
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,440
He had a heart condition

1263
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,720
and they didn't think he'd live past 10,

1264
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,960
but he did make it to 37.

1265
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,960
And that condition comes up a lot early in the movie.

1266
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,720
Halfway through the movie at one point,

1267
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,120
he mentions he's a little short of breath

1268
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,000
and then he just gets very ill very quickly

1269
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,040
towards the end of the movie.

1270
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,360
But, so this is like a musical number

1271
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,840
right from the top of the movie.

1272
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,640
And I think you'll get a good idea

1273
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,480
of the kind of nonsense this is.

1274
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,320
Mike, go ahead.

1275
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,160
Okay.

1276
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,640
His mom is dancing for little Bobby.

1277
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,720
Yeah.

1278
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,240
And he looks kind of horny.

1279
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,400
Okay, he just did Al Jolson mama stuff on his knee.

1280
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,520
And then he became old.

1281
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,440
Then he morphed from a child into Kevin Spacey.

1282
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,120
Yeah.

1283
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,480
He's now doing the widest leg dancing I've ever seen.

1284
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,400
Hoskins threw him a suitcase.

1285
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,040
I'm splitting Jack.

1286
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,320
Oh, he's singing River Stay Away from my Door.

1287
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,320
Oh, that's what it is?

1288
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,880
Yeah. Yeah.

1289
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,760
That's great.

1290
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,400
When this, I re-listened to how he stumbled on this

1291
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,640
during the downtown Disney ordeal.

1292
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,080
And I think this was the impetus

1293
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,440
because I was talking about getting a lot of dread

1294
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,160
from watching movies while high

1295
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,880
and just flashing to the miserable production of them

1296
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,020
instead of enjoying the movie.

1297
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,880
And Eva, you said you saw this.

1298
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,240
It was that number.

1299
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:53,920
That's the number I was thinking of.

1300
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,640
Yeah, that was, I re-round that number dozens of times

1301
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,480
when I saw it.

1302
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,240
I was like, this is so awful.

1303
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,960
And everyone had to pretend to be on board with it

1304
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,960
and tell him he was good kicking.

1305
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,320
He's good at kicking high.

1306
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,760
The little kid going,

1307
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,440
I'd settle for some Al Jolson mama.

1308
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,040
I hate it so much.

1309
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,480
It's so bad.

1310
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,320
Oh God.

1311
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,560
All the 40s costumes or whatever.

1312
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,040
Like somebody having to sweat it

1313
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:27,040
and get like old wardrobe for director Kevin Spacey,

1314
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,280
who I'm sure was a pain about various.

1315
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,260
No, no, that is not a 1941 green.

1316
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,880
They wouldn't have done that kind of olive, I remember.

1317
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,880
So they don't focus a lot on him.

1318
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,680
The sequences of Bobby Darin struggling

1319
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,000
until his first TV appearance,

1320
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,800
it's probably about two minutes in the movie.

1321
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,200
Like he plays a shitty club on Staten Island

1322
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,880
and oh God, what does he sing?

1323
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,120
He sings like,

1324
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,700
pick a tale of cotton that like jump down,

1325
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,320
turn around, pick a tale of cotton.

1326
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,360
It's all these weird spirituals.

1327
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,960
Yeah.

1328
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,200
There is a moment where he is like,

1329
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,840
because Bobby Darin is the stage name,

1330
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,680
the way he comes up with it is he goes with Bobby

1331
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,100
and then he gets the idea for Darin

1332
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:30,460
from a Chinese restaurants neon sign that says Mandarin,

1333
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,600
but the first part of the word is burned out.

1334
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,440
Yeah.

1335
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,220
Is that real?

1336
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,040
Yeah.

1337
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,920
Yeah, is that real?

1338
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,960
I have no idea.

1339
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,520
It's not.

1340
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,360
He made it up.

1341
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,720
It doesn't seem like,

1342
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,120
it very much felt like you're flying alone solo,

1343
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:54,120
on solo, like it is right on that level.

1344
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,840
So Bobby starts to have some success

1345
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,960
and he gets a lot of success singing rock and roll,

1346
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,240
specifically the song that he writes very quickly,

1347
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,840
he co-writes called Splish Splash.

1348
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,200
Splish Splash, I was taking a bath.

1349
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,600
Yay.

1350
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,240
The clip of that is upsetting, but I did not record it,

1351
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,000
but him, it's like him walking down some stairs

1352
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,400
and singing it on TV and just an audience of teenagers,

1353
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,160
it's a bandstand audience, it's American bandstand,

1354
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,720
an audience of teenagers lose their mind at this

1355
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,320
and then his family is watching at home and someone says,

1356
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,640
he's gonna be the biggest star in showbiz.

1357
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,400
It's a super closeup and he kind of whips to the camera

1358
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,120
and like kind of with a wink and a smile says,

1359
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,000
Bing, bang, I saw the whole gang.

1360
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,880
So disturbing.

1361
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,000
Yeah, there's a lot of pre-House of Cards

1362
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,480
looking right in the camera in this movie.

1363
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,360
He's got a lot of like jamming his hands

1364
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,640
in his pockets always too,

1365
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,440
isn't that kind of his Bobby move?

1366
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,800
Yeah, and he does a lot of like hands business

1367
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,200
when he's singing.

1368
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,320
And I don't know if that's his choice or Bobby Darin's choice.

1369
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,920
We'll certainly discuss this in my segment as well,

1370
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,040
but what do we think of his singing?

1371
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,160
I feel like it's not straight up horrible,

1372
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,760
but for him to be so heavily featured as a singer

1373
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,720
constantly in so many forums,

1374
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,080
he's just kind of too nasally, I think.

1375
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,840
He couldn't win karaoke night, like he's not that good.

1376
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,720
He's fine, he's on key, but it's like,

1377
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,400
it's completely weird that he keeps making people

1378
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,240
listen to him sing.

1379
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,480
It's like Billy Crystal singing.

1380
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,320
It's like-

1381
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,480
I would argue Billy Crystal,

1382
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,880
Billy Crystal has more personality in his singing though.

1383
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,120
His singing, his spacey singing is very like colorless.

1384
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:56,960
Thin.

1385
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,800
Thin, yes.

1386
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,880
Good word, yeah.

1387
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,120
At least Billy's putting on a little bit of a,

1388
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,320
like a voice.

1389
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,160
Yeah.

1390
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,520
It should have been like one scene in something

1391
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,960
where he sings and you're surprised

1392
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,560
that he's a little bit good, not like full musical film,

1393
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,280
host the Tonys, music front to back,

1394
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,440
constant singing at events and functions everywhere.

1395
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,360
But like we've established he thinks he's good at everything.

1396
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,800
I mean, he's a good ventriloquist.

1397
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,360
He's a guitar player, he's a singer, he's a dancer.

1398
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:31,600
There's nothing he can't do at like a C minus to C plus level.

1399
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,080
I might rate him higher when it comes to murdering.

1400
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,680
Well, that's-

1401
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,760
Allegedly, behind the paywall.

1402
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,080
Don't send this to anyone.

1403
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,920
Allegedly.

1404
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,480
There is, well, and Eva, I know you have some of these,

1405
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,480
but I've got an impression.

1406
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,080
He thinks he's very good at funny little impressions.

1407
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,640
Mike, can you pull up,

1408
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,280
there's a video that's about 30 seconds long,

1409
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,280
got John Goodman as the preview image.

1410
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,440
Are you seeing that?

1411
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,160
Or 13 seconds.

1412
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,320
13.

1413
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,600
All right, that's what I was, okay.

1414
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,320
Yes, I see that.

1415
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,600
So let's take a quick look at this.

1416
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,120
He's in a bowling shirt.

1417
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,640
Jerry Lewis?

1418
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,680
Yeah, he's kind of doing a Jerry Lewis, hey lady.

1419
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,560
This is a scene,

1420
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,680
because one of the points of conflict in this movie

1421
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,600
is that Bobby Deren started going bald early

1422
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,800
and was conflicted about wearing a toupee,

1423
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,040
and John Goodman, playing his manager,

1424
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,440
suggested he wear a hat.

1425
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,960
And he kind of wins the argument by going like,

1426
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,760
Sinatra wears a hat sometimes.

1427
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,640
And then Bobby does a funny little bit.

1428
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,800
He does a funny little Jerry Lewis to keep it light.

1429
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,560
Has he done, I think that Jerry Lewis,

1430
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,520
I have not seen this movie, I have not seen him do Jerry.

1431
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,520
I knew he did all the big,

1432
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,480
I knew he basically did all of Kevin Pollock's impressions.

1433
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,480
But I have not seen him do Jerry Lewis.

1434
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,920
Yeah, he does the impressions that are easy to do, yes.

1435
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,560
So another clip, as Bobby goes on,

1436
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,200
he has all these hits.

1437
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,640
He has a big hit with Splish Splash,

1438
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,320
but he doesn't just wanna do rock and roll for the kids.

1439
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,880
He wants to do the classics,

1440
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,120
the big band standards.

1441
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,800
And that actually works out.

1442
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,040
He does get very successful doing it.

1443
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,880
And he gets cast in a movie with Rock Hudson and Sandra Dee.

1444
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,760
Kate Bosworth plays Sandra Dee,

1445
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,320
and he very quickly is like,

1446
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,360
that's the woman I'm gonna marry,

1447
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:53,360
and pursues her very aggressively, in a creepy way.

1448
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,480
This is a little bit of creepiness.

1449
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,160
Mike, this clip is 17 seconds long.

1450
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,440
You can see it.

1451
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,040
Sandra Dee is sitting in a chair.

1452
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,200
I think it's this.

1453
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,160
Yeah, that's it.

1454
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,600
I give it a week, maybe less.

1455
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,600
Don't take that long for me to marry a kid.

1456
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,360
Mary, you're gonna send roses to the mother?

1457
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,000
Charlie, you always make sure the mama dog

1458
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,960
likes you before you go near her puppy.

1459
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,480
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1460
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,320
Ew.

1461
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,000
Can you just say that just for full clarity?

1462
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,520
You almost make sure the what?

1463
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,120
You always make sure the mama dog is taking care of first

1464
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,480
before you go for the puppy.

1465
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,760
Oh, no.

1466
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,640
Clues, so many clues.

1467
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,480
So many clues.

1468
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,480
And right at the end of that sentence,

1469
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,880
he looks dead in the camera.

1470
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,160
It's very quick.

1471
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,200
But he's sort of leaning back, strumming a guitar.

1472
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,280
He's strumming a guitar a lot in this movie,

1473
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,280
especially when Bobby Darin tries to do

1474
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,200
a folk singer turn towards the end of his life.

1475
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,640
In that bizarre where that's like this that's presented

1476
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,080
as this like highfalutin, and then he had his third act

1477
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,240
in which he addressed everything going on in this troubled

1478
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,640
nation we call America.

1479
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,880
And I'm like, I've never heard of this Bobby Darin protest.

1480
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,080
I barely know Bobby Darin.

1481
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,920
I mean, I guess a biopic can teach you about somebody.

1482
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,440
But I felt like this came out and fell on such deaf ears

1483
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,840
because like, who cares?

1484
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,400
And it doesn't really make the case of why you should care

1485
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,520
about Bobby Darin.

1486
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,800
Yeah.

1487
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,800
Yeah, I mean, to put this in perspective,

1488
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,680
this is coming out in 2004.

1489
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,160
And I think people knew Beyond the Sea.

1490
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,000
People knew Splish Splash, kind of radio,

1491
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,600
kind of like wedding standards, I guess, you know.

1492
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,520
But here are some of the top songs of 2004.

1493
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,320
Yeah, by Usher and Lil Jon and Ludacris.

1494
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,240
Burn by Usher.

1495
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,560
This Love by Maroon 5.

1496
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,840
The Reason by Huba Stank.

1497
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,640
Hey Ya by OutKast.

1498
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,520
I think maybe that might've been 2003 and still popular.

1499
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,080
And Lean Back by Terror Squad.

1500
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:12,080
So the young people not really interested in Bobby Darin,

1501
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,600
but he was a multifaceted performer, historical figure.

1502
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,160
And Mike, if you can pull up this last clip,

1503
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:25,160
Bobby Darin was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor role.

1504
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,880
And he lost to Melvin Douglas.

1505
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,680
But this is Kevin Spacey doing the part

1506
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,240
that Bobby Darin was nominated for an Oscar for.

1507
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,440
Okay, quiet on the set.

1508
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,360
And rolling.

1509
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,240
Speed.

1510
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:46,320
And action, Bobby.

1511
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,760
Okay, Big Jim, you go on.

1512
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,680
You get this two big corn feeder off the ground, huh?

1513
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,240
He's on a psychiatrist's kind of couch.

1514
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,520
I mean, one with real bills on them, it won't quit.

1515
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,360
You know what I mean?

1516
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,120
I'm talking about some real balloon smugglers.

1517
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:03,960
You know what I mean?

1518
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,800
Jesus.

1519
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:07,720
We got hit.

1520
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,320
Buck, Buck, we're going down.

1521
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,240
Oh Jesus, we're gonna crash.

1522
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,080
I gotta get out, I gotta use the escape hatch.

1523
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,720
Oh, come on, oh no, he doesn't have a head.

1524
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:24,720
Oh no, please, can't you fix it the way he was before?

1525
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,380
Oh, that's amazing.

1526
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,000
Fantastic.

1527
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,240
That's amazing.

1528
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,760
Fantastic.

1529
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,840
And that was so, I believe he was being,

1530
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,400
that was like hypnotherapy,

1531
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,240
and he was recalling war memories.

1532
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,840
And Kevin Spacey kind of playing it

1533
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,520
like it was a Zucker Brothers movie,

1534
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,600
like an Oscar, like a fake Oscar nominated movie

1535
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,680
where a character is screaming,

1536
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,300
like nobody never told me nothing.

1537
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:02,560
No one ever gave me nothing, I did it all on my own.

1538
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,920
But it is so hammy.

1539
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:09,040
Please, please, what is it that you're waiting for?

1540
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,000
He doesn't have a head.

1541
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
He doesn't have a head.

1542
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,160
I forget what the movie is called,

1543
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,080
that popular, it actually was in and was nominated for.

1544
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,720
But it truly seems like, if you made that movie now,

1545
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,280
the tagline would definitely be like,

1546
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,400
the real war was at home.

1547
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,360
Jason, can I present a theory?

1548
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,320
I feel like maybe the reason he wanted to make this movie

1549
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:39,400
is because he thinks he's like, it's the most,

1550
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,120
he just sees himself as like having a lot in common

1551
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:46,440
with Bobby Darin, obsession with an overbearing mother,

1552
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:52,400
predatory pervert, bald early,

1553
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,000
nominated for an Oscar for supporting actor.

1554
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,600
I think so, I think that's right,

1555
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,080
because there's a big hero moment

1556
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,080
where he finally gets to play the Copa.

1557
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,120
Bobby Darin just wants to play the Copacabana nightclub.

1558
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,080
That's where all the real singers play, baby.

1559
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:17,080
And Bobby stands up for having a black comic open for him.

1560
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,480
The very racist owner of the Copos,

1561
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,120
like, well, I don't know, I don't know about this.

1562
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,280
And Bobby Darin is a hero,

1563
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,560
and he pushes for it and makes it happen.

1564
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,520
He also is very chivalrous.

1565
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,480
On the wedding night between Bobby and Sandra Dee,

1566
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:39,080
she's very nervous about wedding night business.

1567
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,160
And he runs in with a sword.

1568
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,720
First off, she's sobbing, she's crying,

1569
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,480
and he runs in with a giant broadsword.

1570
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,960
And he's like, no, no, no, no,

1571
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,080
don't be afraid of the giant sword.

1572
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:54,040
And tells the story about how one of the knights

1573
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,800
of the round table laid down a sword on a bed

1574
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,640
and told Guinevere that I won't cross this sword,

1575
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,760
only you can cross this sword.

1576
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,840
So he's a gentleman who respects consent.

1577
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:14,840
So clearly a lot fictionalized in this movie

1578
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,280
as far as Kevin Spacey is concerned.

1579
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:24,040
The musical numbers continue and get weirder and weirder.

1580
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,760
It ends with a big musical number with adult Bobby Darin

1581
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,000
and young Bobby Darin doing a big tap dance number.

1582
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,800
Among that stuff, there is a shot of Bobby Darin

1583
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,160
eventually has a child.

1584
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,520
There's a shot of him petting the child's head

1585
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,320
and then it comes to a long zoom in shot of Bobby Darin

1586
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,040
eating a big bowl of cereal.

1587
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:55,040
And the third act, Scott, as you mentioned,

1588
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,880
he tries to be like a singer songwriter,

1589
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,560
like a Bobby Darin, and Bobby Darin,

1590
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,320
Bob Dylan sort of acoustic guitar player

1591
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,200
and no one is interested.

1592
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,400
But then he does one Las Vegas residency

1593
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,880
where he sings a folk song about peace and freedom,

1594
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,120
but he's got a big gospel choir and a big band

1595
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,000
and he's wearing a tuxedo and everyone's clapping along

1596
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,320
and everyone likes it.

1597
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,440
And then he promptly dies.

1598
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,760
And that is how the movie ends.

1599
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,600
The next day?

1600
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,920
Pretty much the next day.

1601
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,760
Oh, and then the dream sequence tap number

1602
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,040
with young and old Bobby happens.

1603
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,840
That's what I hope heaven is for me

1604
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,480
is that I get to dance with my child self.

1605
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,920
Well, everyone's dream.

1606
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,520
It pretty much just rips off all that jazz

1607
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:55,520
of like young and old, like, oh, it's a memory.

1608
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,160
So here's, you're good.

1609
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,520
Your life's work is good.

1610
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,000
You were a good man.

1611
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,800
You weren't sex past.

1612
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,640
You were good.

1613
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,200
I'm looking at IMDB and on the trivia,

1614
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,560
it says many writers have requested WGA

1615
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,800
not to associate them with credits for the screenplay.

1616
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,720
Some of them include Tom.

1617
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,520
Some of them include Tom Epperson and James Tobeck.

1618
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,640
What?

1619
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,480
Tobeck?

1620
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,320
What?

1621
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,720
If you don't remember, Tobeck was one of the worst

1622
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,120
of the Me Too Men.

1623
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,040
You're kidding.

1624
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,680
Whoa.

1625
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,520
That's what it says on here.

1626
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,760
I wanna be associated with this movie.

1627
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,120
With that creep, with that spicy.

1628
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,520
I got standards.

1629
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,720
Oh, I forgot about one little bit of movie magic.

1630
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:48,720
So there's an occasional mention of a watch.

1631
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,760
Like Bobby gets a watch and it's a big deal

1632
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,920
that he gets a nice watch.

1633
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,440
And he like, he gets it as a kid

1634
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,960
and the, you know, Bob Hoskins, I think it was,

1635
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,880
or the doctor is like, you're gonna wear this when,

1636
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,320
you're gonna be old enough to wear this watch.

1637
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,280
You're gonna live.

1638
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,240
And then towards the end of the movie, it's like,

1639
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,640
uh-oh, my watch has stopped.

1640
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,080
And then right at the end of musical number sequence,

1641
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,720
the kid throws the watch to Kevin Spacey

1642
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:21,880
and in the air, it morphs into a golden microphone

1643
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,000
and Bobby Darin catches it and sings us one last tune.

1644
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,800
This movie's great.

1645
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,640
Wow.

1646
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,480
Yeah.

1647
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,360
It's got morphing.

1648
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,000
My life story is told with morphs one day.

1649
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,760
Yikes.

1650
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:47,200
So, yeah, so that's, I mean, my other little stuff is

1651
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,320
I started reading, like I said,

1652
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,600
I watched the Christmas threads again

1653
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,760
and I went looking for like a deconstructed,

1654
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,800
like an article deconstructing them or a video deconstructing.

1655
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,120
Because there's hidden messages.

1656
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,880
We think like there's like these contain weird,

1657
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,880
here's what he's trying to say about the Royals or whatever.

1658
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,000
Yeah.

1659
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,040
Like in the movie Envelope.

1660
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:09,880
Yeah.

1661
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,720
Yes, like in Envelope.

1662
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,880
There's no message, it's just the Envelope.

1663
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,480
I am no spy.

1664
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,160
I told you, I teach.

1665
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:22,520
So I don't know if you guys wanna wait towards the end

1666
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,600
to get your stuff out and then talk about the Christmas threats.

1667
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,240
But I have some little oddball stuff that as I kept,

1668
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,440
I started reading articles,

1669
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,840
there had been a bunch of articles in the Atlantic

1670
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,800
about his abuse of power.

1671
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,560
So I've just got some weird little tidbits from those.

1672
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:44,560
One, as you know, some of the accusers have passed away

1673
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,640
but he's got a long way to go

1674
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,600
because apparently there's been 30 accusations

1675
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,760
against Kevin Spacey.

1676
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,040
I did not know the number was that high.

1677
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,680
The Spacey appears in the Epstein flight logs as we all know.

1678
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,840
And the handwritten notes for one of the flights says,

1679
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,680
Kevin Spacey, President Bill Clinton,

1680
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,480
J.E. Jeffrey Epstein,

1681
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,800
G.M. Ghislaine Maxwell,

1682
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,400
and Chris Tucker, Chris Tucker popping in there at the end.

1683
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,240
That's a weird one.

1684
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,040
Yeah, I feel like not enough has been said about that.

1685
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,880
Very bizarre. That's wild.

1686
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,720
Yeah.

1687
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,560
Yeah, oh, go ahead.

1688
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,400
Oh, sorry.

1689
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,240
No, no, no.

1690
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,360
So a chunk of his Oscar speech,

1691
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:37,000
that should have been a big, big red flag

1692
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,240
that I don't think people really flagged until later.

1693
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,080
He said this quote as he was accepting

1694
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,360
his best actor award.

1695
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,240
We got to see all of his worst qualities

1696
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,080
and we still grew to love him.

1697
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,520
This is his character from American Beauty.

1698
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,680
This movie to me is all about how any single act

1699
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:01,120
from any single person put out of context is damnable.

1700
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,400
So there's that.

1701
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,200
And then just after, so this movie came out in 2004,

1702
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:15,680
pretty much bombed, did not make a blip.

1703
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,640
And then from 2004 to 2015,

1704
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,200
Spacey sort of retreated and was the artistic director

1705
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,440
of the old Vic Theater in London

1706
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,760
and was just a little tyrant,

1707
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,360
was just a little tyrant of the theater.

1708
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,720
Would pop up for a movie every now and then.

1709
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:39,720
Yeah, he played Lex Luthor in the 2000s

1710
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,480
in Superman Returns. In a perfect film, yes.

1711
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,280
A perfect, normal Brian Singer directed film.

1712
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,280
God, he's Singer and Clinton and Epstein

1713
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,320
and he hit them all.

1714
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,040
He's the type of thing, all of them.

1715
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,120
I can't not quickly talk about the Funny or Die video

1716
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,600
where he has a little scene with Clinton,

1717
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,200
where it's all a video made by the Clinton Foundation

1718
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,080
and it's about a bunch of celebrities all brainstorming.

1719
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,360
I've watched this video 25 times

1720
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,920
and I don't know what the point of it is,

1721
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,680
but then at the end they get a call from Clinton,

1722
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:19,800
I'm just checking in on you, my little celebrity friends.

1723
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,440
And then like, that's weird.

1724
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,160
Why does Clinton sound so bizarre

1725
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,680
and not like Clinton at all?

1726
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,640
And then it cuts to the other end of the phone

1727
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,360
and it's Kevin Spacey and he's screwing around.

1728
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:33,640
He's pretending for Ted Danson and Ben Stiller

1729
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:37,560
that he's Clinton, but then the real Clinton walks in

1730
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,640
and they have- Oh my God.

1731
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,040
You ever seen this? No.

1732
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,240
It's not scrubbed, it's definitely around.

1733
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:49,000
And yeah, so yeah, he's on the phone

1734
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,840
and then he gets interrupted, real Clinton walks in.

1735
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,360
Now, Kevin, what did I tell you about making prank calls?

1736
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,320
Not to do it, not to do it without me.

1737
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,440
And then they like smile at each other.

1738
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,920
Yeah, all right.

1739
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:06,880
And then over the Clinton Foundation logo,

1740
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,520
Jack Black sings a song about the Clinton Foundation.

1741
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,720
The Clinton Foundation fighting global issues.

1742
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,400
He's like trying to put his funny Jack Black stank

1743
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,040
on like the real mission statement

1744
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,640
of the Clinton Foundation.

1745
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,000
Doesn't he say like with business oriented solutions?

1746
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,800
You're right, I left out the most important part.

1747
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,160
Fighting global issues with business oriented solutions.

1748
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,440
He tries to make fun and Jack Black-ish.

1749
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,400
It's one of the strangest videos to watch today.

1750
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,560
And the smile that Spacey and Clinton smile at each other

1751
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,240
is just the most like lascivious squinty.

1752
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,720
It's truly strange.

1753
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,040
One of the funnier, it's one of the immoral.

1754
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,520
Can I just jump in with something really fast?

1755
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,360
Please, please.

1756
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,180
Because you said that.

1757
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:51,680
This is just something from,

1758
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:58,320
this is from my major, but it's just, it applies.

1759
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,680
Can you guys see this?

1760
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,520
Yes.

1761
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,920
Oh, it says impressions.mp4.

1762
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,760
Yeah.

1763
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,560
I just started doing Bill Clinton.

1764
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,840
I have to listen to a lot of his stuff

1765
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,840
because there's a quality he has.

1766
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,680
It's so good.

1767
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,260
So good.

1768
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,760
Yeah, so that's a lesson.

1769
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,880
And the crew busts up.

1770
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,640
I remember like they're all like,

1771
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,520
oh, they can't hold it back.

1772
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,880
He's so good.

1773
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,840
I have one last thing that I just kind of made notes floor

1774
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,680
on the fly because we talked about Superman returns,

1775
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:38,000
which gets us from Kevin Spacey to Bryan Singer

1776
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,880
and gets us to another project we've addressed on the show,

1777
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,480
but very briefly, because there's only so much about it

1778
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,960
out there, mostly about how it stalled, it stalled,

1779
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,440
and then it fell apart, which is Broadway 4D.

1780
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,600
And this is one of the legit,

1781
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,120
the actual direct theme park connections for this episode

1782
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:59,240
because Broadway 4D was a 3D movie that was going to be

1783
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:03,520
in a restored theater with like a special effects,

1784
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,080
like 4D movie kind of special effects.

1785
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,440
And it was co-directed by Bryan Singer and Gary Goddard.

1786
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,800
No, no, no, no.

1787
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:13,640
That's right.

1788
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,480
Goddard's another, if you don't remember,

1789
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,080
he's in the list.

1790
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,020
God, always, always.

1791
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,200
Who's another creep?

1792
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,260
Who's another sex pest?

1793
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,840
Much like Kevin Spacey,

1794
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,720
but this Broadway 4D had big names in it.

1795
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,880
They had Hugh Jackman was going to be in it.

1796
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,120
And I believe hosting it.

1797
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,480
They shot a sequence where Christina Aguilera sings,

1798
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,800
don't cry for me, Argentina.

1799
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,240
And it's just stuck in, it's just stuck in hell now.

1800
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:44,120
It will just probably never be seen or maybe leaked one day.

1801
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:44,960
Oh wow.

1802
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,960
Or maybe parts of it are out there.

1803
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,360
I haven't tried to find it.

1804
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,120
It's like the day the clown cried,

1805
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,280
like everyone has to die for us to see it.

1806
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,360
Why don't we have it?

1807
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,440
It should have, we should have got that

1808
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,040
the second Jerry Lewis died, by the way.

1809
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:57,880
Yeah, why don't we have it with you?

1810
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,360
What is the holdup on that?

1811
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,200
Yeah.

1812
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,480
Now put it on Disney plus.

1813
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,240
Put it up there.

1814
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,720
All content anywhere needs to be released in virus times.

1815
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,640
We're all under the guise of boredom.

1816
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,160
Put all content is free and out.

1817
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,280
Yeah.

1818
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,800
A double feature of Artemis foul

1819
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,000
and the day the clown died.

1820
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,640
Wait, sorry.

1821
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,480
What's up with Broadway 4D?

1822
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,760
Wait, what does Spacey do in it?

1823
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,600
Oh, nothing.

1824
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,120
It was just the singer,

1825
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,120
Spacey to Goddard connection.

1826
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:31,960
Oh, okay, okay.

1827
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,600
And also their crimes.

1828
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,280
Their crimes they also have in common.

1829
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,760
So Kevin Spacey is not in Broadway 4D?

1830
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,360
He's shockingly not in Broadway 4D.

1831
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,200
I know.

1832
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,040
It just works.

1833
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,560
It was just a Spacey to singer to Gary Goddard.

1834
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,880
That sounds the most like waiting for Spacey to be in it.

1835
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,440
I did hear, I dated a sound designer

1836
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,600
who worked on the Superman movies

1837
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,280
and who said that Spacey and singer

1838
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,560
had a spectacular falling out

1839
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,840
on the last time they worked together.

1840
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,960
I think it makes sense that maybe they didn't,

1841
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:06,920
they weren't friends anymore.

1842
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,800
And that's why he wasn't allowed to be in it

1843
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,480
for Broadway 4D.

1844
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,360
Yeah. Oh, interesting.

1845
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,560
They had different ideas

1846
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,200
about like interior design of sex planes.

1847
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,800
One preferred cooler colors than one was warmer.

1848
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,640
And you can't reconcile that.

1849
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,480
Yeah.

1850
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,560
Are we up to wait?

1851
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,880
We discussed a new strategy.

1852
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,040
I think, Eva, do you want to jump in?

1853
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,040
I think I'm going to go next

1854
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,760
and Scott's going to close it out.

1855
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,600
Because I think that'll actually be-

1856
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,960
Oh boy, pressure's on.

1857
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,800
Yeah.

1858
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:36,880
Well, Kevin's going to close.

1859
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,560
I have faith in Kevin.

1860
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,120
He'll bring it home.

1861
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,760
So should I jump in?

1862
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1863
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,800
So I'm going to start with my minor,

1864
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,960
which is the 2000 drama,

1865
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,000
Pay It Forward,

1866
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,240
and just a specific monologue in that movie.

1867
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,520
So for anyone who doesn't know,

1868
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,560
Pay It Forward 2000,

1869
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,880
it was directed by Mimi Leder.

1870
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,000
It was based on a story

1871
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,120
from the Chicken Soup for the Soul book.

1872
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,120
And it starred three people who within the last few years

1873
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,400
have been nominated for or won an Oscar,

1874
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,840
Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and Hailey Joel Osment.

1875
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,840
And basically it takes place in Las Vegas.

1876
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:21,160
Hailey Joel Osment is this kind of a depressed tween.

1877
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:25,400
His mom is hard working, hard scrapple, Helen Hunt.

1878
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:28,360
And his teacher is Kevin Spacey,

1879
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,880
who is a stern kind of civics teacher

1880
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,600
with a horrible burn covering most of his body

1881
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,800
and part of his face.

1882
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,440
In the plot to Pay It Forward,

1883
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,760
Kevin Spacey puts a, like just the assignment to the class

1884
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,880
is like, you need to do something to change the world.

1885
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,760
So Hailey Joel Osment invents Paying It Forward,

1886
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:51,920
and it works and it sort of sweeps the nation,

1887
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,120
but he doesn't know for a while.

1888
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,040
So it's just, everyone just dealing with like

1889
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,720
their household kind of drama stuff.

1890
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,480
Helen Hunt is kind of like,

1891
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,760
Kevin Spacey kind of into each other,

1892
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,920
and then they have sex.

1893
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,520
And then Helen Hunt's husband,

1894
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,040
John Bon Jovi comes back, her abusive husband.

1895
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,520
What? I didn't know that one.

1896
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,360
Yeah.

1897
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,680
And so she kind of breaks up with Kevin Spacey.

1898
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,720
But Kevin Spacey knows that this is a bad scene

1899
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:23,440
because, I'm gonna share this video,

1900
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:28,440
because his own stepfather is, it turns out,

1901
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:31,720
a very problematic person in his life.

1902
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:35,440
So he's telling the story about like what happened to him

1903
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,800
to Helen Hunt.

1904
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:41,280
And I'll just play, this is this monologue

1905
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,040
that I've thought about ever since I saw it

1906
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,480
in the theater in 2000.

1907
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,320
So basically in the story,

1908
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,400
Kevin Spacey's like, ask me what happened.

1909
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,960
And she's like, what happened?

1910
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:51,840
Cause she's never asked.

1911
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,920
He's like, my stepdad was beating my mom.

1912
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,400
I ran away.

1913
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:00,600
I came back one night to try to get my mom to leave him

1914
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,280
cause he would abuse her, but not me.

1915
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:03,560
And then this is the monologue.

1916
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,320
I'm in front of the house.

1917
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,320
I'm telling her, I'm screaming for her to come out.

1918
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:10,120
I'm telling her she doesn't have to take it anymore.

1919
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:10,960
She really doesn't.

1920
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,600
She can come with me now.

1921
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,760
I don't even see it coming.

1922
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,640
He hits me in the side of the head with a two by four

1923
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,520
and I'm bleeding from my ear.

1924
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,480
And then he's dragging me.

1925
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,640
He's dragging me behind the house and into the garage.

1926
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,640
And then he's gone a minute, five minutes, I don't know.

1927
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,680
And then he's back and he's wetting me down.

1928
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,680
He's wetting me down and I don't understand.

1929
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:32,160
I don't understand why water should smell so bad.

1930
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,080
I don't understand.

1931
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,040
Then I see it.

1932
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:42,960
I see this

1933
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,760
gas can, this red gas can from his truck.

1934
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,560
And he looks at me one last time

1935
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,920
and he lights a match.

1936
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:11,720
And the last thing I remember, I'll never forget it.

1937
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,720
Were his eyes.

1938
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,720
His eyes because they were filled with this

1939
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:27,360
immense satisfaction.

1940
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,160
I'm so sorry.

1941
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,280
Don't, don't, don't tell me how sorry you are for me.

1942
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,680
Just tell me how you're gonna stop it happening to Trevor.

1943
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:41,520
All right, that's it.

1944
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,520
Ah!

1945
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,480
Oh!

1946
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,600
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

1947
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,520
For me that that monologue is peak, like bad, good Spacey.

1948
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,440
Like he was still trying.

1949
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,840
And it's a, this movie is a giant piece of trash,

1950
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,960
but you could see him.

1951
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,240
It's like, he's just really still like putting himself,

1952
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,240
it's before KPACs.

1953
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,400
He's just still like putting the effort in.

1954
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,560
He still thinks I think anytime he makes a movie

1955
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,040
that he's gonna win an Oscar.

1956
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,800
And so he really, he's got the little tear

1957
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,440
in the corner of his eye.

1958
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,640
And it's just, there's so much loaded in there.

1959
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,440
And I just, I just love it.

1960
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,240
It's also, I also love how it's in front of the Vegas strip,

1961
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:23,320
like the out of focus MGM and Tropicana back there.

1962
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,920
That's an odd detail.

1963
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,400
Yeah. He, I think that's something to be said about

1964
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,120
beyond the sea and pay it forward.

1965
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,880
Both such confident Oscar bait.

1966
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,360
They are so certain they're just getting,

1967
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,760
he's like picturing taking the award

1968
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,640
while he's doing this right now.

1969
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,360
Yes. He's picturing this.

1970
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,160
He knows that scene is played during the ceremony.

1971
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,480
He's like, I'm doing the scene.

1972
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,600
I'm doing the scene.

1973
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,840
And so what this relates to now is my major,

1974
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,840
because there's a detail in it that I found very interesting

1975
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,760
watching these two things together, which is,

1976
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,000
so my major is the Kevin Spacey now taken offline,

1977
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,240
masterclass.

1978
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,280
Yeah.

1979
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:06,280
Masterclass, it's like classes that you watch online

1980
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,000
by famous luminaries.

1981
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,400
And until he got sex pestered away,

1982
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,840
Kevin Spacey had an acting class on there.

1983
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,680
And it, and I found it.

1984
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,600
I put it out there on Twitter being like,

1985
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,080
I tweeted release the Kevin Spacey masterclass

1986
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,760
and somebody contacted me like within minutes

1987
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,240
was like, I have it. Do you want it?

1988
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:30,040
So I watched, I watched most of it.

1989
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,960
How many hours, what's the width of the content?

1990
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:34,800
The breadth of the content.

1991
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,240
Several hours. Yeah.

1992
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:39,480
And it comes with like a company,

1993
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,880
like a booklet that talks about all of his theory.

1994
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,840
But basically what the class is,

1995
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,120
is what he's been doing in London this whole time,

1996
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,760
where he brings actors on,

1997
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,000
it's like he gets a group together of unknown young actors.

1998
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,760
He makes them do scenes, monologues,

1999
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,720
and then he stops them.

2000
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,480
He gives them notes and he makes them do it again.

2001
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,720
So you're basically just watching him

2002
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,160
teach an acting class.

2003
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,720
But there's this very, there's all these like specific things.

2004
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,200
Well, one thing that is interesting is that

2005
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,280
he keeps giving people the note of

2006
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,880
be doing something domestic.

2007
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,880
I want you to be doing something domestic.

2008
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,720
And when I watched that pay it forward scene,

2009
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,240
he's got the grocery bag.

2010
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,040
He's messing with the grocery bag,

2011
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,000
even as he's talking about a stepdad, letting him on fire.

2012
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,160
He practices what he preaches.

2013
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,480
Most of the class is him telling like

2014
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,200
just awful like self promoting stories

2015
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,880
and just like drinking in all of their adoration.

2016
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,120
It's a truly like creepy, creepy thing to watch.

2017
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,200
I barely enjoyed it.

2018
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,240
I enjoyed it a lot.

2019
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,400
I hated it a lot, but it was really, it's a rough,

2020
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,880
it was a rough exercise.

2021
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,240
Is there any, I've never,

2022
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,280
I'm pretty unfamiliar with master classes

2023
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,720
and I've always been curious about them.

2024
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,960
Like, do you think anyone would regard this as,

2025
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:01,400
well, that was as worthwhile as going to a real school,

2026
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,640
in a place and learning drama?

2027
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:05,480
I don't know.

2028
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:10,480
I mean, most of his notes are just like weird.

2029
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:12,240
I don't know.

2030
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,760
His notes are, okay, here's what I wanted to talk about.

2031
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,880
So he does this type of note that he gives

2032
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,480
mostly to the young men.

2033
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,600
The young women are mostly completely dismissed by him.

2034
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,520
And it's very funny cause a woman will come up,

2035
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,360
do a model, I could be like,

2036
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,600
eh, it wasn't so good.

2037
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,440
Do it again.

2038
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,840
Maybe he'll give her like a bad note

2039
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,880
to make her look stupid.

2040
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,640
And then he'll say like, now you look stupid.

2041
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,560
It's very weird.

2042
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:37,000
But if it's a young, gorgeous boy,

2043
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,540
he just, it's like cameras on his face, he's loving it.

2044
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,360
And he's just like drinking it in.

2045
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,240
So then, so I'm gonna share this.

2046
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,760
I edited a little thing together

2047
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,400
of my favorite notes that he gives.

2048
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,480
And you guys will see.

2049
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,560
Yes, yes.

2050
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:54,360
You guys will see a trend.

2051
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,120
Make sure you're, I would say,

2052
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,200
make sure your volume is up.

2053
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,040
Okay.

2054
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,560
Like he's whispering right in your ear.

2055
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,040
Here it is.

2056
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,480
Are you saying that to us or to the listeners?

2057
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,040
Everyone.

2058
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:11,880
I think, well, whatever,

2059
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,700
you might have to turn up your volume.

2060
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,540
It starts with music.

2061
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:16,000
Cause I used, the whole thing has this like jazzy back.

2062
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,760
There's this jazzy score for each masterclass.

2063
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:21,200
And I gave you just a little taste of that at the beginning.

2064
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,840
But here, this is 35 minutes long, 35 seconds long.

2065
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,200
And it's just my favorite notes

2066
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,440
that he gives over the course of the many hours.

2067
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,560
Yes. Wow.

2068
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,600
This is something you've done a bunch of times.

2069
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,440
Okay.

2070
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,240
This isn't fucking new.

2071
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:38,080
Oh!

2072
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,480
If he goes through with this thing,

2073
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,280
with this woman,

2074
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,280
you're going to kill him.

2075
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:48,080
Make him about 82 and really angry.

2076
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,160
And now I want you to give her a deformity,

2077
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,520
a physical deformity.

2078
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,360
You!

2079
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,560
I want you to try to do this now

2080
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:59,040
as if you're trying to kill him.

2081
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,800
As if you are a bird.

2082
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,640
Yeah.

2083
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:08,360
I feel like you guys,

2084
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:09,920
I can probably put that online

2085
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,000
and I'll wait to get seasoned to sit off.

2086
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,640
But basically, if you didn't see like listener,

2087
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,360
his last note was to this young man.

2088
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,360
And he says, I want you to do this as if you were a bird.

2089
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:24,880
And that is the most torturous, like 15 minute section

2090
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,480
because this kid comes out, does a perfectly good monologue.

2091
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,320
He is the best in the class.

2092
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,480
He does this Jules Feiffer monologue.

2093
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,840
He's very attractive, space is in love with him.

2094
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,160
And then he gives him this fucking note

2095
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,040
that he should do it again as if he were a bird.

2096
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:41,360
And then you watch this kid try to do that.

2097
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,320
And it's just, he falls apart.

2098
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,480
And the class is kind of like,

2099
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,600
I think he just can't do it.

2100
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,960
And he's like kind of grasping

2101
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,280
because it's such a crazy note.

2102
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,280
What does it mean?

2103
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:51,920
How does he interpret that?

2104
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,960
And he always needs to put on these hideous masks

2105
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,160
and then like go like, go do it in the mirror.

2106
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,120
And then he'll like walk up to them,

2107
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,520
holding a Starbucks and like gently touch them

2108
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:04,080
and be like, I want to see it now.

2109
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,280
And I was like, I don't know why he's whispering.

2110
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,480
Is it to keep it away?

2111
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,800
Like keep it so that the class doesn't hear the note?

2112
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,040
Cause we get the subtitle.

2113
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:15,760
Yeah, Jules Feiffer also a wonderful writer.

2114
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,400
You don't really have to Gus up Jules Feiffer.

2115
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,720
I know, it's a great-

2116
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,680
You don't have to Gussy that up.

2117
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,520
He does a great job.

2118
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,680
And it just like space, he's clearly like very into

2119
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:24,500
what he does.

2120
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,480
And he's like, I just got to give him something.

2121
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,120
And he gives him this bird note.

2122
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,560
So anyway, it's just a bunch of that bullshit.

2123
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,560
I should also, the listener did not see

2124
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:37,560
that half of those notes were given to actors in masks.

2125
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,680
We're kind of comedia hideous masks.

2126
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah.

2127
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,120
I think my favorite was the very first one.

2128
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:46,280
The, you've done this before.

2129
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:49,080
It isn't fucking new.

2130
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,040
It isn't fucking new.

2131
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:55,600
It's all this like cool, like I'm a cool guy shit.

2132
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,720
And it's great.

2133
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:01,320
And so then the other thing I just wanted to share is from,

2134
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:06,320
it's just a tiny section from his lesson,

2135
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,600
which is titled impressions,

2136
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,680
which I played the big part in from earlier,

2137
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:11,920
but this was the one I liked.

2138
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:12,760
And-

2139
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,500
How could this be applicable?

2140
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,600
How could him doing impressions be,

2141
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,720
teach you anything as an actor?

2142
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,800
This is my problem with it is it's basically,

2143
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,580
as you'll see, like if a guy on TikTok doing impressions,

2144
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:28,220
was treating it like it was actually like an important

2145
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:31,700
lesson that you had paid money and you're like learning.

2146
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,900
And so I'll share this one.

2147
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:36,860
So when you do SpongeBob SquarePants.

2148
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:39,620
Like Peter Griffin, like literally.

2149
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:43,060
When you do Peter, to be Peter.

2150
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:47,220
So, okay, so this is 40 seconds and check this out.

2151
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:50,660
Yeah, like, you know, it's like Pacino.

2152
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:55,500
Pacino has a certain kind of, I know, gruffness.

2153
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:58,220
You know, there's a certain quality

2154
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:00,620
where the voice gets lower.

2155
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:03,820
Automatically, you start working on a different part

2156
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:05,700
of your voice.

2157
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,180
Oh, big man.

2158
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:14,180
You know, there's a, you sit in a different place vocally.

2159
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:17,020
And then if you start to find those physical things

2160
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:18,200
that a guy like Pacino does,

2161
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,300
where it always seems to me like Al,

2162
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:23,380
Al appears to be the absent minded actor,

2163
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:26,660
where he's forgotten where everything is.

2164
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:30,020
And so he's always looking for something.

2165
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,940
So that's, he runs through all his impressions

2166
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,940
and he treats them all like they're these like

2167
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:35,700
actual acting lessons.

2168
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,900
When he's just doing his like 20 impressions,

2169
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,500
he's always done for his whole life.

2170
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,780
That was like the easiest impressions.

2171
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:44,480
And he's, this guy's, it was so crazy.

2172
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:48,140
I was like, he had drunk so much of his own Kool-Aid

2173
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:51,140
right before this all happened and he went away.

2174
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:54,020
And this masterclass is like the perfect

2175
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,660
exemplification of it,

2176
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:58,700
where you're just seeing this weird little world

2177
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,200
he's built for himself.

2178
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,480
And where he actually thinks like a lesson

2179
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,660
on how to do Pacino is like an acting lesson.

2180
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:08,660
So that's my masterclass on the Kevin Spacey masterclass.

2181
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:11,860
He also, he goes, he just says like,

2182
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,380
and he also drops in like, he goes,

2183
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:15,420
so Al, what you're doing with Al?

2184
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,160
He also is like, I know him as well.

2185
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,860
I'm like, oh, that's right.

2186
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:23,460
I think big man is a, is might be a Glenn Gary Glen Ross

2187
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:26,100
line that he's dropping in to remind you that he was in

2188
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,780
Glenn Gary Glen Ross with him.

2189
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,540
Oh, and he does Jack Lemmon a lot too,

2190
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:31,980
which he's also in that.

2191
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:35,100
There's a whole Lemmon section in this impressions video

2192
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:37,260
where he talks about knowing Jack.

2193
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:40,200
And of course he ends with Carson and he like rocks back

2194
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,300
on his heels and shows the way that Carson stands.

2195
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,780
Oh, that's yeah, you sent me that.

2196
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:47,060
And it's so, it's so long winded the explanation.

2197
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:48,480
He makes the crew back up.

2198
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,320
Like, can you see me?

2199
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,640
You gotta get a full body.

2200
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,800
And he makes them change their camera angle

2201
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:53,880
so that he can show that like,

2202
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:58,360
if you saw Johnny in person at the tapings, like I did,

2203
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:01,200
like when you saw, if you took the time to see him in person,

2204
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,640
what you didn't know is there was the pivot.

2205
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,240
There was the pivot and that's the key to the Johnny

2206
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,240
is the pivot.

2207
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,060
So that's like this elitist, like,

2208
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:10,440
because I went and saw him in New York city.

2209
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,320
He also does a very like, it's extremely,

2210
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:21,480
I referenced earlier the SNL audition move of the,

2211
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:24,360
like he, it's like he thought of this for the first time,

2212
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:28,560
the really hacky like celebrity at the weird store.

2213
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:33,000
And he does that with Jimmy Stewart.

2214
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,480
And I think it's, I think he's like,

2215
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,100
and he's acting like he's making it up on the fly.

2216
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,000
So like, I don't know, something like Jimmy Stewart

2217
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
at the laundromat, you know?

2218
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,520
So there's just a natural, you know, this kind of,

2219
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,800
it's a contradiction, right?

2220
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,800
So, you know, you'll have something like,

2221
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:54,280
the dryer's full, the dryer is full, you know?

2222
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,120
So, you know, something like that.

2223
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:56,440
And it's very funny.

2224
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:59,360
And then he tries to make up another one.

2225
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,840
And I think can't come up with a line,

2226
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:02,600
like Jimmy Stewart at the bowling alley.

2227
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,720
And he'll say, you know, whatever it is.

2228
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:09,840
And once he's called upon to think of a new one,

2229
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,120
he blanks.

2230
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,600
But this is like, oh, sorry.

2231
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,560
It's so confusing.

2232
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,440
Because he's like, there's a lesson on impressions,

2233
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,360
but it's a serious acting class,

2234
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:22,200
but it seems like he's coaching someone,

2235
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:26,160
like a comedian doing like an SNL audition.

2236
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:29,080
It's like, okay, I got Dr. Fosse.

2237
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:32,400
I've got Trump.

2238
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:36,720
You know, I've got my three impressions down.

2239
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,120
It's weird.

2240
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,280
And this all feeds into something I mentioned,

2241
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:43,240
I think during the Downtown Disney ordeal,

2242
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,960
but my larger theory that I think all of this supports,

2243
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,800
which is that Kevin Spacey is stupid.

2244
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:53,000
And like, and he fooled us for so long

2245
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,400
because he can act like a smart person.

2246
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,240
But at the end of the day,

2247
01:36:56,240 --> 01:37:01,040
I think he's just a big old dumb dumb with terrible taste.

2248
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:04,040
The man who starred in a whiskey sponsored short film

2249
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,400
about a dentist operating on a pirate.

2250
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:10,240
I think he might be a big dumb brain.

2251
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,320
I need to see at least 10 more short films

2252
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,440
before I decide.

2253
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,680
I haven't decided yet.

2254
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:23,120
The do some business with your hands is such like a,

2255
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:26,960
what dumb people think good actors do.

2256
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,640
There's a moment in House of Cards that like struck me

2257
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:34,880
so hard when it first aired,

2258
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,040
where they're in the living quarters in the White House,

2259
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:41,600
and Robin Wright Penn comes in

2260
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,840
and Kevin Spacey is there making peanut butter

2261
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,240
and jelly sandwiches.

2262
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:49,320
He's singing like Froggy went to court or something.

2263
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,640
And I've written that into it.

2264
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,800
Like I wrote a sketch based on that scene

2265
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,760
where people just coming in to tell the president

2266
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:00,040
about crisis is, and he just keeps making sandwiches

2267
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:04,480
and singing like songs, because it's so bizarre.

2268
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,320
Business needs business.

2269
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:08,560
Business means you're smart.

2270
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,040
Do something to mess things.

2271
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:15,960
Do something you've done, you've fucking done before.

2272
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:21,000
With a curse, with a curse so you know he means it.

2273
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,560
He would never swear at a woman.

2274
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,600
Like he will only do that to like the big guys in the class.

2275
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,520
If it's a woman, he just treats her like shit.

2276
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,760
She doesn't get any like investment.

2277
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,120
It's just the guys.

2278
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,800
He touches the woman in that clip.

2279
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,160
Like he does this such a slow move in to touch her,

2280
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,640
which would just be, it would be okay

2281
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,560
if he just kind of like went like this,

2282
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,520
but he like does this like slow,

2283
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,640
like creepy touch with his fingers.

2284
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:48,080
He's standing there and he's whispering,

2285
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,920
I want you to give her a deformity.

2286
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,240
To a woman in a mask.

2287
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:58,120
This is like, again, clues.

2288
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:01,040
This is like we're watching video of an Epstein party.

2289
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,200
Oh yeah, for sure.

2290
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:06,520
Whispers and masks, deformities.

2291
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,680
I, oh my God.

2292
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,280
Has anyone seen by the way,

2293
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:12,160
years before he did this real master class thing,

2294
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,920
there was a Peter Serafinowicz sketch

2295
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,800
where he plays Kevin Spacey doing a master class.

2296
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,440
And it's one of the best impressions I've ever seen.

2297
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,240
Kevin should watch this impression

2298
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,200
to learn how to do impressions.

2299
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:26,280
But it is entirely about being like the extremely disdainful

2300
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,840
of his female students

2301
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:31,960
and like putting them in impossible boxes to escape from.

2302
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,680
Like this deep, deep score.

2303
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:37,560
It like, this sketch like predicted exactly

2304
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,880
what the real master class ended up being.

2305
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,240
He says in the impressions video

2306
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,040
that nobody can do an impression of him too.

2307
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:43,880
He's so low.

2308
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:44,720
God.

2309
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:47,400
Oh, what would mothers say about all this?

2310
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,440
I don't think mother would care for this.

2311
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,440
Does it in that Phil Hartman Saturday Night Lights sketch

2312
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,400
when he came back to host,

2313
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,520
when he's doing the acting teacher,

2314
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,680
this is something, this is nothing.

2315
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:57,520
Doesn't he also say like,

2316
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,720
I don't believe women should be in the business?

2317
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:00,560
That's right.

2318
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,400
I believe.

2319
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,240
I think so.

2320
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:05,080
I think so.

2321
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:07,240
All the sketches predicted all of this.

2322
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:11,160
Well, is it, is it my major?

2323
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,000
Am I up?

2324
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,840
Yeah, you're up.

2325
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:14,400
Fantastic.

2326
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,240
Well, yeah, impressions certainly factor into mine,

2327
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:20,000
obviously, because my major is award shows.

2328
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,800
And, you know, there's all of this work that he does,

2329
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:27,480
you know, in private and with small crews and, you know,

2330
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,480
his process is kind of behind closed doors.

2331
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:33,280
But when we see him at award shows,

2332
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:36,360
that is the way to just see on display

2333
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,880
the sheer unbridled love of this man

2334
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:42,800
that existed until one day in 2016,

2335
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,800
and then it never existed again.

2336
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,280
And it's, you now, when you watch clips of him

2337
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,640
on award shows,

2338
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:51,000
you feel like you're looking into an alternate dimension.

2339
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,880
It like doesn't make sense to you.

2340
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,560
You're looking at all the most powerful people in the world,

2341
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:56,640
some of the most respected people.

2342
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,080
We're all just like beaming.

2343
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,240
It is beyond like little laughs.

2344
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:04,920
He always killed, destroyed with these audiences

2345
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:07,080
who love him so much.

2346
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:11,000
One of which Pacino factors into,

2347
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,320
I watched the Kennedy Center honors of Al Pacino

2348
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:16,240
or a clip of him on.

2349
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,240
I don't have a clip,

2350
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,440
but it's like exactly what you played, Ivo.

2351
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,200
He makes the same observation about,

2352
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,520
because Al is always looking for something.

2353
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,640
He's always trying to find something.

2354
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:27,520
So he'll be like,

2355
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,920
and then he just shifts back and forth and goes,

2356
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,000
ah, ah, ah, ah,

2357
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,080
and this murders, murders with real Al Pacino,

2358
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,160
murders with President Obama.

2359
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,120
Everybody's wearing their fancy ribbons

2360
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:41,360
and it's cutting to them.

2361
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,840
Again, just like as if they're staring into the face of God.

2362
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,720
Everyone loves Kevin so much.

2363
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:52,080
The Tonys, he hosted the Tonys right before all of this

2364
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,560
in 2015.

2365
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,080
And God, I wish there were more full award shows

2366
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:00,040
hosted front to back by Kevin Spacey.

2367
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:03,240
Cause that's like him producing Saturday Night Live.

2368
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,760
That's like, if he was Lorne Michaels,

2369
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,320
just like what is his idea of a great variety show?

2370
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:12,240
And of course it involves impressions of Bill Clinton

2371
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:13,760
and Johnny Carson.

2372
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,200
Johnny Carson at the 2015 Tony Awards.

2373
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:21,160
John, he does Karnak.

2374
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:22,080
And he just, he says,

2375
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:25,120
I've worked up a little, again, it's that nasal.

2376
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,680
It's not Carson.

2377
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:28,200
Can I do him doing Carson?

2378
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:31,320
Just like, and so I've worked up a little Karnak,

2379
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:32,680
the Magnificent.

2380
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,560
And so far off the mark.

2381
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:38,880
And he just says Karnak pulls out the envelope.

2382
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,280
Audience explodes.

2383
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,680
He's killing through this entire thing.

2384
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:46,040
Especially when he walks out,

2385
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:51,080
Lin-Manuel Miranda cannot find the envelope.

2386
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:51,920
Where is it?

2387
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:52,760
Does somebody have it?

2388
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:55,920
And turns out who has it is President Frank Underwood.

2389
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,680
And he walks out with a full entourage

2390
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:01,680
with the actress, Corey Stoll, correct?

2391
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:02,680
Is that the right name?

2392
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:03,520
Yeah.

2393
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:09,360
And Robin Wright Penn, his full crew from House of Cards.

2394
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,760
And he proceeds to do a little sketch as Frank Underwood.

2395
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:16,160
And his castmates, who we, as we mentioned,

2396
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,320
are extremely good actors,

2397
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:20,760
proceed to have no lines to stand behind him

2398
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:22,280
and do nothing.

2399
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,480
They went to the trouble of getting Robin Wright Penn.

2400
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:24,640
She did jack shit.

2401
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,560
But a lot of, this is really,

2402
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,240
it's an incredible lineup of folks.

2403
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:32,360
Cause you get Lin-Manuel Miranda on stage

2404
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:36,000
with Kevin Spacey, cuts to audience for reaction.

2405
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,160
Gad, all my faves, Gad, huge shit, even grin.

2406
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,720
And then keeps cutting around.

2407
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,440
And you know who really loves this bit?

2408
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:44,880
Les Moonvesds.

2409
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,120
All their favorites.

2410
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:53,120
It was around this time of watching a word show kind of stuff

2411
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,720
and event stuff that I started feeling like,

2412
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:59,440
I think Kevin Spacey was like the ambassador

2413
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,840
of the ultimately Me Too'd men.

2414
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:04,200
He was like always their king.

2415
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,200
And when he went down, the whole ship went down.

2416
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,240
Cause there's another thing at the,

2417
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:10,600
not that all these people went down,

2418
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,800
but then there's a House of Cards,

2419
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,960
sketch that played at the White House Correspondents Dinner

2420
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:20,960
where Spacey's on the phone and he's talking to Bloomberg,

2421
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,640
to Mayor Bloomberg, who then hands the phone

2422
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:25,320
over to Charlie Rose.

2423
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:29,520
They're just like, they all just like gravitated

2424
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,360
towards each other.

2425
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,520
I guess when you feel kindred spirits.

2426
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:37,240
So I mean, those, all those odds and ends are fun.

2427
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,600
But I mean, the things I got to talk about,

2428
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:40,920
and I talked about them the first time,

2429
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:41,960
that this all came up.

2430
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,320
And there's some people listening for whom

2431
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:47,600
the clips I'm gonna play are like the Bible,

2432
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,000
like why go over them again?

2433
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,080
But that might not be everybody.

2434
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,840
And some of these things I have to watch

2435
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:57,880
once every couple months just to get that,

2436
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:59,440
those endorphins.

2437
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,960
The first of which is truly a classic

2438
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,760
and that is his performance of,

2439
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,840
I got a feeling by the Black Eyed Peas

2440
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:15,840
at the British Sports Awards, the Laureates.

2441
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:19,680
Again, I know you guys know these plenty well,

2442
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,720
unless you don't, fill me in if you don't.

2443
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:24,840
I've never seen this.

2444
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:25,800
You've not seen this?

2445
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:27,120
Oh shit, oh okay.

2446
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,200
Well then maybe I'll play a little more

2447
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,200
than I was gonna play.

2448
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:34,400
What's happening here didn't even strike me

2449
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,240
as a surprise.

2450
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,760
What's happening here didn't even strike me

2451
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:42,760
as so odd until I had to transcribe it

2452
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,000
for the audio medium of a podcast.

2453
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,040
That the show starts, he walks through some double doors,

2454
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,600
goes through a kitchen, that's such a flurry of activity.

2455
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,600
Like, woo, there goes a waiter.

2456
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,440
So much is happening.

2457
01:45:56,440 --> 01:46:00,160
A beautiful woman comes up and asks for his autograph.

2458
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:03,640
There's bodyguards, there's people pointing at a form.

2459
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:07,240
There's a guy who comes up with a silver platter,

2460
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:12,240
which he reaches into and grabs a microphone

2461
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:16,640
off of a pillow inside the platter.

2462
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:20,320
And again, this literally dismisses this woman.

2463
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:23,000
She's like, this is important monologue business to go over.

2464
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,560
No, no, no, not now.

2465
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:26,240
And this happens.

2466
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,160
Just one moment.

2467
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,000
I got a feeling.

2468
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:37,520
That tonight's gonna be a good night.

2469
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:41,280
That tonight's gonna be a good night.

2470
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,080
That tonight's gonna be a good night.

2471
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:43,920
It's his makeup done.

2472
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,240
A good night.

2473
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:46,080
A feeling.

2474
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,160
He high fives a bouncer.

2475
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:53,080
It's they're trying to craft, and it's all one shot.

2476
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,320
They're trying to craft that perfect little opening

2477
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:56,520
where the guy's so debonair.

2478
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,520
He's getting everything done.

2479
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,320
Little makeup, sure, I'll sign this.

2480
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:03,280
And then he takes, I think a soccer ball,

2481
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:06,400
shoots it at a basketball net and misses.

2482
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,000
Which is like at his eye length, like eye level.

2483
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,640
Your eye is a very good detail.

2484
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,240
Yes, it is not up high.

2485
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:14,800
It is so close to him.

2486
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:19,040
I wonder to this day, does he know if he missed it?

2487
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,880
Has he ever watched this in his head?

2488
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,240
Did he just nail this?

2489
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,320
And even if he saw a video, he might be like,

2490
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,400
this was doctored.

2491
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,800
It was a swish, I recall vividly.

2492
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:34,960
So, keeps singing, walks backstage,

2493
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,920
and is revealed on stage.

2494
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,480
Sings this little line about,

2495
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:42,760
if I'm not the right host,

2496
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:43,840
you can hire Ricky Gervais.

2497
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,680
And then we keep going.

2498
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:49,200
If I'm wrong, you can always hire Ricky Gervais.

2499
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:52,160
Do you like the night?

2500
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,040
Please give a cheer.

2501
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:57,800
There's just one reason why we're all here.

2502
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,680
I've won awards.

2503
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:05,520
I won a few, a walk of fame star, and Oscars too.

2504
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:08,960
It's just that I want it all.

2505
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:09,800
A glorious.

2506
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,360
So, the lyrics are,

2507
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:15,280
there's just one reason why we're all here.

2508
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:18,600
Then he lists his own accomplishments

2509
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:21,120
at a British sports awards.

2510
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:24,200
Then goes up into his singing register he can't hit

2511
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:27,440
and rounds a corner past which we can see his bald spot.

2512
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:32,200
It's wonderful throughout.

2513
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:34,520
Any reactions or feelings for anybody?

2514
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:37,000
This is the best thing I've ever seen.

2515
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,320
I mean, this really.

2516
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:42,000
It kind of makes sense him hosting the Tonys

2517
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,800
because he was a theater guy.

2518
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,680
Hosting the British sports awards,

2519
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:48,160
the only connection he has to British sports

2520
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:53,160
is that he hid out in London at the old Vic for 11 years,

2521
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
just terrorizing people.

2522
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,160
That's his connection to Britain.

2523
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:00,560
He was knighted.

2524
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:01,400
The tigers.

2525
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,400
Oh, right, right.

2526
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:04,240
So of course.

2527
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,560
He was knighted, he's a sir?

2528
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:08,360
I believe he was, yeah.

2529
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,160
He can't be knighted.

2530
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:13,000
He's not a British citizen.

2531
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,920
So it's whatever the,

2532
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:18,080
once they give to citizens of other countries.

2533
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,400
But I believe the queen did knight him.

2534
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:26,280
The utter confident,

2535
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:27,280
everything you've been saying Mike

2536
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,600
that he thinks he can do everything.

2537
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:31,440
It's extremely clear here

2538
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:36,440
that he's singing a just straight up current pop rap song.

2539
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,360
Cause everything we've seen up until this point

2540
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:40,800
is standards and beyond the sea.

2541
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:45,000
And so him singing the black eyed peas is just fantastic.

2542
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:49,680
And that's, I don't want to need to play everything,

2543
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:51,400
although it's, I recommend watching the whole thing,

2544
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,520
but just highlights.

2545
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,080
I think my favorite part is when he says,

2546
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:57,880
Davy's dressed up.

2547
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:59,960
And then it cuts to a guy I've never seen before.

2548
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,720
I don't know who Davy is.

2549
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,880
Whenever it cuts to somebody, they look miserable.

2550
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:07,840
They are not enjoying the performance.

2551
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,640
They look confused.

2552
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:12,440
This poor guy I'm showing you.

2553
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:14,160
He sings the line,

2554
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:16,080
Tony Hawk.

2555
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:16,920
Yeah, Tony Hawk.

2556
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:17,920
He wants an award,

2557
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:21,440
but he's too old for his skateboard.

2558
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,560
And then it cuts to this face.

2559
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:25,880
It just disgusted Tony Hawk.

2560
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:29,320
Why would you just insult Tony Hawk to his face?

2561
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:32,880
Has it ever occurred to us that Tony Hawk's too old?

2562
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:36,680
That's an observation completely in Kevin Spacey's head.

2563
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:44,320
He then, see who's, he rhymes best with glorious.

2564
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:46,040
A lot of the audience,

2565
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:50,200
so much of the audience that it cuts to are in like turbines.

2566
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,800
I don't know what this affair is.

2567
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:56,480
This specific event was in Abu Dhabi.

2568
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:57,920
And I looked into the history of it

2569
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:02,080
and it was always somewhere different in Europe or Asia.

2570
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:05,440
There was one in Russia that Putin attended.

2571
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,560
So I don't know what the hell these awards are.

2572
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:09,240
They're just strange in general.

2573
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,680
For two years in a row, it was in Abu Dhabi

2574
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:15,560
and the host for both years, Kevin Spacey.

2575
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:20,120
You gotta wonder what's going on here.

2576
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:22,200
He got paid so much money for this.

2577
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,520
It feels like somebody who would enjoy going to Abu Dhabi

2578
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:27,360
for some reason we don't wanna know.

2579
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:28,960
It's while I'm in town,

2580
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:32,400
little watering hole only I know about.

2581
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:37,840
He's doing like a bad Robert Goulet.

2582
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,440
Like when you're, we're talking about his singing,

2583
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,880
it's very much like, I've got a feeling.

2584
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:44,280
Tonight's gonna be a good night.

2585
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,960
Like he's doing his like lounge singer version

2586
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,520
of I Got a Feeling.

2587
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,800
You wouldn't doubt he can just kind of talk it.

2588
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,440
But then he also goes for notes.

2589
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,840
He certainly is not qualified to hit.

2590
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:00,120
Let me go to the end.

2591
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:02,360
Some of these wonderful slant rhymes.

2592
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,200
Just, I love this thing.

2593
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:12,560
That tonight's gonna be a good night.

2594
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,360
That sports will be given its due right.

2595
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:19,880
And I'm glad to be back from my second night.

2596
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:21,120
I got a feeling.

2597
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:27,600
Look at that face when he like flutters like a songbird.

2598
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:29,360
His lip quivers.

2599
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:31,640
He could not like, there's other performers

2600
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,440
who would kind of have fun with it.

2601
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,840
They're singing, this is too cool of a song,

2602
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,800
too current of a song for me to be doing.

2603
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:38,640
But boy that,

2604
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:42,680
he believes it so hard.

2605
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,960
It's the first time I've actually gotten

2606
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:47,200
like the weird stomach feeling of embarrassment

2607
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,040
for someone else.

2608
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,160
This is the first time in the three hours

2609
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:52,480
that I feel like debilitated.

2610
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,720
You're kidding, I can't believe it took this.

2611
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,080
He has so much more confidence

2612
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,520
than any person I've ever met.

2613
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,560
Like I could be like, hey, here's a unicycle.

2614
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,360
Do you think you can ride and go, of course I can.

2615
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,440
And you get on it.

2616
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,320
And there's a chance he could kind of do it, honestly.

2617
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,000
Like there's a chance like he's not thinking

2618
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,520
or doubting himself would allow him

2619
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:15,120
to sort of ride a unicycle.

2620
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,520
Yeah, that's true.

2621
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,920
And then very quickly he'd be back on stage

2622
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,400
at the Lourious Awards,

2623
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:24,000
like going up against the world's greatest unicyclist.

2624
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:27,200
Let's have a race, you and me.

2625
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:30,000
In fact, I knew this clip and only this clip.

2626
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,400
And then I got curious what the rest

2627
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:33,440
of his award show bits were.

2628
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,520
And in one, there's like a major, major tennis player.

2629
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:37,800
I'm not sure who it is,

2630
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:42,160
but he challenges with a lot of windup, too much windup.

2631
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:46,000
But I thought we'd try a different type of game.

2632
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,160
And then it's that they play ping pong.

2633
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:50,640
And the whole bit is just a regular ping pong game

2634
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:52,520
that just goes for 10 minutes.

2635
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:53,640
It's very quiet.

2636
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:56,240
That's like far away from the audience.

2637
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,760
They're not involved in this.

2638
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:02,000
I was curious what the other year was.

2639
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,800
And so what I just showed you was 2011.

2640
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:07,920
In 2010, he, ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Spacey.

2641
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:11,120
And he walked out to, I've got a feeling again.

2642
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,920
He didn't perform it, but he played it.

2643
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:18,120
And it must have planted the seed like next year.

2644
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:21,040
This song reminds me of me.

2645
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,040
Oh, wow.

2646
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:25,960
Me in a nutshell, when I've got a feeling, I act on it.

2647
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:27,640
That's really what acting is.

2648
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:30,560
What was that one lyric where he says,

2649
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:33,080
sports finally get their due right?

2650
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:38,080
Isn't sports one of the biggest, if not the biggest,

2651
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:43,960
categories of entertainment in every country in the world?

2652
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:47,600
I thought so, but you think it's different.

2653
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:50,240
They deserve a little attention now and then.

2654
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:54,000
Let's think about sports just for one night.

2655
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:59,720
On the Wikipedia for the Laureus Awards,

2656
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:02,160
it says the award show has been criticized

2657
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,240
because the criteria are unclear.

2658
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:11,920
Elsewhere in his 2010 monologue,

2659
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:14,840
the first year's monologue of the Laureus Awards,

2660
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:18,360
he says, now I wasn't the first choice.

2661
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:21,440
They originally wanted this to be hosted by Morgan Freeman.

2662
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,240
And then of course, that is the end

2663
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:25,480
to do a Morgan Freeman impression.

2664
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:27,480
And I buy it a little bit.

2665
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:30,000
Maybe Morgan Freeman was supposed to be there or something.

2666
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,760
And then he keeps going and says,

2667
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,720
you know who else was maybe gonna host?

2668
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:35,680
Christopher Walken.

2669
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:37,640
Can you imagine what that would have been like?

2670
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,200
Well, hi, you know.

2671
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,160
And then he does that bizarre,

2672
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:43,560
whatever the fuck people think

2673
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:45,400
the Christopher Walken impression is.

2674
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:50,800
Just like Shatner, which is where are we

2675
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,200
with these impressions?

2676
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:53,920
I do a perfect William Shade.

2677
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:54,760
Yeah.

2678
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:57,280
Like what?

2679
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:58,520
We were just off.

2680
01:55:58,520 --> 01:55:59,840
We're in outer space now.

2681
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,240
I was just thinking about this

2682
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:04,800
because in the movie Nine Lives,

2683
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,120
which was one of the last movies he made

2684
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:07,600
before he was canceled,

2685
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:09,720
Christopher Walken is in that movie with him.

2686
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:10,880
And they have scenes together.

2687
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,760
Christopher Walken is the one who gives him

2688
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:15,080
the enchanted cat that he becomes.

2689
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:17,280
And they're in scenes together.

2690
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:20,640
And I wonder what that was like for Christopher Walken.

2691
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:25,000
Or wonder if Spacey did walk into Walken's face?

2692
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,840
I bet if they met, yeah,

2693
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,480
he probably walked up and like, hello,

2694
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,400
pleasure to meet you.

2695
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:35,520
And Walken was probably just didn't know what he was doing.

2696
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:36,840
It's like, yes, you too.

2697
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:39,840
Would you like to do the scene now?

2698
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:40,680
Yeah.

2699
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:46,040
Then he loses the thread of

2700
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,280
what if other celebrities hosted?

2701
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,560
And then he just says, what about Al Pacino?

2702
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:52,320
Oh, what about him?

2703
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:56,760
And then his Al Pacino impression consists of the words,

2704
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:00,520
say hello to my little Abu Dhabi.

2705
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:01,360
What?

2706
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,640
Goosebumps, embarrassment goosebumps.

2707
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,000
I'm covered in them.

2708
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,200
They'll be on for a week.

2709
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,080
Say hello to my little Abu Dhabi.

2710
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:12,160
I'm surprised he hasn't followed a Tom Cruise trajectory

2711
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:13,480
where Tom Cruise is so confident

2712
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:16,840
he'll do a halo jump out of a plane.

2713
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:19,000
Like Kevin Spacey has the level of confidence

2714
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,040
that like, yeah, I'll jump out of a plane any height.

2715
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:22,000
It doesn't matter.

2716
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:26,040
All of his movies should have giant stunts

2717
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,480
because he's so confident.

2718
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:31,640
He needs to jump out of the plane

2719
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:33,680
to land on the Pacific garbage patch

2720
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,800
where he currently is seeking asylum.

2721
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,080
That's the only way to get there.

2722
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,840
Nine Lives does start with him skydiving,

2723
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:43,760
highly CGI skydiving, and he calls his son a pussy

2724
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:45,720
as he jumps out of a plane.

2725
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:46,560
Whoa.

2726
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,080
It really, really bad.

2727
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,120
Oh my God.

2728
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:52,240
I can't believe nobody did Nine Lives.

2729
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,760
I mean, there's only so many majors.

2730
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:54,800
It's not really worth it.

2731
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:57,840
I watched it and I didn't want to major in it.

2732
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,480
That's the biggest moment when the bad movie

2733
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,840
isn't fun bad when it's just trying.

2734
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,280
That's why I like these little,

2735
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:07,080
in these little quick bites of his award show appearances

2736
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,120
are kind of perfect.

2737
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:11,640
The comment section is mad about, you know,

2738
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:13,680
they think the audience isn't giving him enough.

2739
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:15,400
How dare Tony Hawk glare at him

2740
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:18,040
just because he was mean to him in front of everyone.

2741
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:21,280
YouTube comment, the crowd sucked.

2742
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:22,920
How can you just sit there with a stone face

2743
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:26,320
when Spacey is bending over backwards to entertain you?

2744
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:29,080
Later comment, even if he is a little old,

2745
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:31,080
I would definitely marry him.

2746
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:34,880
Really?

2747
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:35,720
I guess.

2748
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:37,800
Spacey reply guys.

2749
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:41,440
Well, most of them,

2750
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:44,200
I am happy to say most of this was from five years ago,

2751
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:45,040
thankfully.

2752
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:49,120
I'm trying to think the right order to do this in.

2753
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:51,320
I mean, I might close out with a classic.

2754
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:55,160
And expose you to, so this is something new to me

2755
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:56,600
and hopefully is for you too.

2756
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:58,920
Jason throughout the episode has alluded to his work

2757
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,120
at the Old Vic.

2758
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:02,560
And that's why he was the perfect choice

2759
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,360
to host the Olivier Awards.

2760
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,200
More bizarre awards we've never heard of.

2761
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:12,840
And he starts, well, you know, I wrote down the dialogue,

2762
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:15,040
but maybe I should just play it.

2763
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,920
Sharing screen.

2764
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:20,360
Oh, here we go.

2765
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:26,120
All right, now we take you to the Old Vic

2766
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:29,760
and the Olivier Awards.

2767
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:33,720
Has everything to do with the Old Vic

2768
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:35,960
and what I hope we'll all continue to try to do

2769
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:38,880
and be there for this wonderful, wonderful girl.

2770
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,520
Taking off the bow tie again.

2771
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:43,440
Just like the, the little girl.

2772
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,960
Little girl when you're feeling small.

2773
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:50,800
For this wonderful, wonderful girl.

2774
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,640
Little girl when you're feeling small.

2775
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:57,280
You're pretty high.

2776
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:58,120
Again, if this were,

2777
01:59:58,120 --> 01:59:59,600
if I felt more like torturing you,

2778
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:02,440
I would play all six minutes of this, but.

2779
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,160
He's singing Bridge Over Troublewater.

2780
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:06,680
Let's just get to the chorus.

2781
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:08,840
The curtain opens and reveals a choir

2782
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:11,280
of approximately 600 people.

2783
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:14,560
The biggest choirs I've ever seen.

2784
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:18,560
Get to the chorus.

2785
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:25,760
And friends just can be found

2786
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:33,480
like a rainbow

2787
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,560
some water.

2788
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:41,520
I, when I, I watched all six minutes of this

2789
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:44,400
and towards the end, I started just cackling to myself.

2790
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,360
Like I'd literally lost my mind.

2791
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:50,920
Like Walter in the, in the crawl space and Breaking Bad.

2792
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:54,560
I, it just really, really broke me on some level.

2793
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,880
And I'll show you why really that happened.

2794
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:57,800
I mean, first of all, the fact that he's singing Bridge

2795
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:00,040
Over Troubled Waters, but he makes a point of singing it

2796
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:01,480
in the gospel-y way.

2797
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:04,080
Like, or he skips the V.

2798
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:06,800
It's a very key decision from him.

2799
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,120
Oh, Troublewater.

2800
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:12,080
It's very like old man rib.

2801
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:15,280
He's definitely, this is the,

2802
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,240
I think spirituals are mentioned earlier.

2803
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:19,200
And it's very spiritual.

2804
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:22,920
Your intersection sucks.

2805
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:24,840
Oh no, I'm sorry.

2806
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:25,760
Well, hang on.

2807
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,680
We got, we got a little lift here.

2808
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:30,200
Just when you needed a little, a little assistance,

2809
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:32,880
he brings out another singer, Beverly Knight.

2810
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,320
And then he brings out his secret weapon.

2811
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:38,480
I wish the audience could see it in the way

2812
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:40,160
that you guys can't, but I'll tell you what happens

2813
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,320
as soon as it's happened.

2814
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:45,560
Ladies and gentlemen, Beverly Knight.

2815
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:57,840
He is now playing harmonica.

2816
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,800
He is busted out of harmonica.

2817
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:04,680
And please, my friends, watch him play this harmonica.

2818
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:06,800
Just watch the physicality here.

2819
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:10,480
The horrible of his hands.

2820
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:17,440
It is making a suspicious amount of sound

2821
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:20,000
despite being nowhere near the microphone.

2822
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:23,600
Yes, I know where you're gonna go with this.

2823
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:27,240
I, yes, I have a proposition, which is that

2824
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,600
as with all the many of the things that Kevin Spacey

2825
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:32,440
thinks he knows how to do, playing harmonica

2826
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:35,520
is one of those things that he thinks he knows how to do.

2827
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:38,120
And when he pitches that he could play the harmonica

2828
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:41,360
at an awards like this, there's a quiet backroom discussion.

2829
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,320
Like, so are we gonna have like an offstage

2830
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:46,160
mega harmonica player and he'll just do a pantomime.

2831
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:47,000
Yeah, that's fine.

2832
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:47,820
Yeah, just cut his mic.

2833
02:02:47,820 --> 02:02:48,660
Okay.

2834
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:51,660
Just a full like singing in the rain, like second microphone.

2835
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:56,960
I believe that is what's occurring.

2836
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:57,800
Yes.

2837
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:59,000
And I think he's none the wiser.

2838
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:02,080
He doesn't know he missed the shot.

2839
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:06,040
And this comes into play once again in another one.

2840
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:08,120
Let me make sure I have this one open.

2841
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:10,400
And I think Mike, you may have stumbled

2842
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:11,680
into this one before.

2843
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:13,440
Yeah, I tipped it a little bit,

2844
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:15,120
but there'll also be a big surprise.

2845
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:17,560
I didn't say what I didn't say.

2846
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:20,040
So we'll see, you'll find out now.

2847
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:22,280
Happy to play it again.

2848
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:23,760
You guys seeing it?

2849
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:26,760
Are you guys seeing the wonderful label Gershwin Prize?

2850
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:27,600
Yes.

2851
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,400
And here we go.

2852
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:33,640
If you can imagine it, Billy Joel.

2853
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:35,000
You know how to play this?

2854
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:37,360
Well, it's your night, Billy.

2855
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:40,280
And I will accept the challenge, yes.

2856
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:42,840
Okay.

2857
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:43,680
Big laugh.

2858
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:44,640
Let's see what you got.

2859
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:45,760
That seems fair.

2860
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:47,280
Audience always on his side.

2861
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:52,000
So Billy's gonna play harmonica

2862
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,960
or Kevin's gonna play harmonica with Billy.

2863
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:57,360
Here we go for the classic song.

2864
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,360
["The Star-Spangled Banner"]

2865
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:05,360
This one is way more comically not proper,

2866
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:09,680
not happening than the previous.

2867
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,520
Well, time for Billy to take over

2868
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:20,400
and sing the song that we all know and love.

2869
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:21,680
And now Billy.

2870
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:25,120
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday.

2871
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:26,640
Nope.

2872
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:29,040
The regular crowd shuffles in.

2873
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:29,880
Anyway.

2874
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,600
I feel like I'm going insane.

2875
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:33,760
This is so weird.

2876
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:38,360
This is a running thing which into that look,

2877
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:41,480
that dress shirt or tuxedo shirt in the best.

2878
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:43,440
It comes up in Beyond the Sea.

2879
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:46,160
It's come up in multiple musical performances now.

2880
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:49,360
And he clearly thinks that's a cool look for him.

2881
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:51,160
And it looks like shit.

2882
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:52,760
He looks like Timberlake, man.

2883
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:55,720
He's well dressed and fitted.

2884
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:56,840
Where's Fedora's?

2885
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:58,400
He's just like Timberlake.

2886
02:04:58,400 --> 02:04:59,840
He looks so sloppy.

2887
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:05,000
Guys, I have a theory that I have hit on

2888
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,280
and tell me what you think.

2889
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:09,720
Is Kevin Spacey eat dark Troy McClure?

2890
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,280
Because he's got all these little weirdo oddity.

2891
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:19,280
If Troy McClure had an actual run of award winning stuff

2892
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,360
in addition to all the funny jokes.

2893
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:25,160
Yeah, just because like the connecting thing between them.

2894
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:29,840
Just that line of like,

2895
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:32,360
what I have is a romantic abnormality.

2896
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:33,680
One so unbelievable.

2897
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:36,240
It must be hidden from the public at all costs.

2898
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,080
You're right.

2899
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:39,240
I think it's a good theory.

2900
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:41,080
And you could picture Troy McClure saying,

2901
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:44,400
you may know me from Nine Lives,

2902
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:47,640
from the Talking Cat movie and the movie where I play Nixon.

2903
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:51,520
Boy, yeah, yeah.

2904
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:53,280
And he's always hosting everything.

2905
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,280
He's always like, if you need a personality,

2906
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:56,480
it's always him.

2907
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:57,720
Ooh, I like this.

2908
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:59,680
Yeah, dark Troy McClure.

2909
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,320
I really love that.

2910
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:04,520
I just, just before moving on from the harmonica,

2911
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:06,960
he just looks, you know, we'll post videos somewhere,

2912
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:09,360
but like, he just, he looks like a bobble head.

2913
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:12,320
His head is just like jangling around.

2914
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:13,880
And what's funny is when you watch, you know,

2915
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:16,360
like Stevie Wonder play harmonica,

2916
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:19,920
he, you know, has the harmonica to his head

2917
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,680
and he moves his head a little.

2918
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:26,600
He isn't like swinging it around back and forth wildly.

2919
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:30,360
Like it is the most like air guitar playing of harmonica.

2920
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,960
The way, if we all picked up a guitar and fake played it,

2921
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:36,920
we'd like hit every note in a way a real musician wouldn't.

2922
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:37,840
It's madness.

2923
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,040
Isn't he doing, like, it seems like in that clip,

2924
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:43,560
he might be doing it as a bit, but the other clip he's not.

2925
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,080
But then you'd like do some,

2926
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:48,600
then he'd like pull it away and look at it like,

2927
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:50,560
whoops, I'm saying I'm still going.

2928
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:55,200
He'd do like a ventriloquist kind of section of the bit.

2929
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,120
I think he's never played harmonica in the mirror.

2930
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:58,120
He's just done it.

2931
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:59,640
He thinks he looks good doing it.

2932
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:01,760
He doesn't know he looks insane doing it.

2933
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:02,600
Exactly.

2934
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,360
And he sees the Blues Brothers.

2935
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:10,240
He's seen only the Blues Brothers at Universal Studios do it.

2936
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:12,480
And they do like the caricature.

2937
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:16,240
Just as he is a caricature of what,

2938
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:19,400
he is like what rich people, dumb rich people think like,

2939
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:22,960
oh, this is what a good, like classically trained actor is,

2940
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,320
like Kevin Spacey.

2941
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:26,720
Oh, and he's funny and charming.

2942
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:27,560
Yeah.

2943
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:29,880
Yeah.

2944
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:32,280
There should be a TV show where Kevin Spacey

2945
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:34,040
does things for the first time.

2946
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,760
And he just does them like very confidently

2947
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:39,480
and we'd all very much enjoy it.

2948
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:41,560
Yeah.

2949
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:43,800
I can ride a deer.

2950
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:51,240
Even like Kevin Spacey paints a house

2951
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:53,000
and he just takes the bucket and like throws it.

2952
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:53,840
I did it.

2953
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:55,080
The house has been painted.

2954
02:07:56,280 --> 02:07:58,600
Look at me go, I'm a painter now.

2955
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:02,440
And then he's immediately dispensing advice

2956
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:04,040
on how to do it.

2957
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:06,440
What you have to do is you have to have paint.

2958
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:12,040
This time I want you to paint it very fast.

2959
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:14,200
Wear the mask.

2960
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,800
Wear the mask you fuck.

2961
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:22,320
Paint with a bird's favorite color.

2962
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:28,360
All right, so my final punishment

2963
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:31,000
and this one we all know, I think,

2964
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,440
but it seems nice to go out on a classic,

2965
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:36,120
on a modern day spiritual.

2966
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:38,920
And this was one of the first things we talked about,

2967
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,680
but I got to do it.

2968
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:45,560
His now classic,

2969
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:49,280
should be in the Smithsonian performance of mind games.

2970
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:54,320
As this came up the first time we talked about this,

2971
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:59,320
he was hosting an event called

2972
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:03,200
Come Together, A Night for John Lennon's Words and Music.

2973
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:07,840
This was an event that was a pre-standing tribute

2974
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:10,520
to John Lennon and then 9-11 happened.

2975
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:12,440
And then it became like a dual,

2976
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:14,840
it's both John Lennon and 9-11.

2977
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:17,000
So this could not have been more important.

2978
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:20,280
It was just a crucial event

2979
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:22,680
for bringing the city back together.

2980
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:24,640
It's why all the big guns had to come out.

2981
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:27,920
It's what Dave Matthews had to sing in my life.

2982
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:30,960
It's why Shaggy had to sing Give Peace a Chance.

2983
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:34,120
This is the only way to heal.

2984
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:38,160
In my life, I love you more.

2985
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:41,200
And everyone wept.

2986
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:46,440
This whole thing, I mean, let me just,

2987
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:53,120
I'll play his little speech here, important context.

2988
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:58,120
John Lennon was many things to many people,

2989
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:03,320
a poet, a rocker, a leader, a troublemaker,

2990
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:06,240
a father, a husband, a man.

2991
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:09,360
Growing up, to me, he was a hero.

2992
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:12,640
The work of John Lennon was marked by its exquisite beauty

2993
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:14,360
and by its brutal honesty.

2994
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:15,200
Can I just stop it here?

2995
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:17,480
And if I could just okay boomer it for a second,

2996
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:20,000
I just have an observation to get off my chest.

2997
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,800
This kind of shit that he's doing

2998
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:26,160
is why I couldn't get into the Beatles for many, many years.

2999
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:28,000
Does anyone agree with me on this?

3000
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,480
Everybody makes the Beatles sound like a chore.

3001
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:35,040
They're like a fun band who have fun songs

3002
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,920
and dress up in costumes and shit.

3003
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:38,400
And then when anyone has a microphone

3004
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:40,320
and gets to talk about them, it's like,

3005
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:45,320
he was a savior to most, yet just a man,

3006
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:50,240
but from his pen sprung forth poetry, the likes of wit.

3007
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:55,240
Like this kind of grandstanding shit, just don't do it.

3008
02:10:55,560 --> 02:10:59,080
That kind of introduction is so rough to hear

3009
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:01,840
and it translates to text sometimes.

3010
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:04,000
Like if you see someone on Twitter

3011
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,480
who gives themselves like 12 titles,

3012
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:11,120
like actor, writer, producer, resistor, father,

3013
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:18,040
watcher, TV watcher, like it's like, all right, man, come on.

3014
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:19,040
Pick two.

3015
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:22,320
I also think if John Lennon were at this event,

3016
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,880
he'd like throw a cocktail at Kevin.

3017
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:28,840
Yeah, he had anger issues.

3018
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:33,640
John Lennon would be like what get probably like

3019
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:36,200
not necessarily in the same way,

3020
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:41,040
but would probably be like some sort of weirdo reactionary.

3021
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:43,640
He would be like a Gary Oldman type where it's like,

3022
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:44,840
yeah, you're still a good actor,

3023
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:46,760
but if you put them in front of an interviewer,

3024
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:48,880
they're gonna say something insane

3025
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:51,400
that like you cannot follow the logic of.

3026
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:55,160
Dennis Quaid is starting a podcast.

3027
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:58,120
They announced this week where he's gonna interview

3028
02:11:58,120 --> 02:12:00,080
his friends and it includes like Lance Armstrong

3029
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:01,640
and Logan Paul.

3030
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:04,080
His friends?

3031
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:06,560
Yeah, he's become like a piece of shit.

3032
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,440
And now it's like, he's hanging out with other pieces

3033
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:10,400
of shit on the podcast.

3034
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:11,240
Can't wait.

3035
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:13,360
I've heard of the worst timeline podcast,

3036
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:16,560
but that sounds like the best timeline podcast to me.

3037
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:19,200
He's got to promote it.

3038
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:20,960
Can we get him on the show?

3039
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:21,800
Yeah, man.

3040
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:24,000
Can we get Dennis Quaid?

3041
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:25,680
Let's get Dennis Quaid.

3042
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:26,880
Are we gonna give him a big one

3043
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:28,880
to the Space Mountain with Dennis Quaid?

3044
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:33,440
Let's give him two, Space Mountain and Pirates.

3045
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,240
Only if Logan's there.

3046
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:38,480
That's probably how they bonded,

3047
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:39,960
Disneyland trips together.

3048
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:40,800
Yeah.

3049
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:44,520
Is Dennis Quaid in the Logang?

3050
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:47,040
Oh, is there?

3051
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:49,280
We gotta find some of those videos.

3052
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,680
Yeah, there is an older man in the background

3053
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:55,160
with the Logang videos, a little out of focus.

3054
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:56,280
Wow.

3055
02:12:56,280 --> 02:12:57,640
Peeing in their pool.

3056
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:02,120
Okay, so I'm gonna continue the monologue.

3057
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:04,440
So in that vein, let me say that while I'm both

3058
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:05,960
deeply honored to be here tonight,

3059
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:07,960
I'm also incredibly pissed off.

3060
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:10,920
9-Eleven pissed him off.

3061
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:15,920
You pissed off Kevin Spacey with 9-Eleven.

3062
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:19,160
I'm outraged because, look terrorists,

3063
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:20,320
look who you made, Mia.

3064
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:22,560
Passionate prophet of peace,

3065
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:24,600
and so many others are not with us here

3066
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:26,880
because we live in an all too violent world.

3067
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:29,520
I am mad about 9-Eleven, which happened a few weeks ago,

3068
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:31,280
and I'm mad about John Lennon's death,

3069
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:34,200
which happened 21 years ago.

3070
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:36,680
I'm equally mad about both.

3071
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:39,440
And I would love to be called and so many others.

3072
02:13:39,440 --> 02:13:44,440
Just all other, that's, he's talking about like

3073
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:47,960
everyone who's ever died, I think.

3074
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:48,920
Et cetera.

3075
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:51,600
Everyone between 1980 and 2001.

3076
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:52,440
Carson.

3077
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:54,600
Carson.

3078
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:55,800
I could do a little bit of him,

3079
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,920
but this isn't the time or the place.

3080
02:13:57,920 --> 02:13:58,960
I'll do a little bit.

3081
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:03,240
Mecca lecca hi.

3082
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:06,120
Here to this occasion, it's up to all of us

3083
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:09,600
to do what we can to not only keep John's songs alive,

3084
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:11,440
but help rebuild New York.

3085
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:14,160
And that includes your host.

3086
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:15,000
Yes.

3087
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:18,520
Yes.

3088
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:23,480
The tiny hop, the little hop, he hops four inches.

3089
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:25,320
And that's how the audience knows

3090
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:28,440
he ain't just toasting, he's singing.

3091
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:34,440
We're playing those mind games together

3092
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:41,440
Pushing the barrier, planning scenes

3093
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:44,560
And if you listen to that audience,

3094
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:47,840
they lose their fucking minds when he starts singing.

3095
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:49,120
He's singing too?

3096
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,400
Shouting the mantra

3097
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:54,120
The mantra

3098
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:55,320
Peace on earth

3099
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:57,120
He's like doing a Lennon impression.

3100
02:14:57,120 --> 02:15:00,520
We're all gonna play those mind games

3101
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:01,920
He's gotta do a bowie or something.

3102
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:03,800
He has to have a bowie somewhere.

3103
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:05,320
Yeah, please, it's time.

3104
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:08,120
So what do we do

3105
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:09,680
Let's do the veils

3106
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:11,840
This is the worst singing he's ever done.

3107
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,560
Yeah, you're right, you're right, yes.

3108
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:15,560
Everything Wellesley watched has been better.

3109
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:17,200
Let's do the veils

3110
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:21,640
Out of his range, his voice is thin, greedy.

3111
02:15:21,640 --> 02:15:23,240
Oh, here comes the best note.

3112
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:26,840
All right, here we go, Kevin.

3113
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:31,840
Love is the answer

3114
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:38,120
And you know that, you know that for sure

3115
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:41,600
The angriest version he could possibly do.

3116
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:42,440
He's angry.

3117
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:45,080
Again, in a dress shirt.

3118
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:47,200
He's in dress shirts for all of this.

3119
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:54,800
He dresses like an actuary at like a corporation.

3120
02:15:57,560 --> 02:16:00,200
But he's casual, you know, no time.

3121
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:01,040
Never the time.

3122
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:01,800
He dresses like his character from

3123
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:03,880
Glangary Glen Ross all the time.

3124
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:08,560
I mean, I kind of just wanna,

3125
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:11,480
kind of just wanna talk over this one.

3126
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:15,480
Um, he gets a little bit of words wrong.

3127
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:17,800
He kind of misses the cue on this one, I believe.

3128
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:18,640
Here, let's listen.

3129
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:22,240
Ha ha ha ha

3130
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:24,560
Ha ha ha ha

3131
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:27,960
Yeah, keep playing those.

3132
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:33,320
I think this is the most like,

3133
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:39,080
it's hard to relate to during the pandemic.

3134
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:41,720
This is just another time entirely

3135
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:44,040
with a man who's gone.

3136
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:47,360
We don't understand being in this frame of mind anymore.

3137
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:49,720
Like why you'd be, Kevin Spacey would sing

3138
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:52,440
Love is the answer at you and you'd cry.

3139
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:57,080
It feels like it was sent through a wormhole for us.

3140
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:57,920
You know, like,

3141
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:03,120
the portal open and dump this out and we're like, what?

3142
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:04,360
The big fart sound.

3143
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:05,400
This doesn't help?

3144
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:06,240
Here.

3145
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:10,240
You know that?

3146
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:13,840
Kevin Spacey has played my games on me

3147
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:15,760
and now I am fully Joker-fucked.

3148
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:20,040
Here, I'll skip a little ahead.

3149
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:21,040
I just wanna hear him sing,

3150
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:22,800
I want you to make love, not war.

3151
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:29,480
Such present audience in this.

3152
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:31,240
Everyone, there's people who've been applauding

3153
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:33,040
for five straight minutes.

3154
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:34,560
Their hands are bleeding.

3155
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:42,560
Raising the spirit of peace and love.

3156
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:50,800
Now you've heard that before.

3157
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:55,640
That's the most like your neighbor at karaoke he gets.

3158
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:57,720
It's so bad.

3159
02:17:57,720 --> 02:17:59,680
You know, there's another thing I thought about,

3160
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:01,280
Kevin Spacey and his musical taste.

3161
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:02,400
So what have we heard him sing?

3162
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:04,560
We've heard him sing Beyond the Sea.

3163
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:08,400
He sang Bridge Over Troubled Water,

3164
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:10,480
Piano Man.

3165
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:12,720
You know, this was, as I've said the last time,

3166
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:13,920
this was not his first choice.

3167
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:16,000
He wanted to sing Blackbird until he was told

3168
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,640
that that was a Paul song, not a John song.

3169
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:20,480
So between all of these songs,

3170
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:24,040
it's almost like Kevin Spacey only knows

3171
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:25,920
extremely famous songs.

3172
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:31,480
Almost like it's only obvious karaoke.

3173
02:18:31,480 --> 02:18:32,480
I don't know if you know this one,

3174
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:34,240
it's called Don't Stop Believin'.

3175
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:39,240
I like older stuff.

3176
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:42,080
And then he hears tonight's gonna be a good night.

3177
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:45,280
And he's like, maybe this new stuff isn't so bad after all.

3178
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:50,640
The current John Lennon is Will.I.Am.

3179
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:52,760
Oh man, Scott, you crushed it.

3180
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:56,280
That was absolutely awful.

3181
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:58,000
By it, you mean your spirits.

3182
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:01,120
Yeah, I feel sick.

3183
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:05,400
You really, in an alternate dimension,

3184
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:08,600
in a know me too dimension,

3185
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:10,320
or where he just kept getting away with it,

3186
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:13,320
you know he would be in the Gal Gadot, imagine.

3187
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:15,480
Oh, yeah.

3188
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:16,480
For sure.

3189
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:19,200
Well, he also would have been,

3190
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:21,960
there were Broadway productions of both Network

3191
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:23,800
and To Kill a Mockingbird,

3192
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:27,040
and 100% he would have been in one of those.

3193
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:27,880
Yeah.

3194
02:19:27,880 --> 02:19:29,560
If he had not been cast out.

3195
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:31,000
What I've been watching,

3196
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:32,880
or Eva, go ahead.

3197
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:33,880
No, you go ahead.

3198
02:19:33,880 --> 02:19:36,160
I was gonna say, I've been watching these videos

3199
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:39,440
of all, like a lot of musicians doing a concert

3200
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:41,320
for in their living room or something

3201
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:43,360
during the quarantine time.

3202
02:19:43,360 --> 02:19:46,480
I would imagine he would be giving us a lot of content.

3203
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:48,320
I mean, he should be giving us a lot of content,

3204
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:49,600
which is why it's confusing about it,

3205
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:53,080
but I feel like that would be a ripe time for him

3206
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:57,400
to really comfort us as a nation and a world.

3207
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:00,080
Did he ever croon with Seth MacFarlane?

3208
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:00,920
Ooh.

3209
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:01,760
Is there a problem over there?

3210
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:03,000
Very good question.

3211
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,680
That's worth a Google.

3212
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:05,800
I don't know if did everyone,

3213
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:06,640
has everyone seen this?

3214
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:07,560
I have some clips.

3215
02:20:07,560 --> 02:20:10,560
He does do the Dean Martin duet.

3216
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:12,640
What?

3217
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:15,160
There's two songs he duets with Dean Martin on

3218
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:16,640
on a Dean Martin album.

3219
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:18,520
Oh no.

3220
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:21,680
He wait, he's, wait, it's a posthumous duet?

3221
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:22,520
Yeah.

3222
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:24,960
With a dead Dean Martin and like a Natalie Cole thing?

3223
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,800
With, oh no.

3224
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:27,240
All right, oh, real quick.

3225
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:29,640
I will say that no,

3226
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:34,640
because there's a predator joke on season four of Family Guy

3227
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,720
and they were always mad.

3228
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:37,560
He was always mad about that.

3229
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:41,240
Oh, it seems like Family Guy like referenced a lot of them

3230
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:42,080
before they happened.

3231
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:44,200
So Family Guy was like ahead of the curve

3232
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:45,720
on all the Me Too's.

3233
02:20:45,720 --> 02:20:46,560
Yeah.

3234
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:47,400
Difficult people.

3235
02:20:47,400 --> 02:20:50,480
I think there's a few Kevin Spacey jokes.

3236
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:52,000
Spacey and Max Landis.

3237
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:52,840
They made it to Max.

3238
02:20:52,840 --> 02:20:53,680
Nice.

3239
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:54,520
Yeah.

3240
02:20:54,520 --> 02:20:55,600
All right, real quick here.

3241
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:59,400
Uh, oh no.

3242
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:01,800
192 take 15.

3243
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:03,960
Well, I gotta get a tattoo at 1230

3244
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,360
and I don't wanna be late.

3245
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:06,200
One, two.

3246
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:10,840
Come on, Dean.

3247
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:12,560
Show us how it's done.

3248
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:13,400
No!

3249
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:14,240
No!

3250
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:16,280
I'm lucky and one guy beat me.

3251
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:18,160
Oh, that was Kevin and that was Dean singing it first.

3252
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:19,560
I kissed her and she kissed me.

3253
02:21:19,560 --> 02:21:20,680
Jason is dancing in full box.

3254
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:22,480
I like the fellow once.

3255
02:21:22,480 --> 02:21:23,320
Jason is dancing in full box.

3256
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:26,560
Like the fellow once said,

3257
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:28,920
ain't that a kick in the head?

3258
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:34,160
The room was completely black.

3259
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:37,720
I hugged her and she hugged back.

3260
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:40,960
Like the sailor said, quote,

3261
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:43,400
ain't that a hole in the boat?

3262
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:48,200
My head keeps spinning.

3263
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:51,240
I go to sleep and keep dreaming.

3264
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:52,080
That's Kevin.

3265
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:54,200
This is us to be.

3266
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:57,720
Yeah, my life is gonna be.

3267
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:02,800
Be beautiful like the sunshine.

3268
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:03,640
All right, that's it.

3269
02:22:03,640 --> 02:22:04,800
No more.

3270
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:06,200
No more.

3271
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:07,960
The perfect thing to have today would be

3272
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:11,400
if Dean and Kevin did a duet of Baby It's Cold Outside.

3273
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:12,240
Oh.

3274
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:18,840
If only.

3275
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:21,560
Well, we should start summarizing

3276
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:23,800
highlights.

3277
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:26,000
What do we learn anything here?

3278
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,080
I mean, we learned that he,

3279
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:29,440
what's the word grooming?

3280
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:32,160
He groomed the whole world is what he did.

3281
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:35,600
He groomed us with song and dance and harmonica

3282
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:39,200
and everyone allowed it to happen.

3283
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:41,400
This was right in front of our faces the whole time.

3284
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:42,640
Yeah.

3285
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:45,000
Yeah, I was saying like the nine,

3286
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,440
again, we all took for granted

3287
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:49,640
how like beloved he was in the 90s.

3288
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:51,080
So then it was you're saying, Scott,

3289
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:55,120
every time he's on stage doing literally anything

3290
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:57,160
an audience is losing their mind.

3291
02:22:58,600 --> 02:22:59,440
Like that's how.

3292
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:01,080
That's in their minds.

3293
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:03,640
That's like, oh wow, the American beauty guy is singing.

3294
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:05,040
Holy shit.

3295
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:06,920
I love American beauty.

3296
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:11,280
But I will say like he was so good in the 90s

3297
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:12,560
when I was watching Payette Forward,

3298
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:16,800
I did have the pangs of like, oh, he was great.

3299
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:18,600
He was so good.

3300
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:19,440
Yeah, I mean that's true.

3301
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:23,800
So maybe if you think someone is great, never tell them.

3302
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:24,640
Yeah.

3303
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:26,280
Don't let it go to their head.

3304
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:29,760
Withhold compliments until after someone has passed away

3305
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:31,560
and then say everything you think

3306
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:33,240
because it will ruin them

3307
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:35,360
if they get confident for even a second.

3308
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:39,360
And there should be no award shows anymore of any kind.

3309
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:41,040
That's yeah, let's keep that going.

3310
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:42,560
There's plenty of things I would,

3311
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:44,880
we don't need to come back after the quarantine.

3312
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:46,320
Yeah.

3313
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:47,160
But.

3314
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:48,480
But one of those things is,

3315
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:49,600
oh sorry, no, go ahead Mike.

3316
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:53,240
I was just gonna say, there are budding,

3317
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:55,120
there are budding spaceys right now.

3318
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:58,800
We don't even know necessarily who in their 20s, 30s

3319
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:01,120
that we go, oh, you know, that young up and comer

3320
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:03,520
is a really great actor or actress.

3321
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:06,800
We kind of want, I feel like we want to foster environments

3322
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:10,840
where they get to do a version of I've Got a Feeling

3323
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:13,840
that is our overseas award show for us,

3324
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:14,680
but for our entertainment.

3325
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:17,360
But you're also saying like we need to keep them in check.

3326
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:18,200
Like we need to keep.

3327
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:20,480
I'm not saying, I'm actually saying,

3328
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:21,960
I'm saying the opposite.

3329
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:25,000
I'm disagreeing that they need to be kept in check.

3330
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,160
If they're friends of yours, keep them in check.

3331
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:28,000
Yeah.

3332
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,480
But if they're not.

3333
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:31,320
Let it fly.

3334
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:33,320
We kind of want to see how far we can get.

3335
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:36,280
We want to see what country they can do an award show in

3336
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:39,760
and how many different songs, modern pop songs,

3337
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:42,800
preferably they can perform parodies of.

3338
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,320
So 10 years from now, Shersha Ronan is in doing

3339
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:50,320
like a Moscow, like some sort of film, Moscow Oscars.

3340
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:54,320
And she's like, she's like doing a Lady Gaga thing.

3341
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:57,560
And we're like, Oh, she didn't know Shersha was bad.

3342
02:24:57,560 --> 02:25:00,560
It's like, I wonder what would Catherine Hepburn have said

3343
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:01,440
if she was here?

3344
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:02,280
Wow.

3345
02:25:05,400 --> 02:25:07,560
Well, there is one of these.

3346
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:09,200
And when I say, I don't mean to say

3347
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:13,080
there's a spacey in our midst because what I think also,

3348
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:15,720
probably Mike, you want to say you like the,

3349
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:18,120
just being overly confident and just diving into shit

3350
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:18,960
you can't do.

3351
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:22,440
I bet you don't like being sex pests and murderers.

3352
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:23,280
Yes.

3353
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:24,120
Yes, that's true.

3354
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:24,960
Yes.

3355
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:28,440
I think that part they could get rid of.

3356
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:29,720
I don't care for it.

3357
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:35,240
No, but we would like a posthumous Dean Martin,

3358
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:38,840
Billie Eilish duet, right folks?

3359
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:40,680
Doesn't that sound good?

3360
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:41,520
We're better yet.

3361
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:45,080
Billie Eilish on the tribute album.

3362
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:48,960
Billie Eilish sings John Prine on the tribute album.

3363
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:50,880
Well, she's too much of a musician though.

3364
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:55,880
You, we need, it's gotta be, well, Gal Gadot, you know?

3365
02:25:55,880 --> 02:25:57,680
She's already, she's making a go at it.

3366
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:00,280
She took a big stab at this kind of thing.

3367
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:03,360
I think Renner does a lot of spacey-esque work every day.

3368
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:04,200
Yeah.

3369
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:07,600
I am gonna listen to his House of the Rising Sun cover

3370
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:09,560
to recover from the spacey covers.

3371
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:12,600
I had a little bit of a flashback

3372
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:14,160
as I was watching some of these clips

3373
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:16,240
and especially the award show clips too,

3374
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:19,840
a topic that we probably have to address on the second gate

3375
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:24,560
is the return of Bruno, Bruce Willis' music career

3376
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:26,040
and performance.

3377
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:26,880
Yeah.

3378
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:29,080
Another like very confident guy.

3379
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:31,600
Like he saw Bruce Springsteen and Billie Jolie,

3380
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:33,200
goes, I'm from the same place they are.

3381
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,640
I can do this.

3382
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:37,480
That, yeah.

3383
02:26:38,480 --> 02:26:39,800
And we discussed the town,

3384
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:42,360
his town that he took over in Idaho.

3385
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:43,200
No. No.

3386
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:44,440
There was this town called Haley, Idaho.

3387
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:46,680
And I, my boyfriend and I at the time

3388
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:48,600
were like driving through Idaho to go to the Rainbow Gathering

3389
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:50,080
and we just found this town.

3390
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:51,680
We stopped for lunch basically.

3391
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:54,280
We didn't realize we were just in Bruce Willis' town

3392
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:55,720
that he had taken over. Oh my God.

3393
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:58,000
And he'd like, there was like a jazz club.

3394
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,240
There was a theater where he was doing True West

3395
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:02,200
with some guy from the town.

3396
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:05,320
And I guess eventually he just abandoned it,

3397
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:07,600
but we did have lunch at his own barbecue restaurant

3398
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:09,400
and there were pictures of him on the wall

3399
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:11,000
because this was like 2000.

3400
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,200
Wow.

3401
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:13,520
Yeah.

3402
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:17,800
And it was like peak, like Bruno, like late Bruno era.

3403
02:27:17,800 --> 02:27:18,640
Right. Wow.

3404
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:20,080
That's crazy.

3405
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:24,280
And where is the pilot you obviously wrote about that

3406
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:26,120
being optioned for?

3407
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:27,800
I mean, that's a good story.

3408
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:33,880
We'll do the town episode, the Bruce Willis town.

3409
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:37,800
I'd love to do Bruno and we're winding it down,

3410
02:27:37,800 --> 02:27:38,720
but just drive really fast

3411
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:39,760
because of your background.

3412
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:42,440
Mike is reminding me he did a Clarence Darrow one man show

3413
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:46,320
as you told us at a tennis stadium at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

3414
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:48,720
And demanded that people clap for him

3415
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:51,000
for doing it on family.

3416
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,000
And he loves tennis.

3417
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,040
He's a big tennis guy.

3418
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:55,440
He goes to all the matches and won awards.

3419
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:58,880
There was an award show where he was using a cane

3420
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:01,080
and it was because he got a tennis injury.

3421
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:02,520
Oh.

3422
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:06,000
And he still brags that he was like,

3423
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,600
and I was going for a shot.

3424
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:10,240
I was going for a shot and he goes, and I got it.

3425
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:11,080
Don't worry.

3426
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:12,480
Match point folks.

3427
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:13,680
Match point.

3428
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:16,320
Can we get a little bit of spacey-esque confidence

3429
02:28:16,320 --> 02:28:19,240
and check, did we break the record?

3430
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:21,680
I don't think maybe not because there was a break in there

3431
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:23,360
because there was some technical difficulty.

3432
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:24,680
Yeah.

3433
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:25,520
I don't think we did.

3434
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:27,960
I think we're a little under, but we're pretty,

3435
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:29,840
I mean, we're in the top five, I think.

3436
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:33,200
I can sign off and you guys can just keep talking.

3437
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:35,400
No, please don't give that away.

3438
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:36,240
We'll use it.

3439
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:37,080
It'll be another hour.

3440
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:40,320
Well, that means that the record remains to be broken.

3441
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:42,680
Griffin Newman, I challenge you.

3442
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:45,040
But for now, Eva Anderson,

3443
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:48,400
you survived a truly torturous butchers the ride.

3444
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:50,800
Oh, guys, thank you so much for having me.

3445
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:52,480
This was a dream.

3446
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:55,440
I miss you seeing all your IRL faces,

3447
02:28:55,440 --> 02:28:59,840
but I know that as the Prince of Peace,

3448
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:01,920
the Prophet of Peace once told us,

3449
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:06,040
we live in really, what is it, fucked up times?

3450
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,320
What does he say?

3451
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:09,160
What is it?

3452
02:29:09,160 --> 02:29:11,280
We live in, anyway.

3453
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:15,480
Well, he told us to not do anything

3454
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:17,560
you haven't fucking done before.

3455
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:20,920
And I'm incredibly pissed off.

3456
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:21,760
You know, we're-

3457
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:24,600
You must restore America to its,

3458
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:28,000
we must do what we can to restore America.

3459
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:29,400
And that includes your hosts.

3460
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:34,360
And that includes Mike, Scott, Jason, and Eva.

3461
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:35,360
Down and out.

3462
02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:41,120
All right, now everyone do that like you're a bird.

3463
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:45,400
That'll do it.

3464
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:48,000
Thank you for joining us via satellite, Eva.

3465
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,160
Thanks for being our first via satellite guest.

3466
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:52,320
Thank you everybody for listening and bearing with it.

3467
02:29:52,320 --> 02:29:53,800
And I imagine since you don't,

3468
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:54,800
no one has commutes anymore.

3469
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:57,360
This took a month and a half to listen to.

3470
02:29:57,360 --> 02:29:59,280
So thanks for recommitting the time.

3471
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:01,400
This was wonderful.

3472
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:03,080
I want you to make love, not war.

3473
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:05,160
I've told you that before.

3474
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:06,000
Goodbye.

3475
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:06,840
Bye.
