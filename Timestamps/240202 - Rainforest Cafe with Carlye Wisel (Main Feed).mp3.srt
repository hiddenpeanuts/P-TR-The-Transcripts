1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,160
Forever.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,420
of a man in a humid house.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,080
It may contain massive rotting mushrooms,

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,100
robots of people in the Epstein files,

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,660
and robots of trees purchased by different people

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,100
in the Epstein files.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,500
Carly Weisel returns to the show to talk about

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,660
her exotic expedition to the Rainforest Cafe

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,780
on Podcast the Ride.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,600
["Rainforest Cafe Theme Song"]

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,120
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast that is dedicated

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,380
to protecting endangered animals,

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,580
specifically rotting dead-eyed,

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,920
barely functioning animatronic ones.

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm Scott Gardner, there's Mike Carlson.

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,980
I'm here, yes, and the empathy I have

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,300
for decaying robots is strong.

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,180
I empathize with animals that are living,

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,060
that can breathe and pump blood.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,660
But they'll figure themselves out.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,880
Animatronics are truly helpless.

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,480
No money is ever put into their maintenance

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,320
unless they're into fixing the less and less popular

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,580
restaurant that they live in.

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,620
Yeah, and real animals, they have the ability to heal.

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,960
Robots can't heal unless man decides.

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,280
You know what I'm saying?

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,200
Yeah, unless man or Landry's decides

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,700
that it's their time to heal.

30
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,540
I'm here, I'm trying to get the bucket and sheet metal

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,340
set up for the thunderstorm that will happen

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,460
every 20 minutes on this episode.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,460
Oh, I see, oh, you'll be providing live.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,680
Oh, great, yeah, yeah, get clapping.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
I regret this choice already.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,520
It's a fun idea, it's a fun gimmick,

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,040
but ultimately, yeah, it's gonna wear you out.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,660
Probably shouldn't have buckets of water

39
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,040
by this many wires.

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,540
I think that's right, yeah.

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,480
We'll be safe.

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,220
Yeah, try to contain it over there.

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,780
Yeah, hey, we're excited to be talking

44
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,180
about Rainforest Cafe.

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,120
We've touched on it a little bit before.

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,500
Rainforest Cafe came up in the downtown Disney ordeal

47
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,960
with former employee of Rainforest Cafe, Julia Prescott,

48
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,500
returning to the show soon.

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,260
But we thought, I mean, we have not truly done

50
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,320
the deep dive, I thought, hey, there's still meat

51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,320
on these mojo bones, so let's get into it,

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,600
especially because returning Victorious

53
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,000
from a recent Rainforest Cafe expedition

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,900
and also returning to this show for the first time

55
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,520
in nearly two years, for the first time

56
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,760
I believe so, for the first time since becoming a mom

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,360
for a podcast, very amusing, it's Carly Weisel, hi.

58
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,640
Hello, hi.

59
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,400
Hi, welcome back.

60
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,540
I gotta say, I didn't think after two years

61
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,620
I would come back to such Rainforest Cafe slander

62
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,040
about the audio animatronics because we'll get into it,

63
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,820
but I thought they were in fine condition.

64
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,920
Oh jeez, well, I was impressed.

65
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,740
Look, I'm the one who's out of date

66
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,320
because you've been to one much more recently than me.

67
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm pulling from four years ago.

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,600
Oh, you're not taking a full work day

69
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,420
to drive to Ontario Mills to go to Rainforest Cafe?

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,260
That is what it takes.

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,680
It's to go to the nearest Rainforest Cafe to us.

72
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,760
That's an hour or more for everyone here.

73
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,260
Yeah.

74
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,500
Oh, it was at least two.

75
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,200
Jeez.

76
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,160
It was two flat.

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,120
Wow, wow.

78
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

79
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,620
Depending on where you go also,

80
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,860
and that's one of those drives that just keeps going.

81
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,540
You start to suspect this has to be done soon.

82
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,380
No, it doesn't.

83
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,700
And then you look and it's like, oh, an hour 19, okay, okay.

84
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,380
We're still going.

85
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,920
My God, it's an expedition.

86
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,240
I was very excited to hear you were doing it

87
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,060
and have done it.

88
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,660
I'm really excited to get into it.

89
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,980
But also we've not, we haven't had,

90
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,260
you haven't been on it a little bit

91
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,480
and we're so excited to have you again.

92
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,260
I know, I'm happy to be back.

93
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,660
Much has changed for you.

94
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,160
And I'm just excited.

95
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,040
I haven't really talked to you about

96
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,220
your, a new dimension of your theme park fandom

97
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,960
and excursions doing it as a parent.

98
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,560
Yeah.

99
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,080
You've done a bunch of it, it seems like.

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,500
I have.

101
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,320
I've been really ramming it in.

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,280
I did Disney World for four days

103
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,740
and then I've gone to Disneyland twice now

104
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,000
and I'm gonna be going back to Disneyland

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,180
I think every two weeks.

106
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,940
I'm all in.

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,380
Wow.

108
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,460
That a lot, really?

109
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,060
Oh my God.

110
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,720
I know.

111
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,400
That's just your, that's your local park.

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,960
Your local playground is Disneyland.

113
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,240
I mean, not just because LA only has golf courses

114
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,300
and not really public parks.

115
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,320
We won't get into that, but.

116
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,160
Oh, not well, see that's the Burbank thing.

117
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:36,760
Burbank.

118
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,200
Yeah, being a Burbank parent, there's so many,

119
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,880
it's crawling with, you can have a new one

120
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,180
for every day of the week and never repeat them.

121
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,840
I keep finding them still.

122
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,960
Yeah, Burbank is a magical place.

123
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,160
Okay, I mean I have to explore this.

124
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,740
I've looked into dog parks in Burbank

125
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,640
and those are great too.

126
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,420
Oh sure, yeah, that's good kid entertainment for sure.

127
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,240
But yeah, you're right.

128
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,740
I guess for you it just makes sense.

129
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,020
Just head down to Disneyland.

130
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,780
Yeah, once we got over the,

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,900
I mean for people who don't have kids,

132
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,860
this is so boring, I'm so sorry.

133
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,260
But once we got over the threshold of she can be

134
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,920
in the car seat with someone in the back seat with her

135
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,560
and that means we can get to and from, then we're fine.

136
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,420
And wait, as opposed to, wait, what's the-

137
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,340
I can't drive her alone.

138
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,040
Cause she, when, the longest I can go

139
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,880
is probably 20 minutes before she's like, no, no, no, no, no,

140
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,020
no, no, no, I want out.

141
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,680
Oh geez.

142
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you have any entertainment back there?

143
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,780
We got a little portable DVD player,

144
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,360
like old school DVD player, we can throw Pixar movies

145
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,780
and Thomas the Tank Engine on there.

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,420
We're almost there.

147
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,100
Okay, okay.

148
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,160
We're still at, like a rattle is fun.

149
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,440
We're still coming out of that.

150
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,940
Wait, cause how old now?

151
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,660
Well, she's 10 months, but she's loving a toy.

152
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,960
She's loving to explore.

153
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
She's only 10 months, I thought it was, wow.

154
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,880
10 months, yeah.

155
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,740
I thought it was longer.

156
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,980
Oh crazy, well geez.

157
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,620
Going well, you having-

158
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,680
Yeah, she's, as far as I know, she's growing,

159
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,380
which is the only metric they can really measure.

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,860
That means you're doing your job right now.

161
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,180
She's alive and eating.

162
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,940
Yeah, it's going well.

163
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,960
It's just, I can't believe this world is run by parents

164
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,280
and they're all awake enough.

165
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,180
I didn't know this level of exhaustion.

166
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,340
And now that I do, I don't trust anyone operating a vehicle.

167
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,960
I just can't believe people are flying planes out here.

168
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,140
Flying planes with kids.

169
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,060
Like you have a sick kid and then you go fly a plane.

170
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,560
Impossible.

171
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,180
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,940
I know, like our main thing is doing this

173
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,860
and then we'll be like grumpy doing this

174
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,640
cause of a bad night.

175
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,300
Yeah, same deal.

176
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,320
Oh man, I gotta-

177
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,340
Oh, a theme park podcast.

178
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,200
How do you do that?

179
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,400
Gotta go in my office and talk about Lunar New Year.

180
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,740
How will I ever survive?

181
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,560
Like, I can't believe it.

182
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,880
Meanwhile, dignitaries, heads of state,

183
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,040
and yes, people who operate heavy equipment

184
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,720
all do it with more children than we have.

185
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,020
Navy SEALs.

186
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,560
Navy SEALs.

187
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,160
They must.

188
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,100
I would assume.

189
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,160
I would assume too.

190
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,480
Unless they, Navy SEALs aren't like recruited

191
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,700
from like an orphanage or something, right?

192
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,040
Like where they just like train them to be like super spot.

193
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,500
But even if we don't know about Navy SEALs,

194
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,940
people who run cruise ships.

195
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,740
People who run cruise ships.

196
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,660
Captains of ships are just on a ship with the kids.

197
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,600
Right, and they just keep getting bigger.

198
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,380
They keep getting water parks and stuff put on them.

199
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,520
I see we have the same algorithm.

200
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,280
That's right, yes.

201
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,160
Oh, like with innovations and how crazy cruise ships can be.

202
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,060
There was a new cruise ship that launched recently.

203
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,740
And so my whole feed is like,

204
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,740
can you believe how many water slides we got?

205
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,720
It is, yeah, they're insane, yeah.

206
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,280
So no, those people have kids.

207
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,660
I know, I can't believe it.

208
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,660
To all the parents out there, wow.

209
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,840
Wow.

210
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,860
You had no idea.

211
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,140
You're doing great.

212
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,020
How hard everyone was working.

213
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,980
Yeah, I know what you mean.

214
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,540
I had no idea.

215
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,320
I thought life was hard when I didn't get seven hours of sleep.

216
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,580
You know, it's like, oh, I didn't get my latte.

217
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,080
I can't survive the day.

218
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,040
I mean, I still feel that way,

219
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,540
but now it just has more oomph to it.

220
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

221
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,760
People are more willing to say, oh, I see, okay, okay.

222
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,280
Before, no excuses, especially from parents.

223
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,300
Didn't know what the other side was, now I'm there.

224
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,260
But I love it.

225
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,440
It's very fun.

226
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,620
It's very weird to have a tiny version of you

227
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,320
enter the room and you're like, oh, hello.

228
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,880
They just appear.

229
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,800
It's so, I can't wrap my head around it

230
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,640
and it's been almost a year.

231
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,740
Yeah, I am interested to know if that was ever,

232
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,760
was that common 50 years ago?

233
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,800
It feels like it wasn't.

234
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,620
It feels like, I don't know,

235
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,640
I guess we're all a little bit more children

236
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,800
into our adult years.

237
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Yes.

238
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
And that's part of why it feels a little strange still,

239
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
to be like, there's a little person that looks like my father

240
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,340
when he was a kid.

241
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,880
And I see his baby pictures when she walks in.

242
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,460
When I see her face.

243
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,540
And I go, whoa.

244
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,000
And if I've been gone for six hours,

245
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,800
I come back and go, there's a baby in here.

246
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,500
Exactly, yeah.

247
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,420
It's my baby.

248
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,720
It must be because we all had this extended

249
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,540
child adulthood where we professionally had fun.

250
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,600
And we still have fun.

251
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,440
God bless it.

252
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,460
Boy, you're really needing

253
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,620
those accrued memories.

254
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,340
So by the time you start putting it all up.

255
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,220
But it also, but then you get this kind of,

256
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,740
then there's a perma kid that happens

257
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,360
from having a kid around,

258
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,700
which you'll especially experience

259
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,920
going to the parks.

260
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,080
Yeah, it does.

261
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,940
Not to name drop, but the one person I always think of

262
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,260
is that John Stamos specifically told me

263
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,740
that it's gonna be more magical with a kid.

264
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,800
And I remember he told me when he didn't know

265
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,420
I was pregnant and I was pregnant.

266
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,220
And I was like, boy, I hope he's right.

267
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,760
I don't know, I don't know.

268
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,000
And he was right.

269
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,300
It's a different type of magical to be at somewhere

270
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,260
like Disney World with a mini version of you

271
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,940
and have them watch it for the first time

272
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,680
so that you're not as focused on like,

273
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,860
I don't like the way the Frozen animatronics work.

274
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,020
Your child is just enjoying it.

275
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,460
I know.

276
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,900
We've had to dredge it back up, I feel like,

277
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,940
to do this podcast.

278
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,280
Because although you haven't done

279
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,300
your official Disneyland trip.

280
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,480
No, we have not done it.

281
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:42,960
Yeah, it does.

282
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,920
It makes you shut up about a lot.

283
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,840
You're just like, it's great.

284
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,580
It's so good.

285
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,100
It's just good.

286
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,240
They did a good job.

287
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,300
It's a place to entertain this kid for five hours.

288
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,560
I'm thrilled.

289
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,780
Yeah, it's a new, it's a magic renewed.

290
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,960
Yeah, that sounds great.

291
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,280
God, that would be a good ad campaign.

292
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,600
Hey, yeah, that's a word they have into it.

293
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,100
Renewed.

294
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,060
Renewed.

295
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,320
Yeah.

296
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,480
That would be a good fireworks show, renewed.

297
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,300
I'll remind you that the only way to get a magic key

298
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,500
is renewal.

299
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,180
Oh yeah, true.

300
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,720
I missed the last round.

301
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,200
I don't know if I'll, yeah, I'm still lost on that one.

302
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

303
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,980
It's a dog fight to get it.

304
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,300
You missed the 30 hours notice?

305
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,020
God.

306
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,800
Yeah, that's right.

307
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,440
They barely said it, and you're in a big line,

308
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,720
and then like, oh my God.

309
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,760
Wait, what's our-

310
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,920
You need to set up text messaging alerts

311
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,620
for Scott Gustin tweets.

312
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,180
I see.

313
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
Yeah, that's the only way to ride anything out.

314
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,480
because they were sold on whatever day it was.

315
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,280
The next day I was going with that SoCal resident ticket,

316
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
the three visit ticket, which you can't-

317
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,160
That's why, I already had my ticket,

318
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,540
so I don't want a pass now.

319
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,460
And you can upgrade from that ticket if you,

320
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,700
like I was gonna start it the next day.

321
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,280
So I thought, oh, I'll go to the park the next day,

322
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
I'll scan in with the ticket, and I'll upgrade it,

323
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,060
I'll save money.

324
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,320
I just pray that the passes are available,

325
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,080
and they weren't, and I saw his tweet,

326
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,240
because I got the alert, that was like,

327
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,780
everything's sold out with the resident pass,

328
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,840
and I immediately bought it.

329
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,720
I just ate the cost.

330
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,120
Okay.

331
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,080
Because I had to do it, because Scott Gustin told me to.

332
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,420
I had family visiting, and I was like,

333
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,880
I made reservations on these park hoppers,

334
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,020
but I gotta renew them, and it used to be

335
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,500
you would just walk up and say,

336
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,900
I wanna put this towards an annual pass.

337
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,120
And now there's like one ticket window open,

338
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,960
and there's a two hour line at City Hall,

339
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,560
and I'm like, I can't, I just can't.

340
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,920
I know, I feel you.

341
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,320
I was there, and I am still annoyed that I ate,

342
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,400
what, $225?

343
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,520
Right, yeah, yeah.

344
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,840
But that's why I'm going back, to kind of,

345
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,920
to heal that wound.

346
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,760
Get your money's worth.

347
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,700
Yeah, try to go as much as possible.

348
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,160
So I'll stop being mad at the place, yeah, yeah.

349
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,180
But look, you also, you've got plenty of other

350
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,320
entertainment options, and themed experience options,

351
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,000
and animatronic options, because, you know,

352
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,440
not much further than Disneyland is a magical realm,

353
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,080
a magical place, where you're transported

354
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,920
to another continent, to another world,

355
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,520
to the rainforest, as you got to be several months ago.

356
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,020
Yeah, what happened here?

357
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,600
What was your experience that led you to this,

358
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,620
and led you to wanna talk to us about it?

359
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,820
So, I have a group of friends who, for probably,

360
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,100
almost three years, we had been joking about

361
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,960
going to Rainforest Cafe.

362
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,560
And it was all that we, someone, I think my friend Amy

363
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,340
brought it up as a joke, and we were like,

364
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,900
wait, I actually wanna do that.

365
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,280
And we all wanted to do it.

366
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,020
And one of us lives in the Bay Area.

367
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
It's all, this group of friends I'm talking about

368
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,880
are all Hollywood people, with incredible jobs,

369
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,020
and I don't wanna like, fully, I got their consent

370
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,340
to talk about them on this podcast.

371
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,480
But like, one friend works at Pixar,

372
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,540
another's a producer, another one like,

373
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,300
makes all these shows, and they all were all in

374
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,180
on this convoluted idea of driving all day

375
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,060
to go to Rainforest Cafe.

376
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,700
And the friend at Pixar finally had the day open,

377
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,140
and we all traveled to it.

378
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,920
And we found it on the count, like, we were going.

379
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,700
But what we realized after the fact

380
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,660
was that the only day we could all do it

381
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,780
was the day after the Taylor Swift show.

382
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,180
Which was one of my only big nights out in a long time.

383
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,340
So, I not only drove all day to go to Rainforest Cafe,

384
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,660
I did it extremely hungover.

385
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,220
Wow.

386
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:19,940
Extremely.

387
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,420
Friendship bracelet.

388
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,820
A friendship bracelet intact on my wrist.

389
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,720
Just got in the car the next morning

390
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,280
with so much coffee in my body, and drove.

391
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,860
Those go late too, those went late.

392
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,060
Oh yeah, hours, yeah.

393
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,180
I saw Beck at the forum next door,

394
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,720
and all the Beck dads were trying to like,

395
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,440
beat the traffic, that was the main concern.

396
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,160
It's like, okay, technically see the end of the show,

397
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,720
okay, run to the, okay, she's still playing,

398
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,280
thank God, let's get the fuck out of here.

399
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,660
Oh yeah, and we had a, I went with a group,

400
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,080
so we had a party bus situation.

401
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,620
Oh my God.

402
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,360
But two of us couldn't find the party bus,

403
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,220
so we were there a lot longer than I think you would have.

404
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,680
I'm pretty sure that I texted my friends a photo of me

405
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,560
in front of the beautiful Rainforest Cafe sign,

406
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,360
which I'm sure we'll get into,

407
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,220
and they texted back that they were still in bed.

408
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
Oh my God.

409
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,440
So, wow.

410
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,320
So you had that much time to kill at Ontario Mills?

411
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,100
So you went to lunch?

412
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,680
Oh no, I just didn't sleep.

413
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,460
Oh okay.

414
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,400
Oh no, the friends who didn't,

415
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,880
other friends that I went to the show with.

416
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,600
Oh gotcha, oh, not the people you would meet.

417
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,240
I went to Rainforest Cafe with three other ladies,

418
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,340
and one of them went to Taylor, I went to Taylor.

419
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,680
Okay, okay.

420
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,160
And we met up.

421
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,140
You're in the rainforest,

422
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,260
and they are in the comfort of their bed, oh my God.

423
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,760
Was there any thought to just taking the party bus

424
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,980
straight to the Rainforest Cafe?

425
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,260
If I could have gotten those girls on board,

426
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,400
that would have been a dream.

427
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,240
But people were laughing at me when I told them

428
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,520
the next day I was driving to California's only

429
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,740
remaining Rainforest Cafe.

430
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,900
Sure, yeah.

431
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,360
What was your era real quick,

432
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,780
just in general, what's your era?

433
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,900
I think my era was, I'm not too big of a fan,

434
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,280
but I'm gonna assimilate into this group

435
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,380
because this seems like a great night.

436
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,920
Now that I've seen the show,

437
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,140
I am a reputation girly as they say.

438
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,980
Folklore, I saw a show there.

439
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,360
Wow, folklore era.

440
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Oh, so chill.

441
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,480
Very chill.

442
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,100
I guess I engaged the most in 1989.

443
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,020
I love 1989.

444
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,700
That's mine too.

445
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,180
You're in 1989, oh okay.

446
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,440
Yeah, but no expert.

447
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,740
Okay, so this is an insane whirlwind,

448
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,920
although also the best.

449
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,740
What a great one to punch.

450
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,440
Oh yeah.

451
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,640
What do you think was fueling this enthusiasm?

452
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,620
What was making this group all salivate

453
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,580
for Rainforest Cafe so much?

454
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,240
I think it was the threat of them going away forever.

455
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,320
Because we've seen them really,

456
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,340
I mean if you look at that Wikipedia of closed ones,

457
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,080
it's frightening.

458
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,260
And we knew that we probably weren't gonna be able

459
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,580
to coordinate all of us being in Orlando at the same time.

460
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,100
So while this one was open and still thriving, I'd say,

461
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,860
definitely had to make it happen.

462
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,640
Great, great.

463
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,640
Yeah, it's true.

464
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,260
I figure, again, we touched on Rainforest Cafe

465
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,420
and we were in the underworld.

466
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,160
This was a paywall episode

467
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,800
for people who were just on the main feed.

468
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,100
But this was 2019 when we talked about,

469
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,620
mainly the downtown Disney one.

470
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,520
And I was expecting to look at the list and go,

471
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,500
all right, well in the over four years since that,

472
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,440
we've lost a lot of these.

473
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,920
And in fact, only four, only four have gone away

474
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,380
since we talked about it before.

475
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,840
London is gone, London has fallen.

476
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,800
London's gone, I was gonna say it's fallen.

477
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,780
All right, Dubai has fallen.

478
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,320
Oh wow, you didn't notice that.

479
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,000
Though I think it just moved,

480
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,500
I think it got replaced by another one.

481
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,900
And then both Chicagos, both Chicagos are gone.

482
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,840
For the two of us, that's a big deal.

483
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,300
That downtown Chicago one.

485
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,800
That looks insane.

486
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,620
That looks like a real highlight of the enterprise.

487
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,280
It was a huge part of my childhood.

488
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,480
Oh really, okay, okay.

489
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,520
For one of our, we do a turnabout Sadie Hawkins dance thing

490
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,180
in high school.

491
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,720
And part of it was that when you're a junior and senior,

492
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,320
you get to dress up in theme.

493
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,400
And so we all dressed up and I don't know why we did this.

494
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,360
We drove downtown in a limo to Rainforest Cafe.

495
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,340
So you did have a party bus kind of situation

496
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,360
to the Rainforest Cafe.

497
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,840
And I think that was the same year we went back

498
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,340
and the dance was at the high school

499
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,700
in the Chicago suburbs.

500
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,300
So we left basically a mile radius from school,

501
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,620
went downtown to Rainforest Cafe and then came back.

502
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,400
Which is how far, where was it?

503
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,720
Very far, I mean on a Saturday night.

504
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,700
Oh my God.

505
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,200
We had like post prom,

506
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,000
which the prom was close by the suburbs.

507
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,020
And then we took like a bus after prom down to the city

508
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,880
to get on a boat or something.

509
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,120
Yeah, what was that?

510
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,000
And then came back.

511
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,620
We could have gone to, I don't know,

512
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,620
Michael's and Highland Park.

513
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,300
There could have been other places we could have gone.

514
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,360
Yeah, that's weird.

515
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,060
But for some reason.

516
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,840
I don't know why.

517
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,500
Yeah, but Rainforest Cafe as a high schooler was fun.

518
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,300
Wow, wow.

519
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,460
It was so beautiful.

520
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,440
I don't know if you, I mean, if you Google the facade,

521
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,600
stunning.

522
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,120
I never went.

523
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,560
It's maybe the most ambitious one

524
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,440
besides like the notable ones I'd say

525
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,080
are like the volcano ones.

526
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,240
The Disney Springs one is volcano.

527
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,860
But often they're in these mills settings

528
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,080
where like they're grand once you get in,

529
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,280
but there's no real like outside of it.

530
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,360
But that Chicago one bonkers.

531
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,980
Massive, massive.

532
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,740
The silly, it must have seemed so,

533
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,640
I don't know what the surrounding of Chicago was.

534
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,660
It's kind of like the Rock and Roll McDonald's.

535
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,020
Oh, cool.

536
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,500
Or what the former Rock and Roll.

537
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,520
They kind of updated it, right?

538
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,620
Yeah, but I think so, yeah.

539
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,600
It's like still kind of, yeah.

540
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,420
I made it there.

541
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,820
That was on my, in 2008.

542
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,280
That was on my Chicago list.

543
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:23,720
I did it.

544
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,860
I did do the Rock and Roll McDonald's.

545
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
Yeah, so it was right by there.

546
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,180
So it was a little like, ooh, this is fun chain land.

547
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,800
Oh, cool.

548
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,260
Yeah.

549
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:29,660
Wow.

550
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,900
Have you seen it lately?

551
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,380
Like in person or photos, what happened to Chicago?

552
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,600
Oh, the rainforest?

553
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,020
No.

554
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,380
Yeah, it just kind of, they like stripped off

555
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,380
most of the branding is that.

556
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,240
The mushrooms.

557
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,300
Mainly what stayed is just like big rotting mushrooms.

558
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,080
Characters gone, signage gone,

559
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,540
but the mushrooms are too like baked into it to do anything.

560
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,600
And then just kind of the faded mural,

561
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
that's still up there.

562
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,840
They just kind of like cut and ran.

563
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
And then that building has just been nothing.

564
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,780
And it's actually been in a war for a long time

565
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,340
where various dispensaries have tried to get it.

566
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,520
I think multiple of them.

567
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,460
I feel like my dad sent me a, you know,

568
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,320
like a real dad link.

569
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,900
Like my dad sent me a link of this story.

570
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,260
Oh, man.

571
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,640
A dad link.

572
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,080
That's understanding of your interests.

573
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,520
Fantastic dad link.

574
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,640
Yeah, none of them worked out.

575
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:26,280
A various like, I think lawsuits and shadiness of companies.

576
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know where it stands today,

577
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,600
but yeah, it's just been this kind of creepy,

578
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,460
abandoned mushroom patch.

579
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,480
This is what fueled my desire to go.

580
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,000
Because I should publicly admit,

581
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,200
I foolishly never made it to Mars 2112.

582
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,020
And I will regret it for the rest of my life.

583
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,980
Lived in New York, never went.

584
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,820
Never went, walked past.

585
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,980
Oh, you had the opportunity.

586
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,800
Oh yeah, I had the opportunity.

587
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,680
Never went, never went, sadly.

588
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,500
And so now I'm like, I can't ever do that to myself again.

589
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,820
Was not Mars 2112 also in Schomburg?

590
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,460
Woodfield, yeah.

591
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,660
The Woodfield Mall, which we went to Chicago

592
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,640
and did a live show all about the Woodfield Mall.

593
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,820
So there was one, that's right.

594
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,500
That's why I was so.

595
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,100
It is so weird that this whole audience

596
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,660
doesn't know about Woodfield Mall.

597
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,500
That's so weird.

598
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,860
Yeah, we've primed them, we've conditioned them.

599
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,900
We've got it all at Woodfield.

600
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,140
There's a theme song?

601
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,640
There's a song, an old commercial,

602
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,960
which we sang in the show.

603
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,000
I was, I didn't grow up there,

604
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,020
but I was like, every time Mike talked about it,

605
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,260
it just really, it called to me, it intrigued me.

606
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,380
And for, with good reason.

607
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,840
Mars, and you didn't go to that one either?

608
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,800
I didn't go to that one.

609
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,200
Woodfield Mall was, so I learned to drive very late,

610
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,560
which means I was bad at it.

611
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,780
So when I finally was allowed to drive,

612
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,600
I think only senior year of high school,

613
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,220
or I would like drove with friends once they could drive.

614
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,000
We would go, Woodfield Mall was the furthest we could go.

615
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,360
That was like the furthest we could take ourselves in a car

616
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,240
and we would go to go to Forever 21,

617
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,640
because there wasn't one near us,

618
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,460
to get going out tops, and then we would drive back.

619
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,780
Going out tops, sure.

620
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,240
It was impossible to imagine a time

621
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,880
where Forever 21s weren't there.

622
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,000
I know, Woodfield was like,

623
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,440
we gotta go and get going out tops.

624
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,260
We're going to college.

625
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,360
We need tops.

626
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,720
And then we'd turn around.

627
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,940
It wasn't as, you know,

628
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,660
with theme restaurants, we're in our goal on that trip.

629
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,560
What's a key word of a going out top

630
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,700
from the mid 2000s or whenever?

631
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,140
Some sort of like gems on the neckline,

632
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,740
but a lower neckline, but gems.

633
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,520
And then maybe a, what I would call a bubble hem, I think?

634
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,980
Where it's, the bottom is elastic,

635
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,760
so it kind of poofs over, where it's like,

636
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,780
brrroop, brrroop.

637
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,520
And then anything that has some weird crisscross

638
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,440
in the back, crisscross straps.

639
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,920
Oh, I see, yeah, yeah, okay.

640
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,280
And, importantly, going out tops,

641
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,220
by the time you drove back home, they had disintegrated.

642
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,960
Oh, absolutely.

643
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,980
Yeah, they were not.

644
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,100
Yes, yeah.

645
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,280
Crisscross gone.

646
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,220
Yeah, crisscross gone.

647
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,000
If there was any rain

648
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,120
between leaving Woodfield Mall and our car, over.

649
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,260
Yeah, I remember in college,

650
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,020
people would talk about going out tops,

651
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,060
and there was also like, the subtext was like,

652
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,840
if we spill stuff on this or vomit on it,

653
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,520
it just will go in the garbage.

654
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,760
I keep everything, they're all gone.

655
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,020
It's not gonna withstand

656
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,380
an industrial dorm washing machine.

657
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,220
Oh my God.

658
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,540
And no one is going to the dry cleaner.

659
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,260
No one's, hey, can I get a ride from my dorm

660
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,920
to the cleaners?

661
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,060
Oh my God, that's so true.

662
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,520
I can't even, if you asked me,

663
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,500
if you would pay me a million dollars

664
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,640
to find a dry cleaners on the Urbana Champagne campus,

665
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,280
I would, I'd be poor, like it would never happen.

666
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,280
I can't think of a single dry cleaners in my college town.

667
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,760
There's gotta be one.

668
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,740
But I can't think of it,

669
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,200
and I walked those streets for years.

670
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,020
Well, I can't think of a Bloomington Normal dry cleaner.

671
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,620
Exactly.

672
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,420
When I spent a semester out here

673
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,240
and lived at the Oakwood Apartments over by Universal,

674
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,300
where they put up child actors and their families and stuff,

675
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,300
I did go to the cleaners,

676
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,680
because there was one in the complex,

677
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,540
because I needed like a windbreak.

678
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,200
I needed sleeves shortened,

679
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,260
sleeves and pant cuffs.

680
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,780
I need shortened.

681
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,160
I'm sorry, you were getting tailoring

682
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,880
while you were basically studying abroad?

683
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,080
You were so cool.

684
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,840
With the jacket I bought at Sears.

685
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,760
Wow!

686
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,620
The recently reopened Burbank Sears, that's right.

687
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,380
It's back.

688
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,500
They reopened it.

689
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,360
Wait, that's a current reopening, not a past one?

690
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,560
Yes, it's a current reopening.

691
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,680
It closed, it was closed for a while,

692
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,740
and then all of a sudden one day

693
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,120
they just turned the lights back on.

694
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,520
Burbank Sears is?

695
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,160
Burbank Sears is back.

696
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,260
It is, yeah.

697
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,320
The Disney memorabilia auction

698
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,080
was at the old bed bath and beyond,

699
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,760
not the old Sears.

700
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,580
Whoa.

701
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah, and it's not that it's gotten nice or anything.

702
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,360
People don't know why it's reopened either.

703
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,420
There's speculation in the media

704
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,840
why Sears has reopened, this specific Sears,

705
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,140
because most Sears have closed.

706
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,820
They still have an online business,

707
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,640
but there's a lot of like,

708
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,720
we reached out to Sears for comment,

709
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,540
and Sears is not being clear with us

710
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,840
why this is open again.

711
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,200
Is this a part of a strategy?

712
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,560
Is this just because they want the real estate

713
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,140
to at least be generating some,

714
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,760
nobody knows for sure.

715
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,140
What media is reaching out to Sears for comment?

716
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,760
CNN.

717
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,180
The Guardian, Wall Street Journal.

718
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,980
We spoke to the Burbank Sears.

719
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,660
Jason and I had a conversation about this,

720
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,220
and we were looking up online.

721
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,260
There might have been CNN.

722
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,660
We're trying to figure it out.

723
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,240
Speculation is a shorter way to type out

724
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
alleged money laundering.

725
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,800
It seems suspicious from the way that Sears

726
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,560
just isn't explaining why.

727
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:17,860
Yeah.

728
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,780
They haven't reopened the tax preparer,

729
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,440
and the optical, and the photo center.

730
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,480
You cannot get your taxes prepared anymore.

731
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,700
You cannot get eyeglasses at the Burbank Sears,

732
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,780
but you can still buy-

733
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,560
But you can pick up some Covington lounge wear,

734
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,400
some Structure button-up shirts.

735
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,020
You can buy some-

736
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,920
You know the brands that Sears has.

737
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,340
Oh, God!

738
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,000
I've spent some time at Sears, by the way.

739
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,980
I've got some Sears Christmas gifts in my time.

740
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,860
Oh, my God.

741
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,260
Damn, now you've lived.

742
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,440
So, in the same way where you're worried

743
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,660
about Rainforest Cafe going away,

744
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,400
I say get to the Burbank Sears while it's back open.

745
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,620
I'm gonna have to go after this.

746
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,420
I had no idea.

747
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,020
It feels like entering the set of The Phantom of the Opera.

748
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,340
No one knows why things are happening.

749
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,460
And it's just as scary in there.

750
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,660
It's just as bleak seeming, and dim, and unnerving.

751
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,940
It reopened, because it's like that cursed soundstage

752
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,560
that they eventually demolished on the Universal lot.

753
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,220
It's like, we left this set up.

754
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,760
Don't go in there.

755
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,920
Sears controls this.

756
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,300
Sears has a mind of its own.

757
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,220
Yeah, so we have lost, they are disappearing in California.

758
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,740
And this was all, it was down to one,

759
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,680
when we talked about it in the Downtown Disney ordeal.

760
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,860
South Coast Plaza had one, and Costa Mesa,

761
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,000
that's now Dentifung.

762
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,860
Fisherman's Wharf is gone.

763
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,860
Downtown Disney, as we all know,

764
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,120
has been a Star Wars store for quite some time.

765
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,280
Which it is funny that, for a lot of years now,

766
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,740
after Galaxy's Edge opens,

767
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,740
which is this new dimension of immersive theming,

768
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,160
and where you're watching all these materials

769
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,800
about how they studied the floors in Turkey,

770
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,100
and the tiles, and what would you be walking on,

771
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,480
and what type of stone would be.

772
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,480
And then meanwhile, at a public facing,

773
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,620
not far from that, for years now,

774
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,980
they've had a thing that's just like,

775
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,360
Star Wars Rainforest Cafe, it's fine.

776
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,960
It's like a temple, you know, there'd be a temple.

777
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,200
All right, it's not just a temple,

778
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,540
though, we put a satellite dish on it.

779
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,620
So that's Star Wars, that's what Star Wars is.

780
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,700
That's gonna be fine, right?

781
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,800
Yeah, and I don't think anyone's complaining.

782
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,460
I don't think anyone's.

783
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:20,780
Yeah, truly.

784
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,640
Why haven't we?

785
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,020
If they put it, well, I just think if they put the,

786
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,840
if they move the building into Galaxy's Edge, it would fit.

787
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,180
It would be fine.

788
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,820
I know, that's the thing.

789
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,360
Now, I point all that out, I'm not necessarily against it.

790
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,980
Yeah, I'm not saying.

791
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,440
I am pro that level of Star Wars broadness.

792
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,540
I'm like, yeah, sure, satellite,

793
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,260
we're fine, put a satellite on it.

794
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,200
I agree, yeah.

795
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,680
That would have been, it's fine,

796
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,860
and it could stay there forever.

797
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,440
I mean, it's not supposed to be, right?

798
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,140
It's going away.

799
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,960
I don't know.

800
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,760
Where is that?

801
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,440
For years now,

802
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,360
it's going away, I just say bring back Tracy Tree.

803
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,820
Tracy Tree could be a Star Wars character, why not?

804
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,020
Absolutely, yeah, yeah, well, just like, you know,

805
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,820
put a random apostrophe in her name, and then she'll start to say.

806
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,340
Yeah, just give her an eye patch or something,

807
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,400
make her look like a weather.

808
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,340
Ooh, that's good.

809
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,720
She's a space pirate.

810
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,960
Just wrap her in weird bandages, and then.

811
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,200
Where is the two story Earl of Sandwich going in downtown Disney?

812
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,760
Do we know?

813
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,600
Listen, I'm going to be real with you.

814
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,100
I had a kid, I have no mental capacity.

815
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,200
I decided to turn the lights off when it comes to keeping track of Disneyland changes.

816
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,280
We'll see what happens with Disneyland forward,

817
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,560
and then I'll start paying attention.

818
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,280
But to me, I'm like, yum, yum, I'm going to get my Portos,

819
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,260
I'm going to get my Din Tai Fung,

820
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,720
and I don't know anything else that's happening.

821
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,100
Got it.

822
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,200
You'll know where they are when you get there.

823
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,120
Yes, and also, I've been burnt so many times by Disneyland changing their plans

824
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,160
and being so excited.

825
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,860
I remember they were going to build that gorgeous new five diamond hotel,

826
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,280
six diamond hotel, I think it was,

827
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,160
or the amazing hotel maybe in 2018.

828
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,620
Yes.

829
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,280
When they removed those plans, I was like, I will wait until I see it built,

830
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,940
and then I will be excited.

831
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,320
It was a six diamonds.

832
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,140
Yeah.

833
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
It's going to be so fancy.

834
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,380
The art didn't make it look nice, I'll say.

835
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,500
The art looked like it was just this big warehouse building.

836
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,440
It was not up to your diamond standards.

837
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,200
It was not up to my diamond standards,

838
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,800
as far as a beautiful looking hotel.

839
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,120
It just looked kind of utilitarian.

840
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,540
Well, Mike is in the brotherhood of cross keys, like in Grand Budapest.

841
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,880
Oh, yes, okay.

842
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,220
The concierge.

843
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,080
You lost me for a half second, and then I got you, and then I'm back.

844
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,780
Which is kind of based on reality.

845
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,220
There is kind of an unspoken or a pseudo union for hotel people.

846
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,000
I wouldn't know that.

847
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,040
That was a long time to talk in, this kind of, and I'm so good.

848
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,060
You're going to do a full minute in that town.

849
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,760
Exaggerated for the movie.

850
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,720
You were twiddling your fingers the whole time.

851
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,260
Yeah, well, that's great for an audio medium.

852
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,800
You get some hand movements in there.

853
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,560
People can hear the twiddling, though.

854
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,200
Sure.

855
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,860
Don't you twiddle, twiddle.

856
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,820
Don't you feel like they've toyed with our emotions over Earl's sandwich so often?

857
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,100
Well, Earl keeps moving.

858
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm not tracking this.

859
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,580
That's why I'm like, I'm going to sound like, I'm good at my job, I promise.

860
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,280
But they keep telling me it's here, then it's going away, and then it's back.

861
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,480
It's going to be everything.

862
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,900
And it's too much.

863
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:04,820
It's going to be Tertia Joes and where it is currently, the former La Brea, and the

864
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,280
Star Wars, and it's going to be the Earl of Sandwich Temple.

865
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,840
I think they're giving all of Tomorrowland over to Earl of Sandwich, too.

866
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,360
It's like an auxiliary classroom.

867
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,220
Like when it's like, oh, they're doing vent work at your elementary school.

868
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,400
Music class is in the trailer now.

869
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,780
Yeah, a couple of people roll up with like five igloo coolers full of sandwiches, and

870
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,700
then they just like take cash from people at this point.

871
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,260
Like they've moved it around in such like just random places.

872
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,460
It's a shape shifter.

873
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,500
If you don't get your hopes up, you won't get your heart broken.

874
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,860
So when they open it, I'll be there and thrilled.

875
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,460
But until then, I'm just going to wait.

876
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,320
I don't want to get too excited.

877
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,260
As you are also, you don't want your heart broken by the eventual disappearance of this

879
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:52,020
chain from our war, because it does, you know, even, you know, they move, but that's a

880
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,380
little scary.

881
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,020
Vegas closed, but it moved.

882
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,340
Mall of America closed, but it moved.

883
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,680
But it's it's on the fence.

884
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,100
It's on the ropes, I feel like, in Ontario mills, unless you seem to be implying that

885
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,800
it was pretty jammed, that things are happening there.

886
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,980
It will jammed?

887
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,620
I don't know.

888
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,800
OK, all right.

889
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,480
The animatronics?

890
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,300
Good.

891
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,280
The crowd?

892
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,900
Quite possibly mostly non-existent.

893
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,220
OK, OK.

894
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:18,980
That's what I was.

895
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,660
That was that was kind of the case when I went in early 2020.

896
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,720
Might have been.

897
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,340
And we were there at an odd time when you're there at like on a Wednesday

898
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,280
at two o'clock.

899
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,920
Yeah, we went on a weekday, middle of the day.

900
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,760
We were told that it was they weren't busy right now, but they had been busy.

901
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,260
Not an aggressive please keep coming way, but in like a normal Broadway because

902
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,780
I went with my friends and my friend Kelsey made the reservation.

903
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,100
And unbeknownst to me, she wrote a bit of an essay requesting a specific table.

904
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,360
And we rolled up and she was so stressed about like I from what I remember, she was

905
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,940
so stressed about not getting the table and they were like, you're fine, you're getting it.

906
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,040
And I brought the essay with me.

907
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,760
Oh, yes.

908
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,000
If you would like to hear it.

909
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,600
I'm so curious what table and why.

910
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,060
OK.

911
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,900
Oh, wow.

912
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,080
This is from her.

913
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,880
Oh, oh, the fact that research was done in order to or just

914
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,960
there was awareness of a special table.

915
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,180
This is from her reservation confirmation email under the special requests when making it.

916
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,760
Hello.

917
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,100
We cannot express our genuine excitement for our upcoming

918
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,880
Rainforest Cafe experience.

919
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,340
We're traveling hours from all over the state just to come to you because we miss you so much.

920
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,920
In the spirit of it never hurts to ask, we would love to be able to sit in one of the circular

921
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,480
booths nestled into the plants and animals.

922
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,020
Also, if available, we'd absolutely spend a silly amount on the balloon artist

923
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,320
and would be ecstatic to get a visit from the froggy mascot.

924
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,340
We are so sad that all of your California sibling stores have succumbed to deforestation,

925
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,860
but are so excited to come to you in Ontario for a special trip.

926
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,940
Oh, wow.

927
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,160
So the hostess saw this and was like, I got you.

928
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,240
This was the hand delivered at the door.

929
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,000
This was the like online reservation.

930
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,100
She pulled up in like the POS or whatever that's called.

931
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,960
So she pulled up.

932
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,240
Oh, like Kelsey, party of four and saw this.

933
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,580
And knew she'd take care of us.

934
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,160
Like, well, we got a paragraph.

935
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,540
Check the POS as a paragraph here.

936
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:21,780
Yeah.

937
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,820
Better deal with it.

938
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,220
I understand, though, the request, because when I just did a pop in, you know, look,

939
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,560
you're not going wrong with theming in that place anywhere.

940
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,380
But we were just middle of room.

941
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,760
We weren't enveloped in plant life.

942
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,860
It must have been incredible.

943
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,680
It was it was incredible.

944
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,760
It was because we had pretty high hopes.

945
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,940
We've been planning this for years.

946
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
And we got there.

947
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,500
And is this this a pro swearing podcast?

948
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:43,940
Yeah.

949
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,740
Oh, swearing.

950
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,060
We lost our shit.

951
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,920
We were so thrilled.

952
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,240
It was better than we expected.

953
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,760
We thought, haha, like all the animatronics will be broken.

954
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,920
This will be funny, but sad.

955
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,500
No, it felt alive.

956
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,600
It felt fun.

957
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,920
We sat across from Atlas, which was very exciting.

958
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:00,900
Is Atlas?

959
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,820
Wait, what's Atlas?

960
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,200
Atlas is Atlas, like the the man.

961
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,620
Oh, you mean the big, gold man.

962
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:06,980
Yeah.

963
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,880
With the OK.

964
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,160
Yeah.

965
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,340
So we were sitting nestled in plants.

966
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,240
Oh, that's like all the way.

967
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,580
That's that's where we were.

968
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,160
Yeah, we were truly in a VIP booth.

969
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,660
Oh, boy.

970
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,060
Yeah.

971
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,600
He has a big orb that says and it says, rescue the rainforest.

972
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,240
We like the top of an Emmy or something.

973
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:22,620
Yes.

974
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,340
We could see him.

975
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,900
The elephants were behind us to the right.

976
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,420
I think we had some sort of monkey at our table.

977
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,440
Is Atlas from something other than the rainforest?

978
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,760
Is he just mythology?

979
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,160
So we just got they haven't taken the I'm just saying is like,

980
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,800
is this that God?

981
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,920
Is it a rainforest cafe IP?

982
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,360
Yeah.

983
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,120
OK, it's not original, not an original character, not an original.

984
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,740
But I didn't know that because I have in my notes just like big gold man.

985
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,560
I didn't realize that was meant to be Atlas.

986
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,800
The Atlas.

987
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,520
I mean, was it explained to me at the table?

988
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,040
Yes, it was.

989
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,060
But now we know now that I know.

990
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,640
Did they still have the bar stools that look like animal?

991
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,920
Jason, you know, they did.

992
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,760
You know, they did.

993
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
And they were empty, which was upsetting.

994
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,540
I wanted to go to the bar for a drink after, but we didn't have time.

995
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,480
I wanted to nestle into one of those little giraffe butts, giraffe seats,

996
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,380
seats, seats.

997
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:09,800
There you go.

998
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,880
That's the only that's that's the swearing that we we do.

999
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,280
That's the only one that we monitor.

1000
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,500
Let's just call it seats.

1001
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,440
And they were beautiful.

1002
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,100
And also last night when I was just like, wait, who who invented rainforest cafe?

1003
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,920
I wound up on the website of the guy who makes the seat seats.

1004
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,540
Oh, wow.

1005
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,500
Fascinating man.

1006
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,260
You guys got to do some some sort of episode about that.

1007
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,740
Was this the guy?

1008
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,640
Is there somebody different who did the seat seats specifically?

1009
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,780
Or do you mean like the restaurant?

1010
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,020
There's an artisan.

1011
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,140
Oh, who does the?

1012
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,480
Yeah.

1013
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,940
It's like Seat Seats by Gregory something.

1014
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,120
Whoa, gosh.

1015
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,420
Oh, you've dropped a person.

1016
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,080
Oh, man.

1017
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,360
Yeah.

1018
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,480
I wish we had this at our.

1019
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:48,900
Wow.

1020
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,880
Because they are pretty, you know, there's like there's braiding on those

1021
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,440
rope tails.

1022
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,300
Listen, you when you see a podcast, the right episode forming.

1023
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,080
Yeah.

1024
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,380
Like this was that.

1025
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:58,840
All right.

1026
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,300
So separate episode is the artisan.

1027
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,700
Please send us that info.

1028
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,220
I will.

1029
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,140
Got it.

1030
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,380
That's exciting.

1031
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,920
It's almost turn them out.

1032
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,700
It's some like rainforest cafe factory.

1033
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,400
But no, it's true art.

1034
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,380
And that's why it looks so good.

1035
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,880
They also that zone is called the Magic Mushroom Bar.

1036
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,540
I've seen it referred to as the Magic Mushroom Juice Bar.

1037
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,880
I feel like now it's, you know, utilitarian.

1038
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,240
It's planned to, you know, play into a broad audience where people want,

1039
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,360
you know, booze.

1040
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,000
Unfortunately, I think there was a time and when it opened,

1041
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,800
when there was only one location at the Mall of America,

1042
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,500
when it was meant to be fully a juice bar,

1043
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,760
which is pretty in keeping with the theming, I would say.

1044
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,400
But what an insane idea.

1045
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,360
And that's especially I mean, they're all pretty ambitious in various ways.

1046
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,700
There's the aquariums, the store is a massive operation.

1047
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,500
And you've got your magic mushroom bar.

1048
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,420
The Mall of America one.

1049
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,540
They must have stopped this, right?

1050
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,820
Maybe the other locations did.

1051
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,300
But at least that first one was also a pet store.

1052
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,740
You could leave with exotic birds.

1053
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,660
You could buy birds who lived in the rainforest cafe.

1054
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,060
Like Pantor of the World of Avatar, but real?

1055
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,580
Yeah, yes.

1056
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,320
It's like it's contradicting the other half of the establishment.

1057
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,220
You think the message is a little muddled there?

1058
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,180
Caging exotic birds.

1059
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,160
But yeah, you could buy a macaw or a toucan or a cockatoo.

1060
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,880
And they at this time, this is when the store was like swinging.

1061
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,940
It opened, it had a big hit year or two, the first couple of years.

1062
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,720
And they said they sold one bird a week, which doesn't sound like a lot,

1063
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,780
but that nets you a fifteen hundred to twenty five hundred.

1064
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,480
Wow.

1065
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,380
So that's good.

1066
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,940
One bird a week.

1067
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,840
Can you imagine going to the Mall of America and the thing you leave with is a toucan?

1068
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,540
Do you bag that up or do they probably got to breathe?

1069
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,560
You probably got to let them put that on your shoulder.

1070
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,520
The way the Mall of America was hyped, though, when I was a kid, when we were kids,

1071
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,580
it actually makes sense because it feels like they were hyping it up

1072
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,540
is like this is everything you would want.

1073
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,300
That is true.

1074
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,380
Including toucans.

1075
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,520
So that is so funny that they did that.

1076
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,080
That helped.

1077
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,320
Do you know how long that lasted?

1078
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,400
I don't know.

1079
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,700
No.

1080
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,000
And I think that first one was a whole other ballpark.

1081
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,100
Like, yeah, you know, more ambitious than the others.

1082
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,300
But the others are incredibly ambitious, too.

1083
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,460
I mean, that's the footprint.

1084
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,340
You can attest to that Ontario one.

1085
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,360
I mean, I'm never going to get over this bird store.

1086
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,580
I'm simply like never going to be able to process this information.

1087
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,060
It's really weird.

1088
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,680
And then also, like just other early stuff that maybe just that one had.

1089
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,320
OK, so like I think all of them have the aquarium, basically,

1090
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,740
where you walk through this big, like bright blue, bold blue.

1091
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,220
And there's probably fish in there.

1092
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,840
I think maybe not.

1093
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,300
No, I think anyone listening to this has seen the YouTube video

1094
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,900
of the dude who went to all the rainforest cafes.

1095
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:50,440
Oh, yes.

1096
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,120
Yeah.

1097
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,900
Eddie Burback, is that correct?

1098
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,000
It's Burback, not Burbank.

1099
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,100
And as as that person pointed out, there are many,

1100
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,620
some select ones that don't have fish.

1101
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,500
This one just had bubbling water.

1102
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,860
OK, which if you go in, not expecting that, it's very jarring

1103
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,220
to enter some place that's like the rainforest is alive and thriving.

1104
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,600
And from the from the drop, you're just like, no animals.

1105
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,040
Not here.

1106
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,000
And you have to I mean, your brain just kind of jumps

1107
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,140
to conclusions that, you know, we're here after the pandemic.

1108
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,100
Malls kind of closed suddenly.

1109
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,180
What happened to these fish?

1110
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,060
Oh, yeah.

1111
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,780
Was that a slide out during that?

1112
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,080
Yeah, I don't know.

1113
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,520
What happened when it closed?

1114
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,540
Like was it like who's taking the fish home?

1115
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,140
And like, was there a whole debate and then nobody could?

1116
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:32,920
I know.

1117
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,640
I don't know.

1118
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,500
Oh, and everyone forgot.

1119
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,840
Everybody just like pencils down and nobody ever ran.

1120
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,940
It feels a little bad that there's no fish there.

1121
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:46,880
I heard like an apocryphal story about the fish at the Wynn Casino in Vegas,

1122
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,000
that like a security guard, like the first few months

1123
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,540
when all the casino hotels were closed, they were just like,

1124
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,940
I don't know about the fish.

1125
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,960
Just leave them.

1126
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,600
What are we going to do?

1127
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,520
And like one security guy took it upon himself to scoop out the fish food

1128
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,740
and like keep the fish alive.

1129
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:06,820
Oh, wow.

1130
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
See, I don't because if you're like in a hotel,

1131
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,520
you're security, you're in the hotel.

1132
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:10,860
Yeah.

1133
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,720
If you're just inside the gate of a of an outlet mall that isn't open,

1134
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,840
I don't know.

1135
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240
Yeah.

1136
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,820
And I don't listen.

1137
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,340
Don't sue me.

1138
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,840
Landry's, please don't come for me.

1139
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,880
But it felt disconcerting that post pandemic it was a very empty tank.

1140
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,400
There would have to be like some altruistic like man or woman

1141
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,000
who comes into the mall at night or comes into the rainforest cafe at night.

1142
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,780
And yeah, Mr.

1143
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,220
Mills, like Mr.

1144
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,460
Mills is coming in with the skeleton key and Sir Mills.

1145
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,140
He owns many of them.

1146
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,780
Sir Mills.

1147
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,380
Yeah.

1148
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,960
That is one.

1149
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,160
The one in Philadelphia, the former Franklin Mills, now the Philadelphia Mills.

1150
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,200
That one apparently closed in February of 2001,

1151
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,840
but it only opened in 1998.

1152
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,360
So very short lifespan of the Philadelphia rainforest.

1153
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,720
Is that area not not like?

1154
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,600
No, it's a it's a giant outlet mall.

1155
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,800
The mills.

1156
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,540
Is there anything else?

1157
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,740
Is there anything else fun in that mills or is it kind of a boring functional mill?

1158
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,920
Well, I believe if you look up, there was a giant Ben Franklin,

1159
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,260
like a multi story like Ben Franklin thing.

1160
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,700
Like, I don't even know how to describe it.

1161
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,940
It wasn't a store where you could buy Ben Franklin.

1162
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,860
Somewhere between a statue and a puppet.

1163
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,680
Oh, it moved.

1164
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,340
Yeah.

1165
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,540
Oh, that's interesting.

1166
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,840
And it's a little frightening.

1167
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,360
Size wise, are we talking a transformer?

1168
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Like, what are we working with?

1169
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,220
Yeah.

1170
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:37,860
Bigger.

1171
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,320
Oh, like both stores like bigger than it.

1172
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,860
Wait, a transformer is really big.

1173
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,720
Bigger.

1174
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,040
Yeah.

1175
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,240
Like both stories of the mall, like in an atrium in the mall.

1176
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,300
Were you scared?

1177
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,980
I don't know if I ever saw it in person.

1178
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,380
I might have just seen pictures.

1179
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,160
I'd be frightened.

1180
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,820
Or it's a nightmare you had.

1181
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,300
Jason, growing up in Philadelphia would often have nightmares of a giant

1182
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,760
man eating Ben Franklin Kaiju.

1183
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,020
Ben Franklin.

1184
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,600
Ben Franklin versus Godzilla.

1185
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,540
I mean, we there there are a number of things

1186
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,900
in film that like there is a Dickensian Christmas village

1187
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,560
underneath the Macy's downtown.

1188
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,460
A subterr- a one with a roof and a basement?

1189
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,340
That used to be a Wanamaker's Wanamaker, a former big department store chain.

1190
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,020
My grandmother claimed she was fourth cousins with John Wanamaker.

1191
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,680
You say claims.

1192
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,800
What a brag.

1193
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,460
You say claims as if you're a little bit in doubt about it.

1194
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:32,460
OK.

1195
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,360
False brag.

1196
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,820
It's like Barbara Streisand's basement.

1197
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,100
I am sorry.

1198
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,020
I was over exaggerating this

1199
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,220
Ben Franklin puppet thing.

1200
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,080
Only probably one story so closer to a transformer.

1201
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,660
What you're talking about a transformer like in the park,

1202
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,500
you're not talking about a because a transformer in the world is in the movie

1203
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,100
is like many stories tall.

1204
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,220
I mean, that's about bumblebee sized, I would say.

1205
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,320
Well, it depends.

1206
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,340
They're not like six stories tall.

1207
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,680
I think they're like maybe one and a half or shorter.

1208
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,380
Is that right?

1209
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,200
I think so.

1210
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,240
What's the scale of it?

1211
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,200
Some of them are taller than that, aren't they?

1212
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,560
I mean, I guess because like

1213
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,180
Megatron and like I've seen the first one.

1214
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,120
I've seen Sam Witwicky and bumblebee, and it feels like bumblebee

1215
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,160
can just kind of crouch down.

1216
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,800
That's what I was going to say.

1217
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,800
They come to your eye level and they wouldn't be able to do that

1218
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,940
if they were so big.

1219
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,320
Yeah.

1220
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,520
If they were like Godzilla size, it wouldn't be.

1221
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:24,900
Yeah.

1222
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,120
I think they're only like one and a half stories or maybe like around.

1223
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,440
So yeah, like that Ben Franklin.

1224
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,140
But that is frightening.

1225
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,660
The mills, the mills chain about that, of course, this is a Simon owned.

1226
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,940
Oh, of course, Simon, of course, the company runs the malls.

1227
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,400
Of course.

1228
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,560
Uh, I never remember them being super crowded or particularly desirable.

1229
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,300
The mills, uh, location.

1230
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,900
I've talked a lot of review.

1231
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,460
Yeah, I've talked a lot of smack about mills over the years.

1232
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,180
And maybe we maybe we need to do some kind of mills roundup,

1233
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,420
determine what else is weird like that, like the Franklin.

1234
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,240
What else are weird at mid mills?

1235
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,220
The standard Simon malls.

1236
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,560
I mean, I feel like a lot of the malls around Philadelphia, uh, were nice.

1237
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,880
And then eventually started to consolidate ownership and Simon starts buying up.

1238
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,520
And then I think I like Westfield more than Simon.

1239
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,400
I'm disappointed.

1240
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,300
Westfield man.

1241
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,120
I'm a Westfield man.

1242
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,740
But that's they're all Westfields.

1243
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,380
Are you a Simon lad?

1244
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,600
Are you a little Simon boy?

1245
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,380
I don't know.

1246
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,960
I mean, they didn't save the Granite Run Mall.

1247
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,440
It's kind of a weird.

1248
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,880
My childhood mall is a weird Frankenstein.

1249
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,900
We're like some of the.

1250
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,360
No, no, no.

1251
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,400
A Franklin Stein.

1252
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,100
Oh, it's a.

1253
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,660
Oh, the mills is a Franklin Stein.

1254
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,860
Where it's like one or two of the anchors stayed and then they built like a pseudo

1255
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,080
outdoor mall.

1256
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,600
Thank you for that.

1257
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,360
So you're not even, you wouldn't declare anything, any allegiance, any type of boy

1258
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,780
you are as far as mall ownership.

1259
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,340
Well, certainly moving out here.

1260
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:55,560
Yeah.

1261
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,240
I've become a little Westfield boy.

1262
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,580
Okay.

1263
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,240
So you're more of a little Westfield boy as well.

1264
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,580
Yeah.

1265
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,120
Okay.

1266
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,200
Or fashion square lad.

1267
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,180
I don't want to be a little Caruso lady.

1268
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,840
Oh no.

1269
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,460
Oh no.

1270
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,000
I think the little is optional.

1271
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,620
These guys are always going for the little if that's in the.

1272
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,220
Yeah.

1273
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:11,400
Yeah.

1274
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,700
If you're a fan of anything, adding I'm a little something boy is generally how we

1275
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,100
like to.

1276
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:16,500
It's generally.

1277
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:16,780
Yeah.

1278
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,020
And very, uh, non-off putting it's on putting America.

1279
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,180
I don't know.

1280
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:25,860
I think I'm a.

1281
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:26,680
The bank.

1282
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,080
Oh, because I believe the company was leveraging, uh, using.

1283
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:36,300
Mall of America credit to run the American dream mall.

1284
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,620
Oh, that's right.

1285
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,940
Oh, wait, my brain is going back to all the press releases I got about American

1286
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,200
dream.

1287
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,540
Um, who, who runs that?

1288
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,460
Who runs that?

1289
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,300
I don't know.

1290
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,880
It's like, it's not a particularly memorable name.

1291
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,060
Can I wait or wait, is it Simon?

1292
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:50,960
It is Simon.

1293
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,160
Simon's part of it.

1294
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,560
Or they manage it.

1295
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,920
Uh, I think it's owned by triple five.

1296
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,600
That's the, they own those, these mega malls, mall of America, West Edmonton,

1297
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,440
which is huge and has a theme park in it and American dream, which is a bizarre

1298
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,060
nightmare that I got lost in.

1299
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:05,940
Had a very hard experience.

1300
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,120
I spent my birthday there.

1301
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:07,900
You did?

1302
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,180
Yeah.

1303
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,800
I went to the Shrek water park for my birthday.

1304
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:16,780
You know, like a normal adult woman does before the, uh, the, the collab before

1305
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,980
stuff started falling.

1306
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,540
Oh yeah.

1307
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,200
We went, uh, we went during the pandemic, but during a, you know, like a light,

1308
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,680
a casual break in it.

1309
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,980
Um, but we're my husband and I are neurotic.

1310
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,700
So we wore masks up until we got on the water.

1311
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,060
It was a real specific time and the people operating them were like, you

1312
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,300
can't wear that on the slide.

1313
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,140
So we left it next to the vehicle.

1314
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,360
Um, but it was great.

1315
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,160
I got, I mean, it's so embarrassing.

1316
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,000
I got to hug Shrek, like next to the wave pool in a bathing suit, which was

1317
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,120
an iconic moment for me, but the problem is my phone was in the locker and my

1318
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:46,940
husband had his phone on him.

1319
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,520
So he took all the photos and then I put them in an album and send them to myself.

1320
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,280
But he doesn't use his phone, his photo album a lot.

1321
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:58,820
So now anytime you open photos on his phone, there is just an icon of me in a

1322
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,960
bathing suit with Shrek every single time.

1323
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,980
Just a huge photo.

1324
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,460
Cause he doesn't make photo albums.

1325
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,580
So you'd open his phone to camera or photo.

1326
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,740
It's just me being like, meh in a bathing suit with Shrek forever.

1327
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,040
That is how your husband sees you.

1328
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,920
That is his primary image.

1329
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,140
But have you been to Mall of America?

1330
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,900
I've never been actually.

1331
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,880
I did.

1332
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,240
I did.

1333
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,600
And the same trip, I did Mall of America and then went to Chicago and saw it.

1334
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,560
It was Mall of America and Rock and Roll McDonald's trip.

1335
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,000
Oh yeah.

1336
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,200
Good trip.

1337
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,660
Have you been?

1338
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,660
I have not.

1339
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,300
It's amazing.

1340
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,300
It's pretty good.

1341
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,720
Real quick on the topic.

1342
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,640
I think, did you do a thing I wanted to do and do an episode, but for some reason

1343
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,520
when it was here, I wasn't available.

1344
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,620
Did you go to a Shrek grave?

1345
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,180
I did not go to a Shrek grave because I was pregnant and I didn't think I could

1346
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,060
handle it.

1347
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,200
Cause I want to.

1348
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,320
But I did.

1349
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,520
Look, he can't not take X if you go to a Shrek grave.

1350
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I want to do, when it's back, can we go to a Shrek grave or something and do an

1351
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,320
episode on it?

1352
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,240
I interviewed the founder of it, Cash, and it was one of my favorite interviews

1353
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,160
of all time.

1354
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,120
I did a podcast episode on it and I have never, I don't think in my life I've left

1355
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,460
an interview that happy.

1356
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,300
Wow.

1357
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,980
It was just, we had so much fun talking about Shrek grave.

1358
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:05,840
Wow.

1359
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,580
I felt like, you know, when you like meet people in college who like the same

1360
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,640
things as you and you're just on one, it was that.

1361
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,040
It was pure joy.

1362
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,380
It was, the episode's still up.

1363
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,540
You and Candace for that, the line.

1364
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:14,940
Yeah.

1365
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,480
Over Zoom.

1366
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,200
We were so happy.

1367
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:21,340
Are you excited to visit Shrek's home at Universal Studios Florida soon?

1368
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,180
Don't even get me started.

1369
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,940
Oh boy.

1370
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,860
I'm so, I've done all the Shrek experiences except for, I never made it to

1371
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,080
Universal Studios Singapore, sadly, because I went on a huge tour and by then I went

1372
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,460
with my husband.

1373
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,400
He's fun, I promise, but he went to four international theme parks and was like,

1374
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,260
no, no more.

1375
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,280
I missed that.

1376
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,860
And then I haven't been to, is the ride in Dubai?

1377
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,720
The indoor, there's a dark ride, a Shrek dark ride.

1378
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,340
Oh, I don't know.

1379
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:46,900
Yeah.

1380
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:47,480
I haven't done that.

1381
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,560
There's a few other.

1382
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,580
Oh, for anyone who doesn't have context, every December I do Shrek's number on

1383
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,160
my podcast.

1384
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:58,280
We focus on, we've almost run out of Shrek experiences, but we did the Shrek Airbnb

1385
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,520
this year and that was good.

1386
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,320
Where's that?

1387
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:00,860
What's that?

1388
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,520
Shrek Airbnb.

1389
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,740
I'm so sorry to derail from Rainforest Cafe, but the Shrek Airbnb was a

1390
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:10,520
promotional thing that one winner was allowed to stay at, they recreated

1391
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,080
Shrek's house and they were allowed to stay.

1392
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,200
It was in Ireland.

1393
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,140
I think my brain's fried, but I hunted down the person who stayed there.

1394
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,700
I sleuthed it and I found them and I interviewed them and we talked about the

1395
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,700
experience staying in Shrek's house.

1396
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,220
Have you gotten any, and I feel like maybe this was on a Jim and Len Disney

1397
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:40,080
dish, they were talking about like, there's a number of years ago, but there

1398
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,740
was like rumors of like, well, people like Shrek, but they're sick in the movies.

1399
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:52,780
So it could be prime for a live action, like a Disney version, like a live action

1400
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,640
re- I've never heard that since.

1401
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,060
No, no, no.

1402
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:55,620
Scarf.

1403
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,060
Yeah.

1404
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,300
I don't think it would be for me necessarily, but.

1405
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,540
I don't think they're doing that.

1406
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,340
I think they're doing new anime.

1407
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,700
was that just like a meeting where someone was like tapping a pencil on the head?

1408
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,720
And it's like, do you think Myers would want to?

1409
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,940
I do a lot of it.

1410
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,820
Motion capture.

1411
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,540
Can you imagine the onions?

1412
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,160
Like the, the real swamp, the outhouse?

1413
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:23,700
No thank you.

1414
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,520
Zemeck is just licking his chops waiting to do this.

1415
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,880
Like, Oh my God.

1416
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,360
Sorry, I'm looking at the dates.

1417
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,380
The Shrek rave is like, yeah, it's always, it's always, but then like the

1418
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,560
one in Los Angeles says it's a spooky rave.

1419
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,680
Cause it's unlike, why is it what is it Halloween time?

1420
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,720
I don't know.

1421
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:43,620
It's February.

1422
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:48,460
Well, if you should set it in the Shrek 4D timeline, go so far quad.

1423
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,020
I don't think it is set in the Shrek 4D.

1424
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,520
It just called it's a spooky rave, my bloody Valentine.

1425
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,660
And then the next, it's sandwiched by things that just say Shrek rave.

1426
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,080
So I don't know why is the Los Angeles market, did they not want Shrek rave?

1427
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,040
Maybe they've done it so much where like we need another layer to it.

1428
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,560
We're going the opposite direction.

1429
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,000
The works of my bloody Valentine.

1430
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:08,860
Yeah, it's weird.

1431
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,140
Well, if you want to go, I'm there.

1432
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:10,920
All right, great.

1433
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,140
What city do we have to go to, to go to a Shrek rave?

1434
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,500
Sacramento, maybe San Diego.

1435
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,640
Oh, there's a San Diego, I think.

1436
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,820
They did it in Anaheim once too, I think.

1437
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:20,840
Wow.

1438
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,020
Yeah, let's see.

1439
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,780
There's a, I saw one House of Blues, San Diego, 21024.

1440
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,620
And then I think there was one in Sacramento, but that's obviously a little farther.

1441
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,120
Yeah.

1442
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,020
But if we find out it's better, I mean, we should go to the most quality Shrek rave.

1443
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,240
Well, yeah, if an expert could tell us which one it's superior at.

1444
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:42,680
Great.

1445
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,000
Great.

1446
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:48,180
Let me ask about particulars of your experience.

1447
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,920
Were there animatronics you were especially endeared to?

1448
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,760
Yes, the elephants.

1449
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,440
Elephants.

1450
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,640
I thought elephants weren't really going to work.

1451
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,960
It just seems like those ears wouldn't flap very well.

1452
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,800
It just, I was expecting nothing and it gave everything.

1453
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,660
Wow.

1454
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,420
They kind of, they like shake around when the storm happens.

1455
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,760
They like, they blow those trunks.

1456
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,540
So I forgot the storm happened.

1457
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,380
So imagine me sitting in our little booth.

1458
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,260
We just got in, we're overjoyed.

1459
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:12,980
We made it.

1460
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,340
And then there's a storm and I completely forgot.

1461
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,400
And my friend took a video of me that I didn't realize at the time.

1462
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,520
And I just, it was just an endless shit eating grin.

1463
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,820
Just so happy.

1464
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,700
I think I had both my hands glued to my face in shock.

1465
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,220
It was so fun.

1466
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,920
I can't even emphasize how fun this was.

1467
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,520
Yeah.

1468
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah.

1469
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,400
I had a magical time at that one.

1470
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:35,780
Admit it.

1471
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:40,040
I was with a smaller group, but it was like the amount of, you're, you're

1472
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,660
shocked by how many storms you get.

1473
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,500
If you're there for, if you take a slow lunch, you can maybe get like five storms in.

1474
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,060
No problem.

1475
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,420
I mean, the later storms obviously don't have the same effect.

1476
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:52,780
We just kept the gabbing about serious life issues, but the first few storms were very fun.

1477
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,660
But once we sat down, I don't remember the exact process.

1478
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,400
It must've been the waiter who asked if I wanted to be a member of, I think it's

1479
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,920
Landry's Select Club.

1480
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,380
Well Jason would know.

1481
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,900
Yeah, I'm a member of the club as well.

1482
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,080
You're a Landry's Select too?

1483
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,320
I don't know if it's Landry's Select, but I'm a Landry's card holder.

1484
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,800
We have Lowry's cards.

1485
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,960
Yeah, I have both of those.

1486
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,340
You have both.

1487
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,060
Although you're more of the Landry's cause of course the Landry's points came up.

1488
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,080
I was trying to be nice and I was like, Oh, get him some points.

1489
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,740
Cause then when he was at Landry's and he just automatically used whatever credit was on it.

1490
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:38,760
His father worked for decades for those points and he comes in and just takes them.

1491
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,800
A Morton's one year and a Chart House the next.

1492
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:42,680
We earned those points.

1493
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,820
They had Morton's too?

1494
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,380
Yeah.

1495
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,680
So Landry's owned Landry's Quadrant Forest Cafe in 2000.

1496
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,060
Yes.

1497
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,840
They of course own Morton's and Chart House and the Golden Nugget.

1498
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,760
Your of course's are interesting.

1499
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,460
Of course.

1500
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,420
Of course.

1501
00:52:59,460 --> 00:52:59,640
Yeah.

1502
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,680
I mean not like a long going yes, yes, yes, yes.

1503
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,700
I too am now a card carrying member.

1504
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,820
I'm proud of myself.

1505
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,540
And this was one of them.

1506
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,300
The way the manager came over and thanked me for joining brought me the paperwork.

1507
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,660
I love the thanks.

1508
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,500
Like buying a car.

1509
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,820
It's like getting a promotion just for dining there.

1510
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,340
Yeah.

1511
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,560
Now just remember you can't put the points back on the card.

1512
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,360
Jason tried.

1513
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,200
I tried.

1514
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:31,800
I tried.

1515
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,740
I was like, no, I just wanted the points.

1516
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,860
The scramble when it happened.

1517
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:42,060
I felt so bad because it was probably like the I think they give you 20 bucks on your birthday or something.

1518
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,680
Well, I spent 25 but with the promise of I have $25 credit coming.

1519
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,180
Yeah.

1520
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,080
That's on the card.

1521
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,140
So it was a little bit of a dark exchange.

1522
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,180
Jason grabbing the guy by the collar.

1523
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,360
Put him back.

1524
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,660
Put him back.

1525
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,280
Those are my father's.

1526
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,420
I want to talk to Scampi.

1527
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,600
I want to talk to the big shrimp mascot.

1528
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,920
Scampi is a shrimp, but Cha Cha is a frog.

1529
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,800
Do not get your Landry characters confused.

1530
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,420
I didn't know the shrimp had a name.

1531
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,280
I believe it is Scampi.

1532
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,760
I forget that every time we've done all these series.

1533
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,540
I think I looked it up because the last time none of us could remember.

1534
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,060
I'm like, I need to remember what that and I think it's Scampi.

1535
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:21,740
Oh my god.

1536
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,260
I believe it's Scampi.

1537
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,880
And it's confusing because the one at CityWalk Hollywood is always very filthy.

1538
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,220
It's a dirty, dirty shrimp.

1539
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,640
But he should be called filthy.

1540
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,840
He should be called filthy.

1541
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,560
Filthy shrimp.

1542
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,300
Yeah, you got to take him out back to the CityWalk hose.

1543
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,520
Give him a wad of water.

1544
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,740
The CityWalk hose.

1545
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,200
Go to their hose.

1546
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,060
The CityWalk hose.

1547
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,720
The only one.

1548
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:54,260
Once John Lovett's comedy club shut down, there used to be two hoses, but then the water pipes were shut off.

1549
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,980
Lovett said he angrily took the hose with him.

1550
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,300
Yeah.

1551
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,220
Now wait a minute.

1552
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,900
One of your requests was, if possible, a Cha Cha appearance.

1553
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:03,500
Yes.

1554
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,200
So Kelsey was, as you can tell, better versed about the offerings at Rainforest Cafe than the rest of us were.

1555
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,960
We never got to see a Cha Cha character.

1556
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,380
I didn't know who Cha Cha was until we got there.

1557
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:19,040
And then obviously, like rolling up to Disney World with no context, you know who the main character is.

1558
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,660
We all immediately bought Cha Cha slippers, which were a shockingly affordable $10 each.

1559
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,260
Oh wow.

1560
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:26,900
Okay.

1561
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,580
Are you still buying her prices on slippers?

1562
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:29,880
I was like, I'm going to spend $27.

1563
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,220
99 on this piece of plastic, but I'm never going to get back $10.

1564
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,760
And it was one that I hadn't seen before, now that I've seen videos at Rainforest Cafe.

1565
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,780
It was just Cha Cha's head.

1566
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,460
It was all head.

1567
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,660
Not head on a cup.

1568
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,460
Full head.

1569
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,180
Okay.

1570
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,320
Oh, that's what you want.

1571
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,780
An immersive, yeah, yeah.

1572
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,020
If it's only part of a cup, that feels functional.

1573
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,400
Yes.

1574
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,360
You all did it.

1575
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,880
We all bought it.

1576
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:55,060
And then of course, we opted for the professional photo in a frame, which don't get it twisted.

1577
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:55,800
That's not a frame.

1578
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,140
It's a piece of paper around a photo.

1579
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:01,740
And when they came to our booth and they took our photo and we looked at it, the only way

1580
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,200
I can describe it is that it looks like we're in The Shining.

1581
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,140
Just holding our little Cha Chas in front of our heads, so happy, but possessed.

1582
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:12,760
Completely possessed.

1583
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,540
Just not right.

1584
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,060
New Year's Eve, 1920.

1585
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:15,400
Yep.

1586
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,120
And you zoom in on us being like, yeah.

1587
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,580
You sent that photo a little while ago.

1588
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,000
And like, yes, I collect four Cha Cha slippers.

1589
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,620
And then that, like, Raid Forest Cafe, so the frame is going to be like a fun, it's

1590
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,820
a bunch of leaves and vines.

1591
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,900
You know, it's just kind of like fake gold leafing.

1592
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,300
It's just kind of like what an old restaurant would have.

1593
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,580
It's not green and kooky.

1594
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,060
Just normal.

1595
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,280
I thought it was a frame, like I'm going to hang it on my wall because I'm dumb.

1596
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,420
Little flappy.

1597
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,200
Yeah, yeah.

1598
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,640
Okay, so that's all cool.

1599
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,340
Wait, there was another request though.

1600
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,160
Oh, the balloons.

1601
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,040
The balloon person never came to us.

1602
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:54,500
Okay.

1603
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,420
But they were there.

1604
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,120
They were there.

1605
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,960
So we were in the booth facing Atlas, just to give you the layout.

1606
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,960
And there was a table next to Atlas and they got balloons.

1607
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,800
So we got to enjoy their balloons from afar.

1608
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,460
Okay.

1609
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,180
I think someone had a palm tree with a coconut that they were wearing as a hat.

1610
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,560
There was a very good balloon art happening, but we were never really offered the balloon

1611
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,420
art, which is fine.

1612
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:16,920
That's strange.

1613
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,260
It was in your, how many?

1614
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,800
That's strange.

1615
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,760
Like you put it in your requests.

1616
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,320
Yes, it does.

1617
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,460
It's not a crowded restaurant.

1618
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,660
How in the world does the balloon artist not make it to you?

1619
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,360
You know, it wasn't as disappointing as I'm making it sound now.

1620
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:35,680
We were just so happy the entire time that nothing like, you know, going to the bathroom,

1621
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,240
seeing Queen of the Jungle, like just everything was spot on perfect.

1622
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,400
Not getting a balloon was fine.

1623
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,900
That bathroom's funny.

1624
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:49,020
I was only in the men's, but if it's the same style, it's very like airbrush.

1625
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,440
Yeah.

1626
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,360
It's very like old t-shirt style.

1627
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:51,980
Yeah.

1628
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,000
Yeah, that's nice.

1629
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,120
I liked it in there.

1630
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,180
and I am just kind of like guns blazing about the food quality.

1631
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,360
I'm just like, it's shit, bad.

1632
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,720
That's not the only experience.

1633
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,340
I've only had bad experiences with the food, but let me ask you now about the food portion

1634
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,180
of all this.

1635
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,760
How'd you feel about the food?

1636
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,020
No complaints.

1637
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:18,800
Wow.

1638
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:19,460
No complaints.

1639
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:19,760
And you know what?

1640
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,860
Here I am listening to myself years ago, flapping on.

1641
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,440
I got the aforementioned mojo bones.

1642
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,920
I really liked the mojo bones.

1643
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,940
I had a good time.

1644
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,780
I remember thinking like, have I been underrating?

1645
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,100
Maybe it's location dependent, but I don't know.

1646
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,520
They got the mojo.

1647
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,420
The mojo bones have the mojo.

1648
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:47,420
I knew what I was getting into, and I was coming out of a long night where I didn't

1649
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,960
drink much, but I have no tolerance.

1650
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:55,360
So I was just kind of exhausted, spaced out, got there so happy, so thrilled, got to eat

1651
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:01,920
chips and dip, got to eat a spinach artichoke dip, but like just fun food, fun food with

1652
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,240
friends.

1653
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:02,960
It was great.

1654
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,000
It wasn't artisanal.

1655
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:12,380
And I went into it knowing that there is a chance it was possibly frozen, and then they

1656
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,740
reheated some of the food, possibly.

1657
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,160
I don't know.

1658
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:14,840
I don't work in the kitchen.

1659
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,240
So I went, I ordered from that perspective.

1660
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1661
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,540
If that's where you set your meter.

1662
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:20,840
Yes.

1663
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:27,420
And you know what else I think has happened to me since we've now done so much multiple

1664
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,220
city walks in downtown Disney.

1665
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,800
We have experienced some food lows.

1666
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,880
I think my bar has been lowered a lot.

1667
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:44,280
Yeah, my mojo bone experience, if there's not something specifically wrong, which there

1668
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,980
was not, I don't know.

1669
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,580
I got what I wanted.

1670
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,360
I got no complaints.

1671
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,980
Just real quick, clarify what are mojo bones?

1672
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:53,920
Is it just ribs?

1673
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:54,780
It is just ribs.

1674
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,060
Yes.

1675
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,420
How dare you demystify it?

1676
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,880
I said it so many times without saying that I even had to remember.

1677
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:07,120
I've had that phrase mojo bones haunting me and yet I could not until looking at my photos

1678
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,660
from that day, could not remember that they are ribs.

1679
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:14,200
I was just imagining the big thing of ribs put on Fred Flintstone's car.

1680
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,280
Oh, that'd be fun.

1681
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:15,900
Yeah.

1682
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,100
Not that crazy.

1683
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,120
You can imagine though.

1684
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,340
You can blow them up in your head.

1685
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,040
Is mojo the name of the pig that they…

1686
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,200
I add this question.

1687
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,060
I don't think so because I think that's weird to…

1688
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,260
I could be wrong.

1689
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,000
It is weird.

1690
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,320
It's also weird to eat animals in the Rainforest Cafe because the rainforest…

1691
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,120
You want to preserve the rainforest.

1692
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,500
You don't eat elephant.

1693
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,260
Well, that's true, yes.

1694
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,820
But there might be a wild…

1695
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,440
Is there a wild hog in the rainforest somewhere?

1696
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:45,640
There might be.

1697
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:46,840
There isn't now.

1698
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:47,580
There might be a boar.

1699
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,680
Well, right, because mojo is dead.

1700
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,900
I'll check my menu.

1701
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,300
They might have been jaguar bones.

1702
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,180
Oh, that's the canon explanation?

1703
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,780
Or just truly.

1704
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,020
Oh no, you ate Maya the Jaguar.

1705
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,880
All these characters have names, by the way.

1706
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,880
Oh, right, right, right.

1707
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,280
In addition to Cha-Cha.

1708
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:17,360
There's some sort of creole influence in the menu, which I feel like I picked up there,

1709
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,600
and then I saw later when I was reading about it.

1710
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:20,300
Yeah.

1711
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:20,480
Right?

1712
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,740
Yeah, I think so.

1713
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,320
You get some jambalayas, right?

1714
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,820
Which I don't know where that crossover happened.

1715
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:30,260
Zatarand's warehouse was just closing, so they bought everything in full.

1716
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,200
A lot of surplus jambalaya.

1717
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,760
I mean, I guess that's a question when you open this place.

1718
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,960
Where do you go with it?

1719
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,860
And you imagine kind of like South American or something.

1720
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:42,960
But yeah, I don't know.

1721
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:46,360
I never felt like I was eating my new friends, especially the ones with names, as you mentioned.

1722
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,700
Thank God.

1723
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,520
I never felt, yeah.

1724
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:48,960
You don't want to slaughter.

1725
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:49,920
There was nothing.

1726
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,520
I mean, Cha-Cha's the star.

1727
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,080
The other ones, I don't know, but I would bet my life on the fact that Jason does.

1728
01:01:55,100 --> 01:02:02,900
Rio the macaw, Tukey the elephant, Ozzy the orangutan, Bamba the gorilla, Iggy the iguana.

1729
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,120
That one's a little lazy.

1730
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,120
And Nile the crocodile.

1731
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,300
We saw Nile the crocodile outside the Woodbridge one.

1732
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:10,840
Yeah.

1733
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,580
I'm assuming that was Nile.

1734
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:12,600
That's the freebie.

1735
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,320
That's the freebie, I think.

1736
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,140
What's that?

1737
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:14,920
That's the freebie.

1738
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:15,460
Oh, yeah.

1739
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,300
You don't have to buy anything.

1740
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:17,720
Yeah, a little taste.

1741
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,440
There's a snake.

1742
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:19,100
There's that.

1743
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:19,720
There's one other.

1744
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,160
Yeah.

1745
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,780
I think at Nashville, instead of a crocodile, they got a hippo.

1746
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,600
Oh.

1747
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,000
Was that listed?

1748
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:26,340
The hippo?

1749
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:26,740
Why?

1750
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,060
Special just for Nashville.

1751
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:38,220
The snake was where I, and maybe this has been improved since I was there, but I took a video

1752
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:44,220
under the snake where I'm just seeing the peel from the tongue, from that nasty black.

1753
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,800
I was right under it.

1754
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,800
Maybe all of them would suffer if you walked right up to it, but this you can.

1755
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,480
You're walking right under that snake.

1756
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:58,860
I was just imagining bits peeling off and into an open beverage container or something.

1757
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,520
The snake was not looking great.

1758
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:01,120
I will have…

1759
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,540
That's why you got to get a souvenir cup.

1760
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:03,080
It's covered.

1761
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,780
Cha-cha's head is fully intact.

1762
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,800
Oh, Chai just bounces right off of Cha-cha's forehead.

1763
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,060
Keep your soda secure.

1764
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,800
It's an interesting experience going to that one, the Odyssey to get there.

1765
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,620
I was very fond of my experience.

1766
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,580
There's a lot of notable parts about it for me.

1767
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,500
I went with a friend of the show, Bugman, Buzz Buzz.

1768
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,500
I think I texted you about this forever ago.

1769
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:34,480
While we were there, it was announced that Chapec is taking over as CEO.

1770
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,980
That's where I was when that happened, which also places

1771
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,940
Who doesn't remember where they were?

1772
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,740
Everyone was in Vegas.

1773
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,440
I was napping in Vegas, and I woke up to a flurry of text messages.

1774
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,340
Jason, wake up!

1775
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,080
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

1776
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,700
That also places it at right pre-pandemic, because as we all know, he was put in as a

1777
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,580
fall guy, with Diger's advanced knowledge that the pandemic was coming.

1778
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,920
You got the rich guy dossier.

1779
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,680
Just him and Oprah got it.

1780
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,440
That's what happened.

1781
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:09,600
But also, when I'm looking at my photos of my little Mills expedition,

1782
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,640
pandemic is in my head, because two weeks later, it was raging.

1783
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,500
This is one of the last things I did before, which also means that I'd missed the detail.

1784
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,180
That mall has a truly massive AMC.

1785
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,740
It's a 30 screen.

1786
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:25,200
30, yeah.

1787
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,740
It is like, upsettingly big.

1788
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,500
You feel so small.

1789
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,880
You feel like an ant before it.

1790
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,700
So many hallways.

1791
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:31,580
What's that?

1792
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:32,760
There's got to be so many hallways there.

1793
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,520
There's probably wings.

1794
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,860
And like, no, you're in A2.

1795
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,820
No, you're in B9.

1796
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,600
We got an AMC 30 in Schomburg.

1797
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:39,620
Really?

1798
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,540
Gosh, Schomburg.

1799
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,100
You got it all.

1800
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,780
That's nothing to you.

1801
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,140
It's such a novelty to me.

1802
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,700
You said it, and I scoffed.

1803
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:50,380
They're going to be playing that Sidney Sweeney Glenn Powell romantic comedy forever.

1804
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,000
Yeah, they're going to be playing that for no one in August.

1805
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,060
Amphibum $100 million gross is just made in Schomburg.

1806
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,360
From Schomburg, yeah, that's right.

1807
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,260
There was a Shoney's right by there.

1808
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:02,960
Oh, yeah.

1809
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,120
Whoa.

1810
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:11,260
It feels weird, like urban ruins or something, my photos of this, though.

1811
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:12,580
Because already nobody's at that theater.

1812
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:14,520
And then all the coming attraction posters.

1813
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:20,360
I don't know why I took pictures of posters, but they're all for movies like Black Widow

1814
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:28,240
and Lovebirds that we now know all became pandemic releases, just kind of sadly spurted out at home.

1815
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,400
So it's a real, this was a window in time.

1816
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:31,980
Yeah, really?

1817
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,500
I really had bookend visits.

1818
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:34,600
Yeah, yeah.

1819
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,800
Yours was like post and optimistic.

1820
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,180
It was my first indoor dining in a really long time.

1821
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,060
That was it?

1822
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:41,780
Yeah.

1823
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,200
I made all my friends test.

1824
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,700
We were very stressed about it.

1825
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,000
It was my first indoor dining.

1826
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,020
I was willing to catch COVID, rain forest cafe.

1827
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,420
Thankfully, there were not a lot of people there.

1828
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,460
You're going to get it anywhere.

1829
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,060
And so your first indoor dining was a fake outdoors.

1830
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,560
That's interesting, isn't it?

1831
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:58,920
Yeah.

1832
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,680
I mean, we have seasons of not indoor dining.

1833
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,360
So this was one of the breaks.

1834
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,160
Oh, I see.

1835
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:08,780
Yeah, we basically, the way I try to do it is that I, well, for a while I had a younger baby

1836
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:09,700
and you got to be careful then.

1837
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,980
But I try to, if I have a trip, I don't want to ruin the trip.

1838
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,780
So then I prepare before the trip and then I end up traveling so much that I end up masking forever.

1839
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:18,660
Oh, I see.

1840
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:18,960
Yeah.

1841
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,360
Okay.

1842
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,040
That's why it took me years to go to rain forest cafe.

1843
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:22,820
Okay, okay.

1844
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,080
Gotcha.

1845
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:27,000
So you're beaming this, but this is just like…

1846
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,560
It was better than I thought it was going to be.

1847
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,920
I thought we'd have to pretend to be happy, you know?

1848
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,720
So we schlepped all the way there, like we'd have to drive back in traffic.

1849
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,500
It would be a whole thing.

1850
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,260
We had so much fun.

1851
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,640
We had so much fun.

1852
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,520
And like, again, the food, you know what you're getting into.

1853
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,200
Like I got coconut shrimp.

1854
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,380
It's, I'm not like off the water.

1855
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,200
I know I'm at, I don't even know where Ontario is.

1856
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,580
I don't know what direction I drove in.

1857
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,320
Yes, I know.

1858
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,040
We've been there and I couldn't see anything else about 30 miles around.

1859
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:55,500
Couldn't tell you.

1860
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,600
It was either you go to Disneyland or you're wherever this was.

1861
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,320
You could be at the outlets on the way to Disneyland,

1862
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:04,360
or you could be like in the middle of the state.

1863
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,580
Yes, had no clue.

1864
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,940
Still don't know where it was.

1865
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,140
My car almost died when I was there.

1866
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:09,900
Had to find a charger.

1867
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:10,700
Barely did it.

1868
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,140
Oh my God.

1869
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:11,840
Couldn't figure out where I was.

1870
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,320
Wow.

1871
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,920
Yeah, like just somewhat lost, but it was worth it.

1872
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,520
It was incredible.

1873
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,760
We obviously got, oh, what is it called?

1874
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,760
The chocolate explosion, the volcano, the…

1875
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,580
The volcano, the Sunday.

1876
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,200
Yes, I forget because they have a…

1877
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,240
They have a similar dessert at T-Rex at Disney Springs.

1878
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,360
Which is also in Bylandries, but it's not a rainforest cafe.

1879
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,800
Also created by the same person as Rainforest Cafe.

1880
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:37,960
Steve something.

1881
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,160
Steve Schluser.

1882
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,680
No, Schulser.

1883
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,480
Steve Schleshing.

1884
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,940
Steve Schussler.

1885
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,160
I've been dreading this this whole time.

1886
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,020
Steve Schussler.

1887
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:49,580
Why is it so…

1888
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,860
Steve Schussler.

1889
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:51,420
Steven Schussler.

1890
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,300
Schussler also invented T-Rex.

1891
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,740
And their chocolate dessert is…

1892
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,280
I think it's called chocolate extinction, which is hilarious.

1893
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,100
Oh, my dream.

1894
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:09,740
Wow, wow.

1895
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,320
That's fantastic.

1896
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:11,880
Yeah.

1897
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,400
I think also my friend said it was my birthday and we got a cupcake.

1898
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,260
Yes.

1899
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:16,600
Wow, there's a lie involved.

1900
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,180
I think so.

1901
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,060
It was while I was in the bathroom.

1902
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,760
I was not part of it.

1903
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:20,660
Interesting.

1904
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:21,920
This little thing foisted out of that school.

1905
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,140
Was there a song then?

1906
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,480
You know, I have no memory of it, but there might have been.

1907
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,040
Okay, because I wonder what the Rainforest Cafe like non…

1908
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,920
Like what their version of Happy Birthday is.

1909
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,620
Don't think I have a…

1910
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,740
I don't have a video.

1911
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:36,600
I feel like if they set me up and there was a song, there'd be a video.

1912
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,960
Did the animatronics sing it?

1913
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,140
And they just make horrible creaking noises when they program that?

1914
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:43,760
Atlas sings it.

1915
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,300
You know what I wish they did?

1916
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:48,260
You know that sometimes when like a bunch of like monkeys or orangutans are together,

1917
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:52,500
that they all start playing off each other and they do all their mating calls or whatever that is?

1918
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,200
I've been to a sanctuary.

1919
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:53,820
I should know the answer.

1920
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,260
I don't.

1921
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:58,140
But they should do that as like an alternate thunderstorm.

1922
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,940
Just have all the monkeys start yelling at each other.

1923
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,000
Start screaming at each other.

1924
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,980
Oh yeah, like in a real realistic way.

1925
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:04,940
That'd be fun.

1926
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,620
Your birthday gets us making these monkeys excited to mate.

1927
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,740
Like they'd be so angry though.

1928
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:11,960
I'd love that.

1929
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:12,960
It'd be realistic though.

1930
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:13,680
Yeah, it'd be great.

1931
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,400
When it's crowded, you just hear angry dads go,

1932
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,120
why do I want to eat here either?

1933
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,260
This has the shortest wait though.

1934
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,520
If you want to go to TGI Fridays, we can.

1935
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,380
The call of the tired dads.

1936
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:34,940
Okay, well let me talk a little Steve Shustler.

1937
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:35,700
Shustler.

1938
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,080
Steven Shustler.

1939
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,040
Julia brought some of this to the table with us a while back,

1940
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:48,520
but I feel like I did not get like entranced by Steven Shustler the way that I should have

1941
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:54,500
because the list of, so he sold a couple of these restaurants to Landry's ultimately,

1942
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:58,040
but he's got this whole like, the credits are nuts.

1943
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,480
I think I'm preparing for some gasps here because it's Rainforest Cafe.

1944
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,640
Truly personally this guy.

1945
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,600
T-Rex Cafe is him.

1946
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,480
Yak and Yeti at Animal Kingdom is him.

1947
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,180
What a coup for this guy.

1948
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,320
He's got two, he's got Rainforest and T-Rex at Disney Springs,

1949
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,140
and then Rainforest outside Animal Kingdom,

1950
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,880
Yak and Yeti in Animal Kingdom.

1951
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,520
It's Shustler land.

1952
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,960
It's basically Shustler land.

1953
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,920
Then I had no idea the same man was the Boathouse.

1954
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,280
Neither did I until last night.

1955
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,200
Neither did I.

1956
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,680
Totally different concept.

1957
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:31,660
Also fantastic.

1958
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:32,200
Great food.

1959
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,020
Fantastic food.

1960
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,200
I almost wore my Boathouse shirt today, but I didn't,

1961
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,720
feels like it doesn't fit me right now.

1962
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,120
I gained some weight being a father, okay?

1963
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:48,880
Feels like it doesn't fit me right.

1964
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:49,740
That's how it comes out.

1965
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,040
I couldn't fit in my Boathouse shirt, okay?

1966
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,220
I had to wear Hello Kitty.

1967
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,140
It fits, it fits.

1968
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,700
It's just I was like, it looks weird, it feels weird on me,

1969
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,820
but I almost wore it today.

1970
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,180
I'm right there with you brother.

1971
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,300
I've put a little weight on into it.

1972
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,860
Going back to larges, mediums, or getting a little tight.

1973
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,200
Well it's in style right now so nobody notices.

1974
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:07,960
I've been told this.

1975
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,240
Yes.

1976
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,880
My stylist girlfriend assures me Baggy is back.

1977
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:12,620
Baggy is back.

1978
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,920
I would trust Jane with anything.

1979
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:14,600
I would, yeah.

1980
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,740
She's fantastic at her job.

1981
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,360
Sure.

1982
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:18,380
Baggy is back folks.

1983
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,160
Baggy is back.

1984
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,160
I'm a little baggy boy.

1985
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:20,940
American Apparel dead.

1986
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,540
I'm a little baggy boy now, okay?

1987
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,280
Even though I just said that I had to wear

1988
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,380
that one type of shirt, not another, I've retconned that.

1989
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:29,460
I chose to.

1990
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,020
You heard how my brain was able to reconcile it

1991
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,380
in real time just now.

1992
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,740
I am a little baggy boy now.

1993
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,960
You wore your comfy mashup Hello Kitty,

1994
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,660
New Japan Wrestling shirt instead.

1995
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:40,100
It's bigger.

1996
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,060
The shirt is bigger than my Boathouse

1997
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,780
like three-quarter sleeves shirt that I have.

1998
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,660
Is it a polo?

1999
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,300
No, no, it's a, no.

2000
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,620
I'm not a little polo boy.

2001
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,260
Not that it's anything wrong with me.

2002
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:53,240
I'm a polo boy.

2003
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,520
Notice what word was missing there.

2004
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,820
A regular polo boy.

2005
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:58,980
I shouldn't have said boy either.

2006
01:11:59,100 --> 01:11:59,500
What am I doing?

2007
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,000
Regular polo boy.

2008
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,760
You tricked me.

2009
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,700
I still said boy.

2010
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,380
It's like a baseball tee.

2011
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,700
It's a pink Boathouse baseball tee.

2012
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,660
It's one of my cherished possessions from like Orlando

2013
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,320
as far as Orlando related clothing.

2014
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,660
You gotta get to the gym then.

2015
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:13,640
This is a cherished shirt.

2016
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:14,940
You gotta squeeze back in.

2017
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,540
No, don't let him bully you.

2018
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,580
Go on eBay, buy a bigger size.

2019
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,380
Don't listen to him.

2020
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,240
That's true.

2021
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:21,420
That is an, wait, yes, there's more of these shirts.

2022
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:21,940
Yeah.

2023
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:22,880
Baseball Boathouse baseball.

2024
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,380
I don't mean to bully.

2025
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,200
I just want you to have your shirt that you like.

2026
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,000
You gotta get on Depop, man.

2027
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,680
I'm sure there's some Boathouse stuff there.

2028
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:34,520
I've only seen real, I mean, granted you are a dad,

2029
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,320
but real dad clothing, like dad golf wear.

2030
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,720
But that's what I was excited about because yes,

2031
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,220
they will sell you a captain's hat.

2032
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,040
They will sell you a lot of polo shirts,

2033
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,340
a lot of like Hawaiian type shirt things.

2034
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,120
Just dad clothes, like a captain's hat.

2035
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,200
Captain's hat.

2036
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,900
Like a dad, that's how you know who's the captain of the family.

2037
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:53,420
Exactly.

2038
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,600
but it might have been too expensive.

2039
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,420
His family's a fortress.

2040
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,060
I was gonna probably buy it for you.

2041
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,260
Try to buy it for you.

2042
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,360
But then, yeah, that's not necessarily my aesthetic yet.

2043
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:09,460
But then I saw a baseball tee, and that's much more my aesthetic.

2044
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,020
And I bought it and I was very excited.

2045
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:15,200
It's pink, and I haven't worn it in a while, and I tried.

2046
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,780
Can you imagine the magic moment?

2047
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,640
If you wouldn't have known he was wearing it?

2048
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:21,120
I know.

2049
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:22,280
Yeah, yeah, right.

2050
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,340
Well, it'll be a magic moment when you roll back in with that,

2051
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,560
or probably with a large that you're comfortable with.

2052
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,360
They got like a Boathouse here.

2053
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:33,500
There's like this very Margaritaville-style shirt.

2054
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,540
Oh, that's good.

2055
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,480
Oh, yeah, that feels like a knockoff,

2056
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,740
like Daytona Beach kind of shirt.

2057
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:38,280
That's cool.

2058
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,680
Wow, I gotta go in that store more.

2059
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,420
I wanted to go down when we were back.

2060
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:44,700
I did not make it there.

2061
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:45,380
That is jammed.

2062
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:47,240
We had much crappier restaurants to go to.

2063
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,580
Stay tuned on that.

2064
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:54,260
And actually, speaking of, here, let's move over to,

2065
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,580
because like, OK, so he's Mr.

2066
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,460
Disney, huh?

2067
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,640
Well, not necessarily.

2068
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:02,880
He'll cross party lines because his invention was Hot Dog Hall of Fame.

2069
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:03,480
Wow.

2070
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:04,400
Hell yeah.

2071
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,020
Coming soon to the City Walk Orlando Saga.

2072
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,220
We'll hit that one.

2073
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:14,240
So this guy's just a machine of crazy restaurant ideas.

2074
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:18,300
Dude, I went so deep on this man last night that, OK, his name is Steve.

2075
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,640
My brother's name is Steve.

2076
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:20,780
My brother is a surgeon.

2077
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:21,980
He has a full-time job.

2078
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,500
And in his free time, he makes Chicago Tavern-style pizza.

2079
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,500
And it's amazing because Chicago Tavern-style pizza is not a thing yet.

2080
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,100
People don't really know about it.

2081
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:31,480
It's thin.

2082
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:31,940
It's crispy.

2083
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:32,760
It has like buttery crust.

2084
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:33,660
It's amazing.

2085
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:36,540
And I wound up on a story of this guy,

2086
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,440
and he's now making a Chicago Tavern-style pizza chain.

2087
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,240
He's trying to make it big.

2088
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:42,760
Really?

2089
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,220
Uh-huh.

2090
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:43,780
Whoa.

2091
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:44,880
What's the, do you know the name of the chain?

2092
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,000
Great question.

2093
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:50,640
So it's something like, like Steve and Dave's big-time pizza.

2094
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,980
And my brother, his best friend is named Dave,

2095
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,400
and they had a musical group together called Dave and Steve.

2096
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:57,300
Whoa.

2097
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:57,820
Weird.

2098
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,160
Weird.

2099
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,840
I texted it to him last night and was like, I'm having a stroke.

2100
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,040
Did you want them to play?

2101
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,820
I said they should play the opening.

2102
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:07,920
No, my brother's like, I gotta leave it all behind.

2103
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,760
I gotta pursue my Tavern-style pizza dream.

2104
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:11,560
Oh, wow.

2105
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,180
Oh, gotcha.

2106
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,100
But this is almost like a restaurant themed after him.

2107
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:15,960
He's very good at surgery.

2108
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:16,840
He is the theme.

2109
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,640
Yeah, but like Tavern-style pizza is coming.

2110
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,180
Wow.

2111
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:22,320
Because if this guy says it's so, it has to be.

2112
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:22,940
Geez.

2113
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:23,240
Great.

2114
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:26,060
And well, if he puts his mind to it, it happens.

2115
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:31,260
Oh, and the Dave and Steve and Dave is famous Dave's Dave, I think?

2116
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:31,980
Oh.

2117
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:32,240
Oh, really?

2118
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,160
It's like another chain.

2119
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:33,900
Oh, the barbecue.

2120
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:34,320
Yeah.

2121
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,780
Yeah, so it's a little like buddy-buddy corporate con show.

2122
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:44,260
So if you know, not everyone's going to know who Dave and Steve are, but if you're in the know,

2123
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:44,980
you're in the know.

2124
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,340
I mean, famous Dave.

2125
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,040
Steve was like, I've opened all these places.

2126
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,160
I'm not getting credit.

2127
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,820
Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.

2128
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,640
He's like, Dave's got all this.

2129
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:55,440
I know.

2130
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,400
I want what Dave has.

2131
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:57,440
I want the credit.

2132
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,800
Right, because his animals are getting all the credit.

2133
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:02,040
Atlas is getting all the credit and not Steve.

2134
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,160
Well, Atlas holds up the world.

2135
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,800
Steve should have put himself in there holding up the world.

2136
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:08,920
Yeah, yeah.

2137
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,220
Slap his face on there.

2138
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,660
And the world is like a meatball or something.

2139
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:13,240
You know, he sold his baby.

2140
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,460
He can't do it anymore.

2141
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:21,000
Which maybe might contribute to this chain has decayed a little bit that they've lost some.

2142
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:24,900
Maybe if Steve was still in charge, I don't know.

2143
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:26,040
But he also, I'm sure he cashed in.

2144
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:31,440
Can we just look forward to Rainforest Cafe inventor making a pizza chain?

2145
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,460
I mean, that's pretty fun.

2146
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:32,860
We can, yes.

2147
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:35,340
It feels like, I mean, it's got to be over the top.

2148
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,560
It can't just be plain.

2149
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:37,540
Yeah, you're right.

2150
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:38,860
That's not just going to be some place.

2151
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,920
Yeah, yeah, there's going to be some kooky crap to that.

2152
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:42,480
What is it?

2153
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,240
It's thin.

2154
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,680
That's the type of pizza it is.

2155
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,880
Have you ever, sorry to make it very Chicago centric, have you ever been to Barnabees?

2156
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:48,320
Yeah.

2157
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,740
It's like Barnabees?

2158
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:50,440
That's Barnabees, yeah.

2159
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:50,920
Sure.

2160
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,320
Do you prefer the deep dish or the tavern cut thin crust?

2161
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:55,300
Look, I'm basic.

2162
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,840
I'm a basic guy.

2163
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,620
So I am a Lou Melnati's.

2164
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:00,260
Yes, yes, yes.

2165
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:03,100
That's my priority when it comes to the Chicago stuff.

2166
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,680
But Barnabees is good.

2167
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,200
Yes.

2168
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,320
Or was, yeah, it's still there.

2169
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:06,880
It's wonderful.

2170
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:07,460
Yeah.

2171
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,520
Is it still there?

2172
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,820
Yes, it's still there.

2173
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,000
Not the one on Gulf Road, though, I think it's gone.

2174
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,460
I think, is that the Northbrook one?

2175
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,560
I don't know street names because I didn't drive for a long time.

2176
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,200
Sure, and I'm talking local Schomburg.

2177
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,520
No, I think there's, sorry everyone, there is the Northbrook one.

2178
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:25,640
And then there's the other one, which my dad prefers, which I think is, I think so.

2179
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,500
I think there's one right by O'Hare.

2180
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,000
I think so.

2181
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,580
Whatever the one that's not Northbrook is the one my dad likes.

2182
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,260
Micro specific about Chicago?

2183
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,280
I'm sorry, this podcast is micro specific about Burbank.

2184
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,640
Those are the rules.

2185
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,260
And we say some swears, but not butt or ass.

2186
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,720
Those are the rules of podcasts.

2187
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:41,800
Yes, yes.

2188
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,480
I'll be close, please.

2189
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,260
There's the one deep dish in the valley.

2190
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:46,020
What's it called?

2191
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:46,380
Yes.

2192
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:46,980
Blanking on it.

2193
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:47,700
I haven't been there.

2194
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,580
It's pretty good.

2195
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,440
It gets you close.

2196
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,360
It gets you close to what you want.

2197
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,660
They ship.

2198
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:53,240
They ship.

2199
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,220
Oh yeah, we do it.

2200
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,240
We did it for Christmas.

2201
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:55,720
Yeah.

2202
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,600
Big dream pizza.

2203
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,260
Yes.

2204
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,140
Is what this is going to be.

2205
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:00,800
Big dream.

2206
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:01,860
Yeah.

2207
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,940
The news is on pizzamarketplace.

2208
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:04,360
com.

2209
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,880
Is it decorated to Steve's dreams?

2210
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,260
They haven't opened it yet.

2211
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,520
They were going to, again, I don't sleep.

2212
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,760
Why was I up all night doing this?

2213
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:16,680
They had a former drive-in restaurant that they were going to launch within.

2214
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:19,660
Oh yeah, this is an entirely new, yeah, Galaxy Drive-In.

2215
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,720
This is the whole one that we missed.

2216
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,580
They were going to do it there.

2217
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,580
And then recently, I think a year ago, they decided it wasn't big enough for this huge

2218
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:30,460
pizza launch, so there hasn't been any other news, and they sold that to someone else.

2219
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,080
Oh, interesting.

2220
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,380
But this Tavern pizza trend is coming.

2221
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,240
OK.

2222
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:34,680
I'm on board for it.

2223
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,940
I've really been on this quest to make the best pizza in America.

2224
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,520
When you try Dave's Pizza, you'll never want anything else.

2225
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:41,980
Yeah.

2226
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,400
They're talking a big game.

2227
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,580
And neither of us plays golf.

2228
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,000
Retirement is not the end game.

2229
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,120
These guys don't want to stop.

2230
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,680
They will not stop until we get the best pizza.

2231
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,960
Because Tavern-style pizza is hard to find.

2232
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:53,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2233
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,620
Chicago Tavern-style pizza.

2234
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:55,260
There's a mark.

2235
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,900
If these guys seize it properly and make it a thing.

2236
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,840
The only way I get it is if my brother makes dough two days in advance and then invites me over.

2237
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:03,740
Wow.

2238
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:04,200
Sure.

2239
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:04,500
Oh, geez.

2240
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,620
Well, so this will be special if it happens then.

2241
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:11,780
If I could take it, Mike, or Neach, for a second, about Rainforest Cafe,

2242
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,760
one of the other ones I went to growing up is on the Atlantic City Boardwalk.

2243
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:17,480
Whoa.

2244
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:21,800
And like a cat with nine lives, it is survived.

2245
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:28,660
It is survived because it is on the ground floor of the former Trump Plaza casino.

2246
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:40,160
And then they managed to get the utilities transferred to them.

2247
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:42,280
So they managed to stay open.

2248
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:48,200
And then they survived the, it is not the building that was imploded of Trump Plaza

2249
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,620
that we talked about a number of years ago.

2250
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,700
It is in, and then it survived the pandemic.

2251
01:19:55,260 --> 01:20:02,000
And somehow of all the Rainforest Cafes that closed, this one is still going on the Boardwalk.

2252
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:06,220
How can you not be a fan of this chain after hearing that story?

2253
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,200
I'm coming around.

2254
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,400
I feel like I was talking some shit about it before, but there's something about that.

2255
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,440
It's hanging in there.

2256
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,460
I mean, that's a story of survival.

2257
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:14,800
Yeah.

2258
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:19,920
And metaphorically, if this is, you know, if we root for this the way that we should root for,

2259
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,160
for the planet, maybe we have to, they're one and the same.

2260
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:29,700
And you want a world where your son can experience the rainforest.

2261
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,440
Can run through, can brush across his hand.

2262
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:38,000
It brushes his hands across the fake clothy vines where he can reach out and touch

2263
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,740
the decaying black tongue of a creepy snake.

2264
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,660
The asbestos tongue of the snake.

2265
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:56,000
But I think it could potentially, I think it should come back because current Landrys,

2266
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:02,620
the head of Landrys, noted podcast ride guide, Tillman Fertitta, author of Shut Up and Listen,

2267
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:09,660
exclamation point, the book that, the business book that warns you a paddle is coming for your ass.

2268
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,020
Of course.

2269
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,940
He, he is building a hotel casino on the strip.

2270
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:22,080
It's a plot of land that used to be a travel lodge and the Hawaiian marketplace shopping center.

2271
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:25,760
It's all being demolished and they're building a new hotel casino.

2272
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:30,620
This is like by, if you can think of like the Cosmopolitan,

2273
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,020
sort of across from that area on this strip.

2274
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:41,400
So since he's building a new hotel casino, I think we got to get a Rainforest Cafe in there.

2275
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:41,800
Yeah.

2276
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,440
You know?

2277
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:42,660
You gotta.

2278
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:44,240
It's his own, this is his own company.

2279
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,160
You gotta.

2280
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:45,600
It's his own company.

2281
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,860
Someone's gotta be, yeah, there's gotta be restaurants in there.

2282
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:51,620
Isn't it still, it's still in that weird, I've called it the shit stack.

2283
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:57,300
There's the tower of like the bad chain restaurants, one on top of the other in Vegas.

2284
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:01,520
Right, right.

2285
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:07,300
It's a Denny's and a Hard Rock and Brew Dog, the new rooftop brewery.

2286
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:13,840
And so I, yeah, I think just a couple blocks up from that will be this new Tillman Fertitta location.

2287
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,340
Wow.

2288
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:20,200
His cousins run station casinos, the locals casinos in Vegas.

2289
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:29,140
No, it's his cousins who one of them helped start UFC.

2290
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,360
Oh really?

2291
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:30,900
Yeah.

2292
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,100
Oh my.

2293
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,180
Does this man run the world?

2294
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,680
Well, I, you know.

2295
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,560
Yes, the Houston Rockets.

2296
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,340
And if you go far enough, he has the Houston Rockets, and if you go far enough back in the

2297
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,660
family tree, there are Texas mobsters.

2298
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:50,960
There are the Galveston mafia to the point where like people were surprised when they're like,

2299
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,900
they lent us guy by the Rockets.

2300
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,380
Like usually the NBA doesn't like, you know.

2301
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:59,920
I only knew this man from like, he had a CNBC show.

2302
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:00,580
Yes.

2303
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,540
That we watched a lot of.

2304
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,980
We were very into the show, The Prophet.

2305
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:03,480
Right.

2306
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:07,100
I think it came on after and we watched it a lot and it was him basically telling cupcake

2307
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,560
makers like, I'll sell your cupcakes in Vegas.

2308
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,220
And then I never heard from him again.

2309
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,280
Was that show good?

2310
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,080
It was good enough.

2311
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:14,820
Okay.

2312
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,000
That's what you need.

2313
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,900
That's the CNBC's model.

2314
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:19,640
Good enough.

2315
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,000
Yeah.

2316
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,180
It's, he definitely got the dossier in February of 2020.

2317
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:25,640
Oh yeah.

2318
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:26,260
The original dossier?

2319
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:27,460
Sure.

2320
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,460
I, yeah.

2321
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:34,160
I mean like, yeah, the personalities that run through this thing.

2322
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:38,780
And I just, just one, another little thing about Schussler and Julie talked about this

2323
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:43,620
a little bit, but I haven't meditated on it in a minute that he like to prove the concept

2324
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:48,940
he, wait, okay, actually it wasn't even the reason he just, he had a lot of tropical birds

2325
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:52,460
and he wanted to make the house comfortable for them.

2326
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:57,880
So he made a lot of money by the way, from a restaurant called Jukebox Saturday Night,

2327
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:00,100
which Jason old timey music test.

2328
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:01,820
Who did the song Jukebox Saturday Night?

2329
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:03,720
Oh, is that a big bopper?

2330
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,440
No, little old in that.

2331
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,080
It's a name you love to say.

2332
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,700
Uh, it's not the, it can't be the Dorsi brothers.

2333
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,020
We got a Glenn Miller.

2334
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:13,760
It's a Glenn Miller.

2335
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:14,520
Glenn Miller.

2336
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:15,560
Sorry.

2337
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:19,080
So he had some Jukebox restaurant that kind of looked bad from the outside.

2338
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:21,300
I don't know, but he made some, he made some money,

2339
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,400
wanted to keep going in the themed entertainment, the theme restaurant world.

2340
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:28,840
But so off of that, he's like, you know, I want my birds to be comfortable.

2341
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,420
What other answer do I have than to make my home very humid

2342
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,160
and full of like water spurts and fog and mists?

2343
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:36,420
Of course.

2344
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:37,920
And then eventually waterfalls.

2345
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:41,940
So he just slowly is living in a rainforest himself.

2346
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:44,280
And then quote this man.

2347
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:48,040
When I realized that the rainforest made me comfortable too,

2348
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,940
I began to wonder if I could market the idea

2349
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:56,800
whether I could mix the comfortable feelings with retail merchandising in a restaurant.

2350
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,560
So slowly but surely he just keeps making his house more of a rainforest

2351
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,140
and starts having investors come over.

2352
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:07,680
Check it out.

2353
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,320
What do you think?

2354
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,280
And most of them think that it's really weird.

2355
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:13,640
And then a guy comes over named Lyle Berman.

2356
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:17,480
Lyle Berman also thinks it's really weird and he leaves.

2357
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,040
But Schussler's like not giving up.

2358
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,360
So he keeps hounding him and hounding him.

2359
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:21,760
Come back.

2360
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:22,560
He doesn't do it.

2361
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:22,980
Come back.

2362
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:23,480
He doesn't do it.

2363
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,920
Eventually this guy visits the rainforest house 26 times.

2364
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,560
Oh my God.

2365
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:35,040
In which time Schussler has put half a million dollars into the home.

2366
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:39,820
And after 26 times, Lyle Berman finally says,

2367
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,060
all right, fine, $2.

2368
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,120
5 million is yours.

2369
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,300
Let's partner with Mall of America.

2370
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:48,440
They got it built.

2371
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:54,360
This guy who went for it and did it is one of the greatest gamblers on earth, literally.

2372
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:56,640
He's in the Poker Hall of Fame.

2373
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,280
He's won so many championships.

2374
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:04,340
And then years later was one of the many high profile victims of Bernie Madoff.

2375
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:05,020
Wow.

2376
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,140
And that's why.

2377
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:10,340
So we've got Schussler, but we've also we got to credit Lyle Berman

2378
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:14,420
and his gambling in real life and his literal gambling.

2379
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,700
This is the guy we need to hook up with.

2380
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,460
Oh yeah.

2381
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:21,020
A guy who's willing to just throw a bunch of money at a dumb idea.

2382
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:21,480
Sure.

2383
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,060
And we got to figure out.

2384
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:23,980
Insane gambling man.

2385
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:31,320
If you're down, do not stop until you win all your money back.

2386
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:31,940
That's right.

2387
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:35,040
I think it might be what he did.

2388
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,100
And it paid off incredibly.

2389
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,640
They made $8 million the first year.

2390
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,000
In that year, Michael Jackson visited and asked if he could buy a Tracy Tree.

2391
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,620
A limo was summoned for Steve Schussler.

2392
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,400
This will take you to Michael Jackson.

2393
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,720
Please negotiate a price for Tracy Tree.

2394
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,740
Did he have a Tracy Tree?

2395
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:56,500
I it is not clear.

2396
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,760
It's not clear in this article.

2397
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:00,840
Apparently the price what he offered was $40,000.

2398
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:01,800
That's what he started with.

2399
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,340
So I don't know.

2400
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,580
I don't know where it went.

2401
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,240
So unclear.

2402
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,060
But I don't see.

2403
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,420
At least he got to the table is the thing.

2404
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:14,380
The shock and joy I feel from this story is the exact way I felt when I dined at the

2405
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:15,000
Rainforest Cafe.

2406
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,820
I cannot believe this.

2407
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,640
You mean to tell me Imagineers are just living in regular old houses,

2408
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,340
not committing to the bit like this man?

2409
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:22,360
Yeah, you're right.

2410
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,780
We all love these people.

2411
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:24,660
This is what we need.

2412
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,440
But Joe Roady didn't actually live in Pandora.

2413
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,280
He didn't make his own Pandora.

2414
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:32,580
Yeah, yeah.

2415
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,120
Every time you read about it.

2416
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,840
He lives in Fantasyland seemingly.

2417
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:35,240
This is true.

2418
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:35,600
This is true.

2419
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,120
Yeah, yeah.

2420
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:40,580
But it would be better if Imagineers would like literally change the climate of their

2421
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:44,280
house to slowly turn themselves insane to really get in the mindset.

2422
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:45,820
But call a human macaw.

2423
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,300
That's how we apparently get our best themed restaurants.

2424
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:50,040
That's what I'm saying.

2425
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:55,000
Well, what can we plausibly turn a home into that we wouldn't mind?

2426
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,120
I just keep imagining that when they introduced Fastpass Plus and when they introduced Magic

2427
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,900
Bands that they built that.

2428
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,020
There was like a walkthrough exhibit to show executives.

2429
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:07,820
I just imagine the person who created that was just in there being like, this is my life

2430
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:08,280
now.

2431
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,500
It's a little kitchenette.

2432
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,820
Yeah, just to schedule Fastpasses forever.

2433
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:15,220
You walked through a Fastpass place?

2434
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:17,200
Yeah, there's some old story that-

2435
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,000
The Magic Band place?

2436
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:22,800
Because they had to explain it, they built out a whole thing for execs.

2437
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:24,660
I'll dig it up.

2438
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:25,600
It's an old one.

2439
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:30,780
That's like when they first introduced the app, like booking Fastpasses on the app.

2440
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,040
Yes, when they did all of that.

2441
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:37,400
There was a big profile of like, they built a giant data center at Disney MGM Studios.

2442
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:41,780
And then a few years ago, I think we talked to someone who worked at Disney and it's like,

2443
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,800
oh, that was gone in like a year, year and a half.

2444
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,220
We needed more space.

2445
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:51,220
That was great for the Time Magazine profile, but yeah, it wasn't super practical.

2446
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:57,260
This guy remains insane and he still has like, outside of Minneapolis, he has like a workshop

2447
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:59,300
where he still does this.

2448
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:03,320
He fully builds out restaurants in miniature form that he wants to build.

2449
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:08,440
There's a 10,000 square foot lab outside the place on the door.

2450
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:11,260
Inventions, ideas, contraptions, and dreams.

2451
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:14,660
There's a big T-Rex in there from T-Rex Cafe.

2452
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:20,120
But where he loves the most is a jazz club that he wants to build called Aero Blue,

2453
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:22,200
a World War II era jazz club.

2454
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:25,980
I'm sorry, World War II era?

2455
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:27,760
Yes, I guess so.

2456
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,660
So there's like planes and stuff.

2457
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:31,880
The resident Jew doesn't love that.

2458
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:32,440
Yeah.

2459
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:35,340
Romanticizing of World War II.

2460
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,480
The fun part of the movie World War II.

2461
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,180
What a great time for everyone.

2462
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:44,340
He just means boogie, boogie woogie bugle boy and nothing else.

2463
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:45,260
Okay, okay.

2464
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,300
He just likes the planes is all.

2465
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:51,120
I was like about to get on a plane to meet this man and now I'm slowly greeting back.

2466
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:51,700
Hold on.

2467
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:56,760
I think he fudges the rules because apparently this place, it has-

2468
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,020
I'm like, what do you mean?

2469
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,800
Do you mean you have a full animatronic of this?

2470
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,300
This claims in it-

2471
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:04,720
All right, there's a large airplane that raises and lowers with a spinning propeller.

2472
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:11,260
There's a trumpeting Louis Armstrong and a dancing sax playing Bill Clinton.

2473
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,540
I take back everything I said.

2474
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,160
I take back everything I said.

2475
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,300
We're on the creepy ropes now.

2476
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,140
Oh, I will go to this.

2477
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:18,880
Oh, you're back.

2478
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:19,580
Yeah, yeah.

2479
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:19,780
Oh, I'm back.

2480
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:20,280
Oh, I'm back.

2481
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:23,020
I wasn't sure if Clinton was a deterrent or a robot.

2482
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,600
No, this I have to see.

2483
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:25,180
I know.

2484
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,140
The robot one is more trustworthy.

2485
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:28,160
Yeah, yeah.

2486
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:29,420
Robot's not on any list.

2487
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,300
He can't go anywhere.

2488
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:32,640
He's about, maybe he could because he dances.

2489
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:33,920
What the hell does this mean?

2490
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:34,820
Yeah, what does that mean?

2491
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:39,980
Dancing sax playing Clinton in World War II that you have to go to Minnesota to see?

2492
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:41,480
This sounds like-

2493
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,940
brainstorming we do at the end of an episode where we go, well, what would you want to see?

2494
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,860
And I'm like, dancing Bill Clinton and we all laugh.

2495
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:52,220
Well, have you ever lived in a human house for two years?

2496
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:53,720
Because I think that's probably why.

2497
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:54,340
That's true.

2498
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,620
It got in there.

2499
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:04,420
Can I talk about, since we are ride enthusiasts, the rainforest river adventure ride?

2500
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,460
Oh my god.

2501
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:07,340
The, there is a ride.

2502
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:11,420
I mean, I think we can't fully do it until we've done it.

2503
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:16,720
We're aware, the listeners have mentioned this in Galveston, Texas, there's one with a ride,

2504
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:21,380
but I feel like I would feel like a poser to do it without do it.

2505
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,220
But also, I mean, shout out whatever you want.

2506
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:24,040
I'm just saying.

2507
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:31,380
You know how a lot of rides, like movies or books, if you try to graph it, there's like spikes and,

2508
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,260
oh, it's exciting.

2509
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:37,240
And then it's building up and it says, this is a ride where the whole ride is like a single

2510
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,500
horizontal line.

2511
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:42,380
He's absolutely right.

2512
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:43,760
Very few events.

2513
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:49,400
Well, wouldn't you say the same about another ride called, another relaxing boat ride called

2514
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,560
Navi River Journey?

2515
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,060
It always comes back to boat rides.

2516
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:56,080
It's always, I know, move on without slow moving boat talk.

2517
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:56,660
Right.

2518
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,540
But Navi River Journey is not a rapids raft.

2519
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,320
Exactly.

2520
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:02,380
For no reason.

2521
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,540
Is it, wait, it's a rapids?

2522
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:05,900
It is a rapid.

2523
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:06,780
It's not a boat?

2524
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,120
No, it's not a boat.

2525
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:08,600
What?

2526
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:09,200
Really?

2527
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,680
It is a slow moving rapids.

2528
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,120
Whoa.

2529
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:13,380
It's still a boat though.

2530
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,760
It just makes the ideas that you're in.

2531
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,480
So by that definition, it is a boat.

2532
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:19,720
Sure.

2533
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:24,400
But it's the kind of vehicle where you should be like bumping around and going down waterfalls

2534
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,300
and instead you just kind of like spin around.

2535
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:26,800
Yeah.

2536
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,760
I watched a couple ride videos.

2537
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,760
I also didn't see anyone loading or unloading you.

2538
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:33,800
Yeah.

2539
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:37,460
I watched it on 2X speed and it felt like it was a picture.

2540
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:38,800
Nothing was changing.

2541
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,520
It was just a slow moving vehicle.

2542
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:42,620
I had no idea this was a…

2543
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,720
It should have been Twisty Tourney, Rocky Rollie.

2544
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,780
I thought there'd be a little…

2545
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:47,680
Yes, a dip.

2546
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:50,200
Like a Pirate of the Caribbean level dip.

2547
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:51,500
No, not the case.

2548
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:52,380
Wow.

2549
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,800
Still feels like we have to do it.

2550
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:57,380
Well, I need to see these sound effects because they also sound…

2551
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:05,040
There's some that sound like generic animals and then some that sound like a man screaming

2552
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:08,160
in either agony or ecstasy.

2553
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,980
Like it's very odd.

2554
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:10,720
Except that it's ecstasy.

2555
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,200
It's probably a man screaming in ecstasy.

2556
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,640
He recorded himself screaming in ecstasy.

2557
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:20,980
Those unfinished warehouse roofs really help the audio fidelity.

2558
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:26,520
Maybe it was just people genuinely screaming in ecstasy as I think anyone would at any of

2559
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,940
these establishments clearly.

2560
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:28,320
Sure.

2561
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,480
I mean like it's the kind of thing where…

2562
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:35,380
Like I found some article that was like trying to figure it out.

2563
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:38,620
I don't know, Millennials or Gen Z or whatever going to rainforest cafes?

2564
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:39,200
Why?

2565
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:40,040
Why would they do this?

2566
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:44,380
Well, it must be couched in irony and I'm like, I think you're overthinking it.

2567
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,180
I think there are a lot of layers here.

2568
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:50,820
It's improbable that these exist and that they're still there.

2569
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:55,780
In an otherwise really boring mall, you can go to a place that has a storm every 20 minutes.

2570
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:57,180
It's so bizarre.

2571
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,700
You had the best day ever seemingly doing it.

2572
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,740
Truly an iconic 24 hours for me.

2573
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:09,220
Just bringing Cha Cha full of Diet Coke in the console of my car driving home.

2574
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,180
Taylor, Cha Cha, icons.

2575
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:12,580
Nothing but icons.

2576
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:16,420
You had a spirit of adventure that you hadn't known for so long.

2577
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:20,920
You went to the Forever 21 outlet and bought a top that dissolved by the time you got back

2578
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:21,980
to Los Angeles.

2579
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:24,540
Self-eating top.

2580
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,580
But anything else on the way out the door here?

2581
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:33,240
The only thing I'll say is that like if it's replaced, if the rainforest cafe exists in a

2582
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:37,160
mall and then it's replaced by something very boring like it's like an FYE or something,

2583
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:38,720
I'm upset.

2584
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:43,280
But like Woodfield replaced theirs with something called Peppa Pig's World of Play.

2585
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,200
Sick.

2586
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,320
Which I don't know.

2587
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:48,460
I'm not saying it's like as good as a rainforest cafe, but it's, you know,

2588
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:51,160
it at least is something silly.

2589
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:53,140
You can meet big Peppas?

2590
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,320
Yeah, there's big Peppas.

2591
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:55,480
Which Peppas can you meet?

2592
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:57,600
I actually don't know the names of the Peppas.

2593
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:58,580
Can you meet the Peppa Dad?

2594
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,160
I love the dad.

2595
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:05,020
I don't know his name or anything, but like he's very charming.

2596
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,820
I have a somewhat unfounded crush on Peppa Pig's dad.

2597
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,420
I don't know why he's a pig.

2598
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,400
I think my wife will hear you on this.

2599
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:11,900
Absolutely.

2600
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:13,640
There's a charm to this guy.

2601
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:15,840
You too?

2602
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,640
Who do you rank first, Peppa's dad or Bluey's dad?

2603
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:19,360
Peppa's dad.

2604
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:19,880
Okay.

2605
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:21,100
I'm a Peppa's dad kind of gal.

2606
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,120
Bluey's dad too commonplace.

2607
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:28,240
I thought Bluey for the longest time was the dad and then I watched a couple.

2608
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:32,180
I watched a couple because I was trying to get Garfield to watch it because there were

2609
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:39,800
some videos online that dogs really like Bluey because the color palette is good for their

2610
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:40,100
vision.

2611
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,660
He had no interest in it.

2612
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:42,500
Garfield was an argument.

2613
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,900
He went right back to sleep.

2614
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:46,160
He needs his 16 hours.

2615
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,860
Look at him here in a tux and then that's kind of that scruff.

2616
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,200
I think there's something about the scruff.

2617
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:52,480
I know.

2618
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:53,820
Then the glasses are cool.

2619
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:55,280
Like he seems cool.

2620
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:56,460
I just haven't watched you.

2621
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:57,700
I'll have an opinion soon.

2622
01:35:57,700 --> 01:36:01,160
He seems like he would order a scotch which is a very cool move.

2623
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:02,120
Absolutely.

2624
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:02,600
Does he wear…

2625
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,400
Self-funny, self-effacing.

2626
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,740
Does he wear a captain's hat ever?

2627
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,320
Oh, probably.

2628
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:08,800
He's here in a chef's hat.

2629
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:11,140
Just a baseball tee that's a little too tight.

2630
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,600
That seems like he's classy.

2631
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,960
He's pink which is your vibe.

2632
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:14,560
Yeah, he is pink.

2633
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:15,300
Okay.

2634
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,840
Daddy Pig is the name.

2635
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,180
Yeah, I don't want to say that aloud but…

2636
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:19,660
Daddy Pig?

2637
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:24,320
He's got little silly name boys here have no problem saying that.

2638
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:25,120
Daddy Pig?

2639
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:25,560
Yeah.

2640
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:26,720
I'm very comfortable saying it.

2641
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,880
Little Daddy Pig boy.

2642
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:28,900
I'm just a little Daddy Pig.

2643
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:29,420
Oh, no.

2644
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:32,080
I just realized Daddy Pig becomes mojo bones.

2645
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:33,380
No.

2646
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,100
Protect him.

2647
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:37,300
Don't let Daddy Pig become mojo bones.

2648
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:44,080
Daddy Pig should take the family to visit down at that beach where the pigs swim in the ocean.

2649
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:45,060
What?

2650
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:47,860
You guys know there's like in the Caribbean I think.

2651
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,980
I think there's a beach where pigs swim around.

2652
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:50,180
Yes.

2653
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:50,840
Okay.

2654
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:53,320
Some wild pigs like to swim.

2655
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:56,700
In a couple of years we'll run out of stuff to talk about so we'll have to go review the

2656
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:57,340
pig ocean.

2657
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,280
But until that time…

2658
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:03,100
Pig beach.

2659
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:03,360
We have…

2660
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:08,420
Got another couple decades with Epic Universe opening.

2661
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:09,540
That's true.

2662
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:09,740
You're right.

2663
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,800
We got the Chronos.

2664
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:11,820
So many portals.

2665
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,700
Chronos will give us longer…

2666
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,080
Decades of material.

2667
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:15,620
All the time.

2668
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:18,580
Get ready for 40 more years of Podcast The Ride.

2669
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:23,000
But for now, so happy you came and talked to us about this.

2670
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:25,500
Carly Weisel, you survived Podcast The Ride.

2671
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:25,820
I did it.

2672
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:29,300
Thank you for returning from Ontario full of joy and energy.

2673
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,600
So fun to talk about.

2674
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,680
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2675
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,080
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2676
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,920
My podcast is very amusing.

2677
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:41,400
We're doing weekly episodes now which is a big leap from doing a bunch of episodes and

2678
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,400
disappearing for four months for pre-production.

2679
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,140
So tune in.

2680
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,420
Tell me about that version though.

2681
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:47,640
That sounds good.

2682
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:48,260
Oh it's nice.

2683
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:49,200
Does that work out?

2684
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,940
Yeah but I was also doing episodes that…

2685
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:55,380
Because I'm a solo host and I'd be doing hour 45 sometimes.

2686
01:37:55,930 --> 01:37:56,860
Just old gal.

2687
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,680
Just you talking straight through.

2688
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,020
Putting four interviews in one episode.

2689
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:02,840
You learn along the way.

2690
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,820
So now we are weekly.

2691
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:06,220
It is more digestible as one would say.

2692
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:07,660
And it's a bunch of fun.

2693
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,960
It's all theme park stuff.

2694
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:11,340
Every December obviously we do Shrek stuff.

2695
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:13,860
Disney and Universal mostly.

2696
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,760
Other silly things.

2697
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:18,380
We're going to be doing an episode about studio tours in Los Angeles.

2698
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:19,740
A little more travel this year.

2699
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:20,760
So it's fun.

2700
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:22,880
And then I'm just always yelling into my phone on Instagram.

2701
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:25,860
Great.

2702
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:29,220
So you can find you on that for quick yells and then for long talks.

2703
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,220
Yeah for long yells you got to go to the app.

2704
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:37,040
Merch is available in our Tee Public store.

com slash Podcast the Ride.

2709
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:53,280
And on the way out the door I couldn't find Daddy Pig in a captain's hat.

2710
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:57,460
But pretty close runner up Grandpa Pig in a cap.

2711
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:59,840
Whoa didn't know about Grandpa Pig.

2712
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:01,820
Grandpa Pig's pretty nice too.

2713
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:04,700
Unfortunately not my type but he seems nice.

2714
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,860
But it kind of it shows you where Daddy Pig will go.

2715
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:10,700
If I'm willing to make his long term investment on Daddy Pig.

2716
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,880
Basically going to turn into this.

2717
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:12,980
He has eye surgery.

2718
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:15,520
He'll get eye surgery apparently won't need those glasses.

2719
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:18,900
He's a little pale in a disconcerting way.

2720
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:21,960
Yeah wait he's a lighter pink.

2721
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,260
A little closer to eventual pig decline.

2722
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,380
Oh no you're seeing that on his face.

2723
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:31,380
So Grandpa Pig makes you sad a little bit.

2724
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,260
Makes me a little sad.

2725
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:33,220
Aging is tough.

2726
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,360
Oh let me turn the laptop around.

2727
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,100
I won't make you.

2728
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,880
What about what about Daddy Dog in a captain's hat?

2729
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,580
Who is that?

2730
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:42,100
Yeah it is a lot to learn.

2731
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:42,920
He's from the show.

2732
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:46,400
Multiple captains hat wearing animals in the show.

2733
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,440
I mean if that's not if that's not endorsements.

2734
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,960
Combined with the Schomburg retail location.

2735
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,660
Peppa Pig retelling of Master and Commander.

2736
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:59,140
Oceans are now battlefields.

2737
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,940
Make it happen Peppa Pig creators.

2738
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,840
This has been a Forever Dog Production.
