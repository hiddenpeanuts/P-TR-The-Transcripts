1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Warning!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The following podcast technically

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
has a topic but don't hold us

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to it. Beware of jump scares

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
from horny lions,

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
grouchy OC conservatives,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and a certain very

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
loud bar rescuer.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The hilarious James Adomian joins

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
us to talk about a bunch of bullshit

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
some of which is So Cal

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Waterparks on Podcast

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The Ride.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to Podcast

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The Ride, a podcast hosted

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
by 40 year olds who will likely

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
drown on the watch of untrained

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
15 year olds. I'm Scott

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Gardner, there's Mike Carlson. It's gonna happen

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and it's gonna be even more embarrassing

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
than you could imagine it being. Like

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
something like I'll lose my pants first

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
or something and then I'll be like upside down.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Like it's gonna be a cartoon

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
death with an apathetic

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
15 year old watching on.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well and we're hopefully, we're probably

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
if like a more knowledgeable

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
lifeguard could have solved the situation

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
in 20 seconds but in the

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
7 minutes it takes for him to get his

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
shit together. Yeah.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But I don't blame him, he's 15, what is he supposed to do?

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They should maybe change the hiring policies

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
in general but that's something we can

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
discuss and get into. That's a whole political issue

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
we have to get into later, yeah. Jason Sheridan, hi.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hi, yeah, if it's not apathetic

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and comical enough, I'm

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
gonna haunt the waterpark.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's cool. It's gonna be a haunted waterpark.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's a good place to haunt because

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
they're inherently creepy, they're

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
creepy when they're not running and they're really creepy

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
when they're abandoned as some are,

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
as happens. Yeah.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Some of the things we'll be talking about today.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But when he says haunt, he's gonna haunt the lazy river

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and he's just gonna sit in the like ghost

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
inner tube and like float down and go hey,

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
hey, hey, hey.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like he doesn't want to actually do full on haunting.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What are you making, you making taquitos?

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, you don't have the energy to haunt.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is that a new flavor? Yeah, haunting's an aggressive

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
act, it's a lot of calorie burn.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You gotta stay on top of someone and you have to like

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
learn about them and like define their fears.

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're suggesting that haunting is

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
tired? I think it is.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, I think so. I don't know.

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think there's an aggressive version and there's a

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
lazy, if you're just passively around as a

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
ghost, yeah, that's not the same.

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Certainly effort is involved.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The unpaid

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
emotional labor.

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Who's paying me to be a ghost? Who's paying me

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to haunt? If I'm not being paid, why should I

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
put in the effort? If there's dark energy,

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
it's coming from somewhere.

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So if energy is expelled,

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
it's coming from somewhere. So there has to be some effort

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and it has to eventually become depleted.

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's what I believe. That's something I believe for

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
years. Not just something I thought of

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
now.

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That all of your other less known

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
podcasts get into for a long time.

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We'll get

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
thoughts about parks,

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
haunting, dark energy and where it comes from

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
from our guest. We're really excited he's joining

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
us today. A podcast luminary,

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
a prolific actor, stand-up and impressionist.

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's got a new special out called

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The Path of Most Resistance. Very excited.

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
James Adomian, welcome to the show.

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hey, thanks for having me, Scott. Absolutely.

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is a

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
provocative question.

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The haunting...

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The specific

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
mechanics of haunting and all that.

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You said something about

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
unpaid labor which makes me wonder

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
about the people who are hungry

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
for the haunting work and they're down by the docks

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
waiting to be picked.

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's like, I only need two ghosts today.

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You got room in the truck.

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're not scary enough, you're not

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
big enough.

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Scary, existentially scary

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
or large

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
inhabitants of

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
an energy field. I'm a weird

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
little kid. That doesn't

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
work.

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You can be little, but

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
there's got to be something imposing.

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If you're little, then you have to go overboard

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
in terms of psychically squeaking.

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I just don't know if you're neither here nor there.

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're always hiring the ring girl over there

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
with the long hair.

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
She's my same age. What do you do?

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, but you're so cute, Pip Squeak.

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're just the cute one.

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
She has a way of turning the

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
cute expectations into

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
a very unfulfilling sadness.

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come back when you can do that.

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Pure scary-wise, I've got it.

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I didn't realize there were all these other emotions

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I needed to evoke.

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's like a Casper

132
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
situation. It's too cute.

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Casper is too cute.

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Listen, kid, you died young. That's too bad.

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But I can't do anything scary

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
with that.

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The ghost

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
foreman.

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He's the agent for the good.

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm trying to find your work. I really

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
am, but it's tough out there.

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's tragic, but it's not convenient.

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's okay.

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Look, 4,000

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
little kid ghosts like you every day

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
come and wash up under the

147
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
metaphysical side of the city.

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But I died a little bit younger than

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
them. I was talking to a five-year-old

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
in the lobby. I was four and a half.

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's sadder. It's my sixth-old-months of sadder.

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, this is a great

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
field to explore.

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is employment for after all of our

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
jobs.

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We're also

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
busy thinking about how we're going to make

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
money now that we don't think about what

159
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
we're going to do after we die.

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We're too focused on

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
not working now.

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Not working now, we don't think about not working

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
after we're dead.

164
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
In the afterlife, we'll all become grindsets,

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
like guys who are all about

166
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
grinding.

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But unfortunately,

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that's usually

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
attached to some kind of mill

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
that you're grinding

171
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
in a circle.

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It becomes literal grinding.

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Grinding

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
ectoplasm.

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Grinding bones into

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the raw powder that the elements of

177
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
hell and the wings of hell are made of.

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's always someone who's like

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the one who likes everyone

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
sad except for the guy who's like

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
yes, power!

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And no one else is having a good time

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
except for him.

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So how do you rise to become hell

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
foreman? How did he get that?

186
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You definitely don't get to do live shows that way

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
where everyone's in misery but you're like

188
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
good!

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It just doesn't work.

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It'd be more fun

191
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I think. Power dynamics

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
on display.

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
James, thanks for joining us.

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You threw out a bunch of stuff

195
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
we could talk about. We have this water

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
parks notion but this is a loose

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
assignment. We can talk about

198
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
zillion things in the

199
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
general realm of theme parks or otherwise

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and I say otherwise because I have a theory

201
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
permission to speak informally about the theme

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
park. Yes.

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You did not have to write a report to get

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
on the show. This can be loose.

205
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Fuck.

206
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can show it to us later.

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Well, we appreciate it.

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We recognize the effort.

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I have a theory about

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
some of what brought you here

211
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
today and I could be wrong

212
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
but this is what I think.

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Brett Boehm who runs the show at

214
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Forever Dog here messaged us about

215
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
having you on and I think that

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I believe it was on the

217
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
very day that you had

218
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
been on the best show

219
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and you had done a big

220
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
chunk of stuff about

221
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Jon Taffer.

222
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And that is what I believe. I believe

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
that Brett set us up on some kind of

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
podcast blind date on

225
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
the basis of Jon Taffer because

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
we're Taffer obsessives.

227
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is something we talk about a lot

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and you boast an incredible

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Taffer which I don't mean to

230
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
put you on the spot about.

231
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
My life's work.

232
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I was just thrilled to hear

233
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
you're a fan of the big guy.

234
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If he came in here, what you've got

235
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
plastic on the ground.

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Podcast.

237
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Close it.

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This should be ballet only.

239
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Our customers don't care about

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
they don't need they don't need a bunch of frills.

241
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Black Walls is what people like

242
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
all right. Charlie Rose.

243
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He is has the wrong advice for

244
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
all occasions. Yeah. Yeah.

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's so like

246
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
in practice does not

247
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
really work. Seemingly as

248
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
you said with Tom like his work is

249
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
overturned as soon as he is out of town.

250
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
As everyone undoes

251
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
what he does. It's not

252
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
the usual Ozymandias

253
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
grind of the hereafter.

254
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah. Yes.

255
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's very with him. It's just like no he's gone

256
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
flip it back over to. Yeah.

257
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think he's they're all waiting outside. They're all

258
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
waving. Bye. Thank you.

259
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And as soon as the car says the production

260
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
vans go over the horizon line. Okay.

261
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Turn the sign back because there's always a place

262
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
it's called there's a place that'll be called like

263
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
you know the

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the exit door.

265
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And he comes in and we're going to click

266
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
here's your new bar. And then he

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
unveils it and it's like Mikonos.

268
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This has nothing to do.

269
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We cleared out all the regulars.

270
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Now it's this.

271
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And he's like all those people who came all

272
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the time you don't got to worry about

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
them anymore. You're going to get college

274
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
kids in here now.

275
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And he's like we and it's like we used to serve grilled

276
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
cheese in here and he's like but you're serving escargot

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
now. This is a whole new

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
menu. And then like that saddles them with more money

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
like problems.

280
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He basically turns every bar into

281
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
like what people don't like about Santa

282
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Monica.

283
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's brightly lit unwelcoming

284
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
TVs

285
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
everywhere.

286
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh nobody.

287
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Nobody goes to those places. Right.

288
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And then we we bulldoze them

289
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and turn them into bigger dumber places.

290
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We're flipping.

291
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't you realize. Bar

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
flipping.

293
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He always wants to light the liquor bottles from underneath

294
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
too. That's very important. Oh is that a

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
common. That's one thing at least in the first so many

296
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
seasons he always wants a light under

297
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the liquor bottles behind the bar.

298
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Every bar has to have lit.

299
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
To remind you that they because otherwise people

300
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
might not know. Right. That we have

301
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
liquor bottles here. If they're

302
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
in the shadows.

303
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
There's a sports bar in Burbank.

304
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I used to drive by

305
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
going to an old job.

306
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Champs. Champs.

307
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah he played in Champs. Champs which I think

308
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
was the name before and maybe

309
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
after or like

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
whatever. I forget if they ever changed the name.

311
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Champs.

312
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We're going for a French

313
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
vibe now at Champs.

314
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But I would drive by it like

315
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
every day and so for

316
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
a while the outside

317
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
they would just it would be painted white

318
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
then it'd be painted black

319
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
then it'd be painted wood grain

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
like I'm like what is going on over

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
there. And I found out it was

322
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
because it was on Bar Rescue.

323
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh that was concurrent to when this was happening.

324
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It was their original and then there

325
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
was a intermediary

326
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
phase and then his version and

327
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
the undoing. And then

328
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
uh oh that did we

329
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
he permanently stained the wood

330
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
so we have to go back to a completely

331
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
different color. I also

332
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
don't like it there was residential

333
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
areas all around

334
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
like I'm like wait what's

335
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
hard. Like just

336
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
just have a bunch of TVs. You're a

337
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
sports bar. Just sell wings

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and mozzarella sticks you know.

339
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And don't over pour

340
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and don't disrespect women.

341
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Those are the other things he yells about.

342
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's only for me to do.

343
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Right.

344
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
One of the things he'll do is that he will

345
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
send his wife into a place and be like

346
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and then they'll be like let's see

347
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
let's go in there and let's see if he hits on you.

348
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And then he does

349
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and then he comes in and goes like

350
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
you hit on my wife. It's like

351
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
he didn't know that first of all

352
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
that she was your wife and

353
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
you guys planned it on camera.

354
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I watched it. I'm watching the show.

355
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're watching the issuing

356
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
of the assignment. You order it. She's like

357
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
sure no problem. Go tart

358
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
it up. Pull the shirt

359
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
down a little bit. Show off what you got.

360
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
They did what? They hit on you.

361
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah it's a source of a lot of

362
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
joy to us. It's an episode that we've long

363
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
threatened to do that our pal Griffin

364
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Newman forces

365
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
to do on the main. Oh I mean that we

366
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
would love. Yes. That we would love

367
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and a certain percentage of our audience would be

368
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
so mad about. But I

369
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
think worth it. Scott let me ask you something.

370
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're going to look around when he has the eye contact

371
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
of a pedantic

372
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
school principal. You're going

373
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
to look around the studio and say that

374
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
things are going well.

375
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I think so. Yeah you know people subscribe.

376
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Garbage on the floor.

377
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They don't see that. It's an audio medium.

378
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And that's your excuse that it's

379
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
audio only. I think most of

380
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the time it sounds pretty good. Most

381
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
of the time there's not some weird ambient

382
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
hum through the entire episode. If I locked you in here overnight

383
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
would you be scared?

384
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
There's no windows.

385
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We're locking you in here overnight.

386
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We're going to see if you're scared.

387
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And I'm going to be locked in here with you.

388
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And we're going to see if you're scared.

389
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm scared now.

390
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Are you going to stare at me in that manner

391
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
all night? What do you think I'm going to do?

392
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Eight to ten

393
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
hours of this.

394
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're so much taller than me too. This is what's

395
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
going to turn this place into a bar

396
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that people are going to like.

397
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're spiddling all over

398
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
the microphones. These are going to be inoperable

399
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
if you. It would be worth

400
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
it for like a five minute episode I think.

401
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If he just yelled at us and left.

402
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We can do a mini episode. Although you know what I forgot.

403
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He's not going to go for that. He's going to want to take over

404
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and change your podcast.

405
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
If we allow him to. I would allow him to do it.

406
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If we describe the full breadth of what's been going

407
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
on and like we show him our. We open the books

408
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
as the show says.

409
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's your amount of growth.

410
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's because you're a niche podcast.

411
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're only talking about theme parks. You should be

412
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
talking about sports in America.

413
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Your GoFundMe is more like a GoFuckMe.

414
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The one

415
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
in we have I still believe

416
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
is that he posted this last year

417
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
him on Tron

418
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Lightcycle Run at Disney World with

419
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
his wife. And he like praised

420
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
it up and down. So maybe

421
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
under like the. You just hit Tron

422
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
my wife.

423
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The master control program

424
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
hit on you.

425
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I think there's multiple in's because

426
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
actually you know what I didn't realize. Did you guys know

427
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
did anyone know that the reason the Paramount connection

428
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
came about is that he

429
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
knew he had contacts over there because

430
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
he was a consultant at

431
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
some point in the early run of Bubba

432
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Gump. Is that right? Yes.

433
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah. Whoa. We got a lot to talk

434
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
to him about. We really do. We've talked about Bubba Gump many

435
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
times. It's on universal property

436
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
so it counts. Yeah. Yeah.

437
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's that's in our top purview.

438
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You know the jurisdictional line

439
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
like that comes

440
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
into play sometimes where there's like I'm the

441
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
sheriff of universal city.

442
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I got jurisdiction

443
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
from the minion statue all the way down

444
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to the border of forever.

445
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Bubba Gump shrimp

446
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
falls within the purview of this

447
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
county. If you can see

448
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
the minion. If the minion is in your

449
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
line of sight then he's still in charge.

450
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That would be

451
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
the ancient common law

452
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
definition. Be ye

453
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
under the eye of the minion.

454
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He does have

455
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
the minion does have kind of a like

456
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Brazil Christ statue

457
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
type like. Yeah. Like I wonder

458
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
if any like maybe I don't know if any parents

459
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
in this area were parents in this area.

460
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We could use that minion as kind

461
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
of a if you act out that minion

462
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
could come down here. God up there.

463
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This reminds me of the crucified minion

464
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
that was our

465
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
AI manufactured the meme

466
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and then manufactured the outrage about it

467
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
afterwards. I miss this

468
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
entirely. Don't navigate away.

469
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Don't don't go away.

470
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The videos of just people saying the

471
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
same script. Yeah it was the same

472
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
it was the outrage script that the

473
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
same people the people were going like

474
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
you know it's can you believe it. Can

475
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
you believe it. Can you believe it

476
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
that they've gone this far that AI has gone this far

477
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
that AI has gone this far

478
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and it was just an image

479
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
AI had created this image of

480
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
a crucified minion. OK

481
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
with the crown of thorns

482
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and then entirely. OK. Well this was

483
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
over the summer. Interesting.

484
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And what who's so what's

485
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
the the what's the end game here.

486
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
How do you benefit from no one

487
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
benefits from it. It's just a cycle

488
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
of it's chasing itself. Yeah.

489
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And although I

490
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
do like to imagine the extension of

491
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
the world where there is a minion

492
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Christ and

493
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
you have like you have somebody

494
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
like Johnny Cash singing like really

495
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
respectful

496
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
gospel like

497
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
were

498
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
were you there

499
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
when they

500
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
crucified my

501
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
lord.

502
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Sometimes

503
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
it causes me

504
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
to minion

505
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
minion

506
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I think that's like

507
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
one culture is like flattened and AI

508
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
is taken over. That is what like

509
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
people will. There'll be an AI Johnny Cash

510
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
song like that. That's easily going to

511
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
like you can do that now. Really you can make it

512
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
now. I also think a lot of maybe AI is

513
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
doing a lot of crucifixion of

514
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
our favorite characters. Really quickly I

515
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
found a crucified Shrek who's

516
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
also buff too.

517
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We have two premises here. This is very

518
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
hat on a hat. Right. Buff Shrek

519
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
crucified for being buff

520
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
because that's not what he was on

521
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
the. He was

522
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
on the hill of Golgotha

523
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and he was next to the minion

524
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
when he was crucified.

525
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Was he repentant or was he

526
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the mean one?

527
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I think

528
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I think Shrek was repentant

529
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
which is why he had returned to his

530
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
monster form.

531
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Which Pontius

532
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Pilate could not tolerate.

533
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Still a monster.

534
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Crucify him. He was

535
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
next to the lord of the

536
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
minions who looked

537
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
up to heaven and referred to Shrek

538
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
next to him and said

539
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Translation I'll see you up there my friend

540
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I guess. And then next to them was

541
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
just Barabbas going like what the

542
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
fuck is going on. Barabbas

543
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
was freed by the crowd.

544
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Sorry man. It's getting weird.

545
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It was my favorite.

546
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The only thing that I looked forward to

547
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
about church every year was that every year

548
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
on Good Friday there would be

549
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
a little play and you in

550
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
the audience of church

551
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
what do you call the audience of church?

552
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yes everybody had the part to do

553
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
the congregation. Yeah yeah. Like I have

554
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
a line in this. I get to be

555
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
like there's a whole crowd line

556
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and then hearing all of these children

557
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
parents my age and then old

558
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
people all kind of really hushed

559
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
going Barabbas.

560
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Who do you want me to free? Barabbas.

561
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Barabbas.

562
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Nobody would ever put any

563
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
stank on it. It's

564
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
the only positive memory I have

565
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
from years of church. And

566
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
that's the betrayal of Christ in my mind.

567
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I think that there's no greater

568
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
part. There are some kinds of parts

569
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
that are designed for a

570
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
great actor. And in the

571
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
passion of Christ

572
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I've said this before. Any idiot can play

573
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Jesus Christ. Any blue eyed

574
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
fuck.

575
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's kind of all about looks. You don't have a good

576
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
you have someone who's like blessed are the poor

577
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
in spirit. No one's listening. Everyone's

578
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
watching and thinking of something else while they're watching the

579
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
scene. Easy one note. Where you put the good

580
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
actor is the role of Pontius

581
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Pilate. Yeah. That's where the actor

582
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
because you're introduced to him

583
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
as the most powerful

584
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
man in Palestine.

585
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And he's like he's sitting there

586
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
in a palace with attendants

587
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and he's like who is this?

588
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
He doesn't want to do it.

589
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Who is this Jesus

590
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
of Nazareth?

591
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And then he interrogates him in person

592
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
where he's like are you

593
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
the son of God?

594
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Looking around at the people

595
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and he ends up killing, he ends up sending him to be executed

596
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and then the best, there's nothing

597
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
you, I mean the

598
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
washing of the hands afterwards.

599
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh yeah. There's all process. I washed my hands

600
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
of this. I didn't want any of it.

601
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That is that.

602
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You saw in the pre-interview

603
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
this was not really my vibe.

604
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's where you put the actor and you

605
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
only give him one note.

606
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Which is chew as

607
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
much marble scenery as your teeth

608
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
can handle.

609
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Bigger. Bigger.

610
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Bigger. Bigger. Yeah.

611
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Make me pull you back.

612
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah. Pontius Pilate

613
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
in Jesus Christ Superstar is very

614
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
campy. Oh yeah. Wait.

615
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Is that depiction? How do they,

616
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
does he get a song?

617
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Is he the one who gets a song

618
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and that's all he does

619
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
in the show is the one song

620
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
he's in and out but he steals the show.

621
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It feels like Adam

622
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
West should have played that role.

623
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Shatner.

624
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Like someone really hammy from

625
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
the old days.

626
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You say the son of God. I guess I did walk you

627
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
into a Shatner doing this.

628
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What would it be like? Sorry.

629
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Miracles you say.

630
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And from his point of view

631
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
it's like when he's talking to the robot

632
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
trying to trip it up with logic.

633
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We just watched

634
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
the pilot of T.J. Hooker so I guess I have Shatner

635
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
on the brain. Okay. So you're almost, yeah.

636
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You're thinking more T.J. Hooker. I'm thinking more

637
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Hooker. How would T.J. Hooker be a different pilot than Kirk?

638
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Right. Exactly. And it's so

639
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
different. It would be so different.

640
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's more grounded. Yeah.

641
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Barabbas was the one who was

642
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
parted. Gestas

643
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and dismas were the names

644
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
of the people to the right and left

645
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
of Jesus. Gestmas and dismas?

646
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I never would have guessed that. And as

647
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
you're saying that about like Easter

648
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Good Friday services

649
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I am remembering that

650
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
in that little pageant

651
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I was the

652
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
mean one crucified next

653
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
to Jesus. Really? You were the bad

654
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
one? I was the one like kissing

655
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
at the audience. Shut up Jesus. Hissing at the

656
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
congregation. Wait does it remind me how it works?

657
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There's one who's nice, who they bond

658
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
but the other one is like

659
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
the one who's mean. I was the mean one.

660
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So you would hiss at the congregation like you were a

661
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
wrestling bad, like a wrestling bad guy.

662
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
A branches

663
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
cross, branches from like

664
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the woods behind the church that

665
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
one of the deacons or

666
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
something. Were they heavy? No.

667
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But was it tough to hold your hands up in that?

668
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It was awkward. My hands were tied

669
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
to wood. How old were you? Probably like

670
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
11 or 12. Is there video?

671
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't know if there is video

672
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
of the, I think that

673
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I would pay $500 for that

674
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
video. I would love it. Do you

675
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
have any idea what you said? Do you remember any of it?

676
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't think I said anything. I think I was just doing

677
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
a lot of like grrr. You said you were hissing though

678
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
at the crowd. Like at the crowd like

679
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
railing at, cause it was mean

680
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and then the one who were pence

681
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
like has the

682
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
lines. Think about how scary could

683
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
11 year old you have been.

684
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
To be the most hard boiled

685
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
criminal in the world. Yeah.

686
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Wow. Well you gotta

687
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
look into that if there is a video. Yeah.

688
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Please. Tell me, do you know how to

689
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
spell that name cause maybe I could find some dialogue

690
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
while we. Oh

691
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
it's either G-E-S-T-A-S

692
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
or D-I-S

693
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
M-A-S.

694
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay yeah it filled me in.

695
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Justus Impentanent

696
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Thief. Yeah.

697
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I was the Impentanent Thief.

698
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Justus. Justus.

699
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What? Okay. I want to imagine he's a

700
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Jester and he has like a big Jester hat

701
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
on. Wow he's being crucified.

702
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Now we're

703
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
talking. Uh huh. Yeah.

704
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I was at Lollapalooza and I

705
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
kept stealing

706
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and I was being crucified.

707
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I never took my Jester hat off.

708
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Your cat in the hat. My big dog

709
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
hat. From the 90's.

710
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Hat in that hat.

711
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Lollapalooza hat.

712
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah.

713
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Well you know

714
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
we're not here to talk about

715
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
actually you know what I meant to say

716
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
in the Taffer run. I'm going to put this on the

717
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
table. You certainly don't need to take it

718
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
but I just thought ahead with

719
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
the Jon Taffer discussion and

720
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I just want to show you how

721
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
what generous hosts we are. If

722
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
during this podcast at any

723
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
point you would like a sip of Jon

724
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Taffer's personal

725
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
bourbon brand.

726
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
This was

727
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
We're recording this very early also.

728
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You thought of this ahead of time?

729
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yes yeah yeah. If you want a little

730
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
what is it 1108 AM sip

731
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
of Jon Taffer's

732
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
browned butter bourbon. I haven't eaten

733
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
enough.

734
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Would you want to smell it maybe?

735
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Okay

736
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
can I look at this? Yes of course.

737
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
At least observe it. Is this like the

738
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
hot sauce podcast?

739
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It can be.

740
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
There's a lot of things to hate about

741
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
this. Oh yeah.

742
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Taffer's browned butter bourbon.

743
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
They have the font

744
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
of a newspaper from the Civil War

745
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
like you're supposed to with a whiskey.

746
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But it's supposed to

747
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
be called like

748
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
broken wheel.

749
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Something rustic.

750
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's either something

751
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
like a piece of old

752
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
machinery that doesn't work

753
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
or a sad animal or

754
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
a veiled

755
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
barren calf whiskey.

756
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Right yeah.

757
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Like disrupted crow.

758
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Or there's some veiled

759
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
very veiled reference to the Confederate States

760
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
of America.

761
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
If you know if you're from

762
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
there you know what they are. It'll be like Arkansas

763
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
whistle.

764
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But this is

765
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
he has this font but it's just his dumb name

766
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Taffer's. Yeah.

767
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
This is new. It's not an old thing.

768
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It looks like the old. He's like get me

769
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
the font of the old letters.

770
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Browned butter

771
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
bourbon. Bourbon is already too

772
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
sugary for me.

773
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Even just regular bourbon straight. If I'm going to

774
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
drink whiskey I want it to be a

775
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
rye whiskey or a Japanese whiskey.

776
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You would hate this so much.

777
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
He's like make it more sugary.

778
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Southern comfort is too bitter

779
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
for our purposes.

780
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You should at least pop that top and smell

781
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
it if you can't because the smell

782
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
is like you can't. I don't think there is a hint

783
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
of whiskey in this whiskey.

784
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Jesus Christ. Yeah right. Yeah.

785
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Get me a bottle. Get me a

786
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
bottle of rejected Jack

787
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Daniels. Then get a

788
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
honey bear.

789
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Get a honey bear and upend him.

790
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I want that honey.

791
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The entire bottle of honey bear honey.

792
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Glug glug glug glug

793
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
glug glug glug glug.

794
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Milk him.

795
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Melt a bag of

796
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Werther's.

797
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Crafted by John Taffer.

798
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And then he has this thing where he signed

799
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
it. Oh yes it's exclusive.

800
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's not a wet signature though I'll note.

801
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It's printed.

802
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There's this shit that you

803
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
see with Makers Mark where there's like

804
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
paint drops and shit on the

805
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
bottle. Oh but it looks

806
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
like it's printed according to the same pattern

807
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
each time.

808
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
With notes of vanilla and toffee.

809
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Bad.

810
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Those are not things I know.

811
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
First of all if you're at the cheesecake

812
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
factory.

813
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's the dessert that you

814
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
shouldn't get at the cheesecake factory.

815
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Vanilla and toffee.

816
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What? No. Having

817
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
tasted this their definition of hints

818
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
is a giant smack in

819
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
the face because there is no

820
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
there's not a hint of whiskey. There's

821
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
not you know you'd be hard pressed

822
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
to like oh maybe now all right now on the fifth

823
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
sip maybe I detect a little bit of whiskey.

824
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And he has the audacity to have a frying

825
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
pan on the back label.

826
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's what that is.

827
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Which is ironic because at Taffer's

828
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Tavern locations everything

829
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
is like sous vide or convection

830
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
oven made.

831
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
He has a restaurant chain that's like pseudo

832
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
failing by the way if you didn't know that.

833
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Which one is it? It's called Taffer's Tavern.

834
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
One just closed in Massachusetts.

835
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
The one in Boston area.

836
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yes. Six months ago.

837
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Every time one opens in a new city

838
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
you can tell the food critic in that

839
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
city is just gleeful.

840
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
To give it just an awful

841
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
review.

842
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I thought I was washed up here.

843
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Thought I was washed up up here.

844
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Chattanooga Tennessee.

845
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The Taffer's Tavern locations

846
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
have a big picture like a painting of him.

847
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Like a showcase.

848
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That's disgusting.

849
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But there's only two locations right now.

850
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You're supposed to trust this guy.

851
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
This is some sort of like money scam though.

852
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I think there's many things that have been

853
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
additional coming soon that have been there for three years.

854
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
To Orlando. It will be

855
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
the Orlando location is going to be ten minutes

856
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
away from Epic Universe.

857
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
We will do a live show at Taffer's Tavern next time.

858
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
If there's a room to do it.

859
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
If they let you.

860
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Live barcades in the bar?

861
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
This really should be a sketch.

862
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I wouldn't judge it for anything. So here it goes.

863
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You have Gordon Ramsay and

864
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Jon Taffer.

865
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Like Spy vs Spy.

866
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Trying to remake each other's bars.

867
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Hell's Kitchen and Taffer's Tavern.

868
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's disgusting.

869
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
There's raw pork everywhere.

870
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We don't have pork on the menu!

871
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Exactly.

872
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Is it an attempt?

873
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Are they undermining or are they fixing?

874
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Is the fixing itself undermining?

875
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I think the idea is they're trying to humiliate

876
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
each other in both the fixing

877
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and the tearing down.

878
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
This would be so

879
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
fun to do. It feels like there are a few comedy

880
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
places left to do it. They're all gone.

881
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I just found out because I've been finding

882
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
all these old clips of mine

883
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
to post

884
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
in preparation for the special coming

885
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
out. Comedy Central has been

886
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
gutted. There's nothing on YouTube. There's

887
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
entire TV appearances of mine that just don't

888
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
exist anymore.

889
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Adult Swim's

890
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
kind of gone. All the money

891
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
right now is

892
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
draining.

893
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Emptying buckets of content.

894
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yes. The same thing that happened

895
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
to the hardworking

896
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
industrial

897
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
manufacturing industries

898
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
in the 70s, 80s,

899
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and 90s where they would

900
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
shut down a steel company

901
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and then chop it up for assets and so forth.

902
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That's happening to every other

903
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
industry because there are people

904
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
who go to school who should be

905
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
pulled out of school and put in jail.

906
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
There's entire business departments

907
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and colleges where they teach people

908
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
the only way to make money is through cannibalism.

909
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You've got to find

910
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
an industry and chop it up for parts.

911
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
We send people to go to study

912
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
that. Where you're supposed to study

913
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Aristotle's

914
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Nicomachean Ethics.

915
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Instead, you're coming back

916
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
going like, no, no, dude, no, seriously,

917
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
no. My buddies

918
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
are like family and we're like a pack

919
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
of investors and we look for things

920
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
to fuck up.

921
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah, it's just not a good time right now. It's just weird

922
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
time, you know, so we gotta close our shot.

923
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We crunch numbers and

924
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
we're shutting it down. Crunching numbers, crunching

925
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
companies, we fucking do it.

926
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
We slam it, dawg.

927
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I went to crunch school.

928
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, no, I know it's a bummer.

929
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Now, what do we here, what do we in the lowly

930
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
pie, are we saved in the podcast

931
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
world ultimately by that

932
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
you, Mike, have all of the files

933
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
somewhere?

934
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Probably. Unless you crunch

935
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
us. You bring this up.

936
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
There's some money in it for you

937
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
later to not distribute the

938
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
files to me and Jason. I took an online

939
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Bain Capital course in my spare

940
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
time and I'm just biding my time

941
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
before I impact

942
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
vulture capitalism on this podcast.

943
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I like that

944
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
you're a smart

945
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
pod operation because you immediately go

946
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
like, oh my god, it could come from me.

947
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I was

948
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
looking at the three of you start to

949
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
hold your necks and go, wait a minute, this

950
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
guillotine thing

951
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
could come after me. I'm the bad, I'm the

952
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
what was the name of the impenitent thief?

953
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm the

954
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
guestus.

955
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Although wait, does impenitent

956
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
mean, wait, no.

957
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh, penitent means

958
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
good and impenitent is the bad one.

959
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Oh, that's right.

960
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm going to saddle the podcast with a lot of

961
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
debt. That's what I'm going to do and then we're

962
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
going to go into bankruptcy. I'm going to pocket all the

963
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
money from the bankruptcy

964
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and then you'll find out it's like all the

965
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
money that you still owe is in you and Jason's

966
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
name or something. There'll be some scam like

967
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
that that I'll pull. You're taking community college

968
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
business classes like Idris Elba

969
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and The Wire so you can

970
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
figure out how to run the operation,

971
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
you know. Yeah, search

972
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
will ruin you two actually, really.

973
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I should have known. I should have known it was you.

974
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Well, now we know. Watch

975
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
out. Anything you say here,

976
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
he's going to profit

977
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
off of. It's actually liberating to be speaking

978
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
on a podcast in progress knowing

979
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
that it's going to be wiped out from Link

980
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Rot and the podcast is

981
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
going to be chopped up for parts.

982
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's kind of freeing. If you don't put any expectation

983
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
on like, this is going to be the number one

984
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
part of my podcast reel.

985
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah, no,

986
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
it's all going to be destroyed. This episode

987
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
will never air because I'm going to write it off

988
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
like how Batgirl got wrote off at Warner

989
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Brothers. I'll just

990
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
send it to the government and say like, this is a loss

991
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
that's unreleasable. This single

992
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
episode cost 90 million dollars.

993
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
We need to collect 90 million dollars

994
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
for this and then I'll send a video

995
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
in of me deleting the file. I'm going to send it to the Warner Brothers

996
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
write off

997
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
film department. We have like actually

998
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
big, big dollars for development.

999
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Now, we're going to crush these projects

1000
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
when they come out. Right.

1001
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But we have a lot of money

1002
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
to develop and then kill your project.

1003
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's just, that's what we do.

1004
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
That's what we do.

1005
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Warner Brothers killed the long tradition

1006
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
of this at Warner Brothers. But it feels fun

1007
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
to go make a movie, right? To say action,

1008
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
put on a hat, that's what a director

1009
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
would wear. To sit in a special

1010
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
chair. You get to do all of that

1011
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
and make money. We've been overrating

1012
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the step of it where people get to see what you did.

1013
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I think

1014
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
people have not

1015
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
realized this, I think, in totality.

1016
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
When you start to get

1017
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
50 or 75

1018
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
years outside of

1019
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
the current times or even like

1020
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
recent decades, the copyrights

1021
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
will be gone.

1022
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And some of their in perpetuity clauses

1023
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
will be unenforceable.

1024
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And, you know,

1025
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
barren wasteland, notwithstanding,

1026
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
you'll have a lot of unproduced pilots

1027
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
that will finally be readable.

1028
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Or at least watchable.

1029
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
As long as you physically

1030
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
grab them. Yes.

1031
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
What I'm saying is

1032
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
wait until the

1033
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
large media companies are decaying

1034
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and then break in and

1035
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
steal the hard drives and then

1036
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
put them out on the internet

1037
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
in a hundred years. Get close to the

1038
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
brother of the guy. It was the key to all

1039
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
the hard drives.

1040
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah, yeah. That's what we've learned.

1041
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Seduce the guy.

1042
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Seduce the guy. Marry him.

1043
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
USB 3,

1044
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
USB C,

1045
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
a lot faster than

1046
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Firewire 400.

1047
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Oh, so copying the files will be quicker.

1048
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You'll be able to get more.

1049
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The tough thing will be finding

1050
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the connecting cable.

1051
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That's really the biggest

1052
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
technological roadblock.

1053
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's got to be a cheapie

1054
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
USB cable.

1055
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It can't be a nice one because then it won't

1056
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
work.

1057
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So we just need to,

1058
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
like Mad Max style,

1059
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
you've got to just wear everything you need

1060
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
on your person, kind of weird post-apocalyptic

1061
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
clothes, and just have

1062
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
all kinds of cables as your clothing.

1063
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And then it's on you. Exactly.

1064
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
A dozen USB C cables.

1065
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This came from headphones,

1066
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
this came from a hard drive.

1067
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
He scarred himself as a

1068
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
bundle of cables.

1069
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
How did he get into the building?

1070
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
He snuck around

1071
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and then when somebody was coming he just dropped

1072
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
nobody here but a pile of cables.

1073
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah, it's like a Metal Gear

1074
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
solid stealth mission.

1075
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Objective complete. You have

1076
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
acquired Coyote versus Acme.

1077
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And then you watch it and you're like,

1078
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
oh my god, it was bad.

1079
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Actually Zaz made the right call.

1080
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
He was right about this one.

1081
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He knew something we didn't because he saw it.

1082
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That's what John Cena said.

1083
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
John Cena was like, well if they didn't release it

1084
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
there must be a reason.

1085
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Did he really?

1086
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
He's a company man.

1087
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Whatever the company says, whatever China says.

1088
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
If they're a company

1089
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
he's listening to.

1090
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You're once again

1091
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
inspecting taffers.

1092
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I feel like you're getting tempted maybe.

1093
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm not going to drink this. I just noticed on the top of the

1094
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
cap that it says the number is

1095
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
003 and I'm like, I don't believe it.

1096
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I don't believe that you have special numbers for these.

1097
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't think so.

1098
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It is pretty

1099
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
exclusive though because they only sell it in three

1100
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
states. I had to bring this back from

1101
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Vegas where I should also

1102
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
say I left it in the car

1103
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and I think the bottle maybe

1104
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
3%

1105
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
exploded.

1106
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Not fully exploded.

1107
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I have consumed actually a surprising

1108
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
amount of this, like 60% of it I would say.

1109
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And again I'm not after

1110
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
a milkshake basically.

1111
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
There's no laws in Nevada you realize.

1112
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That's a good point.

1113
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Nevada is an

1114
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
experiment like what if there was

1115
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
no laws?

1116
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That's where Taffer lives.

1117
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That's his home state.

1118
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I guess you shouldn't drink anything while you're there

1119
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
just in case it's not regulated properly.

1120
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Anyway it's still there.

1121
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
If you ever want to grab it. And another thing that's on the

1122
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
table but you also don't have to grab this is

1123
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
talking about theme parks to any

1124
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
percentage but it doesn't matter at all.

1125
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You did mention some things

1126
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
that we could talk about but

1127
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
we don't have to. I realized

1128
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
it's been a sham.

1129
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
A terrible facade.

1130
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Well for theme parks, deal in facades

1131
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
you see. Sometimes you go back there and there's

1132
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
nothing back there. So I don't know if you guys are

1133
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
from what parts of the country you're from.

1134
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm from SoCal.

1135
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Mike over there is Chicago.

1136
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Schaumburg, Illinois.

1137
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And Jason's from

1138
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Philly, Jersey. Philadelphia,

1139
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
South Jersey.

1140
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So I don't know a lot of theme

1141
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
parks outside of Southern

1142
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
California except

1143
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
because I never really went, when I was in New York

1144
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I never went anywhere. Sure. There's not a lot there.

1145
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And I didn't even go, because there's

1146
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Six Flags everywhere but I just didn't go to them.

1147
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Sometimes if I have an extra day

1148
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
in some city and I see a flyer, I'm like

1149
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
maybe I will go to Six Flags

1150
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
on Sunday.

1151
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It never happens.

1152
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You're going to be...

1153
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You need someone locally in town who is like

1154
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm an adult who wants to waste time.

1155
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah, yeah. Doing it solo

1156
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
ain't great. And what I've found

1157
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
here and there is that

1158
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
from my little bit of Six Flags

1159
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
experience, you're paying for a place that's

1160
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
worse inside.

1161
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You will pay a premium to go to a worse

1162
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
place. It's an inverse country club.

1163
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
There will be more weird stains.

1164
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
The food will attract more flies.

1165
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You're making the

1166
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
right move not going, I think. The food at Disneyland

1167
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
is garbage.

1168
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
For the most, I think, some of this has

1169
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
changed here and there. There's

1170
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
exceptions to this a little bit.

1171
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
The big turkey legs?

1172
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
They taste like, you know

1173
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
how vegetation

1174
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
becomes calcified and it turns into stone?

1175
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It feels like they dipped it in salt so long

1176
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
that it's just salt.

1177
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
They do kind of taste like

1178
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
ham.

1179
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Are you sure this isn't a straightened out ham leg?

1180
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
No.

1181
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
The answer is no. I'm not sure.

1182
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
There's no way to know what that... And it's weird in pink.

1183
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
There's a bunch of theme parks

1184
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I like. We were going to talk about one thing, but

1185
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I went to...

1186
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
This is one of my favorite little memories.

1187
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm just realizing

1188
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Trevor Moore, my friend, my late

1189
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
friend Trevor Moore of The Whiteest Kids You

1190
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Know. We had a lot of fun time. We went to

1191
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Disneyland for some reason.

1192
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Just the two of us.

1193
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
He was like, you mean you went to Disneyland?

1194
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We went to Disneyland.

1195
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
We spent the day at Disneyland and we were two

1196
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
adults, like 30 year old adults.

1197
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Smartasses. We were not even

1198
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Drunk or Stoned, but we were having the blast.

1199
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
We were laughing the whole time about everything.

1200
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And one thing we remembered was

1201
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
if either of us had gone alone

1202
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
then you're weird.

1203
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Then you're like the weird creep stranger guy.

1204
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Now what I could do

1205
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
is say, oh yeah, for sure.

1206
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Or I could call two, the three of us have done this

1207
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
many times. It happens all the time.

1208
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Well, what we did, we were like

1209
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
this should be a thing for weird strangers.

1210
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Is that they get to have a stranger

1211
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
who's a buddy. Oh, there's some kind of

1212
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
a society of strangers.

1213
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And we wanted to have

1214
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
a society of strangers where you could

1215
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
be paired up with another stranger.

1216
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And you have your

1217
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
long coats. You both have long

1218
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
coats and weird gates.

1219
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But you should have each other.

1220
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And somebody's analyzing

1221
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
the walk patterns to see

1222
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
these two

1223
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
kinds of shiftiness.

1224
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
If strangers come in pairs, it's okay.

1225
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Well, you do a single rider

1226
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
sometimes and you do get paired accidentally

1227
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
with other single strangers.

1228
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Oh, sure you do because they didn't think about it.

1229
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Where they were like, well there's three

1230
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
people on this ride. Right.

1231
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah. So then you end up having

1232
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
sometimes a special little experience.

1233
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Somebody you never see again.

1234
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You end up with a stranger or you end up with

1235
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
an entire family. It's like you and five

1236
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
people from a family. Yes. You join the family.

1237
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
That's right. I've been on that

1238
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
where you get into something and there's some

1239
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
guy who's like, the lap

1240
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
belt comes down and he's like, oh boy.

1241
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I have a little bit

1242
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
too much meat. And you're in the photo

1243
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
of that family. Too much of that pork leg.

1244
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That family did the cars

1245
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
ride and now you're in the family photo

1246
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
forever with them. Right.

1247
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
There's five of them and it's like maybe that's their one

1248
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Disneyland trip of their life and you're sitting

1249
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
on their mantle forever.

1250
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Forever they're going to go, who's that guy?

1251
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That's true. We've all been that

1252
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
guy. Yeah, we might be on a lot of mantles.

1253
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
We're trapped in a number of family

1254
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
photos. We are trapped.

1255
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
We're going to be haunting those photos

1256
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
when we pass. Very often

1257
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
what's the kind of thing that's like

1258
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
a round life

1259
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
raft that you can kind of steer through the rapids?

1260
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Oh, the rapids. That's where you

1261
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
most end up in a group of strangers. Because there's like

1262
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
there'll be like

1263
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
two brothers and a cousin

1264
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and then like a

1265
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
young couple from France

1266
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
who's like a young

1267
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
sex fucking, that's

1268
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
how I describe people. They're a

1269
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
sex fucking couple. Yeah, and you all get

1270
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
very drenched. And they're trying to dunk each other

1271
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
but you outnumber them so you

1272
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
the French couple is French.

1273
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You shift the weight. You shift the weight.

1274
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And everyone laughs together.

1275
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Everyone laughs and

1276
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
one person is grumpy. Dad is grumpy

1277
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
because he didn't want to get too wet and he's

1278
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
soaked. And then not everybody gets

1279
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
equally wet on those two so you're kind

1280
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
of all like hoping the couple gets

1281
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
it because like depending on how it turns

1282
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and the angle when you hit the waterfall

1283
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
so there's a whole element of like

1284
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Russian roulette or something. You're all waiting to see

1285
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
who's

1286
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
getting the splash.

1287
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The random splash. Russian roulette.

1288
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That would be great if some gangsters

1289
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
take over the theme park.

1290
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And they're like, if you survive

1291
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
dry, you will live.

1292
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I will let you go.

1293
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It shows you were cunning enough too.

1294
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
He gets, John Wick has

1295
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
to go over the rapids

1296
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
life.

1297
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You know something about Disneyland, I

1298
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
realized, Disneyland

1299
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
you don't realize

1300
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
you guys realize it, but you don't realize

1301
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
it if you're a normal person.

1302
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
How much of it is just water?

1303
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Lots and lots of shit at Disneyland

1304
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
is water, water, water, water, water.

1305
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Or there's like, hey, go look at

1306
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
you know, go look at

1307
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Snow White feeding Bambi

1308
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
and then

1309
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
splashing the water at the end.

1310
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I noticed

1311
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
like one of the last times I went to Disneyland

1312
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
when it's late in the day.

1313
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
When it's late in the day at like 7pm

1314
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
you can look around

1315
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
in line anywhere

1316
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
and there are

1317
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
over-excited kids

1318
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
all over and then like

1319
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
soaked grandmothers.

1320
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Grandmothers who've been soaked

1321
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
several times.

1322
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And grandmoms don't get soaked

1323
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
because they're important.

1324
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
So they

1325
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
look like old cats.

1326
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
They don't know how to get soaked.

1327
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And you see them all over

1328
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Disneyland in every line you look at.

1329
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Grandmom, and they're like, they're kind

1330
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
of dazed like, uh-huh, uh-huh

1331
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
slower, slower.

1332
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Chris, come back.

1333
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Sometimes the sun is going down

1334
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and they need to dry

1335
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
off because they're going to get cold.

1336
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Right. A soaked grandmother

1337
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and she's, it's unpleasant, but

1338
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
also she's like, this is, this is

1339
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
my last time at Disneyland.

1340
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I did not live a big full life.

1341
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
If there's a cold snap, they fall out of trees

1342
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
like iguanas in Florida.

1343
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The old ladies at Pirates of the Caribbean?

1344
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It's okay, they're alive.

1345
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You just gotta get them

1346
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
a cup of tea, a hot tea.

1347
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
To revive them.

1348
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
An older lady in her 60s or 70s

1349
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
usually has like

1350
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
nice jewelry and she's dressed

1351
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
nice. And then to see

1352
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
whose idea this was to make like, make sure

1353
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
they all get wet before they leave.

1354
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And it's not clear to them

1355
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
necessarily on a ride that that's going to happen.

1356
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Right, because it's in the fine print somewhere

1357
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
where no one reads it. You're tired and whatever.

1358
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
If you're not like us where you know everything

1359
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
about every experience before you get on it.

1360
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I've been reading about this for years. I know everything.

1361
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
You just get in a vehicle.

1362
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Well, if you get in a boat, that would be a clue.

1363
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It would be a clue. Keep your eyes peeled. If you're on

1364
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
a boat, you might get wet. But it's not like us where

1365
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
we can tell you exactly what seat to sit in if you

1366
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
want to get wet or not sit in.

1367
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
They're just like, the teen

1368
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
loads grandma into the last row

1369
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
and that's the wettest row.

1370
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
She doesn't know what's coming.

1371
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
If you're ever about to get on the Jurassic World ride

1372
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
and you're wondering, like are they loading me?

1373
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Just shoot us a text. We'll try to guide you

1374
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
out of, make sure you don't get

1375
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
souped. That's the term we've used.

1376
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Every time I've been to Universal, the

1377
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Jurassic World ride is closed. I always

1378
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
go when it's closed.

1379
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And I don't like it because

1380
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
my experience of Universal is just a series

1381
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
of screens where they're shaking the seats.

1382
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Well, that's a lot.

1383
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I had a proposition

1384
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
if I was going to chop up Universal Studios

1385
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
for parts like Bain Capital

1386
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
or something. Cut out the middleman.

1387
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Don't even have people walk around

1388
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
the park. You get to Universal

1389
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and you strap into some seat and the whole

1390
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
experience is just a virtual

1391
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
walking around going place.

1392
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Even the little pet thing where they go through

1393
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
the doors, that little pet show.

1394
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Just do it on screens.

1395
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
You can save hundreds of thousands

1396
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
of dollars.

1397
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Just get lots of TVs, which is Taffer's advice.

1398
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Get lots of screens

1399
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
in place and then just either

1400
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
the chairs do the shaking or you just get

1401
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
seasonal employees, 15-year-olds

1402
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
to shake people around and it doesn't

1403
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
matter what's on the TV. If there's

1404
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
a screen in front of you and you're being

1405
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
shaken, then Universal's doing its job.

1406
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I really hated

1407
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
the Harry Potter ride because

1408
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I never watched the movies or cared about them.

1409
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And then it was

1410
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
a lot of screens

1411
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and mist and shit. And they're

1412
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
shaking the seat.

1413
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And I'm like, I don't care about any of this

1414
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
lore. And it's just

1415
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
a carsick machine.

1416
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
That isn't a nerving...

1417
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I've watched people who could do better

1418
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
coasters, like bigger, scarier coasters than me

1419
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
really lose it on Harry Potter.

1420
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
If you want to reverse it,

1421
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
the cord, I'm sorry, I should have set it up better.

1422
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Or if you want to flip your mic stand

1423
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
over so it's like, and you wrap it

1424
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
around, I don't know. I'll just play with it.

1425
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I can't hear it, so it's fine.

1426
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You were just saying

1427
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
the

1428
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
inherent nausea of the

1429
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Harry Potter. Yes, okay, so

1430
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
right, the harder rides,

1431
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
those are cool. What is your speed?

1432
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
If you are going to go to the...

1433
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
What have you liked over the years?

1434
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The best ride is like, is it Colossus?

1435
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That style.

1436
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You mentioned wooden roller coasters.

1437
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Old school wooden roller coasters

1438
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
that are psychological thrill rides

1439
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
where it's based on not

1440
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
how many times can we whip you around

1441
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
in this limited footprint

1442
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
in my opinion.

1443
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Like, we've invented a new way

1444
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
to go backwards and upside down.

1445
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And residents

1446
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
of Minnesota aren't allowed

1447
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
to ride this, even though it's in California.

1448
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Your state government,

1449
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
your attorney general has prevented

1450
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Minnesota citizens from riding on this ride.

1451
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
They don't have what it takes.

1452
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But I love

1453
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
an old fashioned wooden roller coaster

1454
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
where it's like anticipation based.

1455
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Okay, oh this is interesting because

1456
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
we talk a lot about, Mike likes launch

1457
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
coasters where they shoot you out in a matter of

1458
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
two seconds because there is none of the anticipation.

1459
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
You prefer...

1460
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I have not done it actually.

1461
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I think it's that way.

1462
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That's a fast one though, yeah.

1463
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It's the one that zips you up.

1464
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It knots?

1465
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I think they were just

1466
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
redoing that one, so I don't know what it is.

1467
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I've done hang time, I've done

1468
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
we did Ghost Rider, that's old wooden coasters.

1469
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Ghost Rider is really in that.

1470
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Which park is that in?

1471
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It overlooks the parking lot.

1472
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
They all do.

1473
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
They didn't need so much parking.

1474
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
They had no idea they would need it.

1475
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Now any

1476
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
experience you're on, you're

1477
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
in Scrooge McDuck's money bin ride or

1478
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
whatever, guess what? You're going to be looking down

1479
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
at a parking lot.

1480
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Breaks the fourth wall.

1481
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Knots is

1482
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
unique in

1483
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
that way of like, oh you can park

1484
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
half a block away from the gate.

1485
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You can see the gate from

1486
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
your parking spot.

1487
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Also, Knots, Knots

1488
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
is, okay

1489
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Disneyland is

1490
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
on brand.

1491
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Everything's clean, white gloves, and

1492
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
you're supposed to do it a certain way, and there's

1493
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
an underside, but it is an underside because

1494
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
there's a message.

1495
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Six Flags is like, we don't clean up.

1496
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Six Flags is like, there's

1497
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
gum in the carpets, it's like a W

1498
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
hotel. And that's especially

1499
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Magic Mountain. Magic Mountain

1500
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
and Six Flags here in LA, they're like,

1501
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
it's a little bit less expensive

1502
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
than Disneyland and it shows.

1503
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And Knots Berry Farm is like,

1504
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
we don't have Mickey Mouse

1505
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
or Bugs Bunny. We've got Snoopy.

1506
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Nobody cares

1507
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
about Snoopy. So here's

1508
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
the deal with Knots Berry

1509
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Farm. You will have,

1510
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
there's cats, there's feral cats,

1511
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and we will not get rid of them.

1512
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
There's just cats welcome at Knots Berry Farm.

1513
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Well, Disneyland has those too.

1514
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
They help with

1515
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
vermin. And they are

1516
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
also vermin.

1517
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
In some sense.

1518
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I don't know how, I've not seen a lot

1519
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
in Disneyland, but they have a lot in

1520
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Knots Berry Farm that just come out at 6

1521
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
p.m. Also,

1522
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Knots Berry Farm has a bunch of

1523
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
shit that's not rides.

1524
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
They have all this gold mining bullshit.

1525
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Old West,

1526
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
where it's like, come

1527
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
shine your boots

1528
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
down in old tanks, boots shining

1529
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
barn. And they have all this

1530
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
old time California

1531
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
fantasy nonsense.

1532
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It was only that when it opened. I know.

1533
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
That's how it started. Rides were an afterthought.

1534
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
You don't like the little

1535
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
dioramas of the famous

1536
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
missions of California.

1537
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's interesting that it's

1538
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
there at all. And then they have this propaganda

1539
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
up on the walls, and I don't mean that

1540
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
disparaging necessarily, but they

1541
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
have, I'm used to like Disney propaganda

1542
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
where you're like,

1543
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
California adventure

1544
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
reimagines

1545
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
the early days of Walt Disney and

1546
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Los Feliz. And I get it.

1547
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It's your lore.

1548
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
It's your propaganda. But at Knots Berry Farm

1549
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
they're like,

1550
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
this was a conservative theme park.

1551
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And young Republicans

1552
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
used to come here in the 80s.

1553
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Wally George fans would get drunk

1554
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
after a taping,

1555
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and come down to

1556
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Knots Berry Farm and get drunk on

1557
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
poison berry.

1558
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Take their anger out on small depictions

1559
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
of Snoopy and Sally. You can see it on the walls.

1560
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
They're even just like, it was very popular

1561
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
with conservative Republicans up until

1562
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
the 90s. There was a Freedom Center

1563
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
there. It was called the Freedom Center, am I correct?

1564
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Yeah, about free enterprise. You can't just say

1565
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
there was a Freedom Center and not explain

1566
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
what that means. I think it's very self-explanatory.

1567
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
There was a Freedom Center, James?

1568
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Where do you imagine a Freedom Center would be?

1569
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You would learn from Walter Knots.

1570
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
There was a video playing, or whatever,

1571
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
talking about...

1572
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Here's my 13 points about American freedom.

1573
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah.

1574
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
It's not for everybody.

1575
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I don't think the Bill of Rights, one of those old California

1576
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
farmer guys, here's my

1577
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
libertarian ideas about

1578
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
how things should be run in California.

1579
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Camp Snoopy kicked out

1580
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
the John Burt Society club house.

1581
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Yes! You think?

1582
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
That is so funny.

1583
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
You think Snoopy is like a third-rate

1584
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
theme park character? No, no, no, no.

1585
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Woodstock fucking

1586
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
bounced the John Burt Society

1587
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and lost very far.

1588
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Revolution, yeah. And Wally George,

1589
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
hey Snoopy, I think you suck.

1590
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Get off my show!

1591
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Hey, my

1592
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
next guest here is a real loser.

1593
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
He's a real dumb, dumb

1594
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Charlie Brown. Eww.

1595
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Watch this guy trying to kick a football. Watch.

1596
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Just watch him.

1597
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Oh yeah, you're a real...

1598
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Hey, shh. Hey, you're a real dumb head

1599
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
in my opinion. Get out of here!

1600
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You do have

1601
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
a, it's like, it's the only place

1602
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I can think of where you can, where there is a

1603
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
depiction, a full replica

1604
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
of the, of Independence

1605
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Hall right next to a water park.

1606
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
These things are, and

1607
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
on your way to both

1608
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
a bunch of ducks and geese.

1609
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
It's a strange little ecosystem

1610
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
over there. None of it makes any sense.

1611
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Is that water park, cause James, you had

1612
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
mentioned a number of Southern California water parks.

1613
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Well that was originally, we were going to talk about the

1614
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
water parks in SoCal, I don't know.

1615
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Is that still going,

1616
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
the water park by Knott's

1617
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
is still there? Yeah.

1618
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Is it Knott's Soak City?

1619
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It is Knott's Soak City.

1620
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Well, there's a lot of

1621
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
water runoff in the

1622
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
process of making

1623
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
boysenberry, so you gotta put it somewhere.

1624
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It's really a functional thing.

1625
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Yeah, the slides started as pipes

1626
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
that was to route them elsewhere.

1627
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
City of Lena Park doesn't allow you to jam raw

1628
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
boysenberry down at the sewers, so we made a park.

1629
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
We thought

1630
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
it'd be better, make the sewers smell nicer, right?

1631
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Here's a little fun fact.

1632
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Boysenberry jam

1633
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
and jelly is great. It's delicious.

1634
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Yes. And

1635
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
of course, another Bain Capital thing,

1636
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Smucker's bought

1637
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Knott's Berry. Correct.

1638
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And they discontinued the boysenberry flavor.

1639
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Really? The assholes. Yes!

1640
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
What? Someone should put

1641
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
you can't, I can't say it on a microphone.

1642
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Someone should fucking

1643
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
someone should kidnap the guy's kids

1644
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
who made that decision.

1645
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I think it's okay to say as long as you're not saying the name

1646
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and none of us know the name, so I think you're fine.

1647
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
The guy who's

1648
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
in charge of mergers and acquisitions

1649
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
at Smucker's, who's going like

1650
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I have a certain set of skills

1651
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and they involve

1652
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
preserves and jams

1653
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
of various kinds.

1654
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Turning off jam

1655
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
pipes.

1656
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I'll choke you to death with pectin sauce

1657
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
if I don't see my daughter.

1658
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Well, that's

1659
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
a shame. I feel like you're getting boysenberry

1660
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
bullshit somehow there. It's one of the

1661
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
reasons to go. You gotta go. I think they still have

1662
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
the pies with the boysenberries in the

1663
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
pies. Oh, they do.

1664
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Smucker's doesn't

1665
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
sell the jars of it. Jason checks every three

1666
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
months. You make sure they are. Are there

1667
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
specific? There's a private label.

1668
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Knott's has their own private label

1669
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
of jam. So you can go down there and get it.

1670
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So you can go down there and get it.

1671
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
We sold it, but hey, we're gonna

1672
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
redo it

1673
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
under a slightly different name.

1674
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I think I got

1675
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
one of those when I was down

1676
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
there, but I didn't open it, so

1677
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
now it's probably too late.

1678
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
It's a decorative jam jar at this point.

1679
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It looks cool.

1680
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm starting to decorate

1681
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
my kitchen to look like a Knott's Berry farm

1682
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
with like a

1683
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
dappled apron on the table.

1684
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You want that crosshatch pattern?

1685
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
That tablecloth plaid?

1686
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That's a tablecloth plaid, but it's purple

1687
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
and white. Your aesthetic is like

1688
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
what Cordelia Knott,

1689
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Walter's wife, wanted

1690
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
for her restaurant. Cordelia Knott?

1691
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Here's my

1692
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
thirteen points about what a loyal

1693
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
wife should do for a man.

1694
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You can tell from the setup

1695
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
exactly how wrong the thirteen points

1696
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
are gonna be.

1697
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It's the title itself.

1698
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
There was an old building in Knott's called

1699
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
the Wife Center where you would learn about

1700
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
being a good wife.

1701
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You can be processed by the time you come out of this

1702
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
room. We separate the boys from the girls.

1703
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Boys can't be wives. You're out of here.

1704
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You're not allowed in. That's step one.

1705
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
These are hungry boys. They're growing, you see.

1706
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I wrote a number

1707
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
of letters to the editor about this

1708
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
in the Orange County Register.

1709
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
He was buddies with

1710
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
John Wayne. That was the thing we found

1711
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
that when they opened the log ride

1712
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
there, there was an inaugural ride

1713
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
with John Wayne, the king of the O.C.

1714
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Did he invent the log ride there?

1715
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It was before Disney did it. I don't know if it was

1716
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
fully- First in California, maybe?

1717
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I think it was the first to be at least

1718
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
kind of themed and kind of rustic

1719
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
and have the log concept.

1720
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
There were probably weird guys

1721
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
in the old days that were like

1722
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
let's ride a log down a river.

1723
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
For real.

1724
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
That's from the centuries

1725
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
ago. To make it plastic and

1726
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
float in a bunch of chlorine.

1727
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And not kill you. Yes.

1728
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
If he didn't invent it,

1729
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
he'd perfect it. And to see a lot of

1730
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
sad, scary, broken men

1731
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
along the way. That's what we love about

1732
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
the old- the knots rides with all the

1733
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
animatronics with the

1734
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
faces who have seen a lot.

1735
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
The desperate migrant workers. Yeah.

1736
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And broken men.

1737
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I don't know what they're trying to tell us.

1738
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I found gold!

1739
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
You realize that there's nothing

1740
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
romantic about a life like

1741
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
chasing the remote chance

1742
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
that you might find

1743
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
a valuable metal in the dirt.

1744
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Yeah. Oh yeah.

1745
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
That's your only hope.

1746
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
You have the worst life. You have an awful

1747
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
life. You're covered in soot and you breathe

1748
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
more soot. But maybe, just maybe,

1749
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
if I find a pebble down here.

1750
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
They give you the little-

1751
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
you do the little- there's like

1752
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
there's gold in the water. Everybody gets a

1753
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
little bit of gold when you pan for it there.

1754
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah. And I

1755
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
will say, I mean, I still have

1756
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
it from when I was like eight or nine

1757
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
or ten years old, you know. Really? Yep.

1758
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I've still got like a little

1759
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
cedar chest of

1760
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
bullshit from my childhood.

1761
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Including an amethyst with Google eyes.

1762
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
That I think we got in Big Bear.

1763
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And a whole bunch of stuff from Knott's Berry Farm.

1764
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
What do you

1765
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
keep from Disneyland?

1766
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
What lasts over the course of 30 years?

1767
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Disney dollars.

1768
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Oh wow. Do you think you have any of those?

1769
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I do.

1770
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I don't have them in good condition and I found out

1771
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
they're worth actual money.

1772
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
They've appreciated in value. Like the promise

1773
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
of Transformers didn't work out.

1774
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
The Transformers, like of course

1775
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
you played with them. What about-

1776
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
The Transformers didn't pay off.

1777
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Disney dollars did.

1778
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I guess so. Especially if you've got a

1779
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
fucking Donald Duck

1780
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
two Disney dollar note.

1781
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Yeah. You can go to conventions

1782
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
and people have binders

1783
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
full of them. And you can just like

1784
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
oh yeah, that one

1785
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
dollar Jack Sparrow

1786
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
bill.

1787
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
That was one of the ones we saw that was like

1788
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
limited. They only produced so many

1789
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Jack Sparrow dollars.

1790
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That was the last run in the early

1791
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
2000s. I want- I always like

1792
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
the gay villains because I have an old

1793
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
stand up bit about that from 12

1794
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
years ago. So

1795
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I collect Ursula

1796
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
and Captain Hook things. Oh really?

1797
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Wow. Wow. I guess that'd be a question.

1798
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Not a lot. Can't handle a lot. I only

1799
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
live in an apartment.

1800
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Yeah. Well yeah. Square footage.

1801
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Then it becomes- if you have to devote a room to it.

1802
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I did. I had to get rid of some

1803
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
stuff. I was like oh no. There was

1804
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
a pandemic time and I was like just

1805
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
buy things. Oh yeah.

1806
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
They were delivered. Oh yeah.

1807
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I didn't realize they would come.

1808
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Wait, who do you

1809
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
count as a gay villain?

1810
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Who do you bring over? Well, okay.

1811
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
So in Disney it's definitely like

1812
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Ursula.

1813
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Ursula's divine, right?

1814
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Divine, yes.

1815
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Inspired. Divine inspired

1816
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
or lesbian bartender.

1817
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And then Captain Hook or

1818
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
the gummy bears, it's Duke

1819
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Eggthorn which is the same character

1820
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
basically. Oh that's true.

1821
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Captain Hook I mean, come on

1822
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Peter.

1823
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Oh I didn't realize how Hollywood squares.

1824
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Yes, he certainly is

1825
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Peter Pan and also

1826
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
can bring me those gummy bears.

1827
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I'm going to squeeze them for their juices.

1828
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Every last drop. Get it all over me.

1829
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Yes, this is

1830
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
of course all the Decepticons

1831
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
in Transformers.

1832
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
We're leaving Disney now but every single

1833
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Decepticon in different kinds

1834
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
of gay villains.

1835
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Megatron, shut up

1836
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Starscream.

1837
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And then there's like the quieter like butch bartender

1838
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
who's like Megatron, sound wave

1839
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Megatron.

1840
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Okay, this is all available on my

1841
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
2012

1842
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
stand-up album

1843
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Low Hanging Fruit which is also on 800

1844
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Pound Gorilla which is where my special is

1845
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
out. Great, great, great. Okay, okay.

1846
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And this is a one-stop shop. And I recorded both

1847
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
of these things in the Year of the Dragon

1848
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
or released them.

1849
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Oh, these are, oh wow, in subsequent

1850
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
2012 was

1851
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
2012 was Low Hanging Fruit

1852
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
and then 2024 is

1853
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Path of Most Resistance. Wow.

1854
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So then you'll be back, you're not doing, and you won't do

1855
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
another one until the next Year of the Dragon. I'm like a

1856
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
very predictable

1857
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
comment.

1858
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Very predictable comment.

1859
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
But then the scarcity like with Disney Dollars

1860
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
is what you. Oh yeah. Yeah, it makes it more valuable.

1861
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I'm a little appreciated in value if you

1862
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
keep me in a nice cedar trunk.

1863
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Buy a copy, buy a digital copy

1864
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
of the special, keep it in a cedar

1865
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
trunk. Right. Watch what happens.

1866
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Here's, let me bring this one up because when you were

1867
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
throwing out theme park stuff you have experience

1868
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
with, the one you mentioned that we have not ever talked about

1869
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
is Wild Rivers because

1870
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
uh,

1871
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Whittier you spent time in?

1872
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I went to Whittier College, I went to

1873
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
High School in the Valley, I went to Junior

1874
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
High School in Westchester

1875
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
in Santa Monica. Oh, gotcha. Okay, okay.

1876
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
So I know I'm all over that stuff.

1877
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
There was raging, when I was a kid there was raging

1878
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
waters and Wild Rivers. Okay, yeah.

1879
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And that was, that was like the

1880
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
great rivalry. Oh sure. Where did

1881
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
you fall on that? We went to both.

1882
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And I think our family thought that

1883
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Wild Rivers was better but it was a narrow.

1884
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I don't remember. Nothing was like so

1885
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
superior. Right. It was basically

1886
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
the same thing. Right. Raging waters

1887
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
is in San Dimas and I believe Wild Rivers

1888
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
was in OC somewhere.

1889
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Irvine. It was in Irvine. Irvine in the

1890
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
same neck of the woods as

1891
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
the amphitheater there

1892
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
which is Verizon Wireless at one point

1893
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
and Irvine Meadows at one point

1894
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and now I think it's all just becoming

1895
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
apartments. It's gone. No, it's moved.

1896
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
There is a new, Wild

1897
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Rivers shut down a long time ago but there's a new Wild

1898
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Rivers elsewhere. Yes. In something called

1899
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Great Park in Irvine which is always

1900
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I've been to and it's completely... Is it affiliated or

1901
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
like we got the name? Is it a

1902
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Bain Capital estate?

1903
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It is, it did

1904
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
reading the history of it

1905
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
it is a little

1906
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
succession in terms of

1907
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
like well then the lease was for

1908
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
30 years but they only used 13

1909
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
of it so then they were

1910
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
selling this off and they were going to rebuild

1911
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
it on top of the

1912
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
land that was an old

1913
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I think marine base?

1914
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Great.

1915
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I'll exclude an ordinance.

1916
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I assure you, you mentioned

1917
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Boisenberry contaminating

1918
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
groundwater, something else

1919
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
contaminated the groundwater

1920
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
west of this so

1921
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
they did not end up building

1922
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
it on that land. So don't go

1923
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
on any rides that splash you into

1924
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
the groundwater. It is not on the

1925
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
groundwater. Groundwater rapids.

1926
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
They say it has been

1927
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
cleaned up. Luckily their new

1928
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
location is right between San Onofre

1929
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and Camp Pendleton.

1930
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
So

1931
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
there's things about these theme parks

1932
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
that are like the same where there's always

1933
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
a lazy river.

1934
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Some big tower

1935
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
where the big one is.

1936
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Now I think

1937
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Raging Waters is gone too, right?

1938
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
No, Raging Waters is still there.

1939
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
No, but they also have

1940
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
the Six Flags

1941
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
has Hurricane Harbor

1942
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and does Disneyland

1943
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
have one? Not here.

1944
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
So

1945
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
the most recent one I went to

1946
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
was Hurricane Harbor

1947
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
maybe five years ago with

1948
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
my friend. Again, an adult

1949
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
friend where we were just like, let's go.

1950
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
You need that.

1951
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It was the end of the summer. It was after Labor Day.

1952
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It was like this time of year.

1953
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
They still had

1954
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
their five day a week hours

1955
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
but that was the last week that they

1956
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
had the five day a week hours.

1957
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And then they switched to weekends only

1958
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and then they closed I think.

1959
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
So we caught

1960
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
the tail end and they were

1961
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
the lifeguard was just like

1962
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
lifeguard's 18

1963
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
because they're like, that's the one rule

1964
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
the lifeguards have to be 18.

1965
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Lifeguard that had no interest

1966
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
at all. Just watching

1967
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
everything happen like yep

1968
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
okay you know drown whatever

1969
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and I just have to be sitting

1970
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
here. Everything was kind of sloppy

1971
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and rickety at the end of the summer at

1972
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Hurricane Harbor.

1973
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I bet it's not so great at the top of the summer

1974
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
either. We decided

1975
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
not we were both went up the stupid tower

1976
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
where there's like three options of

1977
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
elite manhood and they were

1978
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
like is it the there's like a

1979
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
black diamond it's like a ski slope. Black

1980
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
snake stomach. Is that what it is?

1981
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Yes black snake stomach.

1982
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And there's a scary one at the top we didn't do

1983
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
where it's like Cobra Assassin.

1984
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And they're like if you get stranded up there if you

1985
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
can't go down the slide you gotta be rescued

1986
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
with a helicopter. There's no way

1987
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
down. We have to dislodge

1988
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
the roof. There's a deconstruct the entire

1989
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
tower. And a rope ladder.

1990
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
It was it was rough.

1991
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It wasn't scary so much

1992
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
as I went down and I've done water slides

1993
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
since I was a child. You cross your arms

1994
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
over your thing you go you follow whatever the specific

1995
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
rules are where they're like this one

1996
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
you make sure you go down ass up.

1997
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Whatever it is.

1998
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Whatever it is you do the thing

1999
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
and so I did it and it was rough.

2000
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And it was like

2001
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
it was it was sure you're

2002
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
sloshing and you're like kind of almost slosh

2003
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
up out of the thing going down or

2004
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
whatever where you're in you're in

2005
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
uncontained water at

2006
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
some point. It's just you and a

2007
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
water stream going down.

2008
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
But then also the plastic

2009
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
things were rough. The panels were

2010
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
not fit together right. They don't line

2011
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
up. That's the worst thing. And I'm

2012
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
almost naked and it was like

2013
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
On your skin it's slicing

2014
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
your skin every

2015
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And then like

2016
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
it was like

2017
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
and then crash bump

2018
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
and then down into the final

2019
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
fucking splooge

2020
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
area. What do you call that?

2021
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
That's the term.

2022
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
It's the splooge down. It's the final splooge down.

2023
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
You get down into the

2024
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
final eject zone

2025
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
and

2026
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
it broke the skin.

2027
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It drew blood.

2028
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Did it really? Yes.

2029
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And I didn't do anything wrong. I was just

2030
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
sliding down the slide. And it was

2031
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
enough. It was enough like difference in

2032
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
the panels of the plastic. It drew

2033
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
blood and it hurt and not badly

2034
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
but I was like ow. Where on your body?

2035
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Like my

2036
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
people are going to love this.

2037
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Sure. It was like

2038
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
it hurt

2039
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
my ass and back and ribs.

2040
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And I think the blood was

2041
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
on the side of my torsos.

2042
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I have two torsos

2043
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
by the way.

2044
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Both look great. Both in great shape.

2045
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
So you ended up with a bloody ass?

2046
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Sure. Why not?

2047
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It's not the first time that's happened.

2048
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
But then the problem

2049
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
is the guy, the lifeguard

2050
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
down at the fucking splash

2051
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
splooge, he was like

2052
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
get out.

2053
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And it

2054
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
was just normal. And he could tell

2055
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
that me and my friend one after another

2056
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
came down and were like ow.

2057
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And then like a couple minutes later

2058
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
ow. And he was

2059
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
just like routinely like yep get up

2060
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
get out next one. And then we were like

2061
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
clambered out with difficulty.

2062
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And then he's like

2063
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
we're ready for the next one.

2064
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
You know looking up to the top or whatever

2065
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
with the signals. Unfazed.

2066
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Every person screams.

2067
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And it wasn't like pouring

2068
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
blood but you know the kind of scrape

2069
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
it was like a bleeding scrape.

2070
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
And I realized like

2071
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
oh yes I was bitten by the black snake.

2072
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
There were fangs

2073
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
every eight feet.

2074
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Well we built them into the plastic.

2075
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
We put snake

2076
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
in the title. You weren't expecting

2077
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
fangs.

2078
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
They're like look.

2079
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Hurricane Harbor's got to pay it off.

2080
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Okay here's two facts that I learned

2081
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
about that involve

2082
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
the lifeguards at these

2083
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
places. One is from Soak

2084
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
City. And apparently it's

2085
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Soak City. There is a

2086
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I found this from people saying like I really like the music

2087
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
that they play there. I think does anyone

2088
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
know where the mix comes from? It's kind of nice.

2089
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
They use Pandora raid. What is it?

2090
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
But the weird thing is that

2091
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
what I find weird about the mix

2092
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
is that between every song there's

2093
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
a big chime. What's that about?

2094
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And other people have answered that that is

2095
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
for the lifeguards to remind them to

2096
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
stay alert.

2097
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
So

2098
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
not Soak City has to have

2099
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
a ding that is

2100
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
meant to like reawaken all

2101
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
of the teenagers. Remember

2102
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
do your job. Because otherwise you just

2103
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
get lost and like yeah oh yeah

2104
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
come over.

2105
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
They're playing gotta get up or whatever

2106
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
you get relaxed.

2107
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
You get so chill.

2108
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I picked something that's like 20 years older than me.

2109
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Mine was old too.

2110
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I can't think of a modern relaxing song.

2111
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Look the chime like that's

2112
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
one of Walter Knott's you know

2113
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
principles like you gotta keep them

2114
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
alert. Teen alertness chimes.

2115
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Teen alertness you know.

2116
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Just like a theme park needs a

2117
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
chime to keep the correctly

2118
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
paid laborers

2119
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
alert at their

2120
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
jobs. And you end up with under the

2121
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
table hand jobs. A proper republic

2122
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
and it is not a democracy it is

2123
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
a republic also

2124
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
requires a series of chimes

2125
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
to alert those who would

2126
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
depart from the vision of the founding

2127
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
father. When Nixon is

2128
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
elected I will propose

2129
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
a loud alarms throughout

2130
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
this great nation every

2131
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
just to remind people to be

2132
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
American. My fashion style

2133
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
was crafted

2134
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
by

2135
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Barry Goldwater.

2136
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It's primarily

2137
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
bow tie based.

2138
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
The stiffest suits you've ever seen.

2139
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
You can't bend these at the legs.

2140
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
If you

2141
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
sit you can you get lazy.

2142
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Stay alert Stan. Something about those

2143
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
guys that always have white

2144
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
hair and very thick

2145
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
black glasses.

2146
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
You know the black rimmed glasses.

2147
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And they all kind of look like

2148
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
the same guy when they are over

2149
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
60.

2150
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I am just the generic California

2151
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
old conservative.

2152
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I believe in limited and they believe the

2153
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
same things and they would write the same when I was

2154
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
a kid. You'd read the same letters to the editor by the same guy.

2155
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And it was always

2156
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
the same every

2157
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
iteration of every issue of any

2158
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
newspaper in California used to have the

2159
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Reagan guy letter that someone would

2160
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
write about something. And it was always

2161
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
like your article of last

2162
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
week is typical

2163
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
liberal propaganda.

2164
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And as we need

2165
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
be reminded as the great

2166
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
President Ronald Reagan said

2167
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
government is

2168
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
not the solution.

2169
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Government is the problem.

2170
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Signed yours

2171
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Robert W.

2172
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Walker

2173
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Pasadena, California

2174
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
written while wearing a bow tie.

2175
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Then you look him up

2176
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
and realize he owns the entire

2177
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
city that I went to college. He owns

2178
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
90 acres.

2179
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Just collecting rent and writing letters to the editor

2180
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
all day. He owns the 405.

2181
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
He owns all of us.

2182
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
The problem with the 405

2183
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
is it is too egalitarian.

2184
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
A toll road would have survived.

2185
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
We propose permanent lanes that you stay in

2186
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
for your entire life.

2187
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Giving people permission to switch.

2188
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It's willy nilly.

2189
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
You should pay a dollar to switch lanes.

2190
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
They can switch but that

2191
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
costs money. Throw a dollar at it on the highway

2192
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
and serve you as an elector who will pick it up

2193
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
at the end of the night.

2194
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I have a design from my theme park

2195
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
that might be useful to people.

2196
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Mass Transit was a series of slides.

2197
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
The other thing

2198
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I want to say about, this is back to Hurricane

2199
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Harbor. I read a

2200
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
review. I was going through one star reviews.

2201
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Always a good thing to do. And then there are

2202
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
many. And there was one that said, well there

2203
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
were a lot that said that half the rides were closed.

2204
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
One star ass sliced.

2205
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
This particular one says

2206
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
half the rides were closed. The reason for this

2207
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
was a shortage of lifeguards

2208
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
due to graduation day.

2209
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So this is

2210
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
something that can happen to you. If you go in May

2211
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
to a water park, what you might find

2212
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
is that a lot of the lifeguards

2213
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
can't be there because they are graduating

2214
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
high school. This was on the Yelp

2215
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
for up in Santa

2216
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Clarita, the Magic Mountain too.

2217
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
For Magic Mountain in general. In general it was like

2218
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
why is everything closed? And someone was like

2219
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I think school is back in session so half

2220
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
the workforce is gone. Holy shit.

2221
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Like it just completely, you have to shut down

2222
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
a lot of things. Which then, with the graduation

2223
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
thing specifically, that leaves you now with

2224
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
either the employees are

2225
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
too young to have graduated

2226
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
or perhaps

2227
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
did not graduate for

2228
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
They're doing an extra year. Yes, yes.

2229
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
We might be dealing with, if you're seeing employees

2230
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
these lifeguards might be people

2231
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
who are being held back. Well yeah

2232
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
they're CPR certified.

2233
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
You know, they did the full training.

2234
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
But they are also super

2235
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
seniors. So

2236
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
really they should get a pay bone.

2237
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
For all the experience. They're more educated

2238
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
in a way than someone who did senior year

2239
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
just once. Yeah.

2240
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
They have read a couple of

2241
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
chapters of The Great Gatsby.

2242
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
That's

2243
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
what I've read.

2244
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
It was all just

2245
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
an elaborate series of faking it.

2246
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I've been meaning to actually read it but I

2247
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
have not.

2248
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
That's interesting about

2249
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
the times of year because I know there are

2250
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
and you guys of course know this.

2251
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I had a friend who was very into theme parks who

2252
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
knew this. He was a roller coaster buff.

2253
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Shout out to Bill

2254
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Lynn if he happens to hear this.

2255
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
My friend from the old days at the Groundlings.

2256
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
But I know

2257
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
okay so there's certain times

2258
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
when you're supposed to go that you have to navigate.

2259
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
There's not going to be a big crowd but they might be doing

2260
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
maintenance I guess. Yeah I guess so.

2261
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And I feel like

2262
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I feel like when it's back

2263
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
just back in school from a vacation

2264
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
is a good time.

2265
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Because everything's been picked. Everything's

2266
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
in shape. So now

2267
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
in September or right after

2268
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Easter or something.

2269
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
But maybe I don't know about January though.

2270
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Certainly not for water parks. There's a way you can ride

2271
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
it. There's definitely a time where Disneyland's

2272
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
a little cheaper and a little less crowded.

2273
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
If you can nail right before

2274
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
some schools are back but not all.

2275
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
This is a thing that now that I

2276
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
have a child who is in school

2277
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I can't believe it. Now we are like

2278
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
stuck in the school confines unless we

2279
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
dare pull him out of school

2280
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
in order to go to theme parks

2281
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
with less attendance. Are you allowed to do

2282
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
that as a parent? Are there like you I know you can

2283
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
have sick days or emergency days but can you

2284
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
be like you know what this is a fuck it day.

2285
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And I dare everybody down at

2286
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
the Pasadena.

2287
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
It's just one of Wolters Don's 13 principles.

2288
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I went to Disney World

2289
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
in like eighth or ninth grade

2290
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
in like middle of May.

2291
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
But did your parents lie to

2292
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
the school about what you were doing?

2293
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
No, I think I just had to write like

2294
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
a 500 word essay

2295
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
of what I did on my trip.

2296
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Really? They just didn't care?

2297
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You just had to do a report and you could do whatever?

2298
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
What kind of laissez faire school is

2299
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
you go to? I read all of

2300
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I read Dracula

2301
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
the novel and

2302
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I to you know

2303
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
get ahead because by the time you get back

2304
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
we'll have read this. And I read

2305
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
it and got back and they're like

2306
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
we didn't get Dracula.

2307
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
You read Dracula for nothing.

2308
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
It wasn't particularly

2309
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I mean it was a fine vacation read.

2310
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Like I was old enough to

2311
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
13 or 14. You're in Disney

2312
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
World cramming in Dracula between

2313
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
every bit of free time. Before I go to

2314
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
bed or on the airplanes.

2315
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Did you dare

2316
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
read while. No I was not.

2317
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
And it was one of the ones where it's like

2318
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
we only have so many copies of the book

2319
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
here's a photocopied

2320
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
pamphlet of the book.

2321
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
He's got a loose leaf.

2322
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Yeah it got loose. Yeah it got

2323
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
paper. That never happened. You never had to buy

2324
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
like in college. You never had to buy a bunch

2325
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
of articles like for five bucks

2326
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
photocopied. Why a bunch

2327
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
of articles? This seems unofficial like you ran

2328
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
into a guy in the alley. Yeah I got

2329
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
textbooks. Come here I got textbooks. It very much

2330
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
was that. Is Dracula

2331
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
the only public domain

2332
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
intellectual

2333
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
property that didn't make it into

2334
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Disneyland or into Disney as like

2335
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
a main property. It's kind of

2336
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
a universal because universal is

2337
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
associated with the classic monsters

2338
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
from their old moon. They've done more with

2339
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Frankenstein, Dracula, etc.

2340
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But yeah you're in Disney could.

2341
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
They could just probably. Dracula does

2342
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
exist in the Marvel Universe.

2343
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Oh that's the way in. I think there was

2344
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
a big they were just

2345
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
finishing in the Marvel comics. A big

2346
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
vampire crossover. Robert

2347
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Danny Jr.'s next part.

2348
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
He's going to be Dracula. I'm not going to be. Don't make

2349
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
me be Doom again. I've done so

2350
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
once he's done 20 movies as Doom.

2351
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
He'll be 80 and he'll do Dracula.

2352
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
In the 70s they had

2353
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
the Godzilla license.

2354
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
So the Avengers and Nick Fury

2355
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
were Marvel? Like Godzilla. Yeah.

2356
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
There's like a phone book size collection

2357
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
or two.

2358
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Bum bum bum bum.

2359
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Right.

2360
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
This poses an interesting problem.

2361
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Let me throw one thing out

2362
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
is maybe on the way out the door

2363
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
here is that because we

2364
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
when you mentioned Wild Rivers that

2365
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
sent me down. Well here one

2366
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
thing first. I want to get everybody's thoughts

2367
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
especially Jason's thoughts on something they

2368
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
apparently sold at Wild Rivers. But you

2369
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
as the treat boy of the show. What do

2370
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
you think of the apparently exclusive

2371
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Wild Rivers snack.

2372
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
The funnel dog.

2373
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
A corn dog

2374
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
seemingly made with funnel cake

2375
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
batter as the

2376
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
batter. I don't. I'm into that.

2377
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I don't think

2378
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
corn dog batter and funnel cake

2379
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
batter is that different.

2380
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And I think if

2381
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
you have a salty enough

2382
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
or spicy enough

2383
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
dog in the middle it would

2384
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
you know compliment like a

2385
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
sweet corn dog. My memory

2386
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
of waterpark food. I specifically

2387
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
have one of course

2388
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
at Blizzard Beach at Disney

2389
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
World. We were

2390
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
there and we you know did

2391
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
the did the sides

2392
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and the we have fries and everything

2393
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
it was time for lunch. And

2394
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
like the main lunch counter

2395
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
they're like what is

2396
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
their main their main thing was like

2397
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
meatball subs

2398
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
and I love a meatball sub. So I was

2399
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
pretty excited. But I also

2400
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
like as soon as I started

2401
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
eating it I'm like this is

2402
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
a dangerous food to eat without

2403
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
a shirt on.

2404
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
So what

2405
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
what happened? Covered in marinara sauce

2406
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
shirtless? Yeah because marinara

2407
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
drips out the back. A meat if you're not

2408
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
careful a meatball is going to fall right out

2409
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
the back. Did that happen? And if it's hot

2410
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
it's going to well I think I dodged one.

2411
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I think I caught it with the plate. Whoa!

2412
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Oh shit! You like you took a bite

2413
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
and the bread you squeezed the bread at the wrong

2414
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
angle and then squirted a

2415
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
bullet speed

2416
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
meatball in your on to your

2417
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
bare chest. Oh yeah meatballs could go in any

2418
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
direction either side of the sandwich.

2419
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
And then the meatball lifeguard is like

2420
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
next!

2421
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Come on!

2422
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Keep moving!

2423
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Is it just is it just my memory did they

2424
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
have like unique kinds of ice

2425
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
cream at water parks that you couldn't get anywhere

2426
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
else where there was like it was like

2427
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
a guy with eyes and they were like

2428
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
want to buy this guy and eat his face?

2429
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Sometimes one of the

2430
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
like you can get soft serve

2431
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
in a little sand pail.

2432
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Right. Like bucket at

2433
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
one of the Disney ones and that's cute.

2434
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
But it's a lot of soft serve

2435
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
to fill a bucket.

2436
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It's not a huge bucket. If anybody's up for the

2437
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
challenge. Well.

2438
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
It's a lot of soft serve to fill

2439
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
a bucket. Luckily

2440
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
we have a massive underground

2441
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
system of pipes here in this

2442
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
water park that

2443
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
filters out everything from hair

2444
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
to an entire bucket

2445
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
of soft serve. Every

2446
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
14 cubic feet

2447
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
we know there's an entire

2448
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
bucket of soft serve in the water.

2449
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
You know you just don't want to mix up

2450
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
the pipes because then the soft serve machine

2451
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
shoots out chlorinated water

2452
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and it's then the wave pool

2453
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
is full of soft serve. And feral

2454
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
cats that may have been caught in the filter

2455
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
also get served from the soft serve

2456
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
machines. They're all bloated.

2457
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
They're full of soft serve.

2458
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Well maybe

2459
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
we could get Tom and Jerry as a costume

2460
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
mascot of this park.

2461
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Got enough rats and cats around

2462
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
here.

2463
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
There is a mascot that I

2464
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
want to mention as we wind down because I

2465
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
can't keep this fact in my head even

2466
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
if this could be for a future episode. But when you

2467
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
brought up Wild Rivers in Irvine

2468
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
this area that

2469
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
you know some of it became an amphitheater

2470
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
but all of it just like big

2471
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
teeming grounds there in Irvine

2472
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
used to be something

2473
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
called Lion Country Safari.

2474
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I don't know

2475
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
when this closed but I think it like reached

2476
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
its height in the 70s. And

2477
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
all of that land around there

2478
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
was one of those places where

2479
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
you could drive your car around

2480
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
and there were just lions

2481
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
and hippos and ostriches.

2482
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
It was a drive through safari.

2483
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Now we've kind of relegated all that to San Diego.

2484
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2485
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
San Diego still does that.

2486
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
That's Animal Town.

2487
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
We haven't been there. I haven't done that.

2488
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I thought it would genuinely scare my child.

2489
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
So I didn't do it. But yeah, there was a time

2490
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
where just right next to whatever that mall

2491
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
is called, The Spectrum,

2492
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
there would be lions wandering around.

2493
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Apparently at one point a hippo got

2494
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
loose and was just running around

2495
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Irvine for 19 days.

2496
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
That many days?

2497
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Yes. Yep.

2498
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Well, he's like, well, they don't know where to find me.

2499
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
They think, oh, he's heading north.

2500
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
They go north on the 5.

2501
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
That was actually off the 405.

2502
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
There's a why.

2503
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
There's a why. That was in Wild

2504
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Rivers Tagalos. They said it's where the

2505
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
405 meets the 5. So the hippo

2506
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
could use that confusion to his advantage.

2507
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
The hippo started

2508
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
auditing UC Irvine classes.

2509
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And no one really hated

2510
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
any of mine. Put on a big XXL

2511
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
T-shirt. Also, bad advertising

2512
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
to be like, it's where the 405

2513
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
meets the 5. Because that could send people to

2514
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
your archrival magic mountain.

2515
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Oh, yeah, right.

2516
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
They meet in two different places.

2517
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Okay, I know where that is.

2518
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Great.

2519
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Here's what I wanted to bring up about Lion Country

2520
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Safari.

2521
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I think, you know, they were doing

2522
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
okay for an Orange County

2523
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
drive-thru safari. But things

2524
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
really kicked into gear. When they brought

2525
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
a lion into the fold,

2526
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
named Frasier.

2527
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Frasier was an old, toothless

2528
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
lion. I could barely

2529
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
see. He was 18, which is

2530
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
80 plus for us humans.

2531
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
This is old for a lion.

2532
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And they didn't know. I think he

2533
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
was with some shady circuses.

2534
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
And you know what? We'll take him in. We will be

2535
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
better to Frasier. The question

2536
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
is, how will Frasier blend with all of

2537
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
our lionesses who have been

2538
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
very standoffish when we've

2539
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
introduced other males into our

2540
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
drive-thru safari? And then what

2541
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
happened was, Frasier had

2542
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
35 cubs with six different

2543
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
lionesses who had all refused

2544
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
to mate with younger,

2545
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
more virile, you would think,

2546
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
male lions. And this

2547
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
led to a situation where

2548
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
they started advertising this lion

2549
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
specifically, this old, toothless lion

2550
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
who fucking fucks.

2551
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
And they started

2552
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
calling him Frasier the sensuous

2553
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
lion. This was, I guess,

2554
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
the thing. People know this from

2555
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
the 70s.

2556
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
And honestly, it kept them in

2557
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
business fully, was Frasier

2558
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
the sensuous lion. But then here's the

2559
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
anecdote that really takes it over the edge

2560
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
is that the popularity of

2561
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Frasier was so much that people took a risk

2562
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
and said, you know what? This sounds like,

2563
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
to me, like a movie. And there

2564
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
was a movie that was made called

2565
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Frasier the sensuous lion

2566
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
based on the real lion in Irvine.

2567
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
What I'm showing you guys right now

2568
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
is a, like, 70s

2569
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
drawn sex comedy poster

2570
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
where there is a sheet

2571
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
covering up a kind of leering guy

2572
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
and a sexy, laughing

2573
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Dean Martin girl.

2574
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Right. Human, human. Yeah, so you're right.

2575
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Human's important detail. And then

2576
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
the most, like, side-eye

2577
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
pervy face. Having a

2578
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
threesome with a lion. Yeah, that's

2579
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
kind of what's implying. Yes, yeah, yeah.

2580
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
The woman going like, ooh,

2581
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
and the guy, and the lion.

2582
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I mean, there's also kind of the

2583
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
subtext of, like, she's seeing something down there.

2584
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Well, this is in accordance with my

2585
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
thirteen Leonine

2586
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
principles.

2587
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You separate, you have

2588
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
the lionesses go to the lioness center

2589
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
to learn how to please

2590
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
a male

2591
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
properly maned male

2592
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
lion. I believe that the oldest

2593
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
of any species, lion or human,

2594
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
should receive the most sexual pleasure

2595
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
from the youngest, most beautiful

2596
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
women of their species.

2597
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And if this involves

2598
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
shaming and aggressively

2599
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
expelling

2600
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
the younger male members of the

2601
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
clan, then so be it.

2602
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Making them feel

2603
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
real bad about everything, about

2604
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
their looks and their beliefs.

2605
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Who was in the movie, do you know? Yeah, pretty cool.

2606
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
They got Elliot Gould and Jane Fonda.

2607
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
They worked a lot in the sense.

2608
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Well, that's how it looks in the photo.

2609
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
But really, what you're dealing with is in

2610
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Frasier the Sentuous Lion, the film.

2611
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I'm so glad you asked me who's

2612
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
in it, because the cast is

2613
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
lots of names that I've never heard of.

2614
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Some with cool names, like Malachi

2615
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Throne. I wish I knew more about

2616
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Malachi Throne.

2617
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
But it's kind of, to be honest, no names

2618
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
until you get deep into

2619
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
the names who are on the sheet,

2620
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
kind of down by the knees in this

2621
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
poster. You get to the name

2622
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Peter Laurie Jr.

2623
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Interesting. So Peter Laurie

2624
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
had a son who

2625
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
acted, and he got into this lion movie.

2626
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Rick, I'm fine.

2627
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I don't need anything, Rick. Leave me

2628
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
alone. I'm playing a video game.

2629
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Okay, well that's good

2630
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
that he could have his own career outside of his

2631
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
father. Nope, wrong.

2632
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
This was some guy with a

2633
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
different name who was trying to be an

2634
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
actor, and he had a weird

2635
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
face like Peter Laurie, and it wasn't

2636
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
going anywhere. So he said, you know what I'll do?

2637
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I'll become legally

2638
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Peter Laurie Jr.

2639
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I dare you to say that I'm not

2640
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
why would anybody do that?

2641
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I dare you to say I'm not actually Peter Laurie Jr.

2642
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
But he was not. You could just do that?

2643
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I guess so. Or they made a law after

2644
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
this guy. Maybe if you try to do it now

2645
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
you invoke the Peter Laurie Jr.

2646
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
law. But at the time

2647
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
this was a lawless time, you didn't have that.

2648
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I would go for Orson

2649
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Wells.

2650
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I don't

2651
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's a really good

2652
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
scheme though, is to take some

2653
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
guy that you kind of look like and just say

2654
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
whatever, fine. I don't

2655
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
know if I'd have one.

2656
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
People used to say I look like Zach

2657
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Braff, but I haven't heard that in a long time.

2658
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I was a more slight man

2659
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
and when he was more popular that's what

2660
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
was said. But it never occurred

2661
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
to me to say I'm Zach Braff Jr.

2662
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
and see where that gets me.

2663
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I'm Lil Zach Braff.

2664
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I'm Lil.

2665
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
If they made Jr.

2666
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
illegal.

2667
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Lil Zach Braff.

2668
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
It's funny, I was just

2669
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
reading about, like Michael Keaton

2670
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
revealed, like his birth name

2671
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
is Michael Douglas.

2672
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And when it came time to

2673
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
join SAG, it was already

2674
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
taken. So he called

2675
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
it Michael Keaton. But now he's going back

2676
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
to it. He said he's thinking about changing

2677
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
his SAG name to Michael Keaton

2678
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Douglas. Over my

2679
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
fucking dead body.

2680
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I will

2681
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I have survived

2682
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
multiple bouts of

2683
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
human papilloma virus

2684
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
from guzzling the love juices

2685
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
of various

2686
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
women.

2687
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
And I did not go

2688
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
through that delicious hell.

2689
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
To have my name

2690
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
ripped away by some kind of bird man.

2691
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I believe it's going to come to Fisticuff's

2692
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
fuck face.

2693
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I'm so delighted you do

2694
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Michael Douglas. Michael Douglas is the funniest

2695
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
guy. I could listen to him tell stories.

2696
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Stories of sexual conquest.

2697
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Forever.

2698
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I have to monitor my blood pressure.

2699
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
He's smoking with a

2700
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
heart with a what do you call it?

2701
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Blood pressure sleeve on

2702
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
while he has a cigarette.

2703
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I have to monitor my blood pressure.

2704
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Anyway, I just wanted to educate everybody about

2705
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
not only Frazier the Centuous

2706
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Lion, Peter Laurie Jr., but also

2707
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
that this is a good ski. If you're looking, you know,

2708
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
just think about who might read

2709
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
as your father. I don't know if you have

2710
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I don't know if you've ever been compared to somebody

2711
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
30 years your

2712
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
older. Well, it's a good angle.

2713
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Yeah. When I was skinny, everybody said I looked like

2714
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Errol Flynn, which is great.

2715
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Errol Flynn Jr. is great. No one questioned that.

2716
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Errol Flynn Jr.

2717
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I used to have to be more than just probably

2718
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
a few more generations.

2719
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Or you could do like

2720
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Errol Flynn the fourth.

2721
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Nobody questioned that. And then you subtly

2722
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
the subtle thing, you spell it wrong.

2723
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
You put like, you know, one less

2724
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
R, one more R, three R's.

2725
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Then you're not infringing on anything legally.

2726
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Errol Morris the fourth.

2727
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Great.

2728
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Well, that's a good

2729
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
potential plan for you.

2730
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
But anyway, anything else on the way out the door?

2731
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Any theme park memories or pain?

2732
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I think we are.

2733
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
We've reached the time when the

2734
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Disney characters are projected in the mist

2735
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
above Main Street.

2736
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
And they're about to herd you

2737
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
out the door with nothing open except

2738
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
the shops. Yep. The shops. Extra

2739
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
hour. Ice cream shop. Yeah.

2740
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's what, yeah.

2741
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
That's something we could call. I mean, we call it

2742
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
exiting through the gift shop. That is kind of what we do.

2743
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
But I mean, I guess with

2744
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
that we can say officially, James Zedome,

2745
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
you survived podcast The Ride.

2746
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Thank you for a big pile of

2747
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
memories and oddities.

2748
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
And for, you know.

2749
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Only a minor scrape.

2750
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
You've mostly

2751
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
survived. You know, if it

2752
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
happens again, bring a bottle of Taffer's brown butter

2753
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
powder. Oh, yeah. Rub it on it. Yeah.

2754
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
That's probably how many years,

2755
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
not like an unopened bottle on the shelf,

2756
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
but how many years

2757
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
that occasionally sipped from bottle

2758
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
of whiskey can stick around.

2759
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And how can it help

2760
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
heal a wound if it has very little

2761
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
actual whiskey content? Right.

2762
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
That's really the question. Yeah, yeah.

2763
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Anyway, let's exit through the

2764
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
gift shop.

2765
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Let's talk about the special little. Hey, there we are.

2766
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Yeah, yeah. It's called Path of Most

2767
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Resistance. It's my first

2768
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
stand-up comedy special.

2769
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
It's out now on 800 pound gorilla

2770
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
media dot com

2771
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
to pay what you want.

2772
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And as of September 19th,

2773
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
it's available everywhere, streaming on YouTube.

2774
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
You can rent it and buy it anywhere you would

2775
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
do that with a comedy special. And

2776
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
all the information is on my website, James Zedome and dot com.

2777
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Fantastic. Path of Most

2778
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Resistance. And it's

2779
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
it was a fantastic

2780
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
comedy special about two weeks ago, but

2781
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
now events of the day have overtaken it.

2782
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Oh, geez.

2783
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Wait, which events of which

2784
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Actually, I should be careful because I don't know when

2785
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
this is coming out. That's a

2786
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
real moment of hubris on mine.

2787
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It'll be closer to the YouTube

2788
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
date, I think. I think it's where

2789
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I forget I said anything.

2790
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
You know,

2791
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I don't care if you buy. This special adheres

2792
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
to the 13 principles of Walter

2793
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Nott. Very good.

2794
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I don't know if you get a

2795
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
laugh out of Walter Nott on this, but you think you might

2796
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
at least crack a smile. That is right up

2797
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
my alley for the level of

2798
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
obscurity that I like to have.

2799
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I know. I love that you busted

2800
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
it out of Walter Nott. I don't think anybody's tried

2801
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
a Walter Nott. Well, it's just him, but it's

2802
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
also any guy like that is the same

2803
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
guy. Yeah. O.C. conservative

2804
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
from 48

2805
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And they're not there anymore. Yeah.

2806
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
All those people, their kids moved to

2807
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Arizona and Nevada.

2808
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Yeah, I know.

2809
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
It's a shame. Boy, a shame.

2810
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
O.C. voting blue. I never thought I'd see

2811
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
the day.

2812
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I'm still alive.

2813
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
104 years old and I've been very

2814
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
disappointed to see that my

2815
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
great grandchildren have become

2816
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
liberals.

2817
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Liberals.

2818
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I have a blood vendetta

2819
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
with Snoopy.

2820
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
There's a room in the Freedom Center at Nott's where he is still alive

2821
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
in like an iron lung. Disguised

2822
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
as an animatronic

2823
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
prospector. Oh, he's in there.

2824
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Who did? I did find gold. He's part of it.

2825
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I found gold in a boysenberry.

2826
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
But everybody's like,

2827
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
boy, that weird old robot, that's not realistic

2828
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
at all. Actually, it is the

2829
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
range of motion that a currently living

2830
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Walter Nott would have. His heart is

2831
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
replaced by a large boysenberry.

2832
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Yeah, are they feeding that robot?

2833
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
It's beating boysenberry through his veins.

2834
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
They're feeding it exclusively

2835
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
a bucket of fried chicken

2836
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
and boysenberry pie and it's

2837
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
like preserving it.

2838
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Like the Borg Queen

2839
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
in Star Trek.

2840
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
He's like half of her. He comes down from

2841
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
the ceiling. That's a healthy

2842
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
republic, if you ask me.

2843
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000

podcast the ride. Mike, I swear,

2850
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
if you fuck us on this episode, if you

2851
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
bury this episode for tax breaks,

2852
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
if you fuck James over,

2853
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
this is, think about, to us, sure,

2854
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
but this is our guest. Look,

2855
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
if John Cena were to hear my plan, he would say, well, that makes

2856
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
a lot of sense. I think you should do it. And he would

2857
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
sign off on it and I want to please him, so

2858
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
episode probably buried for a reason. Sorry,

2859
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
probably buried for a reason.
