00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Warning! Today's podcast may include scandalous tales of teenage lap-seeding, rivers of candy blood,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,960
and unspeakable evil like the Shaw of Iran's secret torture police and Disney World hotels charging for parking now.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:38,240
Buckle up, it's the Matterhorn bobsleds on Podcast the Ride.

4
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:46,080
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the show hosted by three men trying to outrace death by knowing every theme park's signature treat.

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,720
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:58,240
So you're saying that if we know every treat that exists at Disney or not, that maybe the Grim Reaper will come another day.

7
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:08,400
We will outrace death embodied by like a skiing man, right? In Jack Kirby's Fourth World.

8
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,600
Isn't death like racing? Like the evil racers.

9
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
That really ties into the theme today.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,560
Yeah, it does.

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,120
Skiing, yeah, good work.

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,760
Oh, right.

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,880
It does? Oh, yes, yes, yes. There's a lot of skiing going on in the Matterhorn.

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,400
Jason's playing four-dimensional chess right now.

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,480
I'm playing four-dimensional chess and playing with me, Scott Gerdner.

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:40,800
I sure am. Don't checkmate me. Yeah, wait, outrunning. Yeah, I mean, yeah, treats help distract from the ultimate specter.

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Some might say, though, the treats speed up, you know, if you have too many treats, Jason.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,480
Well, yeah, but you got to do a few laps on the park to walk off that Ghiradelli.

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,000
All right.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,080
A good place to get your steps in.

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,520
A good place to get your steps in.

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,640
Disneyland, a trip to Disneyland, I will often justify the indulgence by knowing on that.

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
I'm walking potentially nine, 10 miles.

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,400
Yeah, absolutely.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:12,640
Yeah, that's true. Most in my life. I'm never doing any marathon or anything, so every trip to Disneyland is my marathon.

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,600
Yeah, it's very funny looking at my steps and it'll be like from my Orlando trip, it'll be like 20,000 steps, 25,000 steps.

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,400
And then the trip is over and it's like 500 steps.

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
Like one flight climbed and that's it.

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,640
So go there, load up, load up for the year, like gathering berries for your hibernation.

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:32,880
Yeah.

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,320
It levels you out. You're in pretty good shape, I feel.

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,040
I don't know. I mean, kind of. I think it's just luck, honestly.

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,920
I'm tall and it goes over, like it just falls. My metabolism is still OK for a man in his mid thirties.

34
00:02:47,920 --> 00:03:02,240
Yeah, I think any of the three of us are a real rough mess considering how much treats factor into our lives and discussion and alcohol and meals.

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,880
I eat taco about three times a week and I'm doing fine.

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,080
Maybe not three, maybe two. Let's say two. Now, did I eat it two hours ago? Yes.

37
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,400
Yes.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,200
Yes, I did.

39
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,080
But I ate a very small.

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
So on a very sampling day.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
Yeah, I ate two small, very like small kind of treat snack sizes.

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,640
Treats. Yeah.

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,360
Yeah, it's all about portion control now, right? That's what they say.

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,400
Yes, now it is. Yes.

45
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
In 2018.

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,480
So, yeah, we're talking Matterhorn today.

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,040
Sure are. Matterhorn bobsleds.

48
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,760
Yeah, that's the official name.

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,280
Official name, yeah. Thought so. Didn't want to get that wrong.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,200
And for our SEO, get all those bobsled fans to listen to just this.

51
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,680
Oh, yeah.

52
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,240
That's cool.

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,840
Still high off the Winter Olympics. Still riding strong.

54
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,560
But some some recent events, some news to kick us off.

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
Sure. Yeah. What do you got?

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
Well, well, we got a very nice message.

57
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,560
This was through Twitter. Michael Natal sent us a message about a recent announcement by Disney.

58
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,960
Michael writes, this is going to sound bizarre, but here it goes.

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,880
My mother, who isn't in any way tech savvy, is a huge fan of your show.

60
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,960
In fact, it's it's in fact the only podcast you'll listen to.

61
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,600
As such, she asked me on her behalf to reach out to ask you guys

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,000
if you would at any point discuss the controversy over Disney World

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,240
choosing to now charge hotel guests for parking at the hotels themselves.

64
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,280
I know that's specific, but I'm just doing what I was asked.

65
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Michael's mom.

66
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,480
What a good son.

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
What a good son.

68
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Hey, yeah. Thanks both of you for listening.

69
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,720
Yeah, I like how you were just like, I'm just following orders.

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,480
This is not what I wanted to do.

71
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,080
I'd be curious to hear what he would like us to talk about.

72
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Oh, yeah, that's true.

73
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,080
But you know, he's going in generational order, which I think is right.

74
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
That is nice. Yes.

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
So yeah. So yeah.

76
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
What do we think?

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
So yeah, Disney World is now charging.

78
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
If you're staying at like the Polynesian hotel, you're staying overnight.

79
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Most hotels will charge you like forty dollars to keep a car there,

80
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
whether it's a rent, whatever car.

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
In general, in the world.

82
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
In high density areas.

83
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,680
If you come to L.A. or you go to New York, you're going to pay a premium to park at hotels.

84
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,480
If you're staying at like a Hilton Garden Inn or a courtyard by Marriott in the middle,

85
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,680
in the suburbs or something, there's usually a giant free parking lot.

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:33,680
But and a lot of resorts sort of play like universals on site hotels have charged for pretty much.

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,680
I think I've always charged for parking, but that was a perk of Disney's.

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,680
If you stay on site at Disney, you park for free at the hotels.

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:50,480
If you're staying at one little bone toss to the people who were paying for the far more expensive hotels that are on site.

90
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Yeah. So that's going away.

91
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
That's going away. Now it's like forty dollars a night.

92
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Probably. I will say this.

93
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,280
I didn't know they weren't charging people to park there.

94
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
I had no idea.

95
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
I haven't stayed. I stayed there like four years ago on site.

96
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
I didn't realize I didn't have a car, though.

97
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
So I don't know. I didn't know that. That is news to me.

98
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Didn't you just go with a car?

99
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Well, we didn't. That was a whole thing. I didn't even get to that on the podcast episode.

100
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
There was a whole debacle with budget rent a car.

101
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
We had reservations at Be Our Guest restaurant.

102
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
There's still more.

103
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,280
We had reservations at 830. We were in the line at seven o'clock at the airport.

104
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,280
I was like, guys, look, if we wait in this line, we're never getting to be our guest.

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
I'm like, we got to abandon this rent a car.

106
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,280
And I convinced the party I was to abandon the rent a car.

107
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,280
He got the money back. Don't worry.

108
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
I was.

109
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Yeah, Jason was. He was sweating, gripping the microphone.

110
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
What's the end of this story?

111
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
Like a plane going down.

112
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,280
Did budget rent a car? Were they also going to make you eat a seven course meal?

113
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
It's in the trunk.

114
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
Cranberry sauce and gravy.

115
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,280
I would have done it to get to Be Our Guest. I would have eaten two meals.

116
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,280
So how did you get on proper? Did you take a lift?

117
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,280
We had to take a lift. We took an 80 dollar lift ride to the hotel and then to the Magic Kingdom.

118
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:10,280
And I had to look into parking at the Contemporary because I was wondering if before we could have rented a car and parked at the Contemporary.

119
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,280
But they do track you. They do check.

120
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,280
So they give you three. You'd have to be eating at the Contemporary to park there if you weren't staying there.

121
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,280
So they're already becoming very restrictive on parking at their hotels as it is.

122
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:30,280
This is what we do for fun is do do this in life and then talk about it later.

123
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
At you.

124
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Yeah. We enjoy getting around parking fees.

125
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,280
So in that regard, I'm not for this. Well, I don't know.

126
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Hey, I'm not for people getting charged for these hotels, but if it gives us all a chance to try to game the system.

127
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Yeah.

128
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
One of our favorite activities.

129
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Right.

130
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Harmlessly. Harmlessly.

131
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we're not bad boys.

132
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Good boy.

133
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
I will say.

134
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
Just trying to get a value.

135
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,280
I was a bad boy, because so what would happen is since we were taking lifts at Disney World, you would have to get dropped off.

136
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,280
So like at Hollywood Studios, it's very easy to get dropped off.

137
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
They have a section for ride share.

138
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Yeah. But for instance, Magic Kingdom, they want to make you go to Ticken Transportation Center, take a monorail, and that's going to take a while.

139
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,280
What you can do is you can go up to the front of the Contemporary.

140
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
They go, what are you doing here?

141
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
And then you go like, oh, I'm going to eat here.

142
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
And they go, all right.

143
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,280
But they're suspicious of you. And they should be because you're not eating there.

144
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,280
You're just going to get let out of Contemporary and walk over to the Magic Kingdom.

145
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
This happened to me at the Grand Californian.

146
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,280
We took a lift because the lift drop off is very far away from where we're going at Disneyland.

147
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,280
And so we took a lift to the Grand Californian.

148
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Very, very weird and stern and suspicious.

149
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
And like, oh, yeah, we're going to a restaurant.

150
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Oh, yeah. Which restaurant?

151
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Wet Water Snacks, my man.

152
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Yeah, that would have been. Now I know.

153
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Now I know that's the end because I said, did I say this on all on the podcast already at some point?

154
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,280
I said the Napa Rose and they said, nice try.

155
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Napa Rose opens at 11. Ta ta.

156
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,280
It was like it was this it was this very like, no, not ta ta.

157
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,280
That was the attitude is very it was very ta ta.

158
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Yeah, it was. It was just kind of like shut you down.

159
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Found a hole in your life.

160
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,280
It was this very like snooty movie villain, the guy who then you like hit on the head with a club

161
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,280
and drag him somewhere and put on his clothes and then march into the lair or whatever.

162
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
I mean, that'll be interesting.

163
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Scott is now working the gate at the Grand Californian.

164
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,280
And I got stuck with it and I just liked the job and the uniform and I stayed.

165
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
That'll be interesting.

166
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Like when that four diamond or whatever the really fancy hotel opens at Disneyland

167
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:46,280
because like there's an expected level of service at that quality of like high, high end hotel.

168
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,280
And like you have to weigh that you have to balance that out with that Disney.

169
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Like you pay your ticket, everything above board sort of thing.

170
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Now, there's also a lot of con man maniacs out there who are trying to pull real cons on them.

171
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,280
So I get their suspicion.

172
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
You don't consider us con men maniacs, though.

173
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,280
No, I don't think because like also like savvy pass holders.

174
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Yeah. And it's goers, park goers.

175
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Yeah. I mean, who cares?

176
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Like, yeah, it's it's yeah, very savvy stuff.

177
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
It's too much of this thing going.

178
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
I couldn't believe that level of judgment.

179
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,280
I thought this was the be our guest culture.

180
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,280
How could this Disney man be so mean to us?

181
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:34,280
They've gotten yelled at by some meaner person probably of like we can't have this lifts dropping people off here all day.

182
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,280
So they're scared or they've been hardened by a system.

183
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Yeah.

184
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
And then there's a lot to deal with.

185
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:51,280
That's also like when high level executives go to Disneyland, they just valet for free at the Grand California and walk into the parks or escorted.

186
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
So they never. Yeah, they never have to go on the tram.

187
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
They never have to.

188
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:01,280
So, yeah, if you're running late once and you want to valet and you can pay and valet at like contemporary or Grand California out here.

189
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,280
But if you're just going to try to go park quickly, like you have to do the old the old restaurant fib.

190
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Yeah. Yeah.

191
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:15,280
I mean, I think that's a good point that you made earlier, Mike, of like you didn't realize that they were not charging people like.

192
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:29,280
And I think that is probably partly of their justification is like if people are buying big packages in Florida and paying for everything else or every other resort fee and stuff like they probably won't notice this sort of thing.

193
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Yeah, I mean, they are.

194
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Look, I there's no better way.

195
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,280
They are going to suck all the money they can out of you.

196
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,280
So it does. It's like, yeah, if I'm if I'm giving you my opinion on it, it does suck.

197
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
It's bad. I think it's shitty.

198
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:53,280
I mean, I think it's shitty that the two that like getting rid of the like the free the soaps and stuff like, oh, that's a different soap to the shower.

199
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,280
This is a whole nother topic. And this is something you were very upset with.

200
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
I don't know if you've talked about the Scottish looks confused.

201
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:07,280
The toiletry like some of the Disney hotels are like rather than like the single serve travel toiletries would get in a hotel room there.

202
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,280
And this is a thing at like kind of more budget hotels, right?

203
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Budget hotels or like pod hotel or ace hotel.

204
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Like there's a thing called Ace Hotel's like sort of you just there's just like giant bottles of soap, shampoo, conditioner, a fixed bolted to the wall.

205
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,280
And then housekeeping just refills those every time.

206
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Now it is more environmentally conscious.

207
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,280
But for Disney, that's one less free souvenir.

208
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
That's one little perk.

209
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,280
I mean, a lot of people, this isn't just a weird thing.

210
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
There's a huge especially.

211
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,280
And I would on occasion you bring back a little the Mickey the shampoo with Mickey's head on it.

212
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,280
But Jason will come back stocked up for like six.

213
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Oh, yeah. With shampoo and soaps and then like a couple.

214
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
I love it. They got that.

215
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,280
They got that to. Oh, that's a great brand. It's a high end.

216
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:07,280
I know when I was at a hotel, are you using like the moisturizer or the other, you know, the third cream shampoo conditioner and then the foot rub cream.

217
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
I don't know. I have a gentleman.

218
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,280
I'm not usually using, you know, extra shower gel or whatever.

219
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
But in a hotel, I'll treat myself.

220
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Well, Jason's still using some of that cream from one of his visits in 1994.

221
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Yeah, he's been doing that.

222
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Yeah, it's got Bill Clinton waving on it.

223
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Yeah, Mickey and Bill was the part time promotion.

224
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,280
I think that you're going to be really sad when they start bolting the bath towels to the wall.

225
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
Yeah, you know, they'll need to.

226
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Yeah.

227
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Or the bathrobe that you steal out of the room.

228
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Yeah, they just have a there's a cord attached to the bathrobe that you won't be able to leave with it.

229
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Your tether. You can go anywhere in the room, perhaps to the balcony.

230
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,280
But it'll snap you back if you try to jump.

231
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Yeah, right. You're trying to jump in a bathrobe.

232
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,280
That's good, too, if you have suicidal thoughts.

233
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:01,280
So they're helping. Yeah, they're curbing the death rate with that robe leash.

234
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Sure.

235
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
But yeah, I mean, I have to.

236
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,280
I think it's a little bit of like bleeding people dry.

237
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:14,280
I feel like when I was growing up, like it was Disney was trying to get like as many people as possible to the parks.

238
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,280
And now that they've done that for a few generations, they're like,

239
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,280
this might be stretching our infrastructure a little bit.

240
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,280
What if we got less people, but they spent more money?

241
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,280
That that is what a lot of places are doing, too.

242
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,280
It's just like, well, we have some customers instead of making more customers.

243
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Let's just believe the ones we have dry.

244
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,280
And there's the assumption maybe, you know, like when Michael Eisner took over the company in the early 80s,

245
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:49,280
I think it was maybe the only time in Disney's history that it was in question whether like, will this keep going?

246
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,280
If there was ever going to be a time that Disney stopped, it was then.

247
00:14:52,280 --> 00:15:00,280
And now I think there was probably it was because the whole Eisner run was about keeping Disney relevant for teens and new sets of kids.

248
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,280
And now I think there's been a few generations and the existing fans will make their children existing fans.

249
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Yes. And so like I think the cycle will will never end.

250
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,280
And so they don't they don't need to do anybody any favors at this point.

251
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:21,280
That's why we know we talked about on Videopolis how there was like a summer pass just to get teens into the right of the nightclub.

252
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,280
They're not doing anything like that now. Absolutely not.

253
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:32,280
And even in the 90s, like in Disneyland or even when I started when we started going, it was like you got in free on your birthday

254
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,280
and you could put the free ticket toward your annual pass. You could get an annual pass for like a hundred bucks.

255
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
You get it for like one hundred and fifty bucks.

256
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:49,280
And I feel and like when they started doing the annual pass, like monthly installments, like I X number of years ago when I started doing that,

257
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,280
like it wasn't that noticeable. It wasn't a ton like monthly payments.

258
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,280
And you could get a pretty good one. The charge wasn't that the charge wasn't that big.

259
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,280
But then the passes keep going up year over year. Yeah.

260
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,280
And I understand part of that is because there's so many people and they want to like curb crowds.

261
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:18,280
But it's not it's impossible because we're all fucking maniacs that will just like just drift through a sea of thousands just to go on Big Thunder Mountain for one one ride a night.

262
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,280
But this chain does this dissuade you from coming? No, no.

263
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Well, then will if you made us walk through spikes to get in here, we do it. We need it.

264
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:37,280
But I've said this, too, with the price increases on all these things, the annual pass with this parking, if they were if they had the last 10 years been like every summer,

265
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,280
there was a giant new land or ride or crazy thing.

266
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,280
And then they were also like we're paying everyone fifteen dollars to work here like a living wage.

267
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I would go, OK, I'm paying a ton and keep paying more.

268
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,280
But all the employees are making a lot of money or at least a good amount as much as in and out burger employees are making.

269
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,280
And well, there's an awesome new thing every year. Oh, yeah.

270
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,280
So like that is not that is not happening.

271
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Now, it looks like we're you know, we're getting Star Wars land.

272
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,280
We'll get this Marvel thing, which we're going to talk about maybe in a second.

273
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:16,280
And of course, Florida's building, you know, finally like new rides in places and they keep opening, you know, temporary warehouses with frozen singalongs.

274
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:25,280
There's been a lot of good quickly jammed together ways to get it going in the park. Stuff to save every dollar.

275
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,280
So you can fight the unions on very small cost of living increases. Right.

276
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:37,280
So so look, look, we have to if we're weighing in, if we're ruling, it sucks. It sucks. Yeah.

277
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Yeah. The lack of free parking is bad.

278
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,280
I mean, the excuse they're using is like, oh, every other resort in Florida charges.

279
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,280
But it's like, yeah, but you're also not every other resort. Yeah.

280
00:17:50,280 --> 00:18:02,280
The top of the mountain. Come on. Do you guys realize that this is this is changed in the recent past in Las Vegas as well that it was kind of a given that there was free parking for casinos and that is now gone.

281
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Atlantic City. It kind of goes back and forth to like when stuff is slow.

282
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,280
And that's a lot more seasonable, a seasonal that resort town in the winter. The parking is really low.

283
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:22,280
But in the summer, when people like when also go to the want to go to the casino, but also want to go to the beach, the beach side casinos like really raise their parking.

284
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,280
It is. I think it's just with the the Vegas thing.

285
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,280
And I don't I don't think I've been since they started charging for parking.

286
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:36,280
But it's a it hurts morale. Definitely. Like, you know, like you're spending a lot of money and you're aware how much money you're spending.

287
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:45,280
And it is a nice little thing like, oh, I can pop over to Mandalay Bay or whatever and and stop into the Luxor and not not have to stop at that gate.

288
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,280
And yeah, it's just another little little thing that makes it more irritating to go to these places.

289
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Will I stop going to Vegas? No. No. I'm going to Disney World.

290
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,280
No, as long as they keep offering idiocy and treats. I'm I'm there and treats.

291
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Yeah. So why wouldn't they here? I'm just volunteering myself.

292
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Like, yeah, we're all we'll complain about these parking fees on a podcast for three minutes.

293
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,280
But but we are right. I'm still going to go. Yeah. I mean, nothing will stop you from going.

294
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,280
That's yeah. Unfortunately, that's the problem here. Yeah.

295
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,280
So they keep parking free at my apartment. That doesn't change. I guess I'm paying for it. I think I'm probably.

296
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Yeah. This is not like, yeah, yeah. That's that showing there's not like a little like a thing that you write like a separate check you write every month.

297
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Parking. So so Michael and Michael's mother.

298
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
We hope that answers your question. And what do you what do you guys think?

299
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Michael and Michael's mother, I'm saying they like pro capitalism.

300
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,280
They like it. Maybe they were. Yeah. They were talking about this on the Disney dish podcast.

301
00:19:51,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Jim and Len mentioned this pretty quickly. The one thing that they did not mention, though, is like, I think, like my my dad, when we go down the floor, he likes to have the car.

302
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Especially we're going between like Universal and Disney and stuff. He likes to have that option.

303
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Or if we want to eat somewhere else, it made the younger the millennial generation, my solution would just be like, I'm not going to have a car down there.

304
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:26,280
I'll just take a lift or a mere shuttle because mirrors just has a super shuttle and their transport companies have a monopoly in Orlando.

305
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,280
That said, it's only sixteen dollars to take a super shuttle to Universal from the airport.

306
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,280
We know these prices offhand. I was there. I was only there like six months ago.

307
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:42,280
That's not too long to retain. We know. But yeah, take you know, take a shuttle.

308
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,280
We took we figured out exactly how much the lift cost versus how much we would have paid with the budget.

309
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,280
And it isn't a ton more if you're mostly doing Disney and like then because once you're on property Disney, then you can just do the buses.

310
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:01,280
You can do all the on site, which are free for now, which are free for now. Very important. Until that becomes a weird thing.

311
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,280
We're going to start to have to we're going to pay Disney bus fare.

312
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,280
We're going to have like stamp cards and they'll let us for not having exact change.

313
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,280
There is going to be a fleet of autonomous cars that are like the minivan because now we're getting into a whole nother style.

314
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:21,280
But there's minivans. They have like lifts now that are like polka dotted that are super expensive.

315
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,280
Right. I would guess I think it's a flat. What?

316
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,280
Maybe going up to for wherever you go on site, where within the. Yeah.

317
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:34,280
So it's not easy. And they'll also drop you off right at the park entrance. They have exclusive.

318
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
They can get you. They can get you real close.

319
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,280
You don't have to lie to no contemporary gate guard. Yeah.

320
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,280
You're also paying the premium for like the decoration of the cars and stuff.

321
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Oh, yeah. You're paying a bow tax. I would pay an extra 20 if Minnie was driving.

322
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Well, you know, my history with many, too. So I guess that well, sure.

323
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Yeah. Your second family that you have in Florida. Yeah.

324
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,280
This is a transactional relationship. You cannot be getting up to anything in that.

325
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Sorry. Mind if I sit in the front window goes up the Viter. Yeah.

326
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:15,280
But as we've proved in the past, we could talk about transportation options, options all the live long day.

327
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Evidently. But in theory, on some level, this is a comedic entertainment podcast.

328
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,280
That's what we started out thinking it was. Yeah. Yeah.

329
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,280
But as we warned from episode one, you'll be amazed how dry we can get. That's true.

330
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Do we have dry thoughts or or entertaining thoughts about the the recent Marvel announcements?

331
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,280
I probably mostly dry. But yeah, yeah. Good.

332
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:49,280
So, yeah, they announced Marvel, they announced Marvel superheroes that are they're going to be land at Paris in Hong Kong and finally Disneyland and Jason and I.

333
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,280
California adventure. Yeah, specifically. Replacing a Bugsland.

334
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Yes. And I think part of Hollywoodland, but they haven't really quite said that yet.

335
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:04,280
OK. But we'll see. It's opening in phases. It's open. It's it's in the Studios Park, right? In Paris. Am I wrong?

336
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Yeah. And then it's in just Hong Kong, Disney proper in tomorrow around. There is no second gate. Yeah. So. Right.

337
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,280
So as Jason and I, as the podcast listeners know, are Marvel boys, we're big boys.

338
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:27,280
We're I'm very excited. I've been waiting for this forever for them to finally announce this because they just built Guardians of the Galaxy and she's been sitting awkwardly in that area over next to Bugsland and in the middle of Hollywoodland.

339
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:35,280
Yeah. I mean, we're going from old timey Hollywood with trolleys and stuff. And suddenly now there's a bunch of Tannoy. There was a big inventors lab.

340
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Tannoy or Tavon collectors fortress has just appeared.

341
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:46,280
And then right next to a bunch of rides that look like ladybugs and grasshoppers doesn't make any sense.

342
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Infuriating. Yeah. Certainly deeply distracts from me drinking two glasses of wine and walking around and then going.

343
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Yeah. Did we talk to on the podcast about what that when we ran into that woman who was so curious about like seemingly drunk.

344
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:10,280
I think she was drunk. Yeah. So we were it was probably like a year ago. So they were building. They were changing over. I don't think Jason. No, Jason was not there.

345
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:16,280
It was just you and I think it was somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. Our significant others were somewhere else.

346
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Okay. Get lost getting a nice break. Can we just go. They didn't speak to each other. We just go be quiet somewhere. They sat in silence.

347
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:32,280
They were talking about the prices of super shuttles and I just they hugged out of consolation and then came back.

348
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,280
The crisis shelter. It's been 35 minutes. I guess we must return.

349
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:44,280
This was someone very upset about. So the construction we were freedom to go meet some ladies in their absence.

350
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Why did we we walked up because I said I want to look at the building because the building had they were changing the tower of terror and the guardians and it was like they had taken the blanket off the top of it.

351
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:06,280
They take the whatever you call it. Yeah. Yeah. So I was just staring at this crazy thing which I like the look of it even though it's insane looking and this woman pushing a stroller.

352
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Am I wrong or no. She was with her daughter. I was pushing a stroll.

353
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:16,280
That is a common sight in California adventure. Someone pushing a stroller hammered joke of wine.

354
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Yeah. Yeah. Like a tower of your woman pushing a baby in a stroller and men. Oh yeah that's true. Sure. Everyone can be drunk hammered out Orange County citizens all parents can be drunk.

355
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:40,280
And we were both like staring at it and she just comes right up to us and is just like ranting just straight to like I can you even can you.

356
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:47,280
I oh I can't look. I can you. I can't. I can you. I cannot. Her daughter was like trying to get her away from us.

357
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:53,280
I remember like she was so embarrassed and we were like yeah I don't know. Hopefully it's good or whatever. We're trying to cheer up.

358
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:01,280
We're trying to. Yeah. Like you know it's OK. There's still one in Florida that's better you know doing all the talking points all the Tony Baxter talking points.

359
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:10,280
And like I feel my memory of it was that for five minutes she would not leave. I think she left and came back even. Yeah.

360
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:16,280
She had like she was like and another thing and they they're gonna do this in the middle. This is Hollywood land and she had another.

361
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:25,280
And then I'm trying to remember she she she was clearly somebody who hated any kind of change because I think she was cranky about a different ride.

362
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:34,280
I think she said if they do anything to Monsters Inc. And you're like yeah which is a ride that everyone is like fine but it was formerly Superstar limo off in a corner.

363
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,280
You know you forget about it. And I really it was already like a quick beer fill in this bad.

364
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:47,280
So you're experiencing this and your reactions are I wish Spider-Man would swing in and rescue me.

365
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Yes. Oh yeah. Thanks buddy. He shoots the web at her mouth. She can't talk.

366
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Well he does that all the time. Yeah. That's a joke in every Spider-Man.

367
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:10,280
He does the men and women. There's nothing bad about that. And then he like shoots her feet and she like gets pulled up and she's just hanging there for a while. He's like well let the cops deal with her.

368
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Hey whenever there's theme park nerds who are frustrated with a different type of theme park nerd who doesn't share their precise opinion.

369
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:26,280
I'm there. And he shoots a glass of wine into Scott's hand with a webbing. Thanks Spidey.

370
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:40,280
No problem swings off into the night screaming about Uncle Ben Spider-Man walk around in the new Marvel lands just have breakdowns about Uncle Ben.

371
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:47,280
I think you can trigger him if you know the secret word like when the others when you could tell the Toy Story toys.

372
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Andy's coming and they would fall on the ground. You know I'm talking about. Yeah. This was this true ever.

373
00:27:52,280 --> 00:28:00,280
That's kind of pictures of them on the ground. I see pictures of them. Yeah there's and it became urban legend. That was just heat exhaustion. Right. Yeah.

374
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:11,280
They were very sick. Someone should have helped them was a 12 hour shift. They made six dollars an hour. So people were we say people are there's people who are mad about the kind looks choo choo train going away.

375
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well we'll do proper eulogies. Yeah. All of these attractions and have Mitch on to mourn them.

376
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:29,280
I bet Mitch loves time looks to train. So they released these posters these little these little pieces of like I guess concept art or what the land will look like.

377
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:38,280
And does everybody. I'm not sure if everyone listening knows what they are exactly or what the what the extent of the Marvel area is going to be. Right.

378
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:49,280
I mean we know that there's I don't want to interrupt your flow. We know there's we know there's an Avengers attraction. We know there's a Spider-Man attraction and probably probably they haven't officially announced those.

379
00:28:49,280 --> 00:29:00,280
OK. No that's from the rumor blogs. We know there's an Ant-Man movie thing and going into Paris. We don't know if that's officially and that's kind of looks like people having the concept art like guns.

380
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Paris or Hong Kong. I don't think that's going to. I think I think there's a there's a. So we're not sure. So they already have a they already have. Don't be mad at us.

381
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:20,280
They already have a Hong Kong Iron Man ride which is just star tours with Iron Man. So I think maybe that gets cloned somewhere but they haven't like fully announced the whole roster of what's coming.

382
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Yeah. The rumor out here is there might be a Spider-Man ride possibly a big Avengers coaster. Hopefully yeah hopefully many rides but they've just for this particular announcement they just really release these three images and we'll post these on here.

383
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:50,280
And on each on the bottom of each poster before we get into ride speculation on the bottom of each poster there's a phrase that they they use and there's a kid in front of like there's a bunch of kids on the posters and it says recruitment begins.

384
00:29:50,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Yeah. Which is I mean I get it. They're going for like you little kid. You could be recruited to join the Avengers. But what I think it seems to me and it's like hey join the military.

385
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:17,280
Yeah. And this is this is a thing that I've had like been thinking about a lot lately as like Infinity War comes out soon or depending on when this is released comes out immediately.

386
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:39,280
That first wave of Marvel films where like shield is in every other scene are so like militarized. There's a lot of military stuff and folks if you don't know how Hollywood works the U.S. military spends a lot of money and resources lending out like equipment and locations.

387
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:50,280
And you're going all the way and saying the U.S. military is funding the Marvel and I know not funding but like if you have a military angle in your movie and all right.

388
00:30:50,280 --> 00:31:03,280
And it and you make the military look good. They'll give you a lot of material support. I hear what you're saying. Yeah. So I make a movie will they. They might. Yeah.

389
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Depending. I mean if someone salutes a flag in your movie or like someone picks up a bruised flag and raises like the end of San Andreas as they're raising a flag over a destroyed Golden Gate Bridge.

390
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:33,280
The flags are shown respect. Craig Healy goes into the military. I think you get some money. Oh man. Oh yeah. Complicated in the army in the army. A hundred million dollar budget. Yeah. Check out my thing. Complicated on view.

391
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Dot com or not my thing. I have nothing to do with it. Right. I hope you dot com. I'm just a fan. So a lot of this in the movies and it kind of goes back and forth in the comics. Yeah. After 9 11 a lot of military stuff in the comics.

392
00:31:50,280 --> 00:32:04,280
After Watergate less brah brah USA stuff in the comics and the Avengers alternately are like work for the American government work for the United Nations are just kind of on their own.

393
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:20,280
It is it is like and I'm not even trying to like make a point or anything about the military. I just think it's interesting that like there's like if you look at the pictures here and it's like a big Avengers logo and shield and like it very much to me other than like maybe this picture in the back of like the guardians thing.

394
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:36,280
It looks very cold and industrial like hey kids aren't you don't you want to live in your favorite Marvel comic. Yeah. Well what do you want to do. Do you want to go look at shield headquarters and look at sonar. What do you want to do. Like that's like one of the last things that I want to do.

395
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:54,280
I want to go have lunch with Jarvis at Avengers mansion. I want to dine with Dr. Strange and like a different dimension and it's like but instead or you could ride with one of the Avengers in the brand new Chevy Volt the brand new 2019 Chevy Volt in that one like one scene.

396
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:09,280
You know your one scene from the movie. Yes we all remember the one scene with the Chevy Volt. I mean they got to pick a vehicle so they got a big video. Yeah that's also that's a different kind of material support is like I forget which one one of the Captain America's.

397
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:18,280
I was like did Mercedes Benz pay for this move because there were so many shots of like the military like SUVs pulling up in front of the camera SUVs.

398
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:33,280
We were down there last year at Disneyland was the summer of heroes the great summer of heroes when they were opening the Guardians right in the Guardians right which we both we all we all like you like in theory you have not been on the videos I've watched it seems like a lot of fun like fun.

399
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:52,280
The songs you like those songs sure and Jason I have been on it and like it. Everything else at the summer of heroes bit of a dud a little weird. Yeah had a lot of the trademarks of superheroes in theme parks which is like guitar heavy rock music and also ATV vehicles like superheroes on.

400
00:33:52,280 --> 00:34:05,280
They would do a ceremony where the where Black Widow would come out like once once an hour and all of a sudden it would be this like crazy like intense turn turn turn and then like on a like an SUV.

401
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:20,280
Black Widow like sternly standing would drive down the street in this armored vehicle and you're like Jesus Christ this isn't fun like what kid is like oh great. Yeah Scarlet Scarlet which Black Widow was coming to kill us. Scarlet Witch.

402
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:49,280
That's a different character. Okay you didn't get confused no no no Scarlet is in that is probably what my brain was doing but Scarlet which is a different character Elizabeth Olsen in the movies I see this is where I'm just going radio silent for all these Marvel things I don't know whatever the rides are I'll show up I'll go on them I'm not going to understand them like that like that Transformers ride which I will never like if I if I studied if I had to take a test about that ride I would I'd get 10 percent but you know what.

403
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,280
You go on and it shakes you around I'm fine I don't know whatever look do you know the name of the vehicle you sit in on the transformer ride.

404
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Come on. Vehicles not the all spark. No the all spark is the all spark. The vehicles are the vehicles are the vehicles are the characters. Hell yeah Jason knows the name. I'm going to know it once you say it but you you're they keep referring to you as a character.

405
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Yeah you are a character. It's not mud flap or skids scoops. No the vehicle is original. What accent does my vehicle speak. What's the what's the stereotype. He's a pizza chef he's an Italian pizza chef. Yeah the vehicle is an original creation for the ride named Evac. Evac.

406
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:46,280
Okay that doesn't sound familiar to you. No it doesn't. That's how much my my brain does not retain any information about that right. Evac talks a lot to the general played by that great character actor whose name escapes me right now. We don't know the actor's name but we know Evac's name. Yeah that's important.

407
00:35:46,280 --> 00:36:15,280
Yeah I mean I'm excited to see what all this Marvel stuff is. In addition to being Marvel boys Mike and I are the exact right age for to be like X-Men boys like X-Men fans. We grew up in the 90s with the cartoon show with the arcade cabinet the height of like Marvel trading cards too and hopefully with this 21st century Fox deal there's a little bit of X-Men rehab because they're kind of

408
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:32,280
like sure all over the map the movies and TV shows and stuff. I just think we're gonna have to wait. Yeah but like we have to wait for third park in 2031. There's like a dozen X-Men rides that would be great fighting the Sentinels in the danger room in the Xavier school.

409
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:49,280
Like that's what we want. I just think if I was putting together the whole thing like I would have been there is a picture if you can see there is Dr. Strange's of course his trademark home. Scott of course knows it. The Sanctum Sanctorum. Yeah yeah yeah.

410
00:36:49,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Yeah I said exactly what you said. Yeah there is a little picture of it but like if it was like him and like he was like on a giant dragon and he was like come on in or something like that to me is like fun let's do it versus these posters that are very a little cold for me.

411
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:24,280
A little yeah without joy. Have I officially said on the podcast also that I don't see any of these. I'm skipping the entire genre. You've seen a couple pieces of a couple. I saw Iron Man 1 and Avengers and I found Avengers so insufferably boring and confusing and why are there five acts in this movie.

412
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:42,280
It is long. I'm skipping all of it and just sheer money I've saved economics to now because I feel like people joylessly go see I mean you love some of them. You know some of them you go see opening night as expensive as it can be and at the highest quality it can be.

413
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:53,280
City walk IMAX. Exactly. You essentially pay a utility bill to go up and see the piece. And then don't have a good time. I always have a good time. Look you got a Margaritaville you have one of the hot hot hot.

414
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Margaritas there or you do what I do which I've done with you guys which is do that part and then leave. That's the best thing that could ever occur. I think though I would pass a lie detector like did you have a good time and I would have passed it every time. Yeah I think so. Yeah I have a lot of fun and we usually get a big group together and that's fun and it becomes a thing. And even in like the worst of the movies you know the third act starts and you know Thor's hitting somebody with a hammer and I'm like oh that's pretty good. Maybe there's some story problems.

415
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:39,280
But whatever. Sure. Now that being said but the opinion that I stick to is that the rides I'm old. I don't want to see any of these movies. I want every ride there could possibly be. Yes. Yeah I think I mean we're all on the same page. I think like if it's a property and it has a lot of money that's great.

416
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:51,280
That's all we really care about. It could be a show we've never heard of or seen. And as long as they're gonna put a lot of money and thought into it great. We're happy to go on it and we'll become fans. Yeah. You know like Avatar.

417
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,880
like Avatar. Yeah, yeah sure. We made it work. Yeah, we forced ourselves. You rode the

418
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,360
Mighty Akron. I love the Mighty Akron. So yeah, so Marvel, we're excited. It's coming in 2020,

419
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,400
but it says like opening in phases, which has me worried that we're not getting any new rides for

420
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,000
a while. Yeah, maybe not. Opening in phases. Nothing happening in tomorrow. It's like, well,

421
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,960
you know, you're not going to get a new ride, but if you want to wait in a long line to put your

422
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:28,080
name down to be recruited, you can. Yeah. Who here likes limited run food options? Who here likes,

423
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:34,080
what do we have, a Sinman roll that looked like the Incredible Hulk? We split some crazy donut once.

424
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,800
Oh yeah, we ate an Incredible Hulk donut. It was a Captain America Apple Pie donut. Oh, I think

425
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,440
that's right. Yeah, yeah. Well, we waited four hours for the Guardians ride. A Rice Krispie square

426
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,080
with frosting that looks like the Iron Man mask that is like not related to the Krispie square at

427
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,120
all. And in fact, just breaks off with the first bite and shatters falls to the floor. We're going

428
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,880
to have a lot of fondant based experiences until the attractions actually open. Wait, what? It's

429
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:08,320
fondant. What's fondant? Fondant is like the stuff they use on like the crazy cake shows. Fondant is

430
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,160
fondant. It's like sugar stuff that you can mold. Oh, I love that. Sometimes it doesn't have any

431
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,240
flavor. Like it's sometimes just very sugary and it's more for the decoration. Yes, an artistic

432
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,840
implement that is technically edible, but also probably chalky and not great. I always get rainbow

433
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,320
sprinkles and I think it's just because it's visual. Like there's not individual flavors on

434
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:36,000
those rainbow sprinkles. It's fooling me. Yeah. Oh, but you feel mentally like you can taste the

435
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,240
difference between a red and blue sprinkle. I don't even think I can. I just think that

436
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,880
aesthetically when I'm looking at it, it pleases me so much that I have to get them rainbow.

437
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,120
Like if it's sometimes they'll do like a limited edition, like it'll just be like Christmas,

438
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:54,480
like red and green sprinkles. I don't quite enjoy the cone as much unless I have. Thank you.

439
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,000
Well, I find Mike's, sometimes Mike's energy about rainbow sprinkles is infectious. And I'm like,

440
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,120
yeah, he's right. For all that talk about me being like the treat treat king of the podcast.

441
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,000
Uh, I have a couple of treat indulgences. It's the candy at the movie theater and it's rainbow

442
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,440
sprinkles. I don't know why, although I'll tell you this, a two colored rainbow sprinkle approach

443
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,160
that I'd like is Halloween when they have purple and orange, my two favorite colors.

444
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,960
That's a hell of a combination of two colors. Yes. But you don't care for red and green. Yeah.

445
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,560
It doesn't do much for me. Yeah. They're very stuffy colors, you know, stodgy. They're my

446
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,640
parents' colors, purple and orange. Now those are fun. Those are exciting. I wanted to paint my room

447
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,840
those colors when I was a child. Did you? No, I wasn't. You just moved. You could do it today.

448
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:51,440
I could do it today. Live it up. I'm not going to though. Yeah. Yeah, actually that's not a good,

449
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,760
yeah. Uh, that wouldn't be a good vibe for a room, but to eat it and it's gone immediately. Hey,

450
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,120
I've got an idea. You're going to, you know, in the meantime, before the rides are open,

451
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:05,920
we're sending these characters around. Why not? I want them to, I want their costumes and uniforms

452
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,560
to be made of fondant so I can walk up to Captain America or Thor and take a bite out of his helmet.

453
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,600
They're a walking treat delivery mechanism. Yeah, that's good. I would, yeah, I'd like to take a

454
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:23,600
bite out of Agent Coulson's suit. Yeah. Clark Gregg's famous shield character's suit. That's

455
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,800
an interesting point. Well, there, will there be shield face characters in this land, which is just

456
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,840
people in suits and aviator glasses? I think there will be. I think there'll be escorting

457
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,280
the superheroes around. They're secret shoppers. They're like, they're actual armed security guards

458
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,960
in the park. Oh, sure. Oh yeah. Yeah. So you will, yeah, the secret police are shield agents. So if

459
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,880
you go, so in California adventure, there is no Disney jail. It's shield. You'll get thrown a

460
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,920
shield like jail. So what's the, uh, what's the prison out in the ocean? The Triskelion, the

461
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,320
Triskelion. No, wait, no, no, no, that's the, that's the shield headquarters. Jason, come on. Oh,

462
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,680
sorry. Yeah. That's shield headquarters. It's called like, um, it was in civil war or something

463
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,480
or like, let me Google jail from civil war. It does come up a lot of the vault. No, what is it?

464
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,320
It's like something like the vault or something. It's something lame. I feel like, wow, look what

465
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,440
I'm missing out on the raft, the raft, the raft. It's the jail where they, they put super villains

466
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,800
in like the middle of the ocean. So if they get out, there's just water everywhere. So they can't

467
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,520
get away. So you get to go there now. If you dump a soda on Daisy or something. Yeah. Yeah. You get

468
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,000
thrown in the raft, which is in the middle of, uh, the, the, uh, the, uh, to the paradise pier.

469
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,480
Yes. That's what I was going for. Thank you. I like, yeah. Big scary Lake jail. Yeah. Ooh.

470
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,720
All right. Yeah. Lake jail ride would be fun. Yeah. Or, or real, just a real,

471
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,840
somewhere where you go in there, where you got to like get somebody out or something.

472
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,480
It says, we shouldn't break out. We got to bust somebody. We got to bust, uh, uh, agent, uh,

473
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,120
Kobe smolders out. What's, uh, what's her name? I can't think of her character name either. Maria

474
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:05,280
Hill. Maria Hill. We got to bust Maria Hill out of here guys. We know all of these actual answers,

475
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,480
but we like audience participation. We like the listener to be shouting the answer to us. Yeah.

476
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,080
We're like leaving a space. Like we leave a space for a laugh or something. Right. Right.

477
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,520
So of course we know all these things, but yell the answers and then we'll say them right when

478
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,760
you get it. It's Friday morning in the car and someone's screaming Maria Hill. Yeah.

479
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,480
I swear to God, I will unsubscribe one of these days. Damn it. Uh, but you won't. You'll keep

480
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,200
coming back just like all these, uh, just like us Disneyland people paying for parking. Yeah, please.

481
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,880
All right. Well, you want to talk about, here's the, here's the segue. This is amazing. This is

482
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,920
the latest big, uh, Marvel's the latest big expansion coming to Disneyland. But the,

483
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,480
what I would say is the first major multi-attraction expansion. I would agree with that. In the park's

484
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,960
history, 1959, we get the submarine voyage, we get the monorail and we get the Matterhorn

485
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:04,240
bobsleds. Right. Three e-tickets at once. Yeah. I believe. I were. Necessitated the terminology.

486
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,040
Is that. Yeah. Uh, like they, there was not an e-ticket. Right. Up until that point. And then

487
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,440
they retroactively converted things to be, uh, uh, existing rides to become e-tickets. But yeah,

488
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,560
they invented a category. An original bleeding people dry move to convert older rides to e-tickets.

489
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so, uh, yeah, this was, this was, this was a big deal. And I realized the, uh,

490
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,240
this is the oldest attraction that we've talked about so far because we have not done any opening day

491
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:42,320
1955 attractions. I feel like we are so eighties, nineties skewing to where it's, it's like,

492
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:49,440
yeah, skip Mr. Toad, skip, uh, the castle, skip, uh, uh, where there are lasers in it. Yeah. Yeah.

493
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,560
Like where is there an 80? Like was there an embarrassing use of a band or an actor? Uh-huh.

494
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:01,440
Yeah. We got that. We're getting to food rocks so far ahead of Snow White's scary adventures.

495
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,680
Sure. Um, it shows where our leanings are, but Hey, the Matterhorn is a classic that has,

496
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,880
yeah, uh, survived the, uh, yeah, it's a, I feel like one of the, one of the primary parts of the

497
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,240
Disneyland experience. Sure. Striking, uh, visual when you come down to main, down main street,

498
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,920
you see a castle straight ahead of you. You see this Swiss mountain, uh, to the right, uh,

499
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,640
and exclusive to Disneyland. They never built the Matterhorn anywhere else. Expedition Everest,

500
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,400
kind of a spiritual sequel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Matterhorn five. But now there were attempts

501
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,560
because there was, there was always talk of it going into a Swiss pavilion at world showcase.

502
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:47,840
Yes. Yes. And, uh, and talk of also of a similar idea, but not exactly the same of Mount Fuji in

503
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Japan, um, which fell apart. With a Japanese bullet train kind of coaster ride. Yes. Oh,

504
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,680
would it have been a, uh, I don't know much more about the plan. I think theme too, like,

505
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,400
because train travel is such an important part of modern Japanese culture. It would have had an

506
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,560
element that is so constantly is so not trustworthy. Well, I don't know that the green's down.

507
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,200
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, uh, but there was going to be, it was, it was going to be sponsored by

508
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:20,320
Fuji film, but there was already a competing contract with Kodak, uh, in our beloved journey

509
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:26,320
into imagination. So, yeah, yeah. So it couldn't be two types of film. Thus Mount Fuji fell apart.

510
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,800
Uh, I also saw a rumor, I don't know how trustworthy it is that they wanted to try to do this at,

511
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,480
uh, Disney MGM studios and that it would, it would be justified as a film set. Oh, really?

512
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,800
Best way to water down and ruin any fun attraction. Uh, um, I, yeah, I don't know. I saw that,

513
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,080
and that was not super sourced, but, uh, right. So it is a rumor. So you want to talk eighties,

514
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:54,960
nineties stuff blank is a film set is like the ultimate justification or ultimate back story.

515
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,480
Yeah. The vast majority of rides built in the eighties and nineties. And ET of course,

516
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,000
the first incarnation was you're on the set of ET too. Yes. Which they bailed on. Right. Cause it's,

517
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,760
it is a bad, it's bad. People want to be there. They don't want to be acting.

518
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,560
Yeah. You want to live it. This idea that, well, I think this, this also has gone away with time

519
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,920
that like, what if you could be the star of a movie and we can all do this at home all the time.

520
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,000
They do have like green screen being explained to us. I feel like children just instinctually

521
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,440
understand how keying works so they can start making videos at age eight at this point. So,

522
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,200
I mean, that's something to ram into with the original fantasy land rides is like,

523
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,280
Oh, you're going to see everything from the lead characters perspective. And then everyone's like,

524
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,760
we want to see the lead characters in these rides. We want to see Peter Pan. We want to see snow

525
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:46,240
white. Yeah. So like that fixes would be made over time. That's a, that's a pretty correct,

526
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,200
uh, instinct, I think. And, uh, although there seems to be disagreement in general about if,

527
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,480
is the little mermaid ride good or not, but I think it's pretty exciting when you turn the corner

528
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,000
and there's Ariel and then the second appearance of Ariel in the, under the sea set. Like those are,

529
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,440
and they're all good animatronics. I feel. And, um, yeah, I'm glad they started putting characters

530
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,560
in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I mean, toad is awesome, but like, yeah, you're not, there's not a,

531
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,640
I'd like to see toad in tow. That's true. We, I don't know toad well enough to be toad.

532
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,760
Yeah. You, you are toad or you're riding with toad. You are toad.

533
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:30,240
Just as exciting as get recruited, uh, with those Twitter claps in between those words.

534
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:37,520
You are toad. Um, so also the first mountain. Hey, good point. The first Disney mountain,

535
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,760
which of course they would go on to brand mountains. Uh, I guess Everest then broke

536
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,080
from that tradition of there was space mountain, this big thunder mountain railroad. Uh, and the

537
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,080
other one that I'm forgetting, there's one more, right? Space mountain. Space. I said space. He

538
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,880
said space man wakes under, isn't there one more splash? Big thunder. Oh, splash. That's what I'm

539
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,000
at. Jeez. I'm losing my mind today. Uh, there was WrestleMania yesterday. So that's, oh yeah. Yeah.

540
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,920
You're still, you're still coming. Reeling from it. Uh, yeah. So this was the original mountain,

541
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,200
but not called Matterhorn bobsled mountain, but it's the first mountain, the first part of the

542
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,200
Disneyland mountain range. I remember thinking that was cool as a kid, that there's multiple

543
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,520
mountains. Um, which I guess is anything there's, there is kind of like a big rocky peak in

544
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,040
star wars galaxies edge, but this is not, I consider it a part of the mountain range,

545
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,640
but is there a specific name to that thing? Oh, we don't know yet. What's the Batu, what is Batu's

546
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,840
mountain range name? Is it, is it just the Batu mountains or is it like a, what do they call

547
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:43,040
mountains on Batu? Glyph, I don't know. Glyph, or anything. Probably Glyph. Yeah. I know how

548
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:55,920
star wars names work there. I just, I just shit one out. Therm Scissor Punch. You might know what the mountain range is called. Oh yeah, this is the first podcast in the wake of the announcement of Therm Scissor Punch. Yes, I'd say we're in a post scissor punch era.

549
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:05,280
AT after Therm. Yeah. What is, what is Therm, what character is Therm Scissor Punch? I don't know.

550
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,440
Kind of like a crab looking man. He's a crab man, but I don't know that he's going to be any more important than

551
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,680
like Constable Zuvio, who was a character announced for force awakens and then was not in the movie,

552
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:19,200
but he had a toy. Um, and everybody was having, everyone had, we, I mean, I had Constable Zuvio

553
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:27,760
fever before the movie came out and then he wasn't in it, which was very disappointing. Yeah. It was a very funny name. We spent a lot of money on healthcare because before movies come out, we have all these

554
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:36,400
fevers. I mean, we got Thanos fever right now. Uh huh. That's true. Uh, got a fallen kingdom fever. I can feel it in my veins.

555
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:52,640
I got, it's already out as we, as we, Elizabeth, I haven't gotten to see it and recover and recover from blocker fever. Sure. Yeah. That's my own fault though. I've, I've could have gotten checked out for that the last three days since Friday night, but I haven't done it.

556
00:51:52,640 --> 00:52:00,640
And we all, and of course we've said another podcast, Jason always get, catches bicentennial fever. Uh huh. Is that after Bicentennial land?

557
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:30,640
You've never been cured. You all, you always want more viewings. Yeah. You never want to win a sequel. Um, uh, no, you, I think you were fond of the, the, you've stated you were fond of the 1976. Yeah. Oh, yeah. 1776. American adventure. I think that joke was from the American adventure. That's a, I'm calling back here. I'm doing my best. If you're a listener for a while, that's a, and you like that joke, let me know on Twitter. Is it a funny, uh, stereotype about Jason's? Yeah. I think it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,

558
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:36,160
that he loves the bicentennial something to continue ripping him for how we have

559
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:44,880
nostalgia now for, uh, the hard rock park, which we've never been to. I have nostalgia for the bicentennial, which I was born, uh, nine years after.

560
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,120
I believe actually I made that comment. Now they think about it on the splash mountain episode.

561
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:57,040
You know, it's hard to remember exactly after you've been talking for hours, after you recorded hours and hours, it's hard to remember.

562
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:07,040
I don't remember a single thing in any of these and I just hope I don't insert insults, uh, personal friends or, uh, entire swaths of people.

563
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,720
I just hope I'm not being an offense. I guess I have. I do apologize to Nick Weiger in person. Oh, right.

564
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:21,320
For, yeah. Uh, I did do a brief Weiger voice. I implied that he liked a bird show. He was, and I said, oh, you know, like I was talking to him about it.

565
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:26,280
And I was like, ah, you know, we just, the voice, I'm sorry, man. He's like, oh, it's so, I won't do the voice here. I'm going to do.

566
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,200
Oh, do the voice. No, no, no. I'm going to say this is how he said, he said, well, no, no, everything's fine.

567
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,480
He said, uh, I'm just upset that you didn't like the bird show at medieval times.

568
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:45,480
Our joke about him was proven correct that he did like the bird. He really, yeah. He was, he said he was just thrown off cause he was upset that I, I shit on the bird part of the medieval time show where like they send a bird around the arena.

569
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:58,520
So if to track everybody's stereotypes within the world of this Nick Weiger friend of the pod loves birds and bird shows, Jason loves the bicentennial.

570
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:07,400
Right. The thing that I have a lot of fondness for that I didn't get to experience is the 1984 Olympics. I was born right after that.

571
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:25,800
It's a thing that gives me a lot of pride in Los Angeles. I feel like the vibe must've been really cool in LA and as exemplified by the music video, I love LA by Randy Newman in which the Matterhorn factors when he sings the lyric, look at those mountains, look at those trees.

572
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:41,480
It cuts to the Matterhorn and it's that whole video for me. I like it gives it's that eighties vibe. It's that post. It's that Olympics era LA pride. Uh, I don't know. I feel like things are on the move on the grow and you got Disneyland in there too.

573
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:54,520
Yeah. Uh, yeah. It's, it's great. The, and it made me fit when it cuts to that in the video, it makes me feel the way I felt as a kid going to Disneyland and seeing it on the freeway on the way. It's like the thing that lets you know you're, you're there.

574
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:09,400
Uh, the first landmark, I guess at Disneyland, you could see from the, from the five freeway. Right. And the excitement you get like, oh, yes, this means we're here. There's the Matterhorn. Right. Uh, that's the, I think the Monorail goes by it in the video too. Yes. I think it's like, so you get both for your money there.

575
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:29,160
And those things, those little moments are very exciting. The Matterhorn, uh, uh, you know, like all the, so many types of transportation go by the Matterhorn. You've got the, you've got the Monorail right there. The Alice ride is going back and forth, like the outdoor section of the Alice ride. And you used to have the Skyway going right through it.

576
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:43,960
Yeah, that looked so cool. Like I wish I could have written that. I mean, I rode the Skyway a lot in Florida and I loved it as it was a form of transportation. I loved it. I wrote it in Florida and I was scared shitless. I felt I was going to slide out and fall.

577
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:59,720
That's a very apparent, like reading about the Matterhorn and like I started reading about the Matterhorn and then went down a rabbit hole reading about the Skyway and accidentally started taking notes on the Skyway. And I went, oh no, we're doing Matterhorn episode. I don't need this.

578
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,920
Oh, you had too much Skyway.

579
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:27,480
I was like reading about the Skyway because that had like some, both of the, the Skyway, I feel like people are like, well, they shut that down because people died. No, they shut that down for like financial costs and some dipshit jumped out of it and tried to act like he fell out of it. And the case was dismissed. The Matterhorn, someone has died on. The Matterhorn was the cause of the first death in Disneyland in 1968.

580
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:39,640
Number one, I'm not sure what the tally is at this point. Is it like, whenever Snopes last weighed in on this subject, it was nine and two of those were the Matterhorn.

581
00:56:39,640 --> 00:57:01,080
I think that's right. And like a lot of the earlier ones or and even one or two of the later ones resulted in like, oh, sorry. 1964 was the accident that caused Disney's first fatality in 1984. Someone was, what is the word? Decapitated.

582
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,400
What is the word? What's that word? And your head falls off.

583
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:21,480
So, yeah, both of which, the story in both of them involves a lack of seat belts, seat belts, which you just hope is true and not something like when the accident happened, then some enter some Disney employee reached down, kind of like undid the thing.

584
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:36,840
See, no seat belt, no seat belt. I mean, there was someone killed on the people. But there's a few of the deaths where like teen hops out and started doing a goof and then lost their life, which is incredibly morbid. And this also, I think that.

585
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:55,800
Oh, sorry. Oh, I was going to say this touches on I think recently we have been talking about like some of the like lazy urban legends around Disney Park stuff and the my one of the most nails on the chalkboard for me is the one about like, well, you know, no one dies on the property.

586
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:07,640
They always like fake it off proper. They they move the body and it's like, come on, like that takes 30 seconds on Snopes to find if that is true or not. And very quickly, it's like, no, that's not true.

587
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:23,640
Also, there's usually a lot of witnesses. I don't know. I when I did the Universal tour, I was stuck outside of earthquake for an hour because there was a tram right in front of us that got stopped and we couldn't figure out for like half an hour what was going on.

588
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:35,000
And then paramedics showed up and turned out a guy had a heart attack during the earthquake attraction. And we found out the next day that he died, but he died not on the site.

589
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:46,040
And I always I don't want to go accusing my past employer or here we go. Future employer. But it certainly seemed a little odd to me that I guess so.

590
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:54,200
Maybe that sounds like true, but yeah, health and safety like lockdown, get the paramedics in. Jason is really trusting.

591
00:58:54,200 --> 00:59:02,200
You're toeing the line. I don't know. I just think it's like people use it as like really lazy like party small talk.

592
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:10,600
Well, if you're saying yeah. Hey, look, they're trying. They're at a party with you. They know you like Disney. They're trying to come up with something to tell you.

593
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:18,680
They're trying to impress you, man. They don't all know, not like our listeners, they don't know about parking fees and this, you know, the genuine stuff.

594
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:30,360
They shouldn't. But yeah, a lot. I guess a lot of the of the deaths are like somebody was horsing around or something and an accident happened.

595
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:37,160
I will say that I believe someone was jumping from people mover to people mover and then accident happened once.

596
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:46,040
But I was speaking with Bug Main about this and he said the pod entity known as Bug. Yeah, he said he used to do that.

597
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,760
Why? That was a thing he used to do is jump from people mover to people mover while it was moving.

598
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:56,200
Well, he's the ultimate bad boy. But that's where the ultimate good boys figure out how that would work in Cal.

599
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:01,000
Well, in Florida, the cars are open. Oh, OK. Yeah, I think that makes a little more sense.

600
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,560
I should reveal his location, I guess, but we already lived a couple of years ago.

601
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:13,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was literally because someone that was noted on Reddit somewhere, they just revealed Bug's location.

602
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:20,120
Sorry. The shield has found Bug. Agent Colson is going to Bug Main's whereabouts.

603
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:31,880
An urban legend. A thing about this ride that I was able to find was that like the story behind it goes that Disney, Walt Disney was in Switzerland because they were filming

604
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:39,880
a movie called Third Man on the Mountain, which I can only assume is one of those very dry live action movies that used to be so fond of making.

605
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,920
They wish it was an Apple dumpling gang. Yeah, exactly. Didn't ascend to the heights of Condor Man.

606
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:51,000
And he really liked the Matterhorn and he sent a postcard of it to Imagineer.

607
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:01,160
Vic Green. Vic Green and said, Vic, build this Walt, which to me, if I was working at Imagineering that that I would be worried about setting a precedent when I heard like,

608
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,840
oh, Walt's going out of town. It's like, oh, Jesus, where is he going to go this time?

609
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:09,320
Anytime he sees a thing, he just like build it. It's like, oh, God, he's going to the Grand Canyon.

610
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:14,360
Oh, jeez, we're going to have to figure out how to make the Grand. Shit. Walt's going to the Coliseum.

611
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:21,640
Yeah. Can he go somewhere easier? Antarctica. We have to build actual melting ice caps. Yeah.

612
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,600
The real polar bears to live on. Walt is in the Sphinx again.

613
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:39,560
Yeah. So that's pretty impressive that they sorted it out. And apparently the history or the story of putting this together was full of moments of this is physically impossible.

614
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:45,320
What you're asking for, Walt. And he said, figure it out. And they did. Yeah.

615
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:59,240
I guess when you this this I don't know, when you think about this being from 1959, a pretty impressive attraction for that time in its theming and its construction.

616
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,800
First steel coaster. Is that right? Yeah.

617
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:20,760
This is very crazy. There's some qualifier of it. Yeah. Of course, the themed like it was kind of it added more theming in the 70s. The themed caves and the abominable snowman were added in the 70s and then sort of plus up again in the 90s.

618
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:27,240
It's yeah, it seems like it was pretty spare initially. I couldn't find there wasn't there's no video of it, right? I didn't find it. I didn't see any.

619
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:35,560
Well, there is one video you can watch on which in which Walt Disney companies the shot, the Shah of Iran.

620
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:47,640
Oh, yeah. The Shah of Iran visit as the as the video itself says the narration and I quote, here is the Shah of Iran and his pretty empress in the front seat.

621
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:52,040
That's Walt says that. I don't know who said I think it's another minute.

622
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:59,240
I found the video line is and Walt Disney and the pretty hostess in the back. So, so it's yeah, I see him.

623
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:07,000
It was the old smaller car because they went from four to eight and the group of four is Disney and a hostess and the Shah of Iran and his wife.

624
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:14,520
And this is where the and I wrote this. This is where the original where you would have to have a person on your lap, essentially, while you were writing.

625
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:23,480
Yes. Yes. Similar to the the track layout for this, by the way, was used in Space Mountain in Florida.

626
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,880
It's the same layout. It's the same sort of it's same kind of toboggan.

627
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:31,320
It's not the same layout, right?

628
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:35,640
Yeah, sorry. I don't think the layout's the same, but the same sort of toboggan style track.

629
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:44,840
The Space Mountain in Anaheim is a different coast entirely. And this is a big thing for me about the Matterhorn and Space Mountain in Florida.

630
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:49,160
They're rough. That's a track is not aged well.

631
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,920
There's big old clunks that hurt your back. A good deal.

632
01:03:52,920 --> 01:04:01,880
Yeah. Yeah. Depend like when they there's a there's a couple of sudden drops on it and like you can get rocked and they they've done a little work to the track in the last few years.

633
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,960
And it didn't help that much.

634
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,160
It didn't like not a ton. There's still ones that are it's not like a thrilling drop.

635
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:13,640
It's a perfunctory little one. Like this is a yes.

636
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,920
Yeah. No one would like squeal from delight about it.

637
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,800
It's pure. Yes. Ouch. It's like because I was on Space Mountain in Florida and that does it.

638
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:31,000
The cars both both on Space Mountain in Florida and on Matterhorn also really feel like you're exposed a little more than the Space Space Mountain in Disneyland.

639
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,760
You feel really taken care of. There's a lot of space on the sides. You got a lot of room on that seat compared to other things.

640
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,120
It's a bigger car. You kind of feel rushing at you.

641
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:44,600
The wind like air conditioning shot at you to make you feel like you're going faster.

642
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,360
I feel comforting and you just like air conditioning.

643
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,400
And about I guess this might come up before, but you were talking about not liking Wild Mouse coasters.

644
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,480
And this is more in the vein of what I think sort of inspired by Wild Mouse.

645
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:57,800
Yes.

646
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:02,520
Which are just kind of more clunky or messy.

647
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,200
Feels like they could fall apart. Yeah.

648
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,760
It seems like more low rent and janky.

649
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,360
It feels like you're just like sitting in a little tiny chair.

650
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:14,040
Like it doesn't feel it feels like your whole body is exposed.

651
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:18,200
Whereas on Space Mountain in Disneyland, it feels like you're sitting in a proper little car.

652
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:23,560
Like this just feels like you're kind of sitting on a little sheet of like metal and that's it.

653
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,400
There's nothing on the sides. Sure.

654
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,880
It feels like your body is that's why it feels like your body can just fly out at any moment.

655
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:30,120
Yeah.

656
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:34,200
And it was closed for six months in 2015 to like, you know,

657
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:39,080
gusty up some projection effects inside and put in a new abominable snowmen.

658
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,640
And I thought like, oh, it's going to come back.

659
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,560
It's going to be a real smooth ride.

660
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,240
And I'm like, I think it got worse.

661
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,800
I think it got rougher or maybe I'm just getting older.

662
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,600
When I was a kid, I loved like the shaky roller coaster.

663
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,000
I was I, I, I didn't care.

664
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,120
I didn't care if it was rough.

665
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,000
I think because my spine, please.

666
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,560
Yeah.

667
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,800
I think the coasters, I, a lot of the coasters I went on when I was young were like wooden

668
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,400
coasters and some of them very old.

669
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:09,240
Like I was terrified of going upside down, but I would ride the shakiest wooden coasters

670
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,680
like again and again.

671
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,840
Which I wouldn't describe my responses things now as being afraid of them.

672
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,040
Like I'm not afraid of them.

673
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:16,440
Okay.

674
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:16,760
Okay.

675
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,560
All right.

676
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,120
No, one time.

677
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:18,760
Calm down.

678
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,080
Calm down.

679
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,680
Don't suggest that with your eyes.

680
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,640
Fair enough.

681
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,120
No, I don't.

682
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:22,600
Yeah.

683
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,560
There are a lot of rides you, yeah, you feel like you want to avoid just cause it'll be

684
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:31,640
literally unpleasant and not like the experience of it is not fun enough to counteract.

685
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:37,480
Although I will say I, I will still do the Matterhorn and I think the plus ups that they

686
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:42,600
did a couple of years ago got it back in my rotation of I will tend to do it when I go.

687
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:47,000
I really like it, but I know I'm going to need a minute or two after I get off.

688
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:53,320
It is a, it is one of the only rides at the both parks where if it, well, like I'm about

689
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,920
to say this now, I think it's not true.

690
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,040
I was going to say that the guy could go, Hey, you want to go on it again?

691
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:01,800
And I go, I'm going to need five minutes before I got to get out and get back on.

692
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:05,640
That being said, I feel like even if I, my spine was rocked and a man made an offer to

693
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,960
go on another ride without waiting in line, I'd go, all right.

694
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:08,760
Yeah.

695
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,160
Yeah.

696
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:09,720
So nevermind.

697
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,120
Maybe that's wrong, but it is in the moment.

698
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,080
It does feel like one, it feels like one ride is enough.

699
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,840
I don't need to go on this twice.

700
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,720
I see what you're saying.

701
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,120
Yeah.

702
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,120
I need a little, as Jason said, recovery.

703
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:25,400
I, we don't go on a lot because Lindsay hates it because of how hard it is on her spine.

704
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,200
Yes.

705
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,240
A valid reason.

706
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,600
And it was even weirder.

707
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:33,720
I feel like when they had the old cars, cause you'd have to sit with someone in your lab.

708
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:38,840
I mean, you don't have to, but if you had a significant other, uh, maybe from a different

709
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,320
relationship that had to sit in your, like it was weird.

710
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,760
Like you, you felt like you, like it's very weird.

711
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,560
It's very intimate.

712
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,000
They were just hitting into you guys.

713
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,960
It's very intimate.

714
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:48,520
Yeah.

715
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:54,920
I have a, I have a story about the lap seating, which is that I went, so I went to Disneyland

716
01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:01,960
in high school with my, uh, my then girlfriend, my high school girlfriend and her mother who was

717
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:07,160
very, very overprotective, perhaps psychotically.

718
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,760
So like just a degree that was, that was very crazy.

719
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:15,080
And context, I don't know if this is important, but it was a long distance relationship.

720
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:21,960
So we would only get like little stints of time together, always under very close supervision

721
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,320
of this mother.

722
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:28,840
And, uh, you know, but, but Disneyland's a fun place to go because you got, you got little,

723
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:33,640
like little quiet parts where you could sneak a little make out in, you know, the haunted

724
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,360
mansion though.

725
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:38,200
That's, that's, that's, those cars almost have sides and it's dark.

726
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,760
And, uh, at some point the, you know, like, like I think I remember we got on the haunted

727
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,400
mansion.

728
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,920
We kind of like dashed forward.

729
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:50,680
So we'd have some distance from the, which, but then you got to think, this is where it

730
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,880
was helpful for me to know all the stuff so well, because I was like, okay, we have to

731
01:08:53,880 --> 01:09:01,400
stop this, uh, this slight make out during Madam Leota because you see everyone else.

732
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:01,720
Yes.

733
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:01,960
Yeah.

734
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,120
Yeah.

735
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:02,360
Yeah.

736
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,360
It's a fun, the lighting's pretty decent in there.

737
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:08,040
So, you know, we had to save it up for the big, you know, the big make out moments, like

738
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,440
when you're going down the hill into the graveyard.

739
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:14,200
Uh, so this is where it's, it's practical and beneficial to know.

740
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,240
Oh, these are good tips.

741
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,000
I'm surprised you waited this long on the podcast.

742
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,600
They give us these great make out tips.

743
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,560
Hey, yeah.

744
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,280
Uh, yeah.

745
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:24,040
Any enterprising, any enterprising youngsters.

746
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:24,280
Yeah.

747
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:29,160
Let me tell you, I've made out in all the great places at Disneyland, the haunted mansion,

748
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:29,800
the end.

749
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,120
I think there is no other place actually, right?

750
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,280
Because like, yeah, you don't have the, you don't have the.

751
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,720
You don't have that car privacy.

752
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,440
I guess maybe now Little Mermaid.

753
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,640
Omni movers are make out spots.

754
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,400
Zephyr, not happening.

755
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,360
No, no, no.

756
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:49,320
Uh, and the, you know, the swings, you can't, uh, you know, that you're, that your partner's

757
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,520
too far away from you.

758
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,800
That feels very wholesome.

759
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,360
If you, if you got a private Ferris wheel car, that's a make out spot.

760
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,800
Especially a wobbly one.

761
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,600
Oh yeah.

762
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:03,560
Uh, well, you know, cause maybe she like, she falls into your arms in a playful fashion.

763
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,440
Yeah, but you gotta be careful.

764
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,960
You could chip it too if there's something too, if that car is too swinging.

765
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,120
Hey, exercise caution too guys.

766
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,520
Uh, hey, make out safe out there.

767
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:18,840
Um, anyway, it did certainly occur to me, oh, this is a, hey, the Matterhorn is a spot

768
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,520
where you got that lap seating.

769
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:20,840
Oh.

770
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,520
Maybe on that lift hill.

771
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,440
Uh, I do what?

772
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,000
I don't know.

773
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,720
Oh my, yeah.

774
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,520
The hug her.

775
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,000
I don't know what the plan was exactly.

776
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,400
Right.

777
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,080
And so this was in the back of my head.

778
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:36,440
However, we're in the Matterhorn line and, uh, uh, she and I are talking and, uh, just

779
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,680
started laughing about something unrelated.

780
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:42,440
And then the mom, there, there'd been this tension for the entire visit, probably knowing

781
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,240
we're sneaking out, sneaking these haunted mansion makeouts in.

782
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:49,960
There'd been this tension and then she says, and I'll go a little close, Mike, and just

783
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:55,160
be at the clip that she was at, which is she just not looking at us staring at the ground.

784
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:58,600
Her mother says, I know what you two are laughing about.

785
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,160
You're looking forward to being in each other's laps.

786
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,160
Well, let me tell you something.

787
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,240
I've got, I've got news for you.

788
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,760
It is not happening.

789
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,760
I will have my eyes glued on you from right behind you.

790
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:16,840
Why this is the sort of helicopter overbearing parent I would expect in the movie blockers.

791
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:21,160
That's why I'm dying to see it.

792
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,000
I want to see those people get lampooned.

793
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,240
Like they, I have first, I can relate to this.

794
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,520
I've had blockers in my life.

795
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:32,280
This is very funny because like I, I, uh, uh, yeah, it was a real dorky kid growing up,

796
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:37,240
but my parents were pretty like, they weren't, uh, uh, obnoxious.

797
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:43,400
Like they, I would stay out to like one or two, I think because they realized like, uh,

798
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:50,360
well, he just did a play and we've met the other dorks who also did this play.

799
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:55,720
Uh, so yeah, I don't think we got to worry about this.

800
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:01,960
One, uh, but I did, there was like, I had two or three friends who was like, parents

801
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,960
were like, yeah, that weird Robert De Niro meet the parents.

802
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,560
I got my eye on you.

803
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,560
Yeah.

804
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,200
And it's just like, it's very funny to me when that happens and it's like, you see the

805
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,360
kids and they're all fucking dorks.

806
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,360
Yeah.

807
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,360
Yeah.

808
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,360
What are you, what are you worried about here?

809
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:22,840
Oh, and especially in a, like, look, I am not going to impregnate her on the ride.

810
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,840
Yeah.

811
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,640
There is no, I don't know what exactly you were.

812
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:30,960
Being a little more hands off, you're at the safest place on earth.

813
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,960
You're at like Disneyland.

814
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,760
Well, and there's a way, not the Matterhorn.

815
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,760
Well, no.

816
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,760
Yeah.

817
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,520
Look there, you know, she could have, she certainly could have done that and she could

818
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,520
have even played it off.

819
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,840
Hey, hey, I'll be watching you instead.

820
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:50,960
This like odd internalized monologue done in this scary, breathy way.

821
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,120
And we still had about half hour, a half hour more of line to go.

822
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,120
Wow.

823
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,480
And we just kind of, we're all in silence until this occurred.

824
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,080
So was she in the mom's lap?

825
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,400
How did it work?

826
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:06,680
I think I was still, strangely I was still allowed the lap time, but with the warning

827
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:12,400
that I would be under supervision, which obviously there's a lot of cameras watching you as well.

828
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:19,800
So I also was a real smart ass kid and was raised by at least one smart ass.

829
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,320
I guess both my parents are a little smart ass.

830
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,120
They wouldn't be even more than the other, but I definitely in that situation would have

831
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,520
gone like, what does that mean?

832
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:34,000
Like I would have tried to cut the tension with like a well-placed joke and failed miserably.

833
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,520
Mike has seen me do this where I'm like, I'm going to call out exactly what's happening

834
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,000
and it just makes it worse.

835
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I have seen you do that.

836
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,560
I feel like I've seen like, say what it was and if we have to cut it out, we'll cut it

837
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,560
out.

838
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,560
I don't remember.

839
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,040
I just mean like in social situations, like I will go like, well, this is going great.

840
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,760
Like when something uncomfortable happens.

841
01:13:53,760 --> 01:14:00,240
Well, you did that when Minnie was harassing Mike, which didn't help anything.

842
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:04,400
I yelled, oh nice.

843
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,400
Hell yeah.

844
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,200
That's loud for everyone in the library here.

845
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,200
But yeah.

846
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,000
Damn baller move.

847
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
That is very funny.

848
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:20,300
Now I seeing from that young lady's mother's perspective, I will admit there is nothing

849
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:25,920
scarier as an adult than teenagers laughing and you don't know what they're laughing about

850
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,600
and they're looking in your direction.

851
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,960
That is like, oh no, I'm going to get bullied by kids.

852
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,600
I know what you're like.

853
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,160
I look foolish.

854
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,280
Just on the street.

855
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,280
I know.

856
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,280
Yeah.

857
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:41,040
Nothing like, and I don't mean this isn't even recent that I'm in my thirties.

858
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:45,840
I think when I was 22, I was terrified of teens laughing.

859
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,440
It took me no time to get past.

860
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,240
There's no people I want the acceptance of more than teens.

861
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,640
I want teens to like me when I walk by teens on the street.

862
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,840
I'm like, I think they would think I was cool.

863
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:57,840
I don't know.

864
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:04,680
But I also am scared, scared and I admire them and scared of them.

865
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:08,760
It's sort of like, like on the 30 rock joke where like Tina Fey's outside of a building

866
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,600
and she goes, ah, youths.

867
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,400
And like some kids just walk by.

868
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,400
They're not really doing anything.

869
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,240
They just walk by and she's scared of them.

870
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,240
Something unnerving about it.

871
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:21,400
I've never felt comfortable with teens, not before I was one, not while I was one.

872
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,400
Oh, no.

873
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,400
Not after being one.

874
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,400
No, I don't know that.

875
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,840
Maybe it's add maybe it's a longing because I've never been young.

876
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,840
I don't think I've ever felt like a young.

877
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,840
I've never felt.

878
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,160
I never felt like the correct age that I am.

879
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,280
Yes, I agree.

880
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,680
Do you think are there teenagers listening to this?

881
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,680
Oh, yeah.

882
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,480
And now I'm thinking about it.

883
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:45,880
And like, do they like it the way we intend or are they laughing at us?

884
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,280
Is it a long con?

885
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,480
Are they making fun of us while listening to it for two hours?

886
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:59,040
Listen to us while you eat the Tide Pods and like before you put on a little Xan track.

887
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,040
Is that what you guys write?

888
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,040
Was it Xan?

889
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,040
Like little Xan?

890
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,040
Yeah, like Xanax.

891
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,040
Oh, that's his name.

892
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,040
OK.

893
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,040
That's what he's short for.

894
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,040
I think I was thinking it was Xan.

895
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,040
He's in a Twitter feud right now with my friend.

896
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,040
Pass guest John Daly.

897
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,040
Pass guest John Daly.

898
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,040
Boy, John learned a real lesson about.

899
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,080
John sure learned not to mess with teens.

900
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,480
Hey, it's what he gets for nothing.

901
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,040
But I mean, John Daly feuding with a little Xan.

902
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,200
It was reported on.

903
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,200
There was an article in Stereogum.

904
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,560
This is worthy of a headline, apparently.

905
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,560
Thank you.

906
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,160
Well, we look most of our guests are good.

907
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,960
We podcast the ride is no beef with little Xan.

908
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,560
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,560
We love it.

910
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,560
Thank you for listening.

911
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,560
Yeah.

912
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,560
Thank you.

913
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,560
Thank you.

914
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,640
I think the thing about the podcast, say it's these super cool, really self aware guys who

915
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,360
love Lil Xan and also theme parks.

916
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,320
But mainly they just there's just more to talk about the various.

917
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,160
But we love Lil Xan more than theme parks.

918
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

919
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,160
Yeah, absolutely.

920
01:16:55,160 --> 01:17:03,160
Well, three cool dudes with real normal body shapes, real regular who know where all the

921
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,600
cool make out spots are in Disneyland.

922
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,600
Yeah.

923
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:11,680
And you know, think your parents are giving you way too much grief.

924
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:17,080
Look, there might not be a world left for you to be adults in the way things are going.

925
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,080
So have fun now.

926
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,080
Yeah.

927
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,080
Come on.

928
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,080
Enjoy treats while you can.

929
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,080
Yeah.

930
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,560
Although that's been every generation thinks they'll be the last generation.

931
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,880
You know, that's why all those fifties greasers were drag racing all the time.

932
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,560
Oh, they had their wishes.

933
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:34,240
Well, I mean, they lived in the era of like duck and cover because a nuclear bomb will

934
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,680
be dropped on their like Poe Dunk High School.

935
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,320
Well, I mean, and this and this is a very teen friendly reference.

936
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:43,680
Of course, the Wilco song, Jeff Tweedy says that and when he's singing, he says every

937
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,160
generation thinks it's the last.

938
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,160
Oh, yeah.

939
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:51,880
So if you teens love rock, dad rockers, Wilco, I know it's kind of they're kind of like the

940
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,120
rock equivalent of Zan.

941
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,520
They pay for the laws.

942
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,520
Sure.

943
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,520
You got to pay respect to the elders.

944
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,520
They're still rock.

945
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,280
I mean, I had Yankee Hotel Fox terow when I was in high school.

946
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,280
I remember listening to that.

947
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,280
Sure.

948
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,280
I remember listening to the S.A.T.s.

949
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,280
Yeah, 2001.

950
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,280
Yeah.

951
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,640
You don't hate all music, Jason.

952
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,640
No, I don't.

953
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,560
No, I don't hate all music.

954
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,320
You just get mad when we're talking about Denny Lane.

955
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:16,440
Yeah, I just get confused or I lose.

956
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,440
Well, it is true.

957
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,240
Well, like Marvel, you two know a lot about that.

958
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,240
Exactly.

959
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:25,680
Yeah, we we know a lot about like you have a lot of like air because you're also a big

960
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,560
wrestling guy, but I'm not as big of a wrestling guy.

961
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,320
But you Monday are big wrestling guy.

962
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:32,560
You've got to like you've got a lot of like quadrants, I guess.

963
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,760
And some you cross over with most of them, Jason.

964
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:39,040
Yeah, I'm a day tripper and some of some of them.

965
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,040
That's a music reference.

966
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,040
Oh, yeah.

967
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,040
What?

968
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:46,680
Let me let me keep with the parental theme a little bit, which I have another story from

969
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:52,640
my also involving like in-laws, my wife's dad in the probably in the 60s.

970
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,780
I'm not sure if it was a grad night or just a regular day at Disneyland.

971
01:18:55,780 --> 01:19:02,640
But in the time when the Skyway passed through the Matterhorn, he was he was a no good kid

972
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:09,640
and he threw a cherry bomb into the Matterhorn from the Skyway and felt pretty pretty pleased

973
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:10,640
with himself.

974
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,120
Like, wow, I got away with it.

975
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,200
No no PA announcement was made.

976
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:17,560
I made it and then got to the Skyway station.

977
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:23,120
And as he gets closer and closer sees like several security guards arms folded and he

978
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,740
just he knows what it is.

979
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:25,960
He just surrenders immediately.

980
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,240
All right, where are we going?

981
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,440
Kicked out of the park.

982
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:32,920
Now, see, that's very much a sign of the times because at the time that was like, oh, Dennis

983
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,920
the Medis.

984
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,920
And now that would be like, oh, ISIS.

985
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,560
Now you'd be reading about that.

986
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,240
That would be an LA Times article.

987
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,040
He'd be thrown in the raft with Baron Zemo.

988
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,040
No, Mike.

989
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,640
Hey, that's just the world we live in.

990
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,480
I'll bust you out, Mike.

991
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,480
Mike being the dad.

992
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,960
Yeah, not me.

993
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:52,960
Yeah.

994
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,680
Important clarification, glad I made it.

995
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,680
Yeah.

996
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:01,320
So look, a lot of opportunity to get up to some no good stuff on this ride, whether it's

997
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:06,120
making out or throwing bombs or getting decapitated.

998
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:10,360
Whatever your teen interest is, the Matterhorn can satisfy.

999
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:14,360
You know, we've mentioned like this ride has been plussed up over the years.

1000
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:18,720
Like it always had like, yeah, it's a ride that toboggan ride through the Swiss Alps,

1001
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,720
through the Matterhorn.

1002
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:24,120
And you know, eventually the Bomber Bull Snowman got added.

1003
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:30,840
One detail that was added in the 90s was the crate labeled Wells Expeditions, which is

1004
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:37,560
a tribute to the late Frank Wells, who along with Michael Eisner and it was Jeffrey Katzenberg,

1005
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:42,720
right, were often cited as like the great, the three executives that like kind of brought

1006
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:46,120
the Disney company back to life.

1007
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:52,360
Frank Wells often credited as like the level one, the peacekeeper and things sort of seemingly

1008
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:57,680
took a dive after he passed away because he died in 1994 or something.

1009
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:03,200
And that was when the classic movie era kind of ended and people started to get mad at

1010
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:07,120
Eisner and he would play peacekeeper.

1011
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:12,940
I guess was the role he fell into Eisner and Katzenberg and probably other entities.

1012
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:18,080
And he was an avid skier and in fact died in a helicopter crash during a ski trip.

1013
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:23,360
So I mean, and then they put this crate in as a tribute that year.

1014
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,480
But like to me, like I get it, it makes sense as a tribute, but it does seem very morbid

1015
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,200
to me that it's like, well, yeah, but he also died.

1016
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,920
It wasn't a casket though.

1017
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,280
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1018
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,720
So wasn't bones flying.

1019
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,120
He had been eaten by the snowman.

1020
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,620
Although that would be cool.

1021
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:43,320
If there were a bunch of bones lying around.

1022
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,160
Oh, you mean like if you died, that was the way?

1023
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,160
Yeah.

1024
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,160
Yeah, that would be cool.

1025
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:50,400
With like some shreds of orange and purple.

1026
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,600
Yeah, I was eating an ice cream cone and the Yeti came by and he wanted a larger snack

1027
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,600
than that.

1028
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:00,200
Or if I was covered in sprinkles, the Yeti covered me in sprinkles and ate me like an

1029
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,200
ice cream cone.

1030
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,480
The Yeti, I didn't know the Yeti performed ironic deaths.

1031
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,480
Yes, he does.

1032
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,480
He's smart and you give him credit for it.

1033
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,680
Wait, he's not the Yeti though, correct?

1034
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,080
He's the abominable snowman.

1035
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,800
Yes, the Yeti is Expedition Everest.

1036
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,800
Yes.

1037
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:20,040
And the abominable snowman was added in 1978.

1038
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:25,280
They weren't abominable, strange by the way.

1039
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:29,120
Not often used outside and I feel like probably a lot of kids mispronounced that word.

1040
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,960
I'm not sure I would have said it correctly.

1041
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:37,480
I probably know the word now better because that's the company that made our special lords

1042
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,480
of synth.

1043
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,480
Thanks guys.

1044
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,480
That's some abominable.

1045
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,480
I did make that.

1046
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:45,160
But I think I probably said like a domina balls.

1047
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:50,040
I think I said it wrong until lords of synth sent the genuine project of mine.

1048
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,040
Not just a fan.

1049
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,720
Yeah, there's no character who hypothetically made it.

1050
01:22:54,720 --> 01:23:00,680
Yeah, I learned to say abominable but that's a very confusing word.

1051
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,440
Do we know the definition of it and why it's associated with snowmen?

1052
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,720
That's a good question.

1053
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:05,720
What is the technical?

1054
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:06,720
I mean, I'll look it up.

1055
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:07,720
Horrifying, scary?

1056
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,720
Abominable, yeah.

1057
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,720
It sounds like notorious.

1058
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,720
Oh yeah.

1059
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,280
Like the unsinkable.

1060
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,760
Causing moral revulsion.

1061
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,880
Whoa, see that's heavier than I thought.

1062
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,880
That's what I'm saying.

1063
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:20,880
So he's like a creep.

1064
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:21,880
He's like a deviant.

1065
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:22,880
It also says very bad or unpleasant.

1066
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,200
The deviant snowman.

1067
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,280
That's why the mom was mad.

1068
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,960
She knew that deviant snowman was going to be watching us.

1069
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:29,960
Oh yeah.

1070
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,960
Watching me touch over the shirt.

1071
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,960
That pervert snowman.

1072
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:37,800
Because before they changed out the animatronic, he did have like five cigarettes in his mouth

1073
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:42,880
and he had a jug with three X's on it and a bunch of porno mags in his hand.

1074
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,960
And his bright red eyes bugged out like the mask wolf.

1075
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:54,280
And the reason he made the ride so bumpy was so you'd have extra fun in the seats.

1076
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,480
It was like that curb episode where Larry is the car that shakes the people in the passenger

1077
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,480
seat.

1078
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:00,480
You have orgasms.

1079
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:05,240
You know what I'm talking about.

1080
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,440
I forgot to mention this.

1081
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:10,480
This is a perfect, this would have been a perfect segue when we were talking about your

1082
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,440
romantic life as a teen.

1083
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,800
But apparently there was just a big pile of dirt.

1084
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,440
This is in the Wikipedia.

1085
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,440
Before it was built.

1086
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,360
So during the construction of the park there was dirt from the excavation of Sleeping Beauty's

1087
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:27,040
Castle and it was like just piled up in between Fantasyland and Tomorrowland and it was dubbed

1088
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,040
Holiday Hill.

1089
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,040
Just a bunch of dirt.

1090
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,800
It was just a bunch of dirt.

1091
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,840
Walt tried to frame like it was something that was supposed to be there.

1092
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:35,840
Right.

1093
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,800
But they didn't know, they didn't have a place to put this dirt.

1094
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,440
And they started, I don't want to interrupt, but I read that they started putting plants

1095
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:48,560
and stuff on there because otherwise dirt would just whip around in the wind.

1096
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,040
Because it was just a big pile of dirt it would just fly off and hit guests in the eye.

1097
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:58,120
So they had to start retroactively landscaping this pile that they called Holiday Hill.

1098
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:02,080
So they, yeah, so they were having like they wanted people like picnic on it.

1099
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,400
So you could go and eat your lunch or whatever there.

1100
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:09,400
But the hill had come to be used primarily as a nighttime lovers lane.

1101
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,880
Ooh, a lovers lane.

1102
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:15,760
Yeah and Disneyland, they were not pleased about this.

1103
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:23,680
And by that they made this, whatever the source of this, it means like it happened twice.

1104
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,560
There were two occasions and that's enough to make it an urban legend that like, there

1105
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,240
were Holiday Hill babies.

1106
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:36,360
There's a similar thing also about the hill which is when they started growing plants

1107
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:43,200
and trees and shrubs that supposedly a Disney gardener started planting a different kind

1108
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,200
of plant.

1109
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,200
Oh really?

1110
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,200
A little marijuana plant.

1111
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,200
Wow.

1112
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,200
Holiday Hill.

1113
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,200
Yeah, yeah, Holiday Hill was the place for you.

1114
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,480
Oh boy, if only I'd been 16 in 1957.

1115
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:59,940
You'd get to get high and then go neck with your best gal.

1116
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:04,280
Talk about my burgeoning communist viewpoints.

1117
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,400
And if Jason were around back then, he would just be having a picnic alone and screaming

1118
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,520
at everyone to knock off the nonsense.

1119
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,000
Stop rustling.

1120
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,520
My picnic basket is falling off the hill.

1121
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,040
I'm perceiving everything a lot more intensely because of this plant for some reason.

1122
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,240
I guess you would be high.

1123
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:25,200
I'd be high but also cranky has happened often in the past.

1124
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:29,920
Because too many too many greasers would be necking with their poodle skirt wearing girlfriends.

1125
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,920
That's true.

1126
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:35,560
They're saying a loud, loud rustle of poodle, poodle cotton.

1127
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,520
Poodle skirts and crispy leather.

1128
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:42,320
Hey, here's an urban legend that is not an urban legend.

1129
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,320
It is a true fact.

1130
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:49,720
There is a cast member made half bath cabal court in the top of the Matterhorn.

1131
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:55,200
It's kind of been shifted around once or twice but it is sort of like an area because there

1132
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:59,760
used to be and there are now again, although I haven't seen them in a while, live climbers

1133
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,360
like costumed mountain climbers would climb up and down this mountain.

1134
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,360
Yes, I love those climbers.

1135
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,360
Has that happened in a long time?

1136
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,360
No.

1137
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,360
They brought it back in 2012.

1138
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,360
Yes.

1139
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,360
But I don't know recently.

1140
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,360
We were there in 2012.

1141
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,920
I was there with my family in 2012 and they were there and they were waving to us.

1142
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,560
It is so much fun seeing these people in little outfits.

1143
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,560
Yeah.

1144
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,560
Oh, that's another.

1145
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,440
I was saying all the different types of transportation are going by the Matterhorn.

1146
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:30,120
Also, the fact that you'd have people propelling down the hill and it's a whole other thing

1147
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,240
but Tinkerbell flying down during the fireworks show.

1148
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:39,320
What the Matterhorn did in terms of providing this exciting hub and this really unique odd

1149
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,960
feature to the park.

1150
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,280
Very visually pleasing.

1151
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:45,600
A lot of kinetic energy they talk about.

1152
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,840
One of my favorite reference points on this show, Devlin the White City, the famous landscape

1153
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:56,080
architect who designed the Chicago World's Fair was very conscious of having kinetic

1154
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,080
movements.

1155
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:03,720
So like boats and people crossing on different walkways and boats going through canals and

1156
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,720
stuff.

1157
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:11,480
He realized it was very visually pleasing and sort of that extra oomph than just like

1158
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:14,080
your regular city park or something.

1159
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,200
And Disney, it is noticeable in theme parks.

1160
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:20,920
Yeah, Monorail going by, the main street vehicles and stuff.

1161
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,440
I feel like I notice when it's not there.

1162
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,560
I like it Epcot.

1163
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,840
There's the boats that go across World Showcase.

1164
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:34,640
But it was a real disappointment to me after the first once or twice I had been to Islands

1165
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:38,800
of Adventure when the boats that would take you from the port of entry to Jurassic Park,

1166
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,880
they only ran for a little while.

1167
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,480
And I thought that was very cool and very cool to look out and see these kind of like

1168
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,320
junk boat looking things.

1169
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,320
They're gone.

1170
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,760
They have not been there for many years.

1171
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,040
They don't do the boats anymore?

1172
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,320
Or is it a different boat?

1173
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,320
At Islands?

1174
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,320
Yeah.

1175
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,320
There's nothing.

1176
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,320
Yeah, there's nothing.

1177
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,320
Really?

1178
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,320
Yeah.

1179
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,560
I don't think there was ever boats in Universal Studios Florida because that always had nighttime

1180
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,560
shows going.

1181
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:06,840
I wish there were boats in the water in California Adventure too, although that I guess has not

1182
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,880
been possible for a long time now with World of Color.

1183
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:13,480
If there was even something, yeah, I guess can you not even pilot anything through there?

1184
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:19,720
Even if you couldn't get in the lake, if there were jet skiers or something going by, that'd

1185
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,720
be kind of fun.

1186
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:21,720
Yeah, that would be great.

1187
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,080
Yeah, I love a jet ski.

1188
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,080
Sure.

1189
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,640
I mean, you know, you just want to feel like the hustle and bustle of whatever fake town

1190
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:28,640
or fake land.

1191
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:30,520
Like you want to feel like people are going to work.

1192
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,520
People are doing things.

1193
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,520
Makes this feel like a real place would feel because I'm never going to any real place.

1194
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,680
No, yeah, we're not going to the real Matterhorn.

1195
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:41,520
And we're not going to a real basketball court.

1196
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,200
You just like knowing that there is one fake mountain.

1197
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:51,600
No, you're not in any of the two dozen social basketball leagues.

1198
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,400
Los Angeles comedians are in.

1199
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,400
Yes, true.

1200
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,720
No documentary about our basketball playing.

1201
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:02,360
No, but yeah, what else about this?

1202
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:06,920
Well, the basketball court is interesting because I feel like that was a that's like

1203
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:14,320
one of those first pieces of Disneyland nerddom that you that you sort of hook on to.

1204
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:18,600
That's one of those first things that you can drop, you know, on a date at the park

1205
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:25,760
or something and feel out if the person is annoyed by facts like that or or into them.

1206
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,760
Yeah.

1207
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,120
It's one of those like entry level pieces of trivia that I always thought was really

1208
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,120
neat.

1209
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:36,880
I feel like the actual court you now I think Disney now is like they've just filmed the

1210
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,000
you can see it in a video or something.

1211
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,200
And it's not I think I think I always imagined it was like a really polished, like nice gym,

1212
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,280
like a Chicago Bulls practice.

1213
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,280
Yeah.

1214
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,280
Oh, yeah.

1215
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:54,280
Like, yeah, like shiny and kept up and that maybe like if if like a high profile talent

1216
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:59,680
if like Kobe needs somewhere private to practice, he could work out a deal to go use the but

1217
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,800
in fact, it's just it looks like an attic or something.

1218
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,320
It's just plywood with a rim.

1219
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:07,040
You can play like course up there, but you probably can't even have a game.

1220
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,040
I don't think.

1221
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,040
Or can you?

1222
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,040
Is it?

1223
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,040
It's a half court game.

1224
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,040
Is it a half court?

1225
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,040
I've seen it described as a quarter court.

1226
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,040
That's what I thought.

1227
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,040
Yeah.

1228
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,040
Even a little bit smaller.

1229
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,040
You can get a whole.

1230
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,040
Yeah, I think you could.

1231
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:20,080
Yeah, you could have a little little fun up there.

1232
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,360
And I think that's neat.

1233
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:27,680
Being that that's the case, the top of the Matterhorn is only used for that.

1234
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,920
And as you said, that's kind of the basketball court's like a kind of a break lounge for the

1235
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,560
mountain climbers.

1236
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:39,360
Other than that, that's the only people who go up to the top because the ride stops kind

1237
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:42,920
of I think 80 feet of the way up.

1238
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,200
It's a very tall structure.

1239
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:48,160
The Matterhorn is what I'm saying, but the only the bottom half essentially is used for

1240
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:49,160
the actual ride.

1241
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:50,160
Yeah.

1242
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,520
And of course, looks much taller because of forced perspective.

1243
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,320
No, I'm standing.

1244
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,760
I read that they painted.

1245
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:01,400
They recently repainted the matterhorn to make it so that they also designed it so that

1246
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:07,000
the sun would hit would hit the hit it in the same way that it hits the actual mountain.

1247
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,640
And they made a paint job that was more realistic to where like what feature is on the actual

1248
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,640
the actual Matterhorn.

1249
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:18,480
Yeah, there's another place we will never go.

1250
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:22,880
Supposedly Walt wanted real snow or like at least fake like some snow like he wanted the

1251
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:26,160
snow not to be just painted on initially, but that was too hard.

1252
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,160
Oh, OK.

1253
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:31,600
So they I mean, it looks kind of snowy, but of course, it doesn't really make sense.

1254
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,040
I've seen I was looking at photos from the 50s and 60s as opposed to now.

1255
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:38,560
And it definitely looks snowier these days.

1256
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,120
I think there were times where it got to more of just a gray mountain.

1257
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,720
It just looked like a big concrete.

1258
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,120
They never here's the thing.

1259
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,960
They never changed this into a giant birthday cake, right?

1260
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,440
They never there was never any crazy different version.

1261
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,160
They never made it like a check in the minus column.

1262
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,160
Of course.

1263
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,160
Yeah, yeah.

1264
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:02,360
So let's talk of a paint job at one time, which I will source Jim Hill.

1265
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,360
Sure.

1266
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:08,920
On which is that he when there was a supposedly when they were going to bring the Muppets

1267
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:13,000
to Disneyland for the first time, they were thinking about heralding that by painting

1268
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,280
the Matterhorn green and putting a big Kermit eyes on the top.

1269
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:22,440
So there was maybe almost a weird Kermit of five terrifying.

1270
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:25,320
And if I was a child, I'd be upset by it.

1271
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:30,040
Yeah, possibly, because I don't know that that would you know that was why.

1272
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,840
And the shape of Kermit is not like the shape of this.

1273
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:37,880
No, no, I would say Beaker is probably the best in terms of Muppet shape.

1274
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:40,720
Maybe a maybe a monster.

1275
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:43,680
But monsters are more from Sesame Street.

1276
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:44,680
Oh, it's sweet.

1277
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,680
I guess you can kind of make it look like sweet.

1278
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:47,680
Sweet.

1279
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:51,200
I'm just not a pointy head like Bert head would look more like the top of.

1280
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:54,720
I mean, yeah, but the Sesame Street workshop is a different.

1281
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,120
Characters now because of the sale.

1282
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,760
And we all know you all know what we're talking about.

1283
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:00,760
So what?

1284
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:06,840
Yeah, I guess you're you're limited in your regular Muppet characters who look enough

1285
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,760
like a mountain to that.

1286
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:16,200
Yet again, feels like would have felt to me like a great Gatsby eyes like God watching

1287
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:19,320
everything you're doing in Disney Park.

1288
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,320
Making sure there's no makeouts.

1289
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:23,320
Yeah, making sure there's no make out the eyes in the sky.

1290
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,040
Beware the eyes.

1291
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,840
Do you know the other we're jumping all around?

1292
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:30,400
We could have done this chronologically, but why not say things as they occur to me?

1293
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:37,560
There's also when they wanted to replace Holiday Hill and clear out all that marijuana growing

1294
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,560
everywhere.

1295
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:43,400
There was talk of replacing it with they had the idea of putting a ride there and kind

1296
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,400
of building on top of the dirt pile.

1297
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,640
And there was another proto Matterhorn situation called Rock Candy Mountain.

1298
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:51,240
Yes, I've heard of this.

1299
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,240
Yes.

1300
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:56,600
I don't I don't know a ton about it, but I looked into it a little bit.

1301
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,360
It was not going to be a roller coaster, but it had some structural similarities to the

1302
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:07,480
Matterhorn and it would have they would have actually extended the Casey Junior train ride

1303
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:14,580
and the storybook canal boats to explore the inner caverns of this big mountain that looks

1304
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:16,120
like candy.

1305
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:21,580
And in fact, when they made a model of this, it would they just put actual candy all over

1306
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:29,080
it and apparently like birds flew into the studio and started to take away, you know,

1307
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,520
Necco wafers that were pasted to the side.

1308
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,880
And that's I mean, that's I would like that ride.

1309
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:38,120
But more than the Matterhorn, unfortunately, I like the Matterhorn fine.

1310
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:42,200
But that candy, I've read a little bit about that and that sounds amazing.

1311
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,200
It would have been like 60.

1312
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,120
It would look like the Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory candy.

1313
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:47,120
Yeah.

1314
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:50,920
Like however they would like the made like that would be like a dirty brown water.

1315
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:51,920
And it's like, oh, chocolate.

1316
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,560
And you're like, now it's like oil.

1317
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:57,640
If you look at it or they said the rivers were going to be red.

1318
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:00,360
But what what candy doesn't it?

1319
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:03,520
It's like rivers of blood, like delicious blood.

1320
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,520
Yeah.

1321
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:08,600
Well, wait, we all have inside of us and nothing about it.

1322
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:13,640
Wouldn't have we would have just shared the name with the, you know, folk song that hobos

1323
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:17,120
would say because Big Rock Candy Mountain.

1324
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:22,380
Just the Wikipedia is a folk song about a hobo's idea of paradise, you know, where hens

1325
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:26,520
lay soft boiled eggs and their cigarette trees.

1326
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:31,480
It's about hobos alluring like pied piper and children away to like, yes, come here.

1327
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,120
It'll be everything you want.

1328
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:36,280
Is it genuinely cigarette trees or is that your generalization?

1329
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:38,880
No, that's it says cigarette trees.

1330
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,880
Yeah.

1331
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:40,880
Wow.

1332
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:44,360
John, very funny, John Hodgman in his book, The Area of My Expertise, there's like a

1333
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,360
whole chapter deconstructing the song.

1334
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,360
Wow.

1335
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:50,080
An American hobo code.

1336
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,080
Really?

1337
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,000
I don't think it was going to be.

1338
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,600
Maybe they would have used the song and not use the certain lyrics.

1339
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,080
Yeah, there are different lyrics.

1340
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:58,840
There's like, you know, cleaner lyrics.

1341
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:03,720
But then there's regional hobos would change the words to whatever they wanted.

1342
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:07,560
So they could fix a version where they didn't have to talk about cigarettes or stealing.

1343
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:08,560
Sure.

1344
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,360
It could have just been, yeah, delicious thing about like Frito pies that they were in the

1345
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:16,880
Southwest or delicious pastrami sandwiches that they're in New York.

1346
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,440
That's what your hobo song was.

1347
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:21,120
Yes, I'm getting hungry just talking about this idea.

1348
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:25,520
In a very dire time, they might sing about eating their own hand off.

1349
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,960
Oh, potentially.

1350
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:27,960
Sure.

1351
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:31,200
If you're in a really grim hobo situation.

1352
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:34,760
Yeah, well, I wish there were cigarette trees.

1353
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:37,000
That would have been a whole thing.

1354
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,240
If there was, they built cigarette trees on the ride.

1355
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:44,800
Then in like the 1990s, there would have been a big like to do about what we have to get

1356
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,760
rid of the cigarette trees on this ride.

1357
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,960
Like, no, you can't.

1358
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:49,960
The cigarette trees.

1359
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:50,960
Walt wanted those.

1360
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:51,960
It's vision.

1361
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:55,520
Those were Walt's cigarettes and they need to be growing on those trees.

1362
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,760
Main Street had a tobaccoist for a long time.

1363
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,760
Yeah.

1364
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,680
I wonder if there was an outcry about that, too.

1365
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:07,480
Like I used to buy all my tobacco from the man, one man on Main Street.

1366
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,840
Like he's going away.

1367
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:09,840
He knew.

1368
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,040
He knew which rubs I liked.

1369
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:13,040
I don't know how you buy tobacco.

1370
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:17,320
Like that drunk woman we ran into at Guardians of the Galaxy, like her mother would like

1371
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:22,180
was outside the tobaccoist as it was being retrofitted into a gift shop or that crystal

1372
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:23,180
store on Main Street.

1373
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:26,400
She was like, come on, this is bad.

1374
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,400
Let me buy my lucky.

1375
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,400
I want my cigarettes.

1376
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,400
I don't know.

1377
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,400
I need my.

1378
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:35,400
What was the official cigarette of Disneyland?

1379
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:38,880
I should Google that.

1380
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,360
Official cigarette of Disneyland.

1381
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,040
There must have been, right?

1382
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:44,760
They were cutting deals with everybody left and right.

1383
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:45,760
Yeah.

1384
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:51,080
That woman that she needed her special pack to make sure her daughter grew up big and

1385
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:55,600
strong.

1386
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,120
Special pregnancy cigarettes.

1387
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:01,320
So another noticeable thing.

1388
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:05,660
I thought this would have come up when we were talking about team stuff, teen stuff,

1389
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:10,520
but the safety warning, the please remain seated per month, Sarah sentados, Puff of

1390
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:15,160
war, the Jack Wagner voiced safety recording kind of infamous.

1391
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:20,080
If you grew up in a certain age and I didn't realize this because again, I didn't just

1392
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:28,680
learned about music five years ago is in the opening of the no doubt album, Tragic Kingdom,

1393
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:32,240
which I believe I realized was a Disneyland pun.

1394
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:38,800
Like last month was like a magic kingdom pun not too long ago.

1395
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:39,800
That came up in.

1396
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:48,680
We discussed Gwen Stefani, apparently frequenting club studio K and perhaps Videopolis as well

1397
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:52,280
and the unbuilt West Coast rock and roller coaster.

1398
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,280
Oh, potentially a no doubt.

1399
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:55,280
Oh, right.

1400
01:39:55,280 --> 01:40:03,760
But they sample a little of this, this famous safety spiel.

1401
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:10,160
So that'll when we do a theme episode about songs about the parks, that'll be one of the

1402
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:12,600
four that we can address.

1403
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:15,120
I cannot.

1404
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:20,240
Tragic Kingdom also in the name of what seems to be like at least one, if not multiple exhausting

1405
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:26,720
books written by ex cast members of like the real stories that went on behind the scenes

1406
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,720
of the Disney parks.

1407
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:29,720
Yeah.

1408
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:30,720
Tragic Kingdom.

1409
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:31,720
Oh, God.

1410
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:35,320
What was the Banksy theme park?

1411
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,320
Oh, Dismaland.

1412
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,320
Oh, Dismaland.

1413
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:43,320
Oh, he also did exit through the gift shop is like a theme park.

1414
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,320
That's a theme park thing.

1415
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,320
Yeah.

1416
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:46,320
Yeah.

1417
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:52,480
One of his pranks in the movie is at Disney, he like puts a Guantanamo body at Big Thunder,

1418
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,440
which is confusing and upsetting.

1419
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:56,440
Yeah, it doesn't really happen.

1420
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,440
Nailed it.

1421
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,440
Got him.

1422
01:40:58,440 --> 01:40:59,440
Really?

1423
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,440
You got the man there.

1424
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:01,440
I can't.

1425
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,440
Sorry, man.

1426
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,440
I can't find the official tobacco.

1427
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,440
I don't know if they had a brand.

1428
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,200
Mike's back from the Burbank library with a stack of books.

1429
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,200
And I'm researching through.

1430
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,960
The official, trying to find the official cigarette.

1431
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:11,960
Oh, Dismaland.

1432
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:15,440
I think they saw that says, look, they sold a bunch of tobacco products to anyone who

1433
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,760
was 16 or older.

1434
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:20,280
Hey, boy, I came up at the wrong time.

1435
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:25,120
I could have had cigarettes coming out every corner of my mouth and put them put them to

1436
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,400
the side long enough for a quick make out.

1437
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:28,400
Yeah.

1438
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:32,600
Your girlfriend's mom could have been giving you grief and you could have blown smoke in

1439
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:37,080
her face like, hey, mind your own business here, lady.

1440
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:40,000
You're not going to see anything blow smoke in her eyes.

1441
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Momentarily blinded.

1442
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,560
Mind your P's and Q's.

1443
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,560
We're legal adults.

1444
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,640
We're 13 years old.

1445
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:49,360
We're getting married before we leave today.

1446
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:50,840
Yeah, there was a marriage.

1447
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:51,840
You could get married.

1448
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,600
You assume that was a Disneyland too.

1449
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,040
Yeah, yeah, it's a different.

1450
01:41:55,040 --> 01:42:00,360
It's between the cigarette store and the bra store or the quick shack up marriage spot.

1451
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:04,360
And also probably the captain of the Mark Twain could marry it too.

1452
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,360
Whoever was.

1453
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:09,680
Oh, so I could have done marriages the day I was the day that you were at the wheel of

1454
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:10,680
the Mark Twain.

1455
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,400
There's a good chance that anyone who wanted to get married, you could just quickly dole

1456
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:14,400
it out.

1457
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:15,560
You just had to read a couple of things from a book.

1458
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,120
Could I even know old marriages too?

1459
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:19,720
If I saw like a couple waiting down.

1460
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:22,400
I think you could have done a lot as the captain of the Mark Twain.

1461
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:23,400
Oh man.

1462
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:26,440
Any marriage you wanted to move in on, you could declare no.

1463
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:29,240
Oh, I could have made a triad too.

1464
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:33,440
You would look down from the from the captain's deck and you would have seen a couple and

1465
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,240
you go, hey, I'm part of that now.

1466
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,760
And then it would have been legally binding.

1467
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,760
I look.

1468
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,200
I'm your third.

1469
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,200
I'm all for it.

1470
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,200
I'm all for it.

1471
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,920
I'm all for the government to start recognizing triads.

1472
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:51,000
I'm on board for like there's 47 genders like or no genders or or I'm on board for it.

1473
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
You're on board.

1474
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Count me in.

1475
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Yeah, you just want to blow up.

1476
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I'm also on board the Mark Twain.

1477
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,080
You just want to blow up math.

1478
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,400
You just don't like you don't like the number two.

1479
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,760
You don't like duos or things coming in twos.

1480
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,320
No, I'm an odd numbered man.

1481
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:06,960
I'm an odd man and I love odd numbers.

1482
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:13,240
I'm the man the list of things we know about you big old drug head hates music.

1483
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,240
Come on.

1484
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:15,240
Come on.

1485
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:20,040
Succeedingly accurate list that I'm looking to be a third.

1486
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:23,920
We know that family members see me plug this show.

1487
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,920
And as far as I know, only my father and brother have looked it up.

1488
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:28,920
Yeah, that's fine.

1489
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:33,800
They go if they don't want to know their real son, then that's not my brother.

1490
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:36,840
Yeah, I'm a real rowdy boy.

1491
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:40,280
This is the last thing I have written down that I thought was interesting.

1492
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:43,640
And this is just to cross off the dry facts.

1493
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:44,920
Part of it.

1494
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:50,960
The splash down pool towards the end of the ride, you come down an incline and you hit

1495
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:55,980
a splash down pool and there's a little bit of a splash.

1496
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,040
That is also practical.

1497
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:02,160
It cools down cools off the breaking pads that are mounted under the bobsleigh.

1498
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,160
That's interesting.

1499
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:07,760
And the hitting the water itself also acts as a breaking mechanism.

1500
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:14,400
I read that that came about because Bob Gerr, a long time, imagine you're Bob Gerr and Walt

1501
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:19,360
took a ride on it and that they had not really sorted out the end and that they crashed into

1502
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:23,160
like a haystack like Walt flew out of the car or something.

1503
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:24,160
Really?

1504
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:25,200
And that but that he liked it.

1505
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:26,200
He thought it was fun.

1506
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:30,440
He was like, oh, some kind of some crazy ending, some thing that slows you down.

1507
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,720
I think the haystacks are probably there to stop the car.

1508
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:35,960
They thought it'd be a more gentle thing, but instead is a big rock ascending.

1509
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:40,200
But I won't wanted something interesting at the end that practically stopped the ride.

1510
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:46,360
I wish there was more classic rides that ended up with you in a haystack or like a big hay

1511
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:47,360
pile like it.

1512
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,360
And back to the future.

1513
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:50,000
That should the back to the future ride.

1514
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,760
You should really end up in like a manure truck or something.

1515
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:53,760
Oh, yeah.

1516
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,760
That will.

1517
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:56,320
There was a possible ending of that.

1518
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,320
Do we discuss this?

1519
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:58,320
Maybe we did.

1520
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,160
Or was it going to get manure poured on him?

1521
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:03,880
And in fact, if you look close in the ride, there's a big pipe over him that I think says

1522
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:04,880
manure.

1523
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:05,880
Oh, how about that?

1524
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:09,200
Which why in a science lab is there a big manure pipe?

1525
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,200
There's no reason for that.

1526
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:12,720
So I'm glad they didn't that that would have been a plot hole.

1527
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:17,080
I'll say this, that landing in a big haystack reminds me of like, you know, we talked about

1528
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:21,880
not you know, we've done a lot of more recent stuff or more recent last few decades.

1529
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:23,760
And this is an older one.

1530
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:31,320
I mean, we have to do like an episode or multiple episodes about like 50s Disneyland when you

1531
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:36,120
read about stuff or you look at pictures and go like, wait, what was the burning of the

1532
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:39,360
town or like what was circus?

1533
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,720
That was a fully operational circus for it.

1534
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:42,720
I see like 50s.

1535
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:43,720
Huh?

1536
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,760
Wasn't that in the early 90s or late 80s?

1537
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:51,320
Well, that was something that was like a carnival summer or something called there was like

1538
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,320
Mouse Club Circus.

1539
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,040
Oh, yeah, there was a circus.

1540
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,040
Wow.

1541
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,040
Like the Mouseketeers would be there and stuff.

1542
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:01,200
And like, so there was a lot of early stuff while they were figuring out what people really

1543
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:05,960
liked about the park and the 50s, I feel like might actually kind of be when the park was

1544
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:06,960
the coolest.

1545
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:07,960
You think so?

1546
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:12,000
Because like, or maybe I whenever like Louis Armstrong's on the Mark Twain, just playing

1547
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,080
a concert, like they'd have like cool people down there.

1548
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,960
There was a period.

1549
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,640
People would obviously dress up and go there and like the Golden Horseshoe was like a cool

1550
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,800
show to go like a cool show.

1551
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,880
People like like adults loved it.

1552
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,360
Like there's a vibe to it.

1553
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,200
And of course, I'm just this is I wasn't there.

1554
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:33,600
But there is a vibe to it in the 50s of like this is just a cool place to hang out.

1555
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,600
Like it's a high end.

1556
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:40,200
They feel more like a genuine shot of Iran is the Shah of Iran or Iran.

1557
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:44,920
Yeah, that is very weird because I remember learning about radio in college and the Associated

1558
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:50,500
Press, in addition to having formatting rules, has pronunciation rules for like major news

1559
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,500
organizations.

1560
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:56,320
And at the time of the Iraq War, you were supposed to say Iraq, not Iraq.

1561
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:57,320
Yes.

1562
01:46:57,320 --> 01:47:02,240
Well, there weren't such rules, not such rules, narrating Disney specials.

1563
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:10,240
I actually have another strangely, the Shah of Iran had another connection to Disney later,

1564
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:15,160
which is that he there was a they were going to build the Persian Hotel, right?

1565
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:22,080
At the Bay Lake, like near not not on the same in the same area as the Polynesian, but

1566
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,240
close to it, I guess.

1567
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:25,760
The concept art is beautiful for that.

1568
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,760
Yeah, yeah.

1569
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:30,440
Sort of a Taj Mahal looking palace.

1570
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:37,040
Yes, I forget the official terms for like the architectural style, but it's a lot of

1571
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:39,440
blues and whites and like very pretty.

1572
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,800
Oh, I don't think I've really seen it.

1573
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:47,680
But the but the yeah, the Shah of Iran was going to put up the money for this potentially.

1574
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,920
But then the Iranian Revolution happened.

1575
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:50,920
Yes.

1576
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:56,520
Went into exile and the biggest fallout from that was the loss of the Persian Hotel.

1577
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,880
I can think of nothing else more important.

1578
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:05,480
I think I was supposed to be like a like a pavilion to there was talk of an Iran pavilion.

1579
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:10,680
But the great Shah of Iran did a lot of great work with totalitarian.

1580
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:16,560
Piece of shit overthrown by the sea or initially put in power by the CIA three years before

1581
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,800
his fun Matterhorn ride with his wife.

1582
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:26,360
He started Savak, a secret police force that tortured his enemies.

1583
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:28,280
And then there is riding with waltz.

1584
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:30,080
How is that word spelled?

1585
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,080
S.A.V.A.K.

1586
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:36,680
Because Savik in Navi means rise to the challenge.

1587
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:37,680
Wow.

1588
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:40,600
How that same very no, it's like an I instead of an A.

1589
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:41,600
I think.

1590
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,600
OK.

1591
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,600
Very close.

1592
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,600
What a spooky coincidence.

1593
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:45,600
So rise to the challenge.

1594
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:52,040
It's a more positive word than the yeah, the other the thing representing and then a secret

1595
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:57,440
police force that apparently tied weights to people's testicles until they confessed.

1596
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:58,440
Jesus Christ.

1597
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,440
Yeah.

1598
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,440
This is happening.

1599
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:06,000
Well, these evidence like the this is just the strangest historical tangent.

1600
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,680
Yeah, I thought we would have started at the Matterhorn and ended up in a pre revolution

1601
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:12,680
Iran.

1602
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:19,960
It's a big tick tock between 16 year old makeouts and yeah, giant overthrow something for the

1603
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,800
whole family.

1604
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:28,240
If you're a history buff or if you're a horny teen, there's something for all you city planner

1605
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:30,160
loves talking about parking options.

1606
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,000
If you're Lil Xan.

1607
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,160
Yeah, we have no feud with Lil Xan.

1608
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:36,160
We love Lil Xan.

1609
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,160
We love you, Xan.

1610
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:38,160
We're glad you're listening.

1611
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,160
We've heard he listens.

1612
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,160
Yeah, he does listen.

1613
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:42,360
He's going to do a song about us.

1614
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,360
What else have we missed?

1615
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:47,040
I like on the new they refurb the ride a couple of years ago.

1616
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:50,480
And even though they didn't make any improvements to the track, even though it seems like it's

1617
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:55,280
exact same, it's different cars, but like not much as far as if it's a smoother ride,

1618
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,560
they made the Yeti better.

1619
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:00,120
There's a cool effect now where or excuse me, the snowman, abominable snowman.

1620
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:02,920
There's a cool effect now where it looks like he's like you're seeing on the other side

1621
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:05,480
of ice and he's kind of climbing towards you.

1622
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:06,480
It looks so cool.

1623
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:07,480
That is so well done.

1624
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:10,640
And the sound design is legit scary.

1625
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:19,000
And yeah, it's that all almost more than the more than the the robotic snowman.

1626
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,440
I think that buildup is really I mean, I was going to say I love the robotics.

1627
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,400
No man is legit terrifying.

1628
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,920
He he looks like movement looks real.

1629
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,400
Yeah, he lunges at you.

1630
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:34,440
It was a little unclear before what the snowman's deal was.

1631
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:36,040
He just kind of like flatly.

1632
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,680
And I liked the old snowman.

1633
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:41,120
I got no beef with the old snowman or Lausanne.

1634
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:45,040
But the the new one, it does seem more clear to me.

1635
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:49,040
I just know this from watching an Imagineering video, but they pointed out how he's you know,

1636
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,040
he's he's protective.

1637
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:54,380
He's like he's protecting his mountain and communicates a little better.

1638
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:58,680
And there's a great thing they added to is that when one of the when you're zooming in

1639
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:03,880
and out of the mountain, there's a Skyway car that he is taking and some other little

1640
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:06,280
artifacts or one of the old styles of vehicle.

1641
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:07,900
Yes, it was the old Skyway.

1642
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:12,400
So like the idea is that like when that Skyway was going through, he took one and he took

1643
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:18,700
it and he put it in his like little treasure pile, which is this is nerd stuff that I love.

1644
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:19,780
This is fun.

1645
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:21,440
This is I guess this is an East.

1646
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:24,240
This is like a classic Ready Player One Easter egg.

1647
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:25,720
If you really think about it.

1648
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:33,200
And of course, there is one there is the two snowmen because two tracks, the one of the

1649
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:39,960
old original snowmen is in the queue for Guardians of the Galaxy, which is awesome with figments

1650
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:40,960
in a crate.

1651
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:41,960
Yes.

1652
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:42,960
And that's another thing.

1653
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:47,040
What's cool about the Guardians is that they've they've made the collector, the famous Benicio

1654
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:50,320
del Toro character that's in the movie for five minutes.

1655
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,800
He loves the Disney parks.

1656
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,800
He's a Disney parks fanatic.

1657
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:55,800
Yeah.

1658
01:51:55,800 --> 01:52:00,160
So he has a lot of artifacts and characters from the Disney the Disney parks history.

1659
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:05,680
They've been thrilled to get to buy that hotel then that old haunted hotel they wanted to

1660
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:06,680
get rid of anyway.

1661
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:07,680
Right.

1662
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,480
Of course, overtake it and put his collection there.

1663
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:10,480
Tannally.

1664
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:14,640
Well, I think, you know, I think Joe Rody said that in the narrative of what's going on in

1665
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:18,520
that area is that one day that just appeared.

1666
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,880
Oh, that's his reference.

1667
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:21,880
That's his explanation.

1668
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:25,480
So perched, there was no sign of the lease from the bank.

1669
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:26,480
Right.

1670
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:31,840
From the I don't know, HR Terrerson, whoever owned the Tower of Terror before.

1671
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:36,160
It was not like Back to the Future, Ride Simpsons, where there was a they put the narrative there

1672
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,460
that they sold.

1673
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:41,760
He sold the Institute of Future Technology to that's what I'm after.

1674
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:42,760
I want forms.

1675
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:45,280
I want to see transfer of ownership.

1676
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:46,280
No logic here.

1677
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:50,480
I think the roadie logic is that all of a sudden, oh my God, where did this giant crazy

1678
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:55,160
space fortress spaceship, whatever he calls it, power plant.

1679
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:58,960
The one I think the first or second time Mike and I wrote it because there's stuff there's

1680
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:02,680
clearly audio Easter eggs in the queue line to in the outside queue.

1681
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:03,680
It is.

1682
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:10,160
And I very quickly like went like, oh, this is a I was like, oh, this very, very proudly

1683
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:13,560
went like this is a mini version of the best time of your life.

1684
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,560
Yes.

1685
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,640
So they yeah, there are audio he not only other carousel of progress, the other carousel

1686
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:23,560
where it might have just been the song, but I forget in Tannaleer to Vans collection.

1687
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:25,380
He also has an audio collection.

1688
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:28,920
And while you're listening in line, they have kind of like warped little like things.

1689
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:34,120
So like it feels like there's loops of like maybe old tomorrow land in that line, like

1690
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:35,720
when you're listening to stuff.

1691
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:38,720
So like there's a whole, I don't know how long it goes, but I don't think I've ever

1692
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:41,760
heard a repeat, even if I'm in line for a long time.

1693
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:46,040
So there's like, if this is like the, this is the nerdy stuff and they really found a

1694
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,120
good way to do it on this particular ride.

1695
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:53,120
Which probably also helps it because there was a lot of people were skeptical and some

1696
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:56,160
people still do not really like the guardians ride.

1697
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:59,560
And I think it was probably a good way to like shut up some of the birds to put all

1698
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:00,640
your Easter eggs in there.

1699
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:05,080
I'm sure it went a good way to you having goodwill towards this ride.

1700
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,080
Yes.

1701
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,080
It makes me, yes.

1702
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,400
It makes me very happy to see the old Yeti.

1703
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:10,400
Yeah.

1704
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,400
It makes in here.

1705
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,400
There's a squid, right?

1706
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,400
There's squid from 20,000 leagues.

1707
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,400
Yes.

1708
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:16,400
The squid from 20,000 leagues.

1709
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:17,400
There's a couple other things too.

1710
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:21,560
There's going to change stuff out supposedly and put all their old things in there.

1711
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:27,680
Do you, do you, do you know that the, the abominable snowman was a redress of a jungle

1712
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:28,680
cruise gorilla?

1713
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:31,480
The really, how about that?

1714
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:37,120
Not unlike the story of changing the rock a fire explosion to munches make believe band

1715
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:38,120
and very similar.

1716
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:44,520
It is a redress of a gorilla, but in this case probably a two, two better use.

1717
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:45,520
Yeah.

1718
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:49,120
I'm sorry munch you're not a good redressed gorilla.

1719
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,120
Mr. I'd like munch.

1720
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,120
What am I talking about?

1721
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:52,120
Yeah.

1722
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:53,120
We all like munch.

1723
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,120
Why am I?

1724
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:55,120
I'm a big fan of munch.

1725
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:56,120
Yeah.

1726
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:57,120
Yeah.

1727
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:58,120
Yeah.

1728
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:59,120
I take it back.

1729
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:00,120
Sorry.

1730
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:01,120
I guess Doug Jones is a little upset when we say stuff like we like the Chuck E cheese

1731
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:02,720
band more than the rock a fire explosion.

1732
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,720
Yeah.

1733
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,720
And he doesn't like a guardians.

1734
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:07,440
I don't think he did a little jab.

1735
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:11,040
Everybody's got their things that they do and don't like.

1736
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:12,040
There's people.

1737
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:13,040
Yeah.

1738
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,040
There's the, I remember I saw Mark Hoppus tweet.

1739
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:17,640
I was very upset about the guardians of the Gallup, Blink 182 front man, Mark Hoppus.

1740
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:18,960
Like people have very.

1741
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,760
Maybe we've not got our own opinions too.

1742
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:22,760
So yeah.

1743
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:23,760
Yep.

1744
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,400
Maybe we haven't properly represented the people do not like.

1745
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:28,880
I do think we may, we could have done when we were putting this podcast together, we

1746
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:35,200
could have had a difference of like, we, we are all, we fall in like a similar line that

1747
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:39,540
we have differences, but we don't have, we need to have like the counterpoint, you know,

1748
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:41,840
we need to add a person to the podcast.

1749
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:42,840
We need more.

1750
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,160
We need another voice.

1751
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:48,120
Just an incredibly annoying devil's advocate in the corner.

1752
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:53,040
I liked that the Matterhorn hurts your back.

1753
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:54,040
It's good.

1754
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:56,800
And then, yeah, no, and then somebody who never wants anything to change somebody who

1755
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,800
is an advocate for.

1756
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:59,680
I think we should bring the Shah of Iran back.

1757
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:05,440
We should find that woman from in front of guardians and get her on the podcast.

1758
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:06,440
Sure.

1759
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:08,320
And she should be here every week.

1760
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:10,400
Do you think, what if we did track her?

1761
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:13,600
Yeah, we've, I feel like we haven't been super nice to her.

1762
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:17,600
So if she's heard this, I don't know if she's going to agree, although maybe it'll like

1763
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:20,680
start the fire and she'll want to come start arguing points.

1764
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:27,880
The problem is I have a feeling that she came up to several different people that looked

1765
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:33,360
like you and I who also all have podcasts, podcasts who also were like, oh, maybe it'll

1766
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,360
be fun.

1767
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:35,960
And maybe she won't know.

1768
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:36,960
Yeah.

1769
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:37,960
She won't know.

1770
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:40,560
And she's also too drunk to remember.

1771
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:41,560
Yes.

1772
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:42,560
Very good point.

1773
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:43,560
Very good point.

1774
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:48,360
She had Walt Scotch missed at the at the Carthay Circle Lounge and we wouldn't put up with

1775
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:49,360
that here.

1776
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:50,360
Nobody's drunk on this podcast.

1777
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:51,360
This ain't no Lovers Lane.

1778
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:54,920
We have no we don't have special plants here.

1779
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:57,680
We know we breathalyze each other before.

1780
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:58,680
Yeah.

1781
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:02,280
Make sure that we're at optimum performance.

1782
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:06,320
So what do you guys that so what do you guys think about this?

1783
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:10,800
Like wrapping up our usual ratings?

1784
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,240
How do you guys feel about this?

1785
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:18,480
I well I think they legitimately did a great plus up and it feels like it's just it's got

1786
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,480
to be mechanical.

1787
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:20,480
They got to make that thing.

1788
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:21,480
Yes.

1789
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:22,760
The number one thing is mechanical.

1790
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:28,080
I fear that the thing is built in such a way that it might be impossible just as far as

1791
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:29,480
clearances are concerned.

1792
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:34,600
Like if they were to make the track like smoother, they'd have to put a whole different thing

1793
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,800
like a different system in there maybe.

1794
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,920
And then like you'd have to like make the tunnels wider because then they don't want

1795
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,440
a human being's hand to be able to touch it if they.

1796
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,440
Yeah.

1797
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:46,360
Although it feels like it feels like I could touch a wall if I if I tried.

1798
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:48,760
The thing has maimed people.

1799
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:50,520
Body parts have come off.

1800
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:54,080
And yeah you feel that it's it's pretty tight clearances on this thing.

1801
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,080
Yeah.

1802
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:59,840
So I don't know if it's somebody would probably say it's impossible to make it a different

1803
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:00,960
ride system.

1804
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:06,600
This might be the most easy consensus in terms of like how we feel about a ride of like the

1805
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:12,280
plus up like yeah it's recently gotten plus up all that is the story stuff and the effects

1806
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:13,280
it looks great.

1807
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:18,360
But like yeah if we could plus anything up that track man just make yeah this is a genuine

1808
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:22,360
idea just make it more make it more comfortable.

1809
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:23,800
We're getting up there.

1810
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:27,600
We're not we're not rowdy teens anymore.

1811
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:28,820
We need back support.

1812
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:29,960
So help us.

1813
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:32,160
I would love some more Easter eggs too.

1814
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:33,560
I would love a little more.

1815
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:34,560
Sure.

1816
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:37,160
There's a like maybe another I don't know if there's any room for show scenes but you

1817
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:38,160
know.

1818
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,160
Yeah.

1819
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:43,000
I get one more appearance of the snowman.

1820
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,440
Some sense of yes of closure.

1821
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:49,400
If he was you know what I was thinking is if he's hanging upside down from from somewhere

1822
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:55,080
who's going down and then he like came down surprise and reached for you.

1823
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:56,400
How about this.

1824
01:58:56,400 --> 01:59:01,480
Bring back the climbers outside the people but then have one of them get eaten or get

1825
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:03,400
sucked into the side of the mountain.

1826
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:06,840
That would be so you'd be like they'd be I mean it would kind of ruin maybe the fun

1827
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:10,040
atmosphere of Main Street but it would be fun.

1828
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:14,760
Sure and Scott maybe to your idea we could they could reskin the xenomorph from the great

1829
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:16,920
movie ride that comes from the ceiling.

1830
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:17,920
Oh yeah.

1831
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:21,160
I have already hangs down and attacks folks.

1832
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:22,160
Yeah.

1833
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:26,480
I have an idea that's that would just be that would not negate the regular operation of

1834
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:32,240
the ride but it actually would be a holiday overlay or sort of a you know the theme to

1835
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:33,240
certain times of the year.

1836
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:41,240
It would be when speaking of our fevers when Olympic fever hits the world if we if during

1837
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:46,080
the winter Olympics there's a perfect opportunity to get a beloved Disney property in there

1838
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:49,280
and I'm talking of course about cool runnings.

1839
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:56,260
If there is a just a seasonal just for in February in Olympics years if the ride becomes

1840
01:59:56,260 --> 02:00:02,260
a race against the Jamaican bobsled team and you would have to shut down one of the two

1841
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:06,760
tracks you'd have to like give it over to be their track and then you even and out and

1842
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:12,200
you'd have to start them all at the same time and presumably build a set of four robots

1843
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:13,200
in each car.

1844
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:14,200
This is an expensive.

1845
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:18,240
Yeah this is going to be expensive and then you also have to make sure the ending like

1846
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:20,600
radiator springs racers.

1847
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:23,640
Yeah someone wins but you have to smooth that out.

1848
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:25,680
You can't say you lost the race.

1849
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:26,960
It's not a lose it.

1850
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:28,920
It's not a gloating situation.

1851
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:32,800
And the bobsled team are beloved underdogs.

1852
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,640
You wouldn't feel great about beating them.

1853
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:38,160
But you'd be the stand in for the evil Swiss team.

1854
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:39,160
That was the enemy.

1855
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:40,160
Right.

1856
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:41,160
Right.

1857
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:44,320
But this is a good hearted race.

1858
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,440
This is an exposition.

1859
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:49,040
Is that the term right when people exhibition exhibition.

1860
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,600
It's an exhibition exhibition game bobsled race.

1861
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:52,600
They're trained.

1862
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:53,600
You're helping them train.

1863
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:54,600
Right.

1864
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:55,600
So win or lose.

1865
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:58,800
You're giving them a little challenge because the Olympics are going to be in Switzerland

1866
02:00:58,800 --> 02:00:59,800
this year.

1867
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:00,800
Right.

1868
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,840
But then imagine they're surprised when there's a monster hanging around like they did.

1869
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:09,240
You know they've been training for a while and they're weird jalopy bobsleds out in the

1870
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:12,240
sun but they're in good shape but they were not expecting.

1871
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:14,120
We could have trained for this.

1872
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:16,240
I have another pitch for that.

1873
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:17,240
Wow.

1874
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:21,520
But it's just like you're on the set of Cool Runnings 2 and you are your actors and you're

1875
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:22,520
not great.

1876
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:25,440
You know perform in the scene.

1877
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:28,360
So when you're passing by the other car give them a cheer.

1878
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:29,360
Give them a boo.

1879
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,360
Yeah.

1880
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:31,360
Express yourself.

1881
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:32,360
That's good.

1882
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:33,360
I like that.

1883
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:34,360
Yeah.

1884
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:36,440
And then I and I was saying I'd like one more robot appearance.

1885
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:37,440
Right.

1886
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:38,440
And I've got an idea.

1887
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:43,000
Well so I think you get rid of the competition aspect by as in the climactic race in the film

1888
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,360
they skid out and they.

1889
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:46,360
Oh yeah.

1890
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:50,200
Because they get to walk out proud even though they didn't quite finish but they marched

1891
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:51,780
across the finish line.

1892
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:54,640
So we know that they'll give it their all no matter what happens.

1893
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:55,640
You keep going.

1894
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,640
They get grabbed by the monster.

1895
02:01:57,640 --> 02:01:58,640
Right.

1896
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:02,040
And you know they're so they're disqualified.

1897
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:04,200
But then you wonder what happened to the bobsled team.

1898
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:07,360
I wanted to beat them in the race but I didn't want anything bad to happen to them.

1899
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:08,680
And then you see them right at the end.

1900
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:13,000
You make one little show scene and they they're now they're hanging out with the abominable

1901
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,240
snowman and they got some spliffs.

1902
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:16,240
And they're getting them high.

1903
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:19,160
Oh a tribute to the old holiday hill.

1904
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:20,160
Yes.

1905
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:21,160
Yeah.

1906
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:22,160
Yeah.

1907
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:23,160
And acknowledgement of the history of the place.

1908
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:24,160
I like that.

1909
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:25,160
Yeah.

1910
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:27,400
And they brought they brought some they brought some good stuff and they're smoking out the

1911
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:29,800
snowman their best buds now.

1912
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:32,280
Let's let's just call it ice cream mountain.

1913
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:33,280
All right.

1914
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,280
Oh hey cover it.

1915
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:36,040
Jason perked up.

1916
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:39,160
Let's cover it in orange and purple sprinkles.

1917
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:40,160
All right.

1918
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:44,680
And in that climatic climactic scene where he the abominable someone is reaching at you

1919
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:47,840
you put an ice cream cone in his hand and he's trying to hand you an ice cream.

1920
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:48,840
Oh boy that's fun.

1921
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:49,840
He's nice.

1922
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:50,840
That's nice.

1923
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:51,840
He was trying to get your attention.

1924
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:52,840
Yeah.

1925
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:54,960
It's like an abominable snowman.

1926
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:59,240
What seems to us like a terrifying roar is just him saying hey take this.

1927
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:01,040
Hey want a refreshing treat.

1928
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,040
Yeah.

1929
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:03,040
Yeah.

1930
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,040
And we can add that dialogue.

1931
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:05,040
Yeah.

1932
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:06,040
Yeah.

1933
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:07,040
Translator put subtitles in front.

1934
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:08,040
Yeah.

1935
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,040
This is this is probably the time to wrap up.

1936
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:15,840
I have a very quick fact which is that the there's a what the Tinkerbell because I'll

1937
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:19,320
never get the chance to say otherwise Tinkerbell flew down when they started doing that in

1938
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:20,320
the 60s.

1939
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:22,640
Her name was Tiny Klein.

1940
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:24,560
She was a Hungarian circus performer.

1941
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:25,960
She was 70 years old.

1942
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:26,960
Oh my God.

1943
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:29,760
When she started doing the Tinkerbell flight from the top.

1944
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:30,760
Yeah.

1945
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:35,280
And and she died of stomach cancer three years after she started doing it in 1964.

1946
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:36,740
So that's three years of her life.

1947
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:38,800
She's spending summers flying down.

1948
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:43,920
It was a trick that Walt saw in a circus or no it was like some it was a Hollywood Bowl

1949
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:47,760
show where Tinkerbell did and he said I want that at the park every night this summer.

1950
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:48,760
Man.

1951
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:49,960
The last couple years of her life Tiny Klein.

1952
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:50,960
God bless her.

1953
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:52,560
So if I didn't get that Tiny Klein info.

1954
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:53,560
No we needed that.

1955
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:54,560
Yeah.

1956
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:56,600
Let's let's shoehorn that in there.

1957
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:59,160
And now that's all the dry facts about the Matterhorn.

1958
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:00,160
All right.

1959
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:03,400
