1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:25,108
Cast the Ride, The Second Gate, your exclusive home

3
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,028
for details on Disneyland's lesser boats.

4
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:30,828
I'm Scott Gertner, joined by Jason Sheridan

5
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:32,468
and Mike Carlson, how you doing guys?

6
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:33,948
Hi, yes, doing fine.

7
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:36,108
Jason, are you particularly excited

8
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:37,608
about talking about a boat?

9
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:40,168
Yeah, you know I am, Michael, you know I am.

10
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:42,308
As Jimmy Buffett's famous song says,

11
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,048
there's something about a boat.

12
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:44,108
Something about a boat.

13
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:45,088
Something about a boat.

14
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:49,308
And those, as Brian Wilson's famous song goes,

15
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:52,548
is a sail on sailor, which is not applicable

16
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:54,448
because we're not talking about sail boats.

17
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:57,228
So we're, all this sailor could be on a keel boat.

18
00:00:57,428 --> 00:01:01,888
We're talking about keel boats, the Mike Fink keel boats.

19
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:03,808
Now, when we started talking about

20
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:06,708
what the Patreon was gonna be, a long time ago,

21
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,868
I had this sea ticket idea, a way to, you know,

22
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:11,588
kind of quick and dirty acknowledge

23
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:13,628
some of the odd little attractions.

24
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,828
And this to me is the ultimate one.

25
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,668
It's like the main one, I kept name checking.

26
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:20,388
Let's do the episode about the Mike Fink keel boats.

27
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:22,668
Because to me, just from that name,

28
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,928
it just like kind of sounds odd and obscure and sad.

29
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:31,328
I don't like, not, the lack of familiarity

30
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:34,168
with what is a keel boat and who is Mike Fink.

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,108
You're not familiar with the King of the River?

32
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:38,468
I was not until now.

33
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:41,788
Now tell me how much you were, or you, Mike.

34
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:45,048
Mike Fink was one of Jason's favorite characters

35
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:46,168
in fiction, of course.

36
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:52,708
I feel like I used to catch the Davy Crockett,

37
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:56,048
whether it be the TV show or the re-cut versions

38
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:58,408
in the movies on the Disney Channel,

39
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:00,648
especially back in the early days of Disney Channel

40
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:03,128
when they were mostly showing like,

41
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:05,648
library content, their archive content.

42
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:08,868
I feel like my dad, my dad certainly,

43
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:13,308
the child of the 60s and 50s, like,

44
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:15,248
he knew Davy Crockett would tell us

45
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:17,288
when we would go to, oh, it's Davy Crockett.

46
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:20,028
You clearly, clearly, King of the, yes.

47
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,048
King of the Wild Frontier.

48
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:22,868
Mike Fink is King of the River,

49
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:27,048
even though in the boat race, Davy Crockett does beat him.

50
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:30,208
It was a nine, 10, 11 year old,

51
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:32,028
did you know who Mike Fink was?

52
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:33,688
Was the name familiar?

53
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,348
It was not to me.

54
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:36,168
No, not really.

55
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:40,848
I would see it around like Disney World, maybe.

56
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:44,188
Like, if it was on the boat or Tom Sawyer Island,

57
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:46,448
I was probably like, oh, that's probably Davy Crockett's

58
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:48,888
friend or Tom Sawyer's friend or something like that.

59
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:51,248
That's exactly what I thought.

60
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:55,788
It just, totally intro at these are,

61
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:59,088
this was a kind of boat that is along the rivers of America

62
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,908
in both Disneyland and Disney World.

63
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:04,168
These boats circle Tom Sawyer Island.

64
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:07,568
And I hear Tom Sawyer and I hear Mike Fink.

65
00:03:07,748 --> 00:03:10,648
And I thought Mike Fink was like a little buddy of Tom Sawyer.

66
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:13,648
I thought that until I started researching this episode.

67
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:15,868
I just never looked into it, but I was like,

68
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:18,328
he's like a little, he's a little scrappy guy.

69
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:19,848
Hey, I'm Mike Fink.

70
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:23,148
He's like some little weirdo who wants to catch June bugs

71
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:23,828
with Tom.

72
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:25,848
Yeah, he does sound, in my head,

73
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:27,668
he was always like a little kid or something.

74
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:29,788
Oh boy, I'm Mike Fink.

75
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:32,128
It's his little curt name, Mike Fink.

76
00:03:32,508 --> 00:03:35,268
Mike Fink sounds like Willy Wonka kid or something,

77
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:36,108
or Mike TV.

78
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:38,808
Like it's in my head, I guess that's what the connection is.

79
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:40,288
I don't know if you why, and the voice I'm doing

80
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,688
has a little bit of that attitude.

81
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,748
He's like a little pipsqueak.

82
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,128
Yeah.

83
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:45,548
You can't trust that ride.

84
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:47,868
Maybe he took too many tickets from ya.

85
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:54,728
But he's, no, in fact, is a Davy Crockett character.

86
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:58,268
But which makes more sense to me because I was always like,

87
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:01,288
why would a little pipsqueaky kid have a line of boats?

88
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:01,948
Right.

89
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:06,868
And did Tom Sawyer, were there a lot of boats around?

90
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:08,748
I guess so, right?

91
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:10,868
Tom Sawyer was, did he go on river boats?

92
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,428
I don't know much about Tom Sawyer.

93
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:14,708
Jason, you were childhood friends with him?

94
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:18,848
Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn spent a lot of time around.

95
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:19,528
Rafting.

96
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:21,768
Rafting and river boats and stuff.

97
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:25,168
I think Huck Finn got into more mischief.

98
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:27,488
Of course, Jim took that raft down the river.

99
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:27,988
Sure.

100
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:29,488
That's a con man.

101
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:32,008
Fell into like a Romeo and Juliet,

102
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:35,408
Hatfield, McCoy situation, ended up in the middle of that.

103
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,008
Keep going.

104
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:41,028
Tom Sawyer, I read Huck Finn in high school.

105
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,948
I never, I haven't really read Tom, so what, maybe like.

106
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:46,728
Yeah, I know a lot less about Tom than I do about Huck.

107
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:49,048
Yeah, is the book, are the books less good?

108
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,248
Is it one book?

109
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:51,088
I don't know, boy.

110
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:52,448
I can't tell.

111
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:53,668
There's two books.

112
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:56,528
There's also, there's Tom Sawyer came first

113
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:57,808
and that was more a children's adventure.

114
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:00,408
Huckleberry Finn was always more, which were a book.

115
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:05,268
At some point, there was also like a Tom Sawyer agent

116
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:07,708
of the US or Tom Sawyer.

117
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,668
There is a thing where he is like a spy.

118
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:12,168
What, really?

119
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:15,128
And that is how they justified having Tom Sawyer

120
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:17,548
in the Leave Extraordinary Gentlemen movie.

121
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:19,488
Cause Twain wrote a story about him as a spy?

122
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,828
Where he is like a spy or an intelligence,

123
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:25,668
like in the, you know, something in the army, like.

124
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:27,668
So it marked, everyone's complaining these days

125
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:30,328
about people, too much IP, leaning on stuff,

126
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:31,828
but he was using his own IP.

127
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:33,108
He used his own IP.

128
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:35,088
And old Tom Sawyer as a spy.

129
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:35,868
That's interesting.

130
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:36,828
I didn't know that.

131
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:38,328
Joey on Friends.

132
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:39,028
Yeah.

133
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:40,088
Doing some continuing,

134
00:05:40,268 --> 00:05:41,868
he's one of the Extraordinary Gentlemen?

135
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:43,108
Not in the comics.

136
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:45,808
In the comics, the comics are very much like a tribute

137
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:50,248
to like British Pope of the various century,

138
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:52,508
19th century, 20th century, 21st century.

139
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,048
The movie, they're just like,

140
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:58,748
it's all these book people and they're all bad ass.

141
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:00,488
Like that's how it gets translated

142
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:01,988
into a big Hollywood movie.

143
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:03,128
I see, I see.

144
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:06,888
Well, in this case, we are talking about Mike Fink,

145
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:10,888
who is not a fictional character, but in fact, real man.

146
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:12,668
And there's a lot of fun to be had

147
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:15,148
in talking about the real man, Mike Fink,

148
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:17,768
but let's go backwards and talk about the attraction

149
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:18,508
a little bit.

150
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:22,788
As I mentioned, a very early attraction in Disneyland.

151
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:25,808
It is a, it was an actual sea ticket.

152
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:27,728
Some of the things that we talk about

153
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:30,888
with this name construct premise,

154
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,748
or were done beyond the ticketing system.

155
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:35,508
This was an actual sea ticket,

156
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,248
and I think it was a very good way

157
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:40,108
to dispose of unwanted seas,

158
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:43,848
because the other boats along the rivers of America,

159
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,508
the Mark Twain, the Columbia,

160
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,768
and the Davy Crockett canoes were all Ds.

161
00:06:49,328 --> 00:06:50,568
So this was a little,

162
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:53,188
and I think it was probably hard to find good seas.

163
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:54,588
I don't know what else was a sea,

164
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:57,468
but you know, sea feels like a thing

165
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:58,748
probably from my mom's era.

166
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:00,388
You talked about like the stress

167
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:04,428
in trying to get rid of the tickets you didn't want.

168
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:06,648
I'm sorry, just interrupt.

169
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:09,188
So it's the Adventures of Tom Sawyer,

170
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:10,528
then the Adventures of Alckivarri Finn,

171
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:12,128
then Tom Sawyer Abroad,

172
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,088
and then Tom Sawyer Detective.

173
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:15,668
Whoa. Yeah.

174
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:16,828
Really? Yeah.

175
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:18,588
If you haven't read that though.

176
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:20,568
I haven't read it, but I think it's in the public domain.

177
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:22,228
Detective. I think you can find it pretty easy.

178
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:23,748
In what era was he a detective?

179
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:26,288
Like significantly later than,

180
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:26,928
are we talking about a- Oh yeah,

181
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:28,208
I think he grew up a little,

182
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,648
yeah, I think he's a little older.

183
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:31,628
Is he as, is it more like 16

184
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:34,148
or more like hard-boiled 65?

185
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:36,428
I am not 100% sure.

186
00:07:36,448 --> 00:07:36,948
We gotta get back to that.

187
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:38,428
We gotta- We gotta revisit.

188
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,308
No. The Tom Sawyer franchise.

189
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:42,668
This feels like a big budget movie franchise

190
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:43,408
waiting to happen.

191
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,008
Yeah. And it will,

192
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,348
once somebody realizes it's up for grabs.

193
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:48,948
I had the same thought though

194
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,288
when I was going through all this Davy Crock

195
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:51,328
and Mike Fink stuff too.

196
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:53,468
I go, oh, this is ripe for a comeback,

197
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:54,468
for a Disney comeback.

198
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:56,188
Yeah, true.

199
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:57,628
And it seems like they should be

200
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:59,748
trying to figure out how to do that.

201
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:01,508
I think Disney in general needs to figure out

202
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:02,968
an old West thing.

203
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:03,448
Oh yeah.

204
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:05,488
Cause it'll justify building more stuff

205
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:06,628
in different frontiers,

206
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:09,268
putting characters into Frontierland rides

207
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:11,748
as they briefly discussed with the Lone Ranger,

208
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:14,748
but it didn't play out the way they wanted it to.

209
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:16,548
So the rock is Davy Crockett?

210
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:18,328
Sure. Sure.

211
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:19,648
Davy Rockett?

212
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:20,968
Davy Rockett.

213
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:22,568
You know, we give all these parts to the rock.

214
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:24,228
Let's not count out John Cena.

215
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:25,768
Let's not count out- Oh yeah,

216
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:26,948
I would never count out John Cena.

217
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:30,348
And there, that's the end of the list of movie stars.

218
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:33,228
Or a 60 year old Tom Cruise.

219
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:34,508
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:36,888
But he's picking those IPs carefully now.

221
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:37,908
Post-Mummy. Yeah, post-Mummy.

222
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:42,428
You also, we might want to think about a,

223
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:43,748
maybe there's a comedy,

224
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:46,128
Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly,

225
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:48,148
Tom and Huck.

226
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:49,668
I'm a grown Tom and Huck.

227
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:50,288
Okay, all right.

228
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,348
People want all the public domain characters

229
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:54,608
played by Kyle and John.

230
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:57,728
Recently mentioned Clifford.

231
00:08:57,848 --> 00:09:00,728
If they go a Clifford route where they are Tom and Huck,

232
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:04,068
but they are playing 10, 12 year old Tom and Huck.

233
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:04,968
Ah, sure.

234
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:06,168
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:09,548
And they have to figure out a way to do a selfie stick

236
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:13,168
within the world of Tom and Huck.

237
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:16,088
The good thing if they get Tom Cruise

238
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,888
is that he will spend six months

239
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:20,068
learning how to pilot a keel boat.

240
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:21,748
Well, and also- You'll really learn.

241
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:24,268
How to trick people into painting a white fence.

242
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:25,508
Sure.

243
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:28,948
He just starts going up to people on the street and like,

244
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,428
hey, could you, hey.

245
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:33,688
Hey, Aunt Polly has me doing this.

246
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:35,008
And it's really fun.

247
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:37,608
Well, in my mind, he was still playing David Cragut.

248
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:39,128
So you see him as more of a Huck Finn.

249
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:40,448
Tom Cruise is Huck Finn.

250
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:43,728
Oh, yeah, that one, yeah.

251
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,408
I don't know.

252
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,368
Unless it's Huck Finn Revisited or something.

253
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:48,548
All right, it's Huck Finn Revisited.

254
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:49,808
He's playing both.

255
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:52,428
So we're a little limited in our knowledge

256
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:55,588
of the David Cragut verse and the Twain verse.

257
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:58,468
I know he was born on a mountain top in Tennessee.

258
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:01,668
Some might call it the greatest place

259
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,828
in the land of the free.

260
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,968
I'm fairly confident he killed him a bar,

261
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:09,708
but what age, that's what's not coming to me.

262
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:10,908
Yeah, citation needed.

263
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:15,848
Yeah, I mean, I want to say only three, but I'm not-

264
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,968
That is an exceptional age to do that.

265
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:19,528
So it's probably, right?

266
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:21,768
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could say that'd be worth bragging

267
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,528
about in a song.

268
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:25,308
Well- Scott, let me ask you,

269
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:27,848
do you have any memories of writing the Mike Fink?

270
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:29,608
You say your mom was trying to get rid of the tickets

271
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:31,848
when the ticket book, do you have any childhood memories

272
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,088
writing the Mike Fink keel books?

273
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:34,848
I do not, I don't think I ever did it.

274
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:38,068
And I think I've only done the David Cragut canoes one time

275
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:40,468
and I did find it sort of unpleasant.

276
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:41,048
It's unpleasant.

277
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,408
I did it once too, yeah.

278
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,068
Yeah, my shoulders hurt.

279
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:45,068
Oh, it's brutal.

280
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:46,648
It hurt hours afterwards.

281
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:49,628
The teens that do and the 20 year olds that do that

282
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:51,368
are jacked by the end of the summer.

283
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:52,568
Jacked heroes, yeah.

284
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:54,528
They are just in such good shape, I bet.

285
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:56,488
Cause yeah, I did it with my dad and mom

286
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,448
a couple of years ago and we were just like, oh.

287
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,028
Yeah, it's hard.

288
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,868
I want to say I did it with my grandmother potentially,

289
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:05,128
which seems very odd.

290
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,308
Like that could have really wrecked her.

291
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:08,968
I did it a couple of years ago

292
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,568
and what ends up happening is the adults in the boat

293
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:13,288
do the real heavy lifting.

294
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,648
Like, I mean, the guys at the ends,

295
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:18,308
the cast members do the brunt of it,

296
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:21,308
but then the rest of the adults, like the kids get like.

297
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:24,188
Like the kids fall off very quickly.

298
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,988
And rightly so, cause it's hard to paddle a boat.

299
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:28,048
Yeah, yeah.

300
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:33,528
Well, you know, one thing about the Mike Finck keel boats,

301
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:37,528
I didn't really know what the experience was exactly.

302
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:40,748
And mainly you pilot around the rivers of America

303
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:43,208
and you see all the stuff that you can still see

304
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,028
on the other boats on the Mark Twain of the canoes.

305
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:52,448
But there's a little bit of Jungle Cruise jokiness to it.

306
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:55,848
Like they make fun of the Davy Crockett canoes.

307
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:58,028
The guy goes on a run about like, oh yeah,

308
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:00,268
that real fun ride where you're right down

309
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:04,288
in the stinky water and you're getting an upper arm workout

310
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:07,948
and oh yeah, oh, that's my favorite by far.

311
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,888
He kind of roasts the canoes, which is a little fun.

312
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,508
And that's the guy on the roof

313
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:15,708
with controlling the big paddle.

314
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:16,528
Yeah. Is that right?

315
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:16,788
Yeah.

316
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:18,428
I actually wait, I'm a little fuzzy on,

317
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:20,908
I just watched like a video

318
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,068
from somebody on the inside part.

319
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:26,328
I don't know that I know how it was, how it's piloted.

320
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:27,168
Is that what it is?

321
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:28,288
Is it a guy up on the second level?

322
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:29,508
Cause I asked my dad, I was like,

323
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:31,788
I have a memory of riding, we rode these, right?

324
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:33,868
And he's like, oh yeah, we rode these often.

325
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:36,908
He didn't register with you?

326
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:39,808
I know, but I have a very specific memory

327
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:42,328
of riding around the river in Disney World,

328
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:46,908
but being lower, not being high up like the Twain

329
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:49,688
or the sailing ship, being lower to the water.

330
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:50,788
Though that must be nice.

331
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:51,848
And that was this.

332
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:53,548
And then when I looked it up, I was like,

333
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:54,488
oh, I remember these ships.

334
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,568
Yeah, I do remember these going around,

335
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:58,368
but there was a guy who would stand

336
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:00,328
on the top of the roof kind of thing

337
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:02,888
and he would control this giant paddle and stuff.

338
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:05,908
Cause it was not on a track like Mark Twain.

339
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,948
It was more like the canoes or something.

340
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:09,848
What I saw, it is free floating.

341
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,848
Cause you would have to dock over on the side

342
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:13,368
and it wasn't just on a set track.

343
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,368
So there was a good person controlling it.

344
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:17,148
It was kind of the appeal of it.

345
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:19,828
That if you can get in that lower level,

346
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:21,988
but this boat by the way, if you haven't seen one,

347
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:23,348
is a double decker.

348
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:27,908
So the bottom level inside this kind of shack thing,

349
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,328
you're lower to the water like the canoes,

350
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:32,268
or you can sit up on top of the roof

351
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:33,948
where I guess the driver is.

352
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,988
So it's two different kinds of little experiences.

353
00:13:36,988 --> 00:13:39,368
But if you want that water proximity,

354
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:41,588
if you want to feel that cold rush going by,

355
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:45,028
but you don't want the workout of the Davy Crocker canoes,

356
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:47,368
then the Mike Fink keel boats are for you.

357
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:51,348
And if you want some mild jokery,

358
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,128
as I said, he roasted the canoes.

359
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:56,388
He also made fun of the Hungry Bear restaurant

360
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:58,208
and said, I hear their food's so good,

361
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:59,608
they throw it to the ducks.

362
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:01,628
So you're getting little,

363
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:03,808
that's what I was not sure about was

364
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:06,028
what is the character of the ride experience.

365
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:09,508
And there are fun little jokes from the driver

366
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:10,448
and the one that I watched.

367
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:13,948
I'm impressed by a guy having to pilot

368
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:15,908
a pretty particular type of boat,

369
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:19,768
but also being funny and playing a character.

370
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:23,608
Because like Jungle Cruise, it's on a track.

371
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:26,248
And they are like, I think they're making it go and stuff.

372
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:27,508
Controlling speed.

373
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:28,608
They're speeding, right?

374
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:29,108
That's it.

375
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:31,968
Which is something, but this guy's actually controlling

376
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:33,548
and they have to do the jokes.

377
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:38,648
I'm impressed that they even poke fun at stuff.

378
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:41,388
I feel like if this started now, it'd be like,

379
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:43,288
well, we cannot make fun of the Hungry Bear restaurant

380
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:44,528
because people will not want to eat there.

381
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:47,428
We just changed the menu and we really need people.

382
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,048
We need eyes on this new menu.

383
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,508
People are upset about the fried green tomato sandwich

384
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:52,968
that has been gone for years.

385
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:55,068
And Lindsay still talks about it

386
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,708
and people are upset about it.

387
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,088
It is crazy that they haven't brought it back

388
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:00,528
because people love that sandwich.

389
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:01,288
Do you know what we're talking about?

390
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:01,948
I never do.

391
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:03,488
I'm aware of the existence of this.

392
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:04,408
I never did it.

393
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:05,048
People love that.

394
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:08,108
But yeah, if people are demanding a food item,

395
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:10,588
doesn't Disney always capitalize on it?

396
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:12,568
So yeah, roasting now, I feel like roasting

397
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:14,408
one of the restaurants they might not be into.

398
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:17,148
Yeah, well, it's just, we're really pushing the meal deals.

399
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:18,948
I mean, feel free to mention the meal deals.

400
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:20,508
Apple slices for the kids.

401
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:21,668
You can bring that up.

402
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:25,008
And what's the yogurt I drank or the applesauce I drank?

403
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:26,108
Oh yeah.

404
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:28,888
I drank applesauce out of a packet.

405
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:30,368
A squeeze pouch.

406
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:32,688
And it's called like bar piss.

407
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:35,248
They call it something foxy.

408
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,868
Yeah, it was from Tomorrowland.

409
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:40,328
And it was basically like I had a,

410
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:44,788
what's the Capri Sun with apple juice in it.

411
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:47,168
With my kid's meal.

412
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,028
Anyway, not a subject to be mocked.

413
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,128
So this double decker bus,

414
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:55,028
you get to go on with a fun foxy guy.

415
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,008
It's one of the first additions to Disneyland.

416
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,928
It was opened on Christmas 1955,

417
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:02,868
the literal day of Christmas.

418
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:08,828
And it was a kind of an in-demand attraction

419
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:11,988
as the Davy Crockett episode

420
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:14,328
in which the keel boats factored into,

421
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,328
which was called what?

422
00:16:16,588 --> 00:16:18,988
Davy, well, Davy Crockett's keel boat race,

423
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,908
but I think it was packaged into something else,

424
00:16:20,908 --> 00:16:22,588
the river race or something or other.

425
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:24,388
But this was, I guess, a moment,

426
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:26,608
this race is a moment that loomed large

427
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:28,528
in the Davy Crockett franchise.

428
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,428
And they wanted to get it in there

429
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:32,148
to the park in its early days.

430
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:34,808
And in fact, they used the literal boats,

431
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,448
the two boats, there were two keel boats,

432
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:40,828
the Gully Whumper and the Birth of May.

433
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:44,208
And the two boats that they put in

434
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,608
were the literal boats used in the Davy Crockett episode.

435
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:49,128
And Birth of May was Davy's

436
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:50,788
and Gully Whumper was Mike Finck.

437
00:16:51,268 --> 00:16:52,348
Yes, that's correct.

438
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:52,748
You got it.

439
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:54,088
Yeah, they had their own boats.

440
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,208
And there's slight differences between them.

441
00:16:58,248 --> 00:16:59,388
I wouldn't pretend to know

442
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:02,168
even having researched this lightly.

443
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:04,708
But yeah, the fact that it is a real,

444
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,148
they just were putting tourists on a real prop

445
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:09,308
from this TV show.

446
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,268
Well, that's like how they had the organ

447
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:13,368
from 20,000 Leagues, the movie,

448
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:16,088
and then they had it in a walkthrough attraction

449
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:19,708
for many years and then they just took the organ

450
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,208
and made it the organ in the auto mansion.

451
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:23,228
Sure.

452
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:25,308
Well, we have an organ?

453
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:27,728
Oh, I guess this ballroom has an organ now.

454
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,748
It's weird to think of things being that scrappy.

455
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,628
Like, well, the studio has this lying around,

456
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:33,688
so let's put it in the park.

457
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:37,848
This is their version of the Frozen ride.

458
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:39,628
Because the Frozen ride, they have to like,

459
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:40,568
how are we gonna put this thing?

460
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,828
All of a sudden, Frozen's a giant hit.

461
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:43,208
Because from what I understand,

462
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:46,188
Davy Crockett was a big hit on TV all of a sudden.

463
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:48,608
And it was like Davy Crockett mania

464
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,608
and merchandise was selling

465
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:52,308
and like they had, what's his name?

466
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:54,308
They played Davy Crockett in the parks.

467
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:55,928
In like a fest, fest park.

468
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:57,128
Of course, you're here.

469
00:17:57,128 --> 00:18:01,308
Now a proud member of the Fest Parker wine club.

470
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:02,008
Oh, really?

471
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:02,708
You joined the club?

472
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:03,728
We joined the club.

473
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:08,468
I am a fan of their wines and the tasting was excellent.

474
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:08,908
Wow.

475
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,968
It's a beautiful facility up there.

476
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,228
Actually, up in Los Olivos, where I recently took a trip.

477
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,648
And in fact, it is the winery scene

478
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:21,288
in the big breakdown scene in Sideways,

479
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:25,728
where he pours the spittoon all over himself.

480
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,308
Oh, how about that?

481
00:18:27,348 --> 00:18:28,728
So it's actually a little cruddy

482
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:31,148
for this very nice winery that they had to like,

483
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,748
almost like stand in as like a crappy one.

484
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:34,148
Right.

485
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:38,508
But it's a beautiful property with lots of little nods

486
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:42,788
to fests and little like etched skin caps everywhere.

487
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:43,428
That's great.

488
00:18:43,428 --> 00:18:44,288
It's lovely up there.

489
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:46,328
If you're in the club, it sounds like

490
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:48,568
we have a Patreon episode coming up

491
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:51,188
where you prepare a tasting for us.

492
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:52,028
Oh, absolutely.

493
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:54,368
Now you're demanding treats.

494
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:55,268
Well, I'm just-

495
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,188
Suddenly you're on board with wine.

496
00:18:57,528 --> 00:18:58,128
I'm just planting the seed.

497
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:01,048
I suppose so.

498
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:05,868
Hey, who am I to say no to drinking wine with the buds?

499
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:07,768
Sounds like a blast to me.

500
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:11,308
And then I'll do an episode where we go down to 7-Eleven

501
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:14,388
and I find what new treats in their private label line.

502
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,568
You can add all the 40 cent coupons.

503
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,088
Because you're a member of some sort of 7-Eleven club

504
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:21,888
that we don't know about?

505
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:23,968
They're a club you have to have the app

506
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,308
and then you get like, it's like a digital coffee card.

507
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:27,288
It seems so complicated.

508
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:28,688
I have not joined the 7-Eleven club.

509
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,788
I don't go there that much.

510
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:32,708
We did all right before recording take advantage

511
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,968
of our ShorePoints.

512
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:34,808
Yes, ShorePoints.

513
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,748
Jersey Mike's food rewards system.

514
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:41,148
Which we are all a member of the ShorePoints club.

515
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:42,288
All of us, yes.

516
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,588
And my wife.

517
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:44,528
Yeah.

518
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:48,128
And when I got my first free sandwich,

519
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:49,488
I was extremely proud.

520
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:51,168
Yeah, it's a very thrilling moment.

521
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,668
I remember when I had my first free sandwich too.

522
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:56,268
Man, if we didn't have to record after,

523
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:59,128
I probably would have just gotten some tasty cakes

524
00:19:59,128 --> 00:19:59,828
at the checkout.

525
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:02,428
I forgot they have a big selection of tasty cakes.

526
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:03,048
Oh yeah, right.

527
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:03,848
Tasty cakes?

528
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:04,828
Oh, tasty cakes.

529
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:06,668
The pride of Philadelphia.

530
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:08,188
These little snack cakes.

531
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:11,388
Butterscotch crumpets and peanut butter candy cakes and stuff.

532
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:13,088
Probably would have just taken one of those,

533
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:16,048
gone home, woofed them down, had a nice little nap.

534
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:19,608
When you say nap, you mean go to bed at four o'clock

535
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:20,988
and wake up at 10.

536
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:21,848
Stay there.

537
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:26,968
Yeah, well, what better way to combat a post-sandwich nap

538
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:28,468
than by talking about-

539
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:29,388
That Mike Finke always-

540
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:31,368
Is 1800s history.

541
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,068
Which is what I'm gonna dive into a little bit

542
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:35,388
because I wanted to know,

543
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:38,308
let's not just talk about the character Mike Finke.

544
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:41,728
Let's talk about the real man Mike Finke.

545
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:43,588
Jason, in our last Sea Ticket,

546
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:46,048
you talked about the tortilla factory

547
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:48,848
and uncovered some fairly nefarious stuff.

548
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:52,448
Get ready for more nefariousness.

549
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:55,148
Mike Finke is something else.

550
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:59,908
So he was a real captain of keel boats,

551
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:04,328
a big brawny guy along the old miss in the old Ohio River.

552
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:07,388
If you wanted to, you know,

553
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:09,088
I don't know if you wanted to cross

554
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:10,928
or go downstream for a while,

555
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:12,768
you had to talk to guys like this,

556
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:14,248
make some deal with them.

557
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:16,988
He knew how to tame the river.

558
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:21,828
So he was a necessary person to have around,

559
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:25,328
but maybe not the most savory man.

560
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:27,528
Now he is kind of a, you know,

561
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:28,948
he exists in sort of this,

562
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,068
adjacent to Davy Crockett,

563
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:34,168
he's kind of a rootin' tootin' tall tale kinda guy.

564
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:37,188
And there's some fun stories about him.

565
00:21:37,188 --> 00:21:39,868
Why it was said that he could drink a gallon of whiskey

566
00:21:39,868 --> 00:21:42,848
and shoot the tail off a pig at 90 paces.

567
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,768
And he claimed he could outrun, out hop, out jump,

568
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:49,448
throw down, drag out, and lick any man in the country.

569
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,768
And that's all fun.

570
00:21:50,948 --> 00:21:52,628
That sounds like Daniel Boone.

571
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:54,828
That's the Americana that we like.

572
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:57,848
The stories about him riding a moose like a horse.

573
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:58,508
That's fun.

574
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:00,748
Wrestling an alligator, okay.

575
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,388
Drowning wolves with his bare hands.

576
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:04,648
Okay, that's good.

577
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:06,588
We're getting more questionable.

578
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:08,128
I hope he needed to drown them.

579
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:09,728
If they were attacking him, I guess it makes sense.

580
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:10,908
If it was in self-defense,

581
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:12,728
and sure, that's still rootin' tootin',

582
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:13,908
but don't just go murderin' wolves.

583
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:16,488
Not the most efficient way to defend yourself from wolves.

584
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:19,148
And if you can shoot a pig from 90 paces,

585
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:21,968
why not just shoot the wolf, put it out of its misery,

586
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:23,468
instead of drownin' it slowly?

587
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:25,208
Shoot a wolf from five paces.

588
00:22:25,568 --> 00:22:26,848
Yeah, 10 paces easier.

589
00:22:26,988 --> 00:22:28,888
Yeah, yeah, don't put yourself out.

590
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:29,928
Don't walk so far.

591
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:34,388
But when you start looking into real tales about this man,

592
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:36,528
they were actually documented in newspapers.

593
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:38,748
They're less savory.

594
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:42,328
There's stuff about him, you know,

595
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:46,048
sayin', oh, I'm gonna shoot a ponytail off an engine.

596
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:51,048
That doesn't sound good to be shootin' it Indians.

597
00:22:52,328 --> 00:22:53,968
There's also, there is this one story,

598
00:22:54,228 --> 00:22:55,848
I'll say it really fast,

599
00:22:55,948 --> 00:22:57,348
because I told the long version to Erin,

600
00:22:57,388 --> 00:22:59,928
and she was like, do not tell this on the podcast.

601
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:04,468
But the story is that he saw a child with a heel

602
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,848
that was kind of a big weird heel.

603
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:08,188
It was kind of grotesque,

604
00:23:08,328 --> 00:23:10,028
and he decided to take care of it

605
00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:11,608
and shoot the kid in the foot.

606
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:12,188
What?

607
00:23:12,468 --> 00:23:16,268
And when he was brought to jail for this,

608
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:19,788
because the kid dropped to the ground screaming murderer,

609
00:23:20,628 --> 00:23:22,388
he said, well, you know,

610
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:24,188
I was just tryin' to fix his foot

611
00:23:24,188 --> 00:23:26,968
so it would fit into a nice genteel boot.

612
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:29,788
What's the long version of the story?

613
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:33,468
There's just worse, more graphic details.

614
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,548
Do you wanna hear that?

615
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,048
Cause I kinda do.

616
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:37,748
I don't know.

617
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:39,408
I think I got it.

618
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:39,948
I think.

619
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,528
Can you give me one really horrible detail about it?

620
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:46,148
What I'm dancing around is that this was a slave child.

621
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:47,508
Oh my God.

622
00:23:47,848 --> 00:23:48,568
Oh, nevermind.

623
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:49,068
It's truly hideous.

624
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:50,248
Do you hear what I'm saying?

625
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:51,728
This is not nice.

626
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:54,188
This is not, and the idea that this is routed around

627
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:56,128
to be folksy. Jesus Christ.

628
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:57,728
He wanted his foot to fit in a boot.

629
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:58,508
Oh, yeah, yeah.

630
00:23:58,508 --> 00:23:59,228
So I maimed him.

631
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:01,428
And this one's not like a tall tale.

632
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,088
There's like a, in a St. Louis newspaper,

633
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,828
it's like man arrested for.

634
00:24:04,828 --> 00:24:05,468
Jesus.

635
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:06,028
Yeah.

636
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:06,428
Shooting.

637
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:09,848
This is like, this is the actual version

638
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:13,468
of the murals in Pawnee City Hall on Parks and Rec

639
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:18,568
where they all commemorate ghoulish historical events.

640
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:20,928
It's not nice.

641
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:22,528
So think about that.

642
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:26,168
There is a ride named after a man who did this.

643
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,188
We got a hall of presidents though.

644
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:32,588
Well, that's full of chicanery, isn't it?

645
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:33,188
Yeah.

646
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:35,528
Yeah, they did a lot more than maim one kid's foot.

647
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:36,588
All the presidents collected.

648
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:41,468
So anyway, you know, this one's back into folksy territory.

649
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,868
He had a good friend named William Carpenter,

650
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:47,408
who was also a keelboat man.

651
00:24:47,428 --> 00:24:49,268
And they were said to have amused themselves

652
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:52,288
by shooting cups of whiskey from each other's heads.

653
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:53,608
It was William Tell style.

654
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:57,128
So they'd go 90 paces and then pull out their guns

655
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,488
and try to shoot the whiskey off each other's heads

656
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:01,728
without even making the cup move.

657
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:03,328
It just, then you just get the bing

658
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:05,828
and then the whiskey pours out onto their head.

659
00:25:05,848 --> 00:25:07,848
That's fun and folksy, right?

660
00:25:07,868 --> 00:25:08,508
Sure.

661
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:09,708
I like that.

662
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,528
But then things were all well and good

663
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:16,208
until these shooting sparring partners, Mike and William,

664
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,868
they said why they started sharing affections

665
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:22,548
for the same Indian girl who, if I had to guess,

666
00:25:22,848 --> 00:25:27,148
I would say she did not share affection for either of them.

667
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:28,388
And was she 11?

668
00:25:28,748 --> 00:25:30,128
Very possibly.

669
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:31,948
Probably?

670
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:33,548
You know, the more whiskey you drink,

671
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:34,768
the more you can't tell.

672
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,648
Not a lot of details, thankfully, but.

673
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:39,088
Because Pocahontas was like,

674
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:40,688
I learned this not too long ago.

675
00:25:40,928 --> 00:25:44,788
She was like 12 or 13 and John Smith was older.

676
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:48,248
Yeah, my fifth grade history teacher,

677
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:51,448
because I think Pocahontas had come out before,

678
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,828
in that summer and I started fifth grade

679
00:25:53,828 --> 00:25:57,188
and she was pissed about that movie

680
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,808
because she was like, we do American history.

681
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:04,568
Okay, so then take the Pocahontas movie out of your head.

682
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:08,588
She was so mad that she's had to correct all of this

683
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:11,408
odd stuff that was changed for the movie.

684
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:11,948
Right.

685
00:26:11,948 --> 00:26:14,028
Yeah, you know, there's that thing,

686
00:26:14,388 --> 00:26:17,468
there's that kind of snarky thing about how all the,

687
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:19,668
you know, Snow White and all the grim tales

688
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:22,308
are like actually full of horrors.

689
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:22,808
Right.

690
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,888
You know, yeah, she got her foot lacerated

691
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:29,248
and you know, it was crippled or whatever.

692
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:32,888
Like, that's the, I don't know, I don't need to,

693
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:35,268
of course, dress up the Little Mermaid,

694
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:36,728
make it a nice story.

695
00:26:36,768 --> 00:26:38,888
I don't need it to be full of trauma.

696
00:26:39,008 --> 00:26:39,308
Right.

697
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:43,148
But when you're taking real history and making it full.

698
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:43,628
Sanitizing it.

699
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:46,228
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and just not acknowledging things.

700
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:49,368
And I think they also, then, isn't the Pocahontas sequel

701
00:26:49,368 --> 00:26:52,648
straight to video about like, then she came back to,

702
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:54,968
she like goes back to England or something.

703
00:26:55,008 --> 00:26:57,028
Didn't she go back to England in real life?

704
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:58,748
Well, she went to England with them in real life

705
00:26:58,748 --> 00:26:59,028
and ended up marrying.

706
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:01,868
But in far more of a kidnap manner.

707
00:27:02,148 --> 00:27:04,448
Whoa, okay, if you think that maybe kidnapping

708
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:06,888
a 12 or 13 year old girl, maybe, yeah.

709
00:27:06,888 --> 00:27:08,128
I guess I could see that.

710
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,588
Use the word kidnapping, yes.

711
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:10,788
I think you could put up, yeah.

712
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:14,408
Did eventually marry an Englishman, but not John Smith.

713
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:17,148
Yeah, I also watched some weird special

714
00:27:17,148 --> 00:27:18,808
that was like promoting Pocahontas

715
00:27:18,808 --> 00:27:20,928
where Disney got a bunch of like school kids to,

716
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:23,088
tell the story of Pocahontas.

717
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:25,288
And then one of them towards the end,

718
00:27:25,488 --> 00:27:27,168
like, and John Smith was killed.

719
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,348
I forget the details, but they actually oddly

720
00:27:32,348 --> 00:27:34,008
do tell real stuff, but.

721
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:34,368
Right.

722
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,048
Cute and kidzzy.

723
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:39,388
A man accused him of cheating in a game of bar room poker

724
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:41,868
and put a knife through his skull.

725
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:45,248
He was dumped in a whiver, no thinking.

726
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:46,688
Even by pigs.

727
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:48,648
Just around a whiver, man.

728
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:50,568
He was murdered.

729
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:52,868
The real grandmother willow was cut down,

730
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:54,168
fed into a chipper.

731
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:59,148
So Mike Finck and William Carpenter got in a fight

732
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:02,948
and they were at odds for months, but then Mike said,

733
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,868
hey, why don't we put it aside and play our old fun game?

734
00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:08,228
Let's shoot whiskey off of each other's heads.

735
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:13,028
They set one of these games up 90 paces,

736
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:16,448
shot, Carpenter falls to the ground.

737
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:17,808
Whoops, oh, I missed.

738
00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:19,868
He was, he was shaking around.

739
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:21,348
What was I supposed to do?

740
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,148
Our game.

741
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,408
If only he hadn't jumped slightly,

742
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:29,048
I wouldn't have hit him square in the brain.

743
00:28:29,528 --> 00:28:32,228
So he passes it off as an accident,

744
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:35,748
but William Carpenter's best bud Levi Talbot,

745
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:38,828
he thinks something's fishy.

746
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,948
He lets months go by and he's like,

747
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:46,008
I think old Mike Finck was playing dirty there.

748
00:28:46,488 --> 00:28:47,848
Mike Funk, Mike Funk.

749
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:52,088
That's the way to bring the ride back is to,

750
00:28:52,088 --> 00:28:54,248
yeah, make it kind of a funk cruise.

751
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:55,408
Make it more of a-

752
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:56,908
King of the River dance, right?

753
00:28:57,888 --> 00:29:00,008
Wait, when you think of funky, you think of river dance?

754
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:02,408
No, I'm trying to think of King of the River.

755
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,028
Oh.

756
00:29:03,028 --> 00:29:04,688
What goes with river dance, okay.

757
00:29:05,448 --> 00:29:07,708
Well, one can be Celtic dancing

758
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,248
and one can be George Clinton.

759
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,688
I just like the idea that if you were like,

760
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:11,888
yeah, you know, I'm really into funk music

761
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:14,148
and Jason and his set is picturing Michael Flatley's

762
00:29:14,148 --> 00:29:14,688
load of the dance.

763
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:16,528
He's like, yeah, that is funky.

764
00:29:16,748 --> 00:29:18,448
Those guys know how to get funky.

765
00:29:18,948 --> 00:29:20,348
And most of all, it's fun.

766
00:29:22,388 --> 00:29:25,268
So this guy, Levi Talbot is like,

767
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:26,588
something's not right here.

768
00:29:26,588 --> 00:29:30,848
Almost immediately Mike Fink gets drunk and brags,

769
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:33,528
I shot him on purpose and I'm proud of it.

770
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,468
Levi Talbot immediately takes out a gun

771
00:29:35,468 --> 00:29:36,728
and shoots him in the heart.

772
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:40,068
So Levi Talbot gets vengeance for his friend,

773
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:43,548
William Carpenter, and he lives happily ever after

774
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:47,048
until several months later he drowns.

775
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:52,548
I love the barbaric nature of the crazy 1800s.

776
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:55,488
The barbaric nature keeps going in what I think

777
00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:57,788
is the cursed tale of Mike Fink

778
00:29:57,788 --> 00:29:59,888
where everything surrounding it is very grim

779
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:04,568
in that when his story is committed to celluloid

780
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:08,748
by Walt Disney in a fun riverboat race scene,

781
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,228
where do they film that scene?

782
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,628
But in beautiful Cave-In Rock, Illinois.

783
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:15,028
Oh my gosh. Oh yeah, yeah.

784
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:16,268
You know about Cave-In Rock?

785
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:16,728
Yeah, a little bit. I don't know

786
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:18,168
how close that is to you.

787
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:20,628
I mean, I know what it's famous for.

788
00:30:20,828 --> 00:30:22,248
You mean today? Today.

789
00:30:22,348 --> 00:30:24,188
Well, yes, of course, today.

790
00:30:24,788 --> 00:30:28,008
Well, not anymore, but for many years, the home of.

791
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:29,488
The gathering of the Juggalos.

792
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,388
Yeah. Indeed.

793
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:37,188
So today in the 2000s, it's best known as the place

794
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:39,068
where people peed on a watermelon

795
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:40,708
and threw it at Teela Tequila.

796
00:30:40,968 --> 00:30:46,208
But back in the past, it was a home

797
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,628
to river pirates and murderers.

798
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:52,468
And in fact, one particular cave was the hideout

799
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:56,068
of the Harpy Brothers, commonly known as America's

800
00:30:56,068 --> 00:31:00,308
first serial killers with over 40 kills to their name.

801
00:31:00,328 --> 00:31:06,128
These guys went around Ohio and Kentucky and they,

802
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:09,268
you know, they like killing and maiming.

803
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:12,688
And they eventually caught up with like a river pirate gang.

804
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:17,668
And they everybody had a shared interest in murdering.

805
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:21,048
But the Harpy Brothers were so aggressive in their murdering

806
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:24,128
that the river pirates were like, hey, maybe you want to get out here.

807
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:25,088
Maybe go somewhere else.

808
00:31:25,488 --> 00:31:27,068
So this is giving us a bad.

809
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:31,568
You're giving us river pirates a bad name hanging around with us.

810
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:34,388
Look, we don't believe in we believe in killing the people fast.

811
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:37,648
We don't believe in stripping them naked and throwing them off a cliff.

812
00:31:37,668 --> 00:31:43,148
Jesus gave in Rock, Illinois, the home to a lot of crazy stuff,

813
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:47,648
which in that light, Juggalos, all is forgiven.

814
00:31:48,048 --> 00:31:50,328
I mean, yeah, we had a fun race wheel.

815
00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:52,208
They had helicopter rides.

816
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,908
Oh, yeah. Helicopter.

817
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:55,228
Oh, helicopter rides.

818
00:31:55,868 --> 00:31:56,468
Those videos.

819
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:59,608
You'd have to be a net and hole to not enjoy those videos.

820
00:32:01,308 --> 00:32:02,188
That's the blue.

821
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:05,328
They go forever.

822
00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:10,748
I also well, as always, like in today's day, like how how like 10 years ago,

823
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:14,148
how when you like when Juggalo culture really was revived, you were like,

824
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,048
oh, my God, this is the dumbest, worst thing ever today.

825
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:19,848
In the light of the last couple of years in this country,

826
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:21,448
I love you, Juggalos.

827
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:22,568
I want to hug.

828
00:32:22,688 --> 00:32:24,328
I guess the Juggalos are allies.

829
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:26,908
They marched on Washington the same day.

830
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:27,988
Same day as that.

831
00:32:28,588 --> 00:32:30,928
One of those not the women's march, but a different march.

832
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:34,788
There was a like a hate march like an under like a Juggalos where they were marching

833
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,108
because they're on the FBI list.

834
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:38,968
Classified as a gang.

835
00:32:39,568 --> 00:32:39,688
Yeah. Yeah.

836
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,168
Yeah. I know.

837
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,728
I was saying concurrently to a hate.

838
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:43,488
I see. March.

839
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:46,228
No, no, I think it was a good it was a good march.

840
00:32:46,388 --> 00:32:46,988
No, no, no.

841
00:32:47,428 --> 00:32:49,208
It might have been concurrently with a hate march.

842
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:53,088
And then people were worried like Juggalos were going to get into it with the

843
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:54,088
the all right people or whatever.

844
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:57,788
Or or you were hoping that this they would take care of it for us.

845
00:32:57,948 --> 00:33:00,148
And we can really celebrate the Juggalos.

846
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:02,268
Do you want to take care of this? Help us.

847
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:09,828
Yeah. No, I love I look all their artists all watch their Western movies all day.

848
00:33:09,828 --> 00:33:11,328
They're big money wrestlers.

849
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:16,408
So anyway, a lot of stuff going on at Cave and Rock,

850
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:20,188
where the where this great keelboat scene was filmed.

851
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:23,528
Jason, as you alluded to, there is a race

852
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:28,148
between Mike Fink and Davy Crockett and Mike Fink loses the race,

853
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,628
which brings us to the Disneyland ride, which to sum up

854
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:36,028
everything we've learned so far, this is a ride named after

855
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:39,208
an old drunk murderer who lost a boat race.

856
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:45,568
And with that, let's take a little let's take a quick little break.

857
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:49,268
Jason, I'm taking your pattern from the last episode and you you threw out

858
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:52,828
a little like fun little questionnaire segments and I figure, well,

859
00:33:52,888 --> 00:33:54,848
that must be the pattern. Let's do that.

860
00:33:54,948 --> 00:33:57,228
So I'm going to pose a little thing to you guys.

861
00:33:57,288 --> 00:34:01,728
A little refresher after all that 1800s murdering.

862
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:07,848
And this is called Select Thy Sea Vessel. Oh, you guys both.

863
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:11,588
You have the day off and you're in a hub of water sports,

864
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:16,148
be it Lake Havasu, be it Key West, wherever you want that to be.

865
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,748
But what you can rent any boat you want.

866
00:34:20,068 --> 00:34:22,408
What are you renting? Are you a sailboat guy?

867
00:34:22,548 --> 00:34:26,968
Are you a keelboat guy? Are you is it a kayak? Is it a jet ski?

868
00:34:27,308 --> 00:34:29,948
What's your ultimate water sports day?

869
00:34:30,828 --> 00:34:32,988
It is. There's a multiple choice. No, it's free.

870
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:35,668
No, it's open ended. Any any vessel you want to ride?

871
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:38,028
OK, it's I would rent. I have an easy answer for this.

872
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:42,028
It's it's this it's the Lagoon by Disney in Disney World,

873
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:47,688
and it's driving around the boat from Thunder and Paradise. Oh, nice.

874
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:53,308
So like a nightboat style with massive interior, the massive room.

875
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:55,608
And it doesn't make any sense.

876
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:57,728
It's like Mary Poppins's bag or something.

877
00:34:58,228 --> 00:34:59,348
But it's driving on.

878
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:02,248
I really should know the name of the boat from Thunder and Paradise,

879
00:35:02,328 --> 00:35:05,408
which is, you know, should the whole code

880
00:35:05,748 --> 00:35:10,268
the Hulk Hogan syndicated show that was supposed to be like the new Baywatch,

881
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:14,108
which boy, if there was ever a Baywatch episode waiting to happen,

882
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:15,868
it's Thunder and Paradise. Yes.

883
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:22,528
Hulk has some problematic stuff recently, but at the time, no one knew.

884
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:25,748
And it was just everyone was in love with Hulk Hogan.

885
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:28,248
And everyone was certainly in love with Jack Lemmon's son,

886
00:35:28,488 --> 00:35:32,748
the other star of the show, who you cannot watch the show

887
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:36,368
without just constantly like seeing a vision of Jack Lemmon

888
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:40,928
laid over his son's face and going, ah, didn't help that he his birth name

889
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,828
is Johnny Lime.

890
00:35:42,888 --> 00:35:46,568
Well done.

891
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:49,628
The boat's name was just Thunder.

892
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,328
OK, that makes sense.

893
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:53,188
And Hulk Hogan played Randolph J.

894
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:56,988
Hurricane Spencer, Randolph J.

895
00:35:57,248 --> 00:36:01,688
Hurricane Spencer, Chris Lemon as Martin Brew, Brew Baker,

896
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:04,408
Carol Alt as Kelly LaRue.

897
00:36:04,948 --> 00:36:06,528
And then, you know, some other people.

898
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:08,768
That's sort of a hell in test where she doesn't get a nickname.

899
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:09,848
Right. She isn't fun.

900
00:36:10,088 --> 00:36:14,768
Films what at MGM Studios and on Bay Lake with the Polynesian in the background

901
00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:16,988
and Floridian in the opening, especially.

902
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:19,248
You can always see a hotel in the background.

903
00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:21,228
Yeah. Yeah. And if it was a hit,

904
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,948
the NWO may have never formed in wrestling because he didn't want

905
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:26,588
to necessarily be wrestling anymore.

906
00:36:26,588 --> 00:36:29,048
And if that had been a big hit, he would have just been an actor.

907
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:31,468
Wow. So how about that?

908
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:33,408
So, you know, he might have been like transitioned out.

909
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:36,748
But yeah, I think he was like trying to like make a rock thing,

910
00:36:36,788 --> 00:36:37,788
like get out of it.

911
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,528
Well, I believe I think this was on

912
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:46,968
Jim Hill podcast that Hogan just kept getting them to move the shooting

913
00:36:46,968 --> 00:36:49,388
closer and closer to his house.

914
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:51,448
Yeah, he did not want to leave Florida.

915
00:36:52,248 --> 00:36:56,028
I think a few people still Kevin James has that too, right?

916
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:59,148
He has like a big building right by his house where he shoots

917
00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:01,088
or where he shot that sitcom.

918
00:37:01,408 --> 00:37:02,608
Isn't that over now?

919
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:03,328
Kevin can wait.

920
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,948
We wasn't filming a studio.

921
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:07,548
It was only I think it was filmed in New York.

922
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:10,328
It was built sound stages for it.

923
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,688
Right. He only had to drive 10 minutes down the road.

924
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:15,008
Yeah. Oh, so that's nice.

925
00:37:15,308 --> 00:37:18,488
Yeah. He seems like a great guy.

926
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:23,628
Well, Jason selects the AC.

927
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:27,248
OK, well, you know, the more I thought about it,

928
00:37:27,248 --> 00:37:28,748
I've never ridden a jet ski.

929
00:37:28,808 --> 00:37:29,888
I'd be curious to do that.

930
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:32,028
But I think on a lake, I'd feel more comfortable.

931
00:37:32,408 --> 00:37:34,888
But once you brought up fictional stuff in Florida,

932
00:37:35,008 --> 00:37:37,948
I was thinking like, you know, what would be cool?

933
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:44,448
We ride this cigarette boat out of Miami as dawn is breaking with.

934
00:37:44,688 --> 00:37:49,668
Is it Crockett and Tubbs and Crockett?

935
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:52,988
But Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, Tubbs and Crockett.

936
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:55,908
Oh, while encore, while the Jay-Z,

937
00:37:55,908 --> 00:37:59,828
Lincoln Park encore is playing like in Miami Vice, the movie.

938
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:04,928
And everything is that odd blue, blue,

939
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:11,668
glowing blue from digital video technology of 2006 or whatever.

940
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:16,268
That's crazy. The answer does it like I would have thought

941
00:38:16,268 --> 00:38:20,128
you were going for like Riverboat in the bayou, like I like a true

942
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:24,228
Riverboat experience. You're on the veranda veranda.

943
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:26,588
You're like sipping a mint julep.

944
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:29,128
Oh, that's how I dress as an old timey colonel.

945
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:32,048
I feel like I feel like seven kids.

946
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:34,768
They're all around you. Various interests.

947
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:39,468
I you know, I didn't want to say sailboat because I don't I'm not good with knots.

948
00:38:39,828 --> 00:38:45,888
I'm really I was late learning how to tie my shoes like well, after everyone else.

949
00:38:46,168 --> 00:38:48,328
I think I was I was very late time.

950
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:52,848
I think you, Michael, taught me how to when you showed me how you tied a tie.

951
00:38:52,848 --> 00:38:54,048
I think that's what it's like.

952
00:38:54,048 --> 00:38:55,188
Is that right? Yeah.

953
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:57,228
Oh, interesting. I don't even remember that.

954
00:38:58,008 --> 00:39:00,548
So yeah, I am your father.

955
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:03,968
You are. So but Riverboat.

956
00:39:04,128 --> 00:39:05,888
Yeah, I mean, Riverboat sipping a jewel up.

957
00:39:06,088 --> 00:39:07,208
That could be nice, too. Yeah.

958
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,808
And I might have snuck in there as a decent.

959
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:13,448
Yeah. Well, I've always been interested in fan boats, not interested enough to ride one.

960
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:15,788
I just like the idea of them and that they're out there.

961
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:18,788
I probably should write a fan boat at some point in my life.

962
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:22,428
But, you know, my answer is I spent a lot of time in Newport Beach.

963
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:27,088
Oh, yeah. I didn't live there, but my dad took me down there all the time.

964
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:33,448
He had a little sailboat stored down there and the name of the boat was Drunky

965
00:39:33,448 --> 00:39:39,488
with two E's and I was always so delighted to climb aboard Drunky.

966
00:39:40,368 --> 00:39:42,108
Wow. Bury the lead on that one.

967
00:39:42,368 --> 00:39:44,608
Bury the lead, Rummy.

968
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:48,788
Yeah. Where did I get it from?

969
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:51,408
Wow. No, excellent.

970
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:52,368
Excellent name.

971
00:39:52,368 --> 00:39:56,048
You know, I, you know, he had to he had to let the boat go

972
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:59,668
and it was probably decaying beyond repair.

973
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:03,628
But if I could, if we could get the old Drunky back and get me and my dad

974
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:09,748
on the water and in absence of that, Mike, you've joined me on a on a pontoon.

975
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:10,668
Oh, yeah. Very fun.

976
00:40:10,668 --> 00:40:12,248
Excursion, I think.

977
00:40:12,248 --> 00:40:13,388
Chase, you were invited.

978
00:40:13,548 --> 00:40:15,008
I think you just weren't around, right?

979
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:16,108
You weren't on the pontoon.

980
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,568
And I'm forget it. Yeah, I think I was out of town.

981
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:20,248
I was not on the pontoon.

982
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:21,728
You know, I don't turn down.

983
00:40:21,728 --> 00:40:22,768
I didn't invite you.

984
00:40:23,148 --> 00:40:26,548
You know, I don't turn down a chance to get on a boat.

985
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:27,828
Yeah, yeah.

986
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:28,908
You load that up.

987
00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:32,548
You got I mean, in my head immediately, you got to ride like the wind.

988
00:40:32,588 --> 00:40:36,548
You got some Miami sound machines, some one, two, three.

989
00:40:36,988 --> 00:40:40,908
Come on, baby, say you love me and since some some Mike McD sweet freedom,

990
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:44,928
you load up all those songs, gets some pop, some champagne.

991
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:48,328
And I think you let me play Fins from Jimmy Buffett.

992
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:49,868
I think that was where you drew the line.

993
00:40:49,868 --> 00:40:50,768
Fins is the F.S.

994
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,828
Fins has shown up on some like summer mixes for me,

995
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:57,308
which is the only acceptable Buffett song to me.

996
00:40:57,468 --> 00:41:01,048
Right. It's the only one I can tolerate partially because of the fun dance

997
00:41:01,048 --> 00:41:02,248
that goes along with it.

998
00:41:02,248 --> 00:41:04,648
It's got a great dance with a little fin on your head.

999
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:07,688
You don't listen to he went to Paris and think about your life.

1000
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:10,088
Well, I haven't yet.

1001
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:11,648
Maybe I'm missing out on something big.

1002
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:14,728
Jason is big on the slow Buffett songs.

1003
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:18,408
He's big on the really contemplative ballads.

1004
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:20,468
He likes fruitcakes.

1005
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:24,988
I will play for gumbo.

1006
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,448
Cheeseburger paradise, because you really got to think about

1007
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:29,108
what you want on your burger that day.

1008
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:30,408
Lots of different kinds of burgers.

1009
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:31,888
It's not one kind of hamburger.

1010
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:33,668
It's pretty heavy. You have to limit it.

1011
00:41:33,668 --> 00:41:36,908
It would be good if Buffett like I watched that Springsteen

1012
00:41:36,908 --> 00:41:40,968
Netflix thing recently, and he does a very slow, acoustic

1013
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:43,008
12 string born in the USA.

1014
00:41:43,248 --> 00:41:47,268
And it's like, I was born in the US like it's very different vibe.

1015
00:41:47,268 --> 00:41:49,588
And it would be great if Buffett did a similar cheeseburger

1016
00:41:49,588 --> 00:41:53,708
in paradise, like a minor key mournful cheeseburger paradise.

1017
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:56,868
It really puts the context like put a different context on the song.

1018
00:41:57,268 --> 00:42:00,868
You make you think it was the that he's like a ghost

1019
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:03,288
and the cheeseburger killed him. Yeah, exactly.

1020
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:05,888
There's suddenly a subtext to it. Sure.

1021
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:09,648
I rewrote it. So now it's about a cheeseburger kill me.

1022
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:11,428
I'm a ghost. Here we go.

1023
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,728
I wrote in two seconds.

1024
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:15,128
Just change the game to me.

1025
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:20,988
Well, let's climb on back the keel boats and

1026
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:26,808
talk about the actual ride again, the the the drunk murdering

1027
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:28,028
boat race loser ride.

1028
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:33,908
It's so you see you got two boats, Gully one per birth of May.

1029
00:42:34,308 --> 00:42:36,268
As I said, it's for this fun little jokes.

1030
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:40,708
They open this thing up in Disney World to people seem to like it

1031
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:44,848
because it added to the the kinetic energy and energy of the river

1032
00:42:44,848 --> 00:42:47,108
to say thing we often say about over in tomorrowland.

1033
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:51,008
And some people feel like the the river isn't the same without

1034
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:53,748
without those boats going around.

1035
00:42:54,228 --> 00:42:58,328
I also learned from my friend, Dennis McNicholas, that there I asked

1036
00:42:58,328 --> 00:42:59,188
if he had any memories.

1037
00:42:59,668 --> 00:43:03,248
The keel boat, he never he never went on it, but he does remember

1038
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:08,428
very specifically that there was something that there was a shop,

1039
00:43:08,808 --> 00:43:13,688
a little little store, a merch stand called Keel Boat Shop.

1040
00:43:13,868 --> 00:43:17,168
And you might ask what they sell keel boat shop.

1041
00:43:17,348 --> 00:43:21,848
I would they sell they sold exclusively haunted mansion merchandise.

1042
00:43:21,848 --> 00:43:27,988
And OK. And in fact, when you looked it up on the map,

1043
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:32,528
it would say keel boat shop, your home for all the best haunted mansion

1044
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:35,408
memorabilia. So it was never related to the keel boats.

1045
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:38,468
I don't know why it was eventually it eventually was renamed

1046
00:43:38,468 --> 00:43:39,708
Ichabod's Landing.

1047
00:43:39,928 --> 00:43:42,028
And now it is storage.

1048
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:44,868
So that's the story of keel boat shop.

1049
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:49,208
And that was that in Florida or that was Florida, where I believe

1050
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:54,148
the boats left from Liberty Square, which is where the haunted mansion is.

1051
00:43:54,168 --> 00:43:55,548
Yeah. And now they have that.

1052
00:43:55,548 --> 00:44:00,948
The the memento mori is the haunted mansion shop and is hugely successful.

1053
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,528
They were like, oh, now they're very committed to a haunted mansion store.

1054
00:44:04,548 --> 00:44:08,808
Crazy that it took them that long to build a haunted mansion based store. Right.

1055
00:44:08,848 --> 00:44:10,408
Mm hmm. Yeah.

1056
00:44:10,428 --> 00:44:13,508
Well, but keel boat shop had you covered for a while.

1057
00:44:13,508 --> 00:44:14,168
Well, that's true.

1058
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:17,708
The other thing I learned that's very strange is that, you know,

1059
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:21,828
you had to be more than just a funny comedian and voice actor to drive these boats.

1060
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:24,688
These were pretty serious vessels, harder to pilot than.

1061
00:44:25,388 --> 00:44:29,268
Yeah. Then some of the bigger boats and and certainly more so than Jungle Cruise.

1062
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:34,988
And apparently the boats were powerful enough to operate as tugboats

1063
00:44:34,988 --> 00:44:36,568
if the train or the Columbia.

1064
00:44:37,128 --> 00:44:39,528
Whoa. I didn't read that. Isn't that odd?

1065
00:44:39,528 --> 00:44:41,048
I don't know if that ever happened.

1066
00:44:41,048 --> 00:44:42,828
I don't know if they were ever employed for that.

1067
00:44:42,828 --> 00:44:46,288
But yeah, it would serve a practical function to rescue the Mark Twain.

1068
00:44:46,408 --> 00:44:48,348
The motors were that strong.

1069
00:44:48,948 --> 00:44:51,668
I guess. I don't know. I don't know how tugboats work.

1070
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:54,308
I mean, it's just kind of momentum and yeah.

1071
00:44:54,868 --> 00:44:55,448
Yeah. I don't know.

1072
00:44:55,448 --> 00:45:00,248
It's like how a pickup truck can drive, like pull a giant parade float.

1073
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:01,468
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1074
00:45:01,468 --> 00:45:04,648
And now they have to attach a canoe to pull it.

1075
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:07,968
So you have to have some tourists pull the twain into dock.

1076
00:45:07,968 --> 00:45:10,288
They start yelling for guests. Come on.

1077
00:45:10,388 --> 00:45:12,668
We need your help. We need our strongest guests.

1078
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:18,228
So keel boats running without incident, never that popular,

1079
00:45:18,268 --> 00:45:22,508
but a good eater of sea tickets went seasonal around 1994,

1080
00:45:22,908 --> 00:45:28,108
not operating all the time, just in peak seasons and one dreaded peak season.

1081
00:45:28,388 --> 00:45:32,128
Something happened at around 5 30 p.m.

1082
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:36,788
on May 17th, 1997, the gully whomper began rocking from side to side.

1083
00:45:36,788 --> 00:45:38,948
It was loaded with 49 guests.

1084
00:45:38,948 --> 00:45:41,068
The normal capacity is 32.

1085
00:45:41,568 --> 00:45:43,268
Yeah. What happened? I read about this too.

1086
00:45:43,348 --> 00:45:46,248
Like what? No one has a good answer for why.

1087
00:45:46,908 --> 00:45:49,008
Not even by off by three or four. Yeah, right.

1088
00:45:49,008 --> 00:45:52,528
Like, oh, OK, we can fit your extra couple of people from your party.

1089
00:45:52,788 --> 00:45:54,968
It's like a load 15 moron.

1090
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:56,328
Yeah, I don't know.

1091
00:45:56,488 --> 00:45:59,028
Asking for trouble and trouble they got.

1092
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:00,848
It rocked back and forth.

1093
00:46:00,908 --> 00:46:04,368
The gully whomper tipped over, dunking a boatload of guests

1094
00:46:04,368 --> 00:46:06,468
into the rivers of America.

1095
00:46:06,788 --> 00:46:09,748
I also heard stories of like people from the canoes

1096
00:46:09,748 --> 00:46:12,988
jumping out of the canoes to help people. Right. Right.

1097
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:15,348
As there were kids and a pregnant woman.

1098
00:46:15,348 --> 00:46:19,148
And now everybody was fine and the injuries were only minor.

1099
00:46:19,228 --> 00:46:20,548
But they did have to go to the hospital.

1100
00:46:20,688 --> 00:46:23,588
People went to the hospital and you're done for the done in the park

1101
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:25,708
for that day and your clothes are wet.

1102
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:29,448
And some of the dirtiest water there could ever be.

1103
00:46:29,468 --> 00:46:32,488
Seems like one of the incidents where you end up with a settlement

1104
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:36,568
and then a black car like a lifetime Disney pass.

1105
00:46:36,748 --> 00:46:37,468
I hope so.

1106
00:46:37,488 --> 00:46:39,928
But they're like they can be cheapskates a little bit.

1107
00:46:39,928 --> 00:46:41,848
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

1108
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:42,948
I that is a question.

1109
00:46:43,088 --> 00:46:46,768
I mean, I'm assuming once stuff like this happens, there's an NDA sign.

1110
00:46:47,088 --> 00:46:48,648
But some agreement is reached.

1111
00:46:49,028 --> 00:46:52,468
And I would love to know on any of these incidents what happened.

1112
00:46:53,368 --> 00:46:55,528
Like, did they get what do they get?

1113
00:46:55,928 --> 00:46:58,708
Learning more because those NDAs don't last forever.

1114
00:46:58,948 --> 00:46:59,928
Isn't there a period?

1115
00:47:00,228 --> 00:47:01,868
I guess it depends on each NDA.

1116
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:03,368
I don't know. I don't know.

1117
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,408
For more stuff to start getting released.

1118
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:08,388
Mm hmm. Well, that's the Stormy Daniels with that.

1119
00:47:08,448 --> 00:47:09,648
No, that wasn't that it ran out.

1120
00:47:09,768 --> 00:47:11,128
It's that she was just she just broke it.

1121
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,648
Screw it. Yeah.

1122
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:16,908
So maybe Michael Avenatti can look into this stuff for us

1123
00:47:16,908 --> 00:47:20,868
and find out what these people got in exchange for being dumped

1124
00:47:20,868 --> 00:47:22,548
out of this boat because it was overloaded.

1125
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,328
Very reliable litigator.

1126
00:47:24,328 --> 00:47:26,888
Well, he just he digs, you know.

1127
00:47:26,888 --> 00:47:31,668
Well, I don't want to distract from the doings of our next president.

1128
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:32,608
Yeah, good point.

1129
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:37,128
Let's let's let him have eyes on the prize.

1130
00:47:37,628 --> 00:47:40,608
So that was it.

1131
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:43,068
That was the end of this at Disneyland.

1132
00:47:43,428 --> 00:47:44,728
They didn't repair it.

1133
00:47:44,848 --> 00:47:46,408
That was it was done.

1134
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:49,288
And I wonder if it was without that sea ticket thing.

1135
00:47:49,688 --> 00:47:52,208
Maybe the popularity just wasn't worth it.

1136
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:54,868
It was I don't know, Disneyland.

1137
00:47:55,488 --> 00:47:57,868
The accidents not that common also.

1138
00:47:57,928 --> 00:47:58,668
And that came out.

1139
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:00,928
And I think they're probably just like, well, let's not even

1140
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:02,148
these things are tainted.

1141
00:48:02,348 --> 00:48:04,888
Let's not slow capacity to.

1142
00:48:05,288 --> 00:48:08,168
Yeah. So it's like requires special training for these captains.

1143
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:10,828
And yeah, it just wasn't worth it.

1144
00:48:11,148 --> 00:48:14,048
Labor costs, because then you have to train and pay the people more

1145
00:48:14,048 --> 00:48:15,128
because they're doing more.

1146
00:48:15,328 --> 00:48:19,968
Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, more transportation is nice.

1147
00:48:19,988 --> 00:48:22,348
That's the only that's the only downside.

1148
00:48:22,468 --> 00:48:23,988
It would have been fun to go on these.

1149
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:28,268
They do feel like a little more of a to do not fully canoe level to do.

1150
00:48:28,268 --> 00:48:31,728
But you got to the canoes and like the raft to Tom Sawyer.

1151
00:48:31,728 --> 00:48:33,028
You got to wait in that little area.

1152
00:48:33,568 --> 00:48:36,488
I don't know. It always feels like I feel like I guess what I'm saying

1153
00:48:36,488 --> 00:48:39,308
is I wouldn't go on these a lot if they still existed.

1154
00:48:39,308 --> 00:48:42,788
Yeah. But it would be nice to once in a while go on them.

1155
00:48:43,028 --> 00:48:46,008
Yeah. And we like our once in a while attractions and idea.

1156
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:49,228
This would be in the mix, especially now where I go so often

1157
00:48:49,228 --> 00:48:52,588
and would be looking to, you know, mix it up and sure.

1158
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:54,928
And off the off the beaten path. Right.

1159
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,028
But they are no longer.

1160
00:48:57,028 --> 00:49:00,988
And in fact, the the boats are not around.

1161
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:04,748
You could they're not see fairing anymore.

1162
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:09,268
The gullywumper, one of them, the one that sank

1163
00:49:09,268 --> 00:49:14,128
or the one that tipped over was installed as a prop along the rivers of America

1164
00:49:14,128 --> 00:49:19,748
in 2003, where it slowly deteriorated and sank into the land of the rivers.

1165
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,048
Oh, so then.

1166
00:49:21,228 --> 00:49:23,348
But there's a gullywumper there now.

1167
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:25,468
I yeah. And it's I believe it's a recreation.

1168
00:49:25,668 --> 00:49:29,348
2010, they put it there because like, OK, that was when I first started.

1169
00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:33,508
I mean, I've gone before 2010, but I think around 2010, 2011,

1170
00:49:33,508 --> 00:49:37,028
I got an annual pass and then started going a lot more.

1171
00:49:37,028 --> 00:49:41,928
And I always remember it being there because I didn't go a lot before.

1172
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:42,908
OK, yeah. Gotcha.

1173
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:46,528
Well, yeah, I think it's labeled the gullywumper, but it is not that actual.

1174
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:51,588
Yeah, OK. Because it sank and I guess is just out of there entirely.

1175
00:49:52,008 --> 00:49:54,148
But what of the birth of May?

1176
00:49:54,148 --> 00:49:55,508
Yes. What of the birthday?

1177
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,728
And I know, Mike, do you know?

1178
00:49:57,868 --> 00:49:59,508
I don't know. Oh, boy.

1179
00:49:59,588 --> 00:50:01,488
I was really hoping you wouldn't figure it out.

1180
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:03,808
I figured it out. I know now. I forgot.

1181
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:05,248
Well, then let me know.

1182
00:50:05,728 --> 00:50:06,748
I know. I know. I know. I know.

1183
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:09,448
The other boats, the birth of May

1184
00:50:09,448 --> 00:50:16,608
suddenly in the early 2000s was listed on eBay for a fairly small asking price.

1185
00:50:16,648 --> 00:50:18,328
Yeah. $15,000.

1186
00:50:18,968 --> 00:50:23,408
And from that eBay listing, it was bought by Richard Kraft.

1187
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:27,728
Richard Kraft, the man who behind the that's from Disneyland

1188
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:33,328
Gallery, who we interviewed on the show and who who sold off all that memorabilia

1189
00:50:33,328 --> 00:50:34,888
and who took us to Club 33.

1190
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:37,808
But didn't sell this.

1191
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:42,108
He did. In fact, I checked in with a craft.

1192
00:50:42,588 --> 00:50:43,868
I asked, what is the deal?

1193
00:50:44,168 --> 00:50:48,868
He alerted me to the documentary that was made about them

1194
00:50:48,868 --> 00:50:53,448
finding craft land in which he takes you to see the boat.

1195
00:50:53,868 --> 00:50:58,108
Now, at the time, it was at a storage facility in La Mirada.

1196
00:50:59,088 --> 00:51:01,468
And he walks for so long.

1197
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:05,248
He just walks and walks past like covered thing after covered thing.

1198
00:51:05,348 --> 00:51:06,528
Unclear if it's all his.

1199
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:08,128
But I wouldn't put it past him.

1200
00:51:08,748 --> 00:51:14,428
He unfurls a sheet, gets up on the deck and dances and dances and dances a lot.

1201
00:51:14,548 --> 00:51:17,668
They devote a lot of the documentary to him dancing on the boat.

1202
00:51:18,968 --> 00:51:23,848
Now, he specifically said he was not didn't ever go on this.

1203
00:51:23,928 --> 00:51:28,688
It seemed weird and sad to him as I was sort of my thinking as well.

1204
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:33,768
But when it came up for auction, it was, you know, it had to be done.

1205
00:51:33,868 --> 00:51:35,008
The price was good.

1206
00:51:35,068 --> 00:51:37,308
Yes. You can't beat that price.

1207
00:51:38,068 --> 00:51:40,528
Even in even in 2001 dollars.

1208
00:51:41,008 --> 00:51:44,588
His idea was to have it craned over his home

1209
00:51:44,588 --> 00:51:48,308
where he and eventually build a lagoon in his backyard.

1210
00:51:48,868 --> 00:51:53,328
He wanted to do a little like picnic area with the keelboats of the centerpiece,

1211
00:51:53,348 --> 00:51:56,128
like the chicken of the sea ship in fantasy land.

1212
00:51:56,628 --> 00:52:00,248
And after a few meetings with various engineers and his business manager,

1213
00:52:00,428 --> 00:52:02,288
reality kicked in.

1214
00:52:03,128 --> 00:52:05,368
And it has been in storage ever since.

1215
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:11,708
So the dream of a lagoon installed in his home didn't work out.

1216
00:52:12,828 --> 00:52:14,128
But he did. Yeah.

1217
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:18,108
This was one of the things that spurred that auction was that he had.

1218
00:52:18,108 --> 00:52:19,688
So as he told us, there's so much stuff

1219
00:52:19,688 --> 00:52:22,328
it was just sitting around that he never even got to enjoy.

1220
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,988
He had no end that to move that thing.

1221
00:52:24,988 --> 00:52:29,568
He never got to enjoy the the the birth of May in his own home.

1222
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:33,248
So he sold it and it was part of the auction.

1223
00:52:33,548 --> 00:52:37,168
Apparently, at the auction, there was like a cutout of it, like representing it.

1224
00:52:37,328 --> 00:52:42,108
They never moved it in the sports authority, but it was sold.

1225
00:52:42,128 --> 00:52:44,048
And I don't want to say the name, but I did hear the name.

1226
00:52:44,048 --> 00:52:48,368
And it is to like a very to a major, major Disney collector.

1227
00:52:48,508 --> 00:52:52,448
So it seems possible that this could end up

1228
00:52:52,448 --> 00:52:55,568
being available to see at some point in time.

1229
00:52:56,948 --> 00:53:01,468
Yeah. When you said craned over his home, I imagine it being

1230
00:53:01,468 --> 00:53:05,868
put on top of the home and like an Admiral Halsey,

1231
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:10,868
very sort of set up where you could just look out from the keel boat.

1232
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:12,668
Oh, I like that. Oh, like it's a little.

1233
00:53:12,928 --> 00:53:14,288
Oh, that's a cool idea.

1234
00:53:14,288 --> 00:53:17,288
Yeah. A little like, what do you call the little like port?

1235
00:53:17,448 --> 00:53:20,648
Like the little crows nest. Oh, there you go. Yeah. Yeah.

1236
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:24,428
Oh, man. Having all crows nest in your house. Awesome idea.

1237
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:25,388
Yeah, that'd be great.

1238
00:53:25,688 --> 00:53:26,968
Well, he missed out.

1239
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:29,688
Should have done. I'm sure smashing a big hole into your roof

1240
00:53:29,688 --> 00:53:34,128
and perfectly installing an old boat in it is more cost effective.

1241
00:53:34,248 --> 00:53:37,668
Architecturally sound in a state known for earthquakes.

1242
00:53:38,908 --> 00:53:42,028
Yeah. And I feel like I know he lived in like the, you know, in the hills.

1243
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:44,408
So like, yeah, should be fine.

1244
00:53:45,268 --> 00:53:49,408
The boat should slide down the hill and take out people along the way.

1245
00:53:50,308 --> 00:53:52,988
We get a few more Patreon subscribers, a couple more Jason.

1246
00:53:53,008 --> 00:53:56,108
You'll be able to finally afford this and buy it from that collector

1247
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,648
and then you'll be able to do that.

1248
00:53:57,648 --> 00:54:01,288
Great. And assuming that the price did not go up.

1249
00:54:01,368 --> 00:54:03,308
Yeah, no, it stays the same.

1250
00:54:03,588 --> 00:54:06,148
Which we can trust being that in that auction, you know,

1251
00:54:06,228 --> 00:54:08,788
a plate would go for four thousand dollars.

1252
00:54:09,048 --> 00:54:11,508
Yeah. And then when I say a couple more Patreon subscribers,

1253
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:16,748
each of them are pledging five thousand dollars a month for this content.

1254
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:19,868
There's only one person who could do that, and it's Richard Kraft.

1255
00:54:20,168 --> 00:54:21,348
Yes, that's true.

1256
00:54:22,668 --> 00:54:24,748
He wants the boat to be back in good hands.

1257
00:54:25,448 --> 00:54:26,828
So that's that's the story.

1258
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:30,888
The fact that it ended with a character we know. Yeah.

1259
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:34,568
I don't think I realize when you said when it was sold at auction,

1260
00:54:34,568 --> 00:54:36,948
it was that auction. Yeah. Yeah.

1261
00:54:36,948 --> 00:54:41,188
Yeah. It was in because a lot of these articles left it at it's just in storage.

1262
00:54:42,048 --> 00:54:42,808
Nothing ever began.

1263
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:48,548
But at are the right below where we were performing our now legendary show.

1264
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:51,548
And yes, we did walk around the floor a bit.

1265
00:54:51,548 --> 00:54:53,488
And we're calling it.

1266
00:54:53,488 --> 00:54:56,048
Yeah, I don't know. There was just so much stuff there.

1267
00:54:56,088 --> 00:55:01,028
And I thought about going the last the last day or the day before it ended.

1268
00:55:01,308 --> 00:55:04,228
But there there's social media updates were so like

1269
00:55:04,248 --> 00:55:06,308
the line is to venture.

1270
00:55:06,648 --> 00:55:07,948
I know. I didn't think we did.

1271
00:55:07,948 --> 00:55:09,428
I was worried we wouldn't get in for our own.

1272
00:55:09,428 --> 00:55:10,328
I would get it. Yeah.

1273
00:55:10,428 --> 00:55:15,028
And also like some of the people who bought like like now we know some of the

1274
00:55:15,028 --> 00:55:18,388
the giant D from the Disneyland Hotel that was the big centerpiece of it

1275
00:55:18,388 --> 00:55:22,588
is in David Copperfield's airplane hangar in Las Vegas.

1276
00:55:23,408 --> 00:55:27,348
And another a couple of the small world dolls were bought by

1277
00:55:27,348 --> 00:55:29,948
what's your name? Chris Jenner. Yeah. Right.

1278
00:55:30,068 --> 00:55:31,268
And given to Chloe.

1279
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:32,548
Chloe Kardashian.

1280
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:36,208
Yes, because we were that that's how cool and with it we are.

1281
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:40,228
We were texting around Christmas trying to figure out which card.

1282
00:55:40,288 --> 00:55:41,588
It's like, wait, so close. No.

1283
00:55:42,168 --> 00:55:44,568
So what? Who had which guy?

1284
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:48,088
Which which boyfriend or husband had the sock company?

1285
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:50,448
Oh, no. And then but who's with Travis Scott?

1286
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:55,048
Like I like I know all the weird facts about the Kardashians,

1287
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:59,548
but I can't remember which one has the incredibly successful makeup.

1288
00:55:59,868 --> 00:56:02,068
Yeah, which is a legitimate entrepreneur.

1289
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:04,328
Is Scott Disick the one with the sock company?

1290
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:10,488
No, I think because Scott Disick was the one who was on vacation.

1291
00:56:10,788 --> 00:56:12,448
I think it's Rob Kardashian.

1292
00:56:12,948 --> 00:56:15,108
OK, fine. Fair. I don't know.

1293
00:56:15,268 --> 00:56:15,928
That could be right.

1294
00:56:16,228 --> 00:56:19,528
But then one of the women bought in bought a big share of it.

1295
00:56:19,528 --> 00:56:21,348
I don't think that sock company is doing well.

1296
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:22,108
That's too bad.

1297
00:56:22,168 --> 00:56:25,328
All I know is that Chris Jenner bought these dolls and Chris Jenner

1298
00:56:25,328 --> 00:56:28,548
is did the only bit of Kardashian related media that I care about,

1299
00:56:28,548 --> 00:56:32,308
which is a song for her own birthday party called I Love My Friends,

1300
00:56:32,788 --> 00:56:36,608
in which all of her friends bizarrely yell at the camera.

1301
00:56:36,888 --> 00:56:38,468
She she loves you.

1302
00:56:38,868 --> 00:56:39,908
She loves you.

1303
00:56:40,128 --> 00:56:43,248
And some and one of the friends, of course, is Ornithal James Simpson.

1304
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:49,288
Of course, a montage of shots of the Kardashians and OJ Nicole together.

1305
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:52,768
A blast. Look that up if you've never seen it.

1306
00:56:52,768 --> 00:56:53,588
Oh, so good.

1307
00:56:53,808 --> 00:56:57,148
And there's a lot of good, you know, there's a good I Love the Farm,

1308
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:58,208
not very far impaired.

1309
00:56:58,388 --> 00:57:01,048
So too many good I love right to even get into.

1310
00:57:01,428 --> 00:57:04,148
But let's let's bring the ship back to the dock.

1311
00:57:05,228 --> 00:57:08,188
It is sorry it is Scott Dissick has the sock company.

1312
00:57:08,388 --> 00:57:08,868
Hell, yes.

1313
00:57:09,268 --> 00:57:10,768
I was right. Cool.

1314
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:17,088
Yes. In November, Chris Jenner, quote, bought half of Rob's sock company.

1315
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:17,948
Rob.

1316
00:57:19,788 --> 00:57:23,368
Sorry, Scott. OK, it's impossible.

1317
00:57:23,928 --> 00:57:25,488
Where to how do you even begin?

1318
00:57:25,488 --> 00:57:26,408
I have a quick plus up.

1319
00:57:26,508 --> 00:57:29,968
I want to bring if you bring back Mike Fink when they finally bring booze

1320
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:32,308
into Disneyland, which to Star Wars, it'll happen.

1321
00:57:32,328 --> 00:57:34,168
And I think it'll slowly roll out everywhere.

1322
00:57:34,928 --> 00:57:38,528
How about some whiskey on the Mike Fink in honor of the great,

1323
00:57:38,828 --> 00:57:41,548
horrible man, Mike Fink himself?

1324
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:45,228
And then people could like pretend to shoot it off each other's head.

1325
00:57:45,448 --> 00:57:46,428
That's fun, right?

1326
00:57:46,608 --> 00:57:48,588
You have a sip of a nice little sip of whiskey.

1327
00:57:48,608 --> 00:57:50,108
You're going around the rivers of America.

1328
00:57:50,308 --> 00:57:51,688
Does anything sound better than that?

1329
00:57:51,688 --> 00:57:53,688
That's not to me. Sounds real nice.

1330
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:54,368
Sounds real nice.

1331
00:57:54,368 --> 00:57:57,448
And you could like take if they set up like an animatronic

1332
00:57:57,448 --> 00:58:01,948
that you could like that would you could perfectly shoot down from 90 paces.

1333
00:58:02,028 --> 00:58:08,088
Yeah. Well, yeah, let's get that Root and Toot and spirit back in there.

1334
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:11,388
Memorialize this great murder and man.

1335
00:58:13,128 --> 00:58:13,828
And anything else?

1336
00:58:13,988 --> 00:58:17,108
Oh, you know what I should say, though, it was not called Mike Fink.

1337
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:20,888
They were called the River Rogue keel boats in Euro Disneyland

1338
00:58:20,888 --> 00:58:21,768
in Disneyland, Paris.

1339
00:58:21,948 --> 00:58:23,748
And I don't think they're gone.

1340
00:58:23,748 --> 00:58:26,308
I don't think they run them very often, but I don't think they are.

1341
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:26,928
I think they are.

1342
00:58:26,928 --> 00:58:29,268
Officially retired and the Florida one ended.

1343
00:58:29,588 --> 00:58:31,648
But they did run it longer than Disneyland.

1344
00:58:32,148 --> 00:58:34,848
OK, right. I think that 2001.

1345
00:58:35,308 --> 00:58:37,068
Yeah, yeah, I made it made a little longer.

1346
00:58:38,428 --> 00:58:42,028
So, yeah, now I'm just glad that the that Mike Fink,

1347
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:45,388
the legend of Mike Fink is conveying the best image of America.

1348
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:47,908
Yeah. Over in France. Sure.

1349
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,628
Yeah. Well, hey, thanks for the thanks for the ride.

1350
00:58:52,368 --> 00:58:54,208
You survived a perilous trip

1351
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:58,408
with old Mike Fink through the rivers of America.

1352
00:58:59,988 --> 00:59:02,448
And you're leaving with all your limbs intact.

1353
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:07,788
Thanks for thanks for listening to podcast the ride, the second gauge.

1354
00:59:08,328 --> 00:59:10,188
Let us if there's worse boats

1355
00:59:10,188 --> 00:59:12,968
you want us to talk about, make us aware,

1356
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:16,368
you know, those Epcot boats are coming at some point.

1357
00:59:16,608 --> 00:59:17,528
Yeah, they have to.

1358
00:59:18,128 --> 00:59:21,528
And because the the thing I joked about this recently,

1359
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:25,628
the the boats that leave you at the back entrance of Epcot.

1360
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:29,408
Well, those are different boats than the boats that cross the lagoon.

1361
00:59:29,548 --> 00:59:31,328
The Illuminations Lagoon. Yeah.

1362
00:59:31,428 --> 00:59:32,448
Two different kinds of boats.

1363
00:59:32,688 --> 00:59:36,088
Yeah, well, I love the boat from GM to anyway.

1364
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:37,068
We'll talk about friendship.

1365
00:59:37,188 --> 00:59:39,408
We'll get to it. Thanks for listening, folks.

1366
00:59:39,628 --> 00:59:40,668
We'll see you next time.

1367
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:40,988
Yeah.
