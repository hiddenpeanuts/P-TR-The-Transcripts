00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Welcome to Hauntcast the Fright, the second game of the year.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are at the second gate where today we will be discussing...

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Ah, ah, ah, Mike. We got a Halloween-ify it.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I gave this some thought last night. I think what we're doing right now is Hauntcast the Fright the Cemetery Gate.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I came locked and loaded, I solved the problem.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Man, and you were waiting to just serve me there.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You knew I wanted it to be the interrupt.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I walked it right into a trap.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A spooky trap.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Dennis Nidried you.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That was me, Scott Geraghty.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I interrupted Mike Carlson and who hasn't said anything yet? Jason Sheridan.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For once, I have not said anything in the rare moment.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're digesting a breakfast, though.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am digesting. Look, it's easy like Sunday morning here at Hauntcast the Fright the Cemetery Gate.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You know, we're getting started of the day.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You know, I was eating a Clif Bar as I walked in with my Starbucks.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And our guest beat us. Our guest beat me and Scott here today.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, yeah. Well, lucky for you and I, Jason, we don't have a lot to do here because I think we're going to sit back and hear a tale.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And a tale from our guest.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes, our guest, Anthony Geo is here.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're back, finally.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We've been saying we've got to have you back for a year.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Splash Mountain. It's been so long.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, it's kind of disrespectful of you.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's very of us to not have you back until now.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So welcome back.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, thank you guys for having me.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm excited to talk about this.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So as will be discussed, I don't know when this is coming out, if it will be discussed before.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've had to find a whole set of new podcast partners for the various haunts that happened in Southern California over the month of September, months of September.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You went to a cemetery and found some ghouls to go with you.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I found some new ghouls to go with me.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Some new ghouls and goblins.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah. So you'll hear about some of that later or before. I don't know.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I forgot.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But Fright Fest at Six Flags.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Six Flags Magic Mountain.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Six Flags Magic Mountain.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Where you would not set foot into.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That was the first time I went to Six Flags Magic Mountain.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wow.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Geo?

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I had been once before, I think.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
OK.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And I have not ever been.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Jason did a safe tour.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Wow, really?

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, because I'm not a coaster guy.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not a screamer.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, I'm not.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I mean, as a child.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm a femur.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Right.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
As a child, I was not.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I went to Great America, but I was very scared of all the big coasters.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Funny enough, that was my Six Flags growing up.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah, the Gurney.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Great America. Yeah, near Chicago.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
OK.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So I was hoping we didn't do every coaster, but I was also hoping to get a little bit braver when it comes to coasters, which we'll talk about in a second.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sure. All the coasters, for the most part, at Fright Fest, too.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I spent a bunch of time reading the website so I at least could contribute something.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And the gimmick with the coasters seems to be the lights are off.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, I don't know how great that gimmick is because it's just like it's dark out.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's like Dr. Bondark himself dreamed up this devilish scheme.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So I don't know.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, I don't know if it's like, wow, it was so different, but I guess it was a little darker.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I would say it was just inconvenient.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Like, it made it hard to like figure out what was going on.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There was a lot of fog.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There was a lot of fog.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I would say they spared no expense on fog machines.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There were so many fog machines.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There were times when we would be walking by and I feel like I would just get a fresh mouthful of fog.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Like the fog would just shoot as soon as we were like right next to the machine and I would just be like, oh, like I got a full good...

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We should just preemptively start the paperwork on the class action lawsuit.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You guys, you text it like two or three times when you were up there.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And it started slow.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And then it very quickly became like, yeah, I got to do an episode about this experience.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, it started so slow.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, it started fast.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We're doing it.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We're doing it.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So we might as well go.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So yeah, this was not necessarily a plan, but as soon as there was a thing that immediately set the tone for the adventure.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Also, we should say nice enough to be invited to a press event.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, right.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This was free and a nice thing.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A real nice thing.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But it's why we're doing this behind the paywall.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
There is a part of it.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Behind the cemetery gate.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why we're behind the cemetery gate.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And by the way, any of the stories we tell, we're not trying to dissuade you from going.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, no.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Go to Six Flags Magic Mountain.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I said to Mike, as we pulled away, I said Six Flags sucks and I love it.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And I think that really sums it up.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Like, do not miss this.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I agree.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's what you could say that you could fill in the blank with a lot of our second gate topics.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's true.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And with blank and I love it.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It sucks and I love it.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Six Flags should buy that slogan from you.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They should promote the parks.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Six Flags sucks and I love it.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, okay.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have a quick question.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Is Fright Night nationwide?

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So is it happening?

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's not just a magic gun?

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm thinking of going when I'm in Chicago.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm thinking of, we'll see.

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
See how it is.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I remember once being at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jersey in the fall and Fright Fest was going

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and it was so small, if you didn't want to do it, you could just avoid that part of the park.

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It was literally in a corner of the park.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There's maybe two houses and a scare zone back in the early 2000s.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It was very small.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Also, unlike other haunts, when it's Fright Fest days at Six Flags, it runs from 1030 a.m. to 1 a.m.

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Like, it doesn't just become Fright Fest at night.

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's not our experience.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's not.

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It started at like seven.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
They had an opening ceremony.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah.

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think that was opening day though.

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh, maybe.

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Or maybe it's just park hours.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
On the website, Fright Fest dates were like marked 1030 a.m. to 1 a.m.

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So you would have like zombies walking around in the morning?

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In the day.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Just with coffee.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They're even brawgier with it before they're gone.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hello, Jason.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Morning.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I just finished my Clif Bar.

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I need a banana.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Which is also my Harrison Ford impression.

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I need a banana.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Clif Bar.

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So where was I?

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Something happened right away.

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh yeah.

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So right away.

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Kicked off with two teens at the Office Depot telling us their favorite roller coaster because we had to print the tickets out.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, that's right.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So yeah, my printer not working and I also feel like printer ink is a scam at this point.

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
At least the printers we have feels like it runs out of ink and 30 pages of printing, which sucks.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So like I'll just like go print for 10 cents at Office Depot.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I will do that too.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How millennials are killing the printing industry.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's true.

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We don't do it.

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I bring that up because I kind of came into play later when we were...

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Teens play a big role in all of this.

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's good to tease the teens because the teens are everywhere.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know if I saw an adult wearing a name tag.

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Like I really think that Six Flags may be running solely on teens.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There is one teen in this story.

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I thought I turned that off.

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There is one teen in this story that is like a hero, is like a shining star and I'll never forget him.

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Teens and bad teens.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Not bad, just maybe apathetic teens.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Although maybe one bad teen.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So anyway, so we print everything out at Office Depot.

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What did the one...

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
She said...

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Tatsu?

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
She spotted it.

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
She spotted your ticket and she goes, oh, Six Flags.

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And she goes, you got to write Tatsu.

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And then she goes, you got to write it twice.

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Or something like she had been...

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We didn't write Tatsu though.

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No.

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Because...

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We'll get there.

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
She says, she says, you got to write it twice.

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I always write it twice.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You write, write, write.

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So she was excited.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And then I wonder if she was like, oh, these two older men are going.

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So like I'm a teen and these two older men are going to enjoy it.

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Having a nice husband's night together.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Husband's night together, who knows?

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Anyway, that's just my own neuroses about my age.

203
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So we drive up there.

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I have recently got a new car.

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I have my old car like 10 years.

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And I said, you know what?

207
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let me pay a little more to try to be conscientious about the environment.

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So I got a Prius Prime.

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's a plug-in.

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So we're at the place where the park, whatever, the parking booth.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And I go, oh, because I think I saw on the website that they have EV park, like a plug-in charging.

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I go, oh, do you have electric vehicle charging?

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And she goes, yes.

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
She was very excited.

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
She was like, we do have it.

217
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And I was like, oh, that's great.

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And she's like, so what you'll do is you'll drive down the street and then the first building you see on your right, that's where it is.

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And she didn't say like specifically like, oh, you pull in.

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
She gave no specific.

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
She just kept saying building on the right.

222
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And I was like, OK, so it's just it's the first thing because I was trying to look for a little more specific detail about it.

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But she didn't have any.

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
She just said first building on the right.

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So we're driving and we take like a little bit of a ways down.

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We take a turn a little bit on the right.

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And there is a would you describe like one step up from a trailer?

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, I would say at best a shack, sort of a shack.

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And there's like a metal like temporary fence in front of it.

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And we spot a car that's just plugged into an outlet on the outside wall.

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You know, you sent that picture and I didn't really know what I was looking at.

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Now I get it.

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And we were like so confused.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We're like, is this it?

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
None of it felt official.

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So we like pulled around like I stopped and like pulled around and we're looking.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We're like, yeah, that car is plugged into an outlet on the wall.

238
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And we were we were pretty good about like we were there are quite a few employees coming in and out of the building that we were like waiting to take a cue from them of like, oh, actually, this is not for you.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because the press parks in the employee lot.

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Right. That's where you were.

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No, I think it was just the general.

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You were just in the general.

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah. So so we were parking.

244
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So so yeah. So there were three or four employees that would walk by.

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But like almost as if they were coming to talk to us.

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Each time.

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And almost cinematically walked right past us.

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Like each time.

249
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Never had a gripe about what we were doing because it looked like we were fucking with the building.

250
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like for as long as we were by the building, like in lining the car up, because there was only one way to park.

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I would I'll say this.

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There were probably a couple ways to park, but most of the ways to park would have let Mike's car been blindsided.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There was no actual space.

254
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It would have been just you in the road.

255
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Right. Like out of it like parallel park on the road that takes you into the parking lot.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's only getting darker as the night goes on.

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah. And it's a new car.

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So then like Geo's like coaching me.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He's like, I think you got to back up on the gravel here.

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So we're like backing up on the gravel.

261
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Just like right back into.

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And again, there's I swear, four or five employees that keep and there's a woman who walks out.

263
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
She walks out and like leans over the fence.

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And we're like, oh, here's the person that's going to finally say this is good.

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No, don't do this.

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You don't do this.

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You're actually there's a full building where you actually charge.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's over there with logos, you know, the way those stations look.

269
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah.

270
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes. Tesla ones like right at the Burbank Mall.

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yes. And we roll the window down.

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And I think you said I said, oh, I said, hey, are we allowed to park here?

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Can we plug in?

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And then I pointed at the outlets and she said she said she didn't speak English.

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And I said, oh, can we then it was I was like, it was tough.

276
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I was like, can we park here?

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And then she kind of just like, yeah, like she was like, go for it.

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And that nonchalance is the Six Flags way.

279
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So I just left my car in the gravel out by a shack, plugged into an outlet on the outside of the shack.

280
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Just like an orange extension cord.

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, I have you.

282
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Most cars come with a thing.

283
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You can plug it into an outlet.

284
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And if you like have it at home, it takes a long time to charge that way.

285
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
OK, which we'll find out later.

286
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So you plugged an extension cord into a utility trailer.

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, it's a it's a it's a charger.

288
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It comes with a cord.

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So, but it's yeah, essentially.

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So there was multiple plugs, I guess.

291
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I guess that's what it was for.

292
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I guess that is what it's so hard to tell.

293
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
One powered all of the Justice League ride.

294
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you unplugged it, that rides down.

295
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's funny.

296
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Well, it's funny you say that.

297
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, my God.

298
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Wow.

299
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So we're laughing pretty hard at this.

300
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm just leaving.

301
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm like, keep turning, like looking at my car.

302
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Like, is it OK there?

303
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Is this going to be?

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I was actually I was pretty convinced that like.

305
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Your car was not going to be there.

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I had convinced myself like, I don't think this is going to.

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But I thought the wheels were just going to be missing.

308
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Like all four wheels gone.

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Good three and a half weeks of that car.

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah.

311
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I do have a theory of what the brown check was now, because once you're in the park, I don't think the teens are taking breaks at the brown.

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't think they're walking across the whole park.

313
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I know it was like the parking lot.

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Break, employee break.

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, that may be.

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah.

317
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's probably a good.

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah.

319
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Who knows?

320
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's actually the power search shack.

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's just constantly having power searches.

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So your car almost got fried.

323
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, it would it would make sense from how much it actually charged it by the end of the night.

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Boy.

325
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So we had in.

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We had in.

327
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We were a little lost in the parking lot.

328
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And finally we walk.

329
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And we had like we had to be in the and I'm forgetting the name of the lounge already at a certain time.

330
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The full throttle lounge.

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Full throttle bar.

332
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Full throttle bar, because that's where the press check in was.

333
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And so we're like we had like an hour, 45 minutes and we're like, well, go on Justice League first.

334
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
When we walked in, though, it wasn't clear.

335
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Like they don't have signs that point to the entrance.

336
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The entrance is what you would think is almost like the side of the park.

337
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, it's not a lot of things are super clear to before.

338
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And then you have to double back.

339
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There's also sniper towers in the parking lot.

340
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, there are strange.

341
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, like towers like deer.

342
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Deer blinds.

343
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Six Flags has deer blind towers in the parking lot.

344
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I love Six.

345
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I want to go back now.

346
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We should have gotten the pass.

347
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We should have gotten the pass.

348
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Because honestly, it would have been we had comp tickets and we were $30 more.

349
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We really should have done it.

350
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm really regretting it now.

351
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
They had a folding table set out for people that wanted to up their pass.

352
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And I go, I pointed it to it.

353
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I pointed it to it.

354
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I go, Mike, doesn't it feel like that should be a little more official?

355
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It was just like like a garage.

356
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I should have fucking.

357
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I mean, also, by the way, it's probably like $60 for the pass instead of 30.

358
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You could barter for it.

359
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If you had like a nice ring, they'd give you the pass for that.

360
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, yeah.

361
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's some silver platinum ring or less.

362
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So we walk in and we've said it before about Disney World.

363
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But, you know, the dream of the 90s is alive at Six Flags.

364
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Only the unpainted dream of the 90s is alive.

365
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It arguably looks abandoned in some places.

366
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There are places where the paint is so faded.

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You would think like, OK, if no one was around.

368
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, like, oh, like this has been this is 10 years.

369
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's been just left like this.

370
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Did you guys notice the walkways in a certain condition?

371
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh, like the cement has not been re cracked in a while.

372
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Like the cement has not been poured in a while.

373
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's what I noticed.

374
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
A lot of cracks like am I going to twist my ankle kind of walkways?

375
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You really can't tell the difference.

376
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You can't tell the difference between the parking lot and pavement and the and the walking pavement.

377
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah. And this park 10 years ago, there was concern it was going to be torn down and housing built there or apartments.

378
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And then it got I guess they figured out either they think maybe the housing crisis happened and they're like, no, just keep it a six flag.

379
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
We're not going to build apartments.

380
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Roller coasters are cheaper.

381
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah.

382
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah.

383
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
These ones are.

384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I told Mike when we walked in, I said, it feels like the PlayStation one just came out.

385
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Like that's like the vibe.

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It felt like just like it like the mid 90s.

387
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And yeah, I mean that full throttle lounges extremely.

388
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's that's cool.

389
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Was that by the West Coast Racers preview?

390
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No.

391
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, it might have been we didn't go in there.

392
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I mean, that at least is an active is an active construction.

393
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We saw the construction construction site.

394
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, that was over by the the rip cord.

395
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'd also like to say we were only there for about five hours.

396
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I want 20.

397
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, when did we get there?

398
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Five.

399
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think you're right.

400
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It just feels like I'm still 22,000, 22,000 feet like steps.

401
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah.

402
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Miles, I was about to say.

403
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But which was I had gone to horror nights a couple of days prior and walked half of that.

404
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Whoa.

405
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's a massive, massive space.

406
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And we kept not knowing where we were going.

407
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's very confusing.

408
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah, especially when the lights went out, the lights went out.

409
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The fog is at 200 percent more than normal fog levels.

410
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
They're giving out cups of just cups of fog solution that you drink on the way and drink your fog.

411
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So iodine tablets.

412
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So we're walking through the slightly abandoned park, the working abandoned park,

413
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and we're trying to find Justice League.

414
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And we see on the map it's there's the D.C. area.

415
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah, there's like a whole I mean, I think their best example, like what a land would be right.

416
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I think so.

417
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Like a gateway you walk under.

418
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
OK.

419
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah.

420
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So we go there and it's not there.

421
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's not located in the D.C. area.

422
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The Justice League ride is not in D.C. land.

423
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh my God.

424
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's next to it, right?

425
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah, I mean, it's not so far, but it's it's a little it's like removed like the game isn't it between the games in the D.C. area.

426
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's not you have to go past the broad the boardwalk games.

427
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yes. Yeah.

428
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So it's not like next next.

429
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So we're like asking people and they don't even seem that sure.

430
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No, we asked where's Justice League and the guy squinted and goes, I think over there.

431
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's like over there.

432
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I swear there's a question mark on the end like the Riddler's question mark was.

433
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So we were like, OK, so we're walking and then we finally see like the Hall of Justice, which I guess we didn't come from that way.

434
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So we shouldn't have seen it because I was I was getting so I kept telling Gio we were going the wrong way, which we weren't.

435
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I was so convinced because the place that got me so turned around.

436
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So OK, so we didn't realize also that we had front row.

437
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
We had front line passes for everything, but we were not utilized.

438
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, no, we didn't have them yet.

439
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No, yeah. That's a later. We weren't utilizing the ride.

440
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Anyway, so we get in the line for Justice League and it takes a little while.

441
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And do you remember was piping through the speakers?

442
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm glad you're here.

443
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So we get in the line and it's like you're in the Justice League.

444
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You're outside of the Hall of Justice.

445
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes. On a loop, Tweety Bird is just talking.

446
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And he's saying stuff like, watch your belongings.

447
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So like there's no theming.

448
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
There's no theming attempt happening at all.

449
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There's no like Bap and Danny Elfman Batman score soaring.

450
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
There's none of that. Right.

451
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
We don't really check for knives here.

452
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So careful.

453
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Watch out for the paradas.

454
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Knives are in play. Be diligent.

455
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Protect yourself from knives.

456
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So I think the ride's over there.

457
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It used to probably be something with Tweety Bird and they just never changed it.

458
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think that's it.

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
These people don't give a shit.

461
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The Hall of Dwahtis.

462
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yes, it's the same ride.

463
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Is the ride over there anyway?

464
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I thought I saw that ride.

465
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So waiting in line.

466
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We are.

467
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
We.

468
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It takes a little while.

469
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We get in and I think there was an employee outside.

470
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
There was an employee outside.

471
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The doors open.

472
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We walk inside into a room where it's a big screen and no employee.

473
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
No.

474
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Which is just shocking when you go to like Universal or Disney.

475
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Any room you go into as an employee to tell you where to go to make sure you don't fuck with things.

476
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
In Japan, there's like seven people per ride just at the entrance.

477
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Hello.

478
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yes.

479
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
No one.

480
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
We're in an empty room with a bunch of tourists.

481
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
With ten feet tall statues of the backhand Superman.

482
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The Holy Trinity.

483
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yes.

484
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Wonder Woman.

485
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So we turn and we watch a video to prep us for the Justice League ride.

486
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah.

487
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I took a little footage of.

488
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Which you have some footage of and then you made a comment of another PlayStation related comment.

489
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh yeah.

490
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I was on the brain.

491
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Well, it looked like PlayStation 3 like cutscene graphics.

492
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes.

493
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The mouths don't line up.

494
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But I'll say the added kind of detail to it is it looked like the CGI characters were there against their will.

495
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Their faces are not happy.

496
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
No.

497
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And it's long.

498
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's a very long.

499
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And also like Superman and a couple other characters look like Ricky Bobby and Talladega Knight when he doesn't know how to do an interview.

500
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And their hands are like hovering in a way while they're talking to the screen.

501
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We're like, what are their hands doing?

502
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Like are they just uncomfortable on camera?

503
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah.

504
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Superman should be better at talking to the public.

505
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Whoa.

506
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And it goes on so long.

507
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's like footage from a Killings commercial webs workshop.

508
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Which will be a second gate eventually.

509
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah. And it's basically just like explaining that Lex Luthor and the Joker are out and they've got some sort of robot.

510
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
What do they call them?

511
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I don't know. Jason, you remember robot things?

512
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I remember.

513
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Well, Luthor, like first the Joker is there and then Luthor like comes down and he explains, like the subtext is like, well, let's just call out the elephant in the room.

514
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The reason I'm working with the Joker is because he like spends time explaining that.

515
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
He seems awkward on camera too.

516
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He's a CGI character.

517
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
He's awkward on camera.

518
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
He's uncomfortable.

519
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He's a super villain, but he doesn't know he didn't take that class.

520
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Some jitters. He's got some jitters.

521
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's also should be said this ride is all over the world, but everywhere it's a little different.

522
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Is that right?

523
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
For whatever reason they have duplicated, but not exactly.

524
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Like some places have less animatronics.

525
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Some places are just screens.

526
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Right.

527
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But it's still called Battle for Metropolis.

528
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Justice League Battle for Metropolis everywhere.

529
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's very straight.

530
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
We need to do a whole second gate episode trying to figure out every iteration of this.

531
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yes.

532
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Our whole main feed episode for that.

533
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
For sure.

534
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I think you could.

535
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah, we'll get a lot more out of it with all the specifics.

536
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So then we go into this other next room.

537
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The second pre-show room.

538
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The second pre-show room.

539
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
No employee to be found.

540
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The second room, there's no employee.

541
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
How are you getting from room to room?

542
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Well, the door does open, but the door first opened for us to go into the first hall or the first room that didn't open properly.

543
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And the woman in front of us had to like kind of like force it open.

544
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
What?

545
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
She had to like put quite a bit of weight so her kids could like kind of like get in.

546
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You were prying your way into this ride.

547
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You were troking your way into the Hall of Justice.

548
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Oh my God.

549
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You're stealing a car.

550
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah.

551
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So we walk into the next room and there's a big cyborg, the character cyborg animatronic.

552
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Which is cool to see.

553
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And he's sort of explaining to you what's going to happen.

554
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And he does what?

555
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Maybe a minute of explanation.

556
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And everyone in there kind of seems like the other people that were with us all seem maybe like they were like annual pass holders.

557
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Yeah, no one was listening.

558
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
They didn't give a shit about him.

559
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
They were kind of just waiting for the door to open.

560
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So when you first walk into the room and you look straight ahead, that's where cyborg is.

561
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,000
He's kind of like up on a platform and he has he has like the weapons in front of him that you're supposed to use because it's like a Buzz Lightyear shooting type game.

562
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Everyone just turned their back to him and went to the other door at the back of the room so they can like get ready to queue up.

563
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I felt like they were protesting him honestly.

564
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't know why.

565
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Mayor Diplazio, you're a disgrace.

566
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So we were watching him, but then I also felt like oddly competitive to like jockey for door position.

567
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah, it was a little tough because it made it felt like they knew something we didn't.

568
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah, like you can't stand too close to cyborg.

569
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You start shooting oil in a second.

570
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And then about a minute into his his speech, he breaks down.

571
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, he breaks down and we hear we hear reset.

572
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We hear reset.

573
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We hear reset.

574
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And then there's about a minute that goes by.

575
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That's just like a human voice.

576
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's not like cyborg's father saying reset or something.

577
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's not themed.

578
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's just an employee being like, oh shit.

579
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Okay, reset.

580
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And then a minute goes by, assuming we'll see maybe again.

581
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And then the doors just open.

582
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And they did.

583
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
For the next room.

584
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Whoa.

585
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Which comes into play a little bit because so we never learned what the ride was like that.

586
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That to me felt like we heard the narrative in the first room.

587
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
The second room is like, this is what you need to know.

588
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
We never heard what we needed to know.

589
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And so we got into the line.

590
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So we'll use. Okay, so there's two lines.

591
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And it said one is regular line and one is single rider.

592
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And you made the point because we were trying to get it.

593
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It was already taking too long.

594
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Everything is too long.

595
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And we need to get to the full throttle bar at a certain time.

596
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So Gio was like, hey, you want to just do single rider?

597
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And I was like, oh yeah, that's fine.

598
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
We don't need to sit next to each other or whatever.

599
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So we're the only two people that go into single rider.

600
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Everybody else goes in the regular line, which wasn't super long, but whatever.

601
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Fifty people, sixty people, only people.

602
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
We walk up right up to the front of single rider.

603
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And there was, I think the most teenish teen working.

604
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And he looked like he got as white as a ghost when he saw us in the single rider line.

605
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
His eyes were really wide and you can just kind of see what was going on in his brain,

606
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
which was someone at some point told me what to do and I've forgotten what to do.

607
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
He did not know what single rider meant.

608
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
He did three, I feel like two, like looking around to see if he could ask someone.

609
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And he was just like, oh, both single rider.

610
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And we're like, oh yeah, yeah, both single rider.

611
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Both single rider.

612
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
OK.

613
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
He went to the regular line and I think you can put three and three in these ride vehicles.

614
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He went to the regular line, pulled two people out, put them in the front.

615
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He looked at Gio and I went, OK, he waved both of us over and put both of us in the back of the vehicle.

616
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah.

617
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Score.

618
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That's great when that happens.

619
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And we were like, OK.

620
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Because that's like, that's not what you do for a single rider.

621
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You're supposed to wait till you've fully packed.

622
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Once in a blue moon I've had that happen.

623
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah, but that's only to get that line, I think, moving sometimes too.

624
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Sure, yeah, yeah.

625
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Because sometimes that keeps working out evenly.

626
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Let me ask you this.

627
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Do you think maybe he just turned white as a sheet because he realized the sun was about to set and the ghosts and goblins were about to come out?

628
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's not even possible.

629
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The power of the Justice League could keep them contained.

630
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's possible.

631
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It was still like 90 minutes till that was going to happen.

632
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
OK.

633
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Cyborg's down.

634
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But there's no doubt it was on his mind.

635
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah.

636
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We're only 30 minutes in.

637
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
All right.

638
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So we get on the ride.

639
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
We're laughing again.

640
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Like, this is funny.

641
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
We skipped the whole line.

642
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And we pull hard into the first room.

643
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And there's the first big screen.

644
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And we have the guns ready to go.

645
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And the screen, I think both of us have the same experience.

646
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I think maybe I realized a second before because I looked in front.

647
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I was like, this screen is awful blurry.

648
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Like, I really can't.

649
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah.

650
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Like, why is it so?

651
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And I look in front and I go, oh, we're supposed to have 3D glasses.

652
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh, yeah, I do recall that.

653
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I remember riding it.

654
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The team.

655
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
No one handed us glasses.

656
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
No one gave us glasses.

657
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Wow.

658
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
He just sent us off.

659
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And I'll say there wasn't much.

660
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't know where people in the regular line were getting glasses.

661
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You may have had to bring them from home.

662
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Have you seen a real D movie lately?

663
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Just store those up.

664
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
We're low.

665
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So we're going through.

666
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
We did the whole ride without 3D glasses.

667
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Everything blurry.

668
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Laughing the whole way.

669
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It broke down too.

670
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And it broke down.

671
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Oh my God.

672
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah.

673
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
A couple of times.

674
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I think I've seen a few sparse animatronics through it.

675
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yes.

676
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But I have to say, when I wrote it a couple of months ago, when I was up there,

677
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
there is a room where it's dark.

678
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And as you come into the room, the lights come up and there's just two goons,

679
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
two bad guys in orange jumpsuits.

680
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And they are holding not ray guns, not slime guns.

681
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They're just holding assault weapons.

682
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Yes.

683
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Shooting right at you.

684
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah.

685
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah.

686
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
In 2019, I was like, it takes a lot to unnerve me, but I was like,

687
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh, I don't know about this room.

688
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't know.

689
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
They're like AR-15 holding.

690
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Watch out.

691
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We got bump stocks.

692
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah.

693
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It's like, Oh, maybe we should put some gizmos or gadgets on those things.

694
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So it looks like they're shooting rays at me.

695
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Because you're holding like a NES zapper.

696
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You are holding like a Marvin the Martian's gun.

697
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That is inadvertently themed, but to the wrong property.

698
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah.

699
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The trigger on mine was very loose.

700
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It didn't have like a lot of...

701
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't even...

702
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It felt like a broken water gun.

703
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I wasn't even shooting that much.

704
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It was okay.

705
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah.

706
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It didn't feel like a water gun, honestly.

707
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It had the recoil of a water gun.

708
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah.

709
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And we're shooting...

710
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah.

711
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So yeah, it broke down a couple of times.

712
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We got stuck on it.

713
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
There's a Joker animatronic, which isn't bad.

714
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's a Harley Quinn.

715
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And a Harley right before you're done.

716
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
There's like a little T.

717
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
She's in the ceiling.

718
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
She sprays you with gas, I think.

719
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yes.

720
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So we get...

721
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Fog.

722
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Fog.

723
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
A mouthful of fog.

724
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Just a warning of the night to come.

725
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So she sprays you and then we get up.

726
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And then the woman collecting the goggles, she tosses the Rubbermaid in your face in the

727
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
front row and they put the goggles in.

728
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And she goes, all right, goggles.

729
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And we go, we didn't get any.

730
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And she kind of...

731
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
She's like, did she like exasperatedly sigh or something?

732
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yeah.

733
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
She seemed really...

734
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It was like, not again.

735
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Right.

736
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It seemed like that has happened before.

737
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Aiden, goddammit.

738
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Aiden, god.

739
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
What is a ghost?

740
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
She goes, hold on.

741
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Let me see what I can do.

742
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And we're like, oh no, we got to...

743
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We're running.

744
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We got to go to the full throttle bar.

745
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
She's like, oh, okay.

746
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
She goes, oh, full throttle.

747
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Very nice.

748
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I do it twice.

749
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So, I mean, the day is off to a rollicking start at this point.

750
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So we go to the full throttle.

751
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
We check in and it's the upstairs of the full throttle lounge.

752
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And yeah, the VIP area, which downstairs looks like...

753
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Kind of like a Buffalo Wild Wings.

754
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
But not as nice probably as a Buffalo Wild Wings.

755
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I also am a big fan of Buffalo Wild Wings.

756
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Maybe, yeah, maybe a little cheaper.

757
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
A little cheaper.

758
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Not so bad.

759
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But they're very spread.

760
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So there's a spread up there.

761
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You know, you got a couple drinks, which is really great.

762
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
We got orange Dreamsicle milkshakes in a skull glass.

763
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
God, fuck off.

764
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
In a layup skull.

765
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah.

766
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Geo didn't drink all of his.

767
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
No, I couldn't.

768
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I drank all of mine.

769
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I could drink all of yours.

770
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Did you doggybag it for me?

771
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I did think...

772
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I asked, do you think Jason maybe would want the cup?

773
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And we were trying to figure out how to...

774
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You abandoned your cup, but I took mine.

775
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I carried mine through every maze.

776
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That's true.

777
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Which also is...

778
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Which is funny enough, I'm sure I'll talk about it again.

779
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I had a cup that was similar from Horror Nights that I carried through every maze.

780
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And they're the same cup.

781
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Only one is slightly bigger and says Six Flags on it.

782
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
But they're the same skull with the same thing and the same light up effect.

783
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So what you're saying is you have a set.

784
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yes, I do.

785
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So when you and Lindsay have your little, you know, five o'clock somewhere.

786
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Glad the work day is done unwinding.

787
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Spooky five o'clock somewhere.

788
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Spooky five o'clock somewhere.

789
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You have a set.

790
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You have a full throttle lounge at home.

791
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So we get that there's a...

792
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That's the case then.

793
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You can't have soap in any of your bathrooms.

794
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Empty throttles.

795
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Am I getting ahead of myself when we went to the coffin challenge first?

796
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah, that's true.

797
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Let's go back for a second.

798
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
When we passed to get...

799
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I feel like a lot of our daytime was doubling back because it's unclear how to navigate a lot of this park.

800
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So we went past to get to full throttle.

801
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
We went past what was something called the coffin challenge.

802
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The 30 hour coffin challenge.

803
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah.

804
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Am I the only one who knows about 30 hour coffin challenge?

805
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Have you participated?

806
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
No, I just know this is a thing Six Flags does every year.

807
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Really?

808
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Where you try to spend 30 hours in a coffin and I forget what the prize is.

809
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
We know what the prize is.

810
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Right.

811
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And we heard it as we were walking through.

812
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So the way that it's set up is you walk up a ramp and then the coffins are in the middle of a little area and you can walk around them in a little sidewalk.

813
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
How would you say, eight or nine are there?

814
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And then they have a dry erase board with the rankings.

815
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's unclear how the rankings work.

816
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Mike and I have deduced that you were maybe penalized for using the bathroom, like getting out of your coffin to like use the restroom or something, because it has times next to the rankings.

817
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Okay.

818
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It was pee in the coffin.

819
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Well, so we're walking around them and there's like a guy in the mic and he's like, coffin challenge.

820
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Hour 26 of the coffin challenge.

821
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Like come back in four hours to see who wins.

822
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And then he says the grand prize, $666 and an annual pass to Six Flags.

823
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And then as he's saying, because like Mike and I are horrified that that's what the prize is.

824
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We think people are doing this for at least like five grand.

825
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Or a stripped down Chevy Cruze or like something like something like and as the guy says that a woman pops her head out of one of her coffins and smiles and waves at us.

826
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I was just like, that made me want to leave fast.

827
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I was like, get out of here.

828
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Did she get docked points for sitting up?

829
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I tell you what, she shouldn't have been waving at us.

830
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Stop waving.

831
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Get back in your coffin.

832
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
A guy in a skeleton mask like whipped the coffin.

833
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
A lot of them were sleeping.

834
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah.

835
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Like were tucked away.

836
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You were like, you were like, it's bad for you to lie down that long.

837
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah, well, yeah, I said like if you're in a hospital bed, like for a prolonged period, you got to get up and move.

838
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And if you're incapable of doing that, then they bring in these sleeves for your legs to like massage your legs to create circulation.

839
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And something's telling me Six Flags didn't provide those teams coming into massage their legs.

840
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Go back to sleep, coffin challengers.

841
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
We know it sure get off.

842
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We forgot.

843
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We forgot to go back to see one.

844
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
We had to do it, but then we got to sidetracked the rest of the night.

845
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We got lost.

846
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
We got lost.

847
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah.

848
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
OK, so we walked around there.

849
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Sixty six.

850
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Wow.

851
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Six hundred sixty six.

852
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Hey, like it's like six days rent.

853
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah, that's what I.

854
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
That's like if you worked a part time job and you were like, oh, twenty two hours an hour, thirty hours a week.

855
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
This job.

856
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah, that's a nice deal.

857
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I feel I mean, I almost feel like I'm sure those people probably need that money.

858
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And I'm like, I feel bad even like knocking, but it's like Six Flags is the problem.

859
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Give them at least a couple grand for God's sake.

860
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Yeah.

861
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You're going to lie down on your goddamn amusement park for 30 hours.

862
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Ten years from now, we'll all be doing the coffin challenge for money.

863
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
For jobs, maybe whoever lasts this long will get a job.

864
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I are some painters, Six Flags, but be able to work.

865
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
OK, so we're back at the full throttle lounge.

866
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And when we checked in, I think part of the confusion was we we got a bracelet and a badge and the badge was like a media badge.

867
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And then the bracelet, as they put it on, they asked each of us if we were twenty one and over.

868
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Right. Yes.

869
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And so we assumed that was to have access to alcohol at full throttle.

870
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But it turned out to be our fast pass.

871
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Right. Which we never figured it.

872
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
We didn't figure out till like the last hour.

873
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It wasn't clear. It wasn't clear.

874
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So and yeah, so we went, we ate some of the food.

875
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Some was better than others.

876
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
There was a hot wing that was very hot, which I liked.

877
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I thought it was pretty good.

878
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
There was some like it was there was Takis.

879
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yeah. Pork and like a nacho cheese.

880
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I don't know. They call it walking.

881
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
She called it. She goes, don't forget your walking zombie.

882
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Taki. That's what she said.

883
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Walking. You like a play on walking.

884
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah. Yeah.

885
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Don't forget your fried fog.

886
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So I'm a little bit of a like eating these sorts of things is like not easy for me.

887
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So I ended up for dinner eating a pudding cup and a beer.

888
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Well, not a pudding cup, a dirt cup.

889
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
A dirt cup. Yeah.

890
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah. Yeah.

891
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
With gummy worm in it and then a little bit of the milkshake.

892
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I tell you the mango cart beer though from Golden Road.

893
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Great. Great.

894
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's like a fruit. It just tastes like juice.

895
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah. That's what we want.

896
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah. Yeah.

897
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I had I had two of the drinks.

898
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You had one and then I tried to redeem your extra ticket so I could get another drink in before.

899
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
But then it was they pulled it all down.

900
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So that was too bad.

901
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
A drink that's mostly sherbet.

902
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah.

903
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's good.

904
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You're preferred mixer.

905
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
One percent alcohol.

906
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So I remember when I went out to use the I had to leave to use the restroom to find like a sink that had soap.

907
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah. Sure.

908
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And when I walked outside, I overheard I wrote it down over a dad.

909
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So this is a dad telling his kid I'm walking to the bathroom and he's walking with me and he turns back and this dad tells his kid, watch your brother.

910
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I have to take a shit.

911
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It took my breath away.

912
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
How young are the kids?

913
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I would say the kid that was being told to watch his other brother was maybe like early middle school.

914
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And the little kid, maybe I would say seven, eight.

915
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Sorry, it's not up to your high standards, your highness.

916
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:54,000
This limousine liberal looking for hand soap in a bathroom.

917
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So you came back upstairs.

918
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I think I tried to wash my hands.

919
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I think it was just that upstairs bathroom is too small.

920
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It was packed.

921
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Too slick for like it's child style.

922
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You didn't fit in it.

923
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Well, yeah, no, it was tiny.

924
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It was like a hobbit size.

925
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
No, it was like it was just like maybe one stall and there were so many people.

926
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:29,000
There were so many press people up there and I was looking for I think what would you say of the people I know in the theme park community that I know everyone with?

927
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Like, did you watch this video?

928
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Did you listen to this?

929
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I didn't see anybody I knew.

930
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
These are all new theme park journalist related people.

931
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
No fresh baked.

932
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
No fresh baked Disney.

933
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
No cabbie hat in sight.

934
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Not a cabbie hat in sight.

935
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah, you're me.

936
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I experienced this because I took a tour of this roller coaster area.

937
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
They're building.

938
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And I was like, oh, the theme park journalism world breaks into different categories because there's just people who follow the roller like the roller coaster enthusiasts.

939
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I think that's what the world.

940
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's a whole other world.

941
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And I was trying.

942
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I was.

943
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Yeah, I was looking for your big names in my mind, but these might be big names in the coaster community or the I have to look the haunt community.

944
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Right.

945
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I have to look into a whole new section.

946
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
There were like 60 people, 70 people up there.

947
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
We never run into the bumper car boys because they are bumper car primarily.

948
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah, right.

949
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
God, because I don't want to see those little shits.

950
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Yeah, there would be a big fight.

951
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah, that would be a big.

952
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
They better stick to bumper.

953
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Thank God Disney doesn't have a lot of bumper cars.

954
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Though there is a funny.

955
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I mean, if we run into it, it would end up turning into like the anchorman fight only with theme park journalists.

956
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Fresh baked Disney gets a blade.

957
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Jim and Len have a big mace.

958
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yeah, everybody's splashing mostly non alcoholic.

959
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Yeah, right.

960
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But drinks in each other's eyes and running away in terror, stabbing each other with commemorative pins run away.

961
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

962
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So anyway, so yeah, we it was crowd crowd.

963
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We had to sit with another table with some nice folks who were one in a blog.

964
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So we were getting told by we're getting she was the woman we had sat down with was telling us don't listen to what they'll tell you where to go after this.

965
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

966
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yeah, her tone was really like, just take the tram up to the top and then start there because they were telling us to go to when they unleash the monster, the 7 p.m. ceremony of unleashing the monsters.

967
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So she was like, yeah, you can't really say.

968
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But we were like, we got to see the monsters get unleashed.

969
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So we were we were like some of the last people in there and then the woman in charge kind of came by and was like, we got come on.

970
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Like she was definitely like, we got to go see the monsters be unleashed, which that to me, I thought the entire night was going to be like ushering like that because she was so I was wondering if that would be out of it.

971
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
She was like, OK, like almost like the last bus is leaving type vibe.

972
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But then once we went to the monster, I mean, maybe they were anticipating the monsters to be so so unleashed because we did not really have guidance after that.

973
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Yes. Right. There were no, which is good.

974
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I mean, that's what horror nights was was.

975
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So that was good. It was good.

976
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
The moving marched through everything.

977
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So we went it was back by D.C. We walk all the way back to D.C.

978
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And then at 7 p.m. it's the unleashing of the monsters, which I have a video of it.

979
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I don't know. I guess I'll not show up. I'll post it.

980
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And then it's too scary for us.

981
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's still daytime, though.

982
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So there's that.

983
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But all the monsters come out set to like heavy metal music.

984
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And I have to imagine that they were all so jacked up.

985
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I imagine that it's like I'm not even being like ironic or anything.

986
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Like it must be like, hell yeah, we're doing it.

987
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
The opening night of the season.

988
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah, they may have regretted it three hours into signing up for this job, which I think is what we when we ran into a few scare actors later, I was like, they're regretting this decision already.

989
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah, they were like jacked up and it was packed.

990
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Also, it was like it was like they were running a race and it was like it did have a cheering.

991
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I'm on.

992
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I just describe it. It felt like they were we were like lined up at a marathon and they were like all coming out.

993
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But they weren't hard like, yes, one guy's had these would you like sparks like these kind of like spark makers on their palms and on their knees.

994
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So like when they slide on them, yes, they cause like some sparking.

995
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh, yeah.

996
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Show.

997
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah, that's like a whole show that goes on.

998
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Oh, OK.

999
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Nice barkers, sliders of the night.

1000
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I think you might be.

1001
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Yeah, that's honors.

1002
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Are you sure that's a classified as a show?

1003
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
On the website it is.

1004
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Does it say show or is it because some of the things I was getting confused there really all that means is that for about 30 feet, there'll be some performers like there's a hypnotist.

1005
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Oh, so it is listed under shows.

1006
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Yeah, yeah, they break it down to like, yeah, we saw that.

1007
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Unleashed voodoo nights, sliders of the night, like so the entertainment, I think maybe they just call it entertainment.

1008
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
That's why I think I don't know that there's a full show because there's some of the things that are listed on that.

1009
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But it turns out like there was like a fairy tale thing and I was expecting a Mazer show and it was just literally an 70 feet of walkway with three or four scare characters and a ton of fog.

1010
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Isn't that technically what a scare zone is?

1011
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yes.

1012
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah, OK.

1013
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Maybe it's just a scare zone.

1014
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I don't know. I actually I don't know though.

1015
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So what is a slider of the night slider of the sliders of the night.

1016
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah, so different than sliders of the day.

1017
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
We're all accustomed to and love sliders of the day.

1018
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So what riders on the moon?

1019
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Right.

1020
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We are strangers in the night.

1021
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Strangers in the night.

1022
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Riders on the storm.

1023
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Riders on the storm.

1024
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Riders on the storm.

1025
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Sliders in the night.

1026
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yes.

1027
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Changing changing sparking the I saw a slider of the night because I would say they're the most amped.

1028
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Here I'm showing you the video of the doesn't look like anything here.

1029
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
OK, here they come.

1030
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Show Jason.

1031
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Take it.

1032
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Oh my God.

1033
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So they are really running and sliding.

1034
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
There is a super tall clown and people are going nuts.

1035
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

1036
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
People were flipping and the difference.

1037
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And I say this from the from having going to horror nights a couple of nights prior.

1038
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:07,000
The difference at as we were saying teasing earlier, the difference is the amount of teens that are at Six Flags because teens shriek,

1039
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
teens yell and shriek.

1040
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So the amount of yelling and shrieking was times 10 of a horror nights.

1041
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I would say for every time I was startled by a scare actor, I was scared by the scream of a teenager.

1042
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yes, that is yes.

1043
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
That would happen.

1044
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:36,000
There was a couple when they were just like the teens were screaming so loud and aggressively that I was like, I keep getting like, well, I'm just reacting to this teen.

1045
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
This teen is causing me.

1046
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I mean, I'm more scared of teens than I am by anything that a fright night could bring in.

1047
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Man, well, you should never even just walking in my neighborhood.

1048
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I'll avoid eye contact with a teen.

1049
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I don't know anything about this.

1050
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The genre of person.

1051
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah, I wouldn't be scared of teens anymore.

1052
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Once I had been one and no, I'm more scared now.

1053
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
As if I'm just going to if I did make eye contact, they would just arbitrarily kick my ass.

1054
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah, especially like the cool neighborhood like Silver Lake, Los Feliz, the cool neighborhoods in L.A.

1055
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:26,000
teens like I remember being at a Mexican restaurant like a taco stand over at Mixed Oh and like a teen skateboarded up once they were holding an American apparel bag and then they ordered and I'm like this 14 year old could kick my ass.

1056
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Like I was just like what growing up in like the cool air.

1057
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
What does that do to your brain?

1058
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Shove your head into that American apparel bag, tighten the straps and choke you to death.

1059
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I yeah, I'm still I want teens approval.

1060
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I'm fast like I at the teen and off early 20s person.

1061
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I'm still like, do you think I'm too old?

1062
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Like, do you think I'm cool?

1063
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Like, I'm still looking for like approval from like the cool kids from high school.

1064
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It's still in my brain.

1065
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It's weird.

1066
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And in this quest, I think.

1067
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
OK, that's fair.

1068
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I think you're right about it.

1069
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I don't know what you gain.

1070
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It's not.

1071
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
When's the point where you feel like I did it?

1072
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Teens love me.

1073
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I don't know.

1074
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Enough be enough.

1075
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I'm like my Nickelodeon.

1076
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I don't know.

1077
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm like a funny dad on a Nickelodeon show.

1078
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
There's a new older brother on Bazaar.

1079
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Varg.

1080
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
He's way old.

1081
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
The oldest brother.

1082
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Old as fuck.

1083
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yeah, it's all still the all the problems.

1084
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I have the vibe that they can't even see us.

1085
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Like the scare actors?

1086
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
No, the teens.

1087
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Oh, like we were just so old they didn't even recognize us.

1088
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah, like they is like I found myself like almost like gawking at like like just like the way they interact and like how you're observing them.

1089
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Yeah, I was just like so I go and I I really don't think they ever like noticed me.

1090
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1091
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I know what you're saying.

1092
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I mean, they have to have noticed us.

1093
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But yes, I.

1094
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I just say the secret phrase.

1095
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
You guys want some bootleg jewel pods?

1096
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Still got mango.

1097
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Still got mango.

1098
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
You want some mango?

1099
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You guys want to buy some cat?

1100
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
You should have come up with us.

1101
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
You could have made some.

1102
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
The secret team code word.

1103
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Ketamine.

1104
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You should really go up to Valencia and the parking lot.

1105
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Oh, sure.

1106
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Make some extra coin.

1107
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Make some extra coin with your side business.

1108
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Your side jewel business.

1109
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Hangs out with us anymore.

1110
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Jewel pods.

1111
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
He just wants to hang with his Valencia team friends.

1112
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Sorry, he's got him grinding, you know, always working.

1113
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
You look like Steve Buscemi on 30 Rock.

1114
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Hello, skateboard.

1115
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
You got the soap shoes that you grind on the curbs with.

1116
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Oh, yeah.

1117
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Blast some Billy Eilish, y'all.

1118
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
This slaps.

1119
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So the opening ceremony.

1120
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
The opening ceremony, the monsters have been unleashed, and then they go through that parade, and then it's cool.

1121
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I mean that sincerely.

1122
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Then they come past the barriers.

1123
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Yeah.

1124
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And they explode into the park, which is fun.

1125
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
That's a fun way to get them all where they're going.

1126
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Because then they're terrorizing teens.

1127
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Like just shrieking, people running, like the teens running away from the performers.

1128
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And it was nice though, is because the teens took the heat off of us.

1129
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah, that's true.

1130
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
They're just going for the people that are going to scream the most, and they're just like, well, these two older fellows.

1131
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
These two are just waiting for their kids to get out of the bathroom.

1132
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah.

1133
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
These two are more concerned about if they're getting enough lycopene, and they're multi-funny.

1134
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
That's what scares them.

1135
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
That's the real scare zone.

1136
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Joint pain.

1137
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
This vector of prostate-ish.

1138
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Real monsters are in my body.

1139
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Speaking of one thing I just remembered, the sliders of the night going hard.

1140
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
One slider of the night went really hard in front of me.

1141
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh yeah.

1142
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And so it's really aggressive, and they spark, and then they hop back up, and they kind of get in your face.

1143
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And the guy slid, and he hopped up, and then he kind of just gingerly grabbed his wrist, and he goes, oh shit, God.

1144
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
He kind of shook it off, and he bailed on scaring me.

1145
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
He just goes, ooh.

1146
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Opening night.

1147
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
He went too hard.

1148
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
He went too hard.

1149
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
He went too hard.

1150
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
He might not work there anymore.

1151
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It might have been if.

1152
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I think half the scare actors that we saw don't work there anymore.

1153
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I agree.

1154
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Well, in fact, we saw one still in costume carrying his under armor backpack and just leave.

1155
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But low key trying to scare us in a way, I think.

1156
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
A little.

1157
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Because I turned around, and there was this guy in his mask at the end of the night right behind me.

1158
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,000
But then he just kind of moved past us, and he had his backpack on and his full scare actor outfit on.

1159
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But who knows?

1160
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Might just have poor vision.

1161
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
That's a good point.

1162
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
He couldn't see out of the mask.

1163
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
How close he was.

1164
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So.

1165
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Then we went to double cyclone.

1166
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Whatever.

1167
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Twisted Colossus.

1168
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Twisted Colossus we went to.

1169
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
So I said, oh, because we just had Rachel Blum on, and she raved about Twisted Colossus.

1170
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And I honestly thought Twisted Colossus is going to be a fast new coaster.

1171
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And new coasters generally are smooth.

1172
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And I was like, you know what?

1173
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
That's good.

1174
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Because again, I'm not a huge coaster guy, and I like some of them.

1175
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And it takes me a little while to get used to them.

1176
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So I felt like that was going to be a new coaster.

1177
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It's going to be fast, and it's going to really set the tone.

1178
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And I'll be like, OK, good.

1179
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I can do all these things.

1180
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's not going to be a problem.

1181
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Catapult, you were wrong.

1182
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Yeah.

1183
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Colossus has been there forever.

1184
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Well, the Twisted Colossus.

1185
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Right.

1186
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Well, Colossus has been there forever.

1187
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And then they made a Twisted Colossus because they made it a hybrid coaster.

1188
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Right. But I'm saying this is a new coaster.

1189
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
So it feels like it should be a new track.

1190
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It is.

1191
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Yeah.

1192
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Well, I'm just saying that I was right about it being a new coaster.

1193
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It used to be just one track.

1194
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It used to just be a regular wooden coaster.

1195
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Right.

1196
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And now they put you're on a steel track.

1197
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So it's a mix of wood and steel.

1198
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Right.

1199
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I couldn't tell it was so dark.

1200
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I was wrong about it being a good tone setter and smooth and not horrifying.

1201
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It was intense.

1202
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So we're waiting in line.

1203
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And again, we didn't realize we could have just hopped the line, but that's fine.

1204
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And so, okay, so we get in and I probably mentioned this before.

1205
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You know the seat on the Mummy at Universal, the seat that kind of juts up, like kind of puts pressure, and I hate to be so vulgar, but puts pressure on your balls.

1206
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Like, you know, do you agree that that happens to you a little bit?

1207
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah, it's like a lap.

1208
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
But it's like this.

1209
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's like there's a ridge.

1210
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So you're kind of up on an angle a little bit.

1211
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
In an annoying way.

1212
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Yeah.

1213
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Do you know if you've done the Mummy here?

1214
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It didn't make you shoot.

1215
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It wasn't good.

1216
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
This really is the second good.

1217
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Yeah, we get a little crazier.

1218
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And I have a problem sometimes where, and this is too much information, I'm sorry, but I'll try to be clean about it.

1219
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I have a problem with that.

1220
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I feel like my lower extremities are like pushing into my body in an uncomfortable way sometimes, depending on how I sit down.

1221
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So on Mummy now I'm kind of used to the way the seat is, and I can position myself in a way that is at least much more comfortable than like the first or second time I did it.

1222
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I was not prepared for this.

1223
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And you're not alone.

1224
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
It was so uncomfortable.

1225
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Because you're stepping off of a platform down into a coaster car.

1226
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And so you can't, it's not a normal way to sit.

1227
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Like you're not falling into the seat normally.

1228
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So you can't really adjust yourself in an appropriate way.

1229
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And then like once you're in there, you're so focused on your impending death.

1230
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Like if you don't like get strapped in correctly.

1231
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And we also have stuff.

1232
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You would like your sunglasses and I had my skeleton head mug and there's a we go.

1233
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Oh, there's a little pouch in the front that you just put your stuff in.

1234
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So I sit down and I'm not fully adjusted yet, but I'm just trying to get everything done because it's we're very aware now that maybe everyone's not taking such good care of you.

1235
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Yes. So I just want to make sure I'm seated and good and everything's secure because I know that maybe no one's looking out for me except for me.

1236
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
No, yeah, the teens like don't care.

1237
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
The sliders of the night are out.

1238
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You know, death is an alien concept to them.

1239
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yes, they do not fear death yet.

1240
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
They have no like we do.

1241
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
They have no issues.

1242
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And there's a teen running the ride who sounds like a 4-H fairground pig auctioneer.

1243
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Like he is he is like he's just so speaking so fast.

1244
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You can't understand a word.

1245
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
You don't know what the fuck the protocol is on this.

1246
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So we sit in the ride and we're deducing like, OK, here's the pouch.

1247
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And then Mike hands me his mug and he goes, no, no.

1248
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
So I try to put the mug.

1249
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So I try to put the mug in the pouch.

1250
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Right. And we both try to put stuff in the pouch.

1251
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
The pouch is about this big.

1252
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:28,000
But the problem with the pouch is that all four corners are bolted down, leaving the pouch.

1253
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
My fucking sunglasses didn't fit in the pouch.

1254
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You know what you're supposed to put in the pouch.

1255
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
What else would go in?

1256
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Are there cubbies at the station?

1257
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
No.

1258
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Sometimes there's cubbies.

1259
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
You could put maybe like some of your important documents.

1260
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
If they were folded in half.

1261
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Like loose change and guitar picks.

1262
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Like that's like all that thing.

1263
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So I'm like trying to like.

1264
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
There's not even a chance the mug fits in.

1265
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It's big.

1266
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
There's not even a chance.

1267
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Your sunglasses.

1268
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So now we're panicked.

1269
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Because everyone's seated and you see people's harnesses going down.

1270
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Restraints. So we're like, both of us are panicked.

1271
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
So we're trying to like, there's a teen that walks by.

1272
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
He's going to check everything.

1273
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And we try to just hand him our stuff to put up because we notice people are throwing like bags just on the side.

1274
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Which happens in certain rides.

1275
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Literally throwing.

1276
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Right. People are throwing and getting back on.

1277
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So we try to give him to the teen and he's like, I can't take them.

1278
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You got to get out of the car and go do it.

1279
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
So I do I you make two trips.

1280
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I don't know why.

1281
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
He handed me the mug and I tried to hand it to the teen.

1282
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
He said, I can't take it.

1283
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And I go, oh, you can.

1284
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Almost as if I thought he was saying like.

1285
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Like I don't want to break it.

1286
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Yeah. And I'm like, no, it's okay.

1287
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
It's okay. You can take it.

1288
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And he goes, no, I can't.

1289
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And so then I had to get out of the car.

1290
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
On the left side of the track and put it down.

1291
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And then.

1292
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Then you wanted to get rid of your sunglasses.

1293
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And then I realized my sunglasses didn't fit in the fucking pouch.

1294
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And so I had to get out of the thing again.

1295
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And at this point, like it feels like I know this isn't true.

1296
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
The guy in the mic is like saying three, two, one blast off.

1297
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I am like I'm freaking out.

1298
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And so he's like, I'm like I'm putting my glasses down.

1299
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
All right. I can't remember what I'm doing.

1300
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And then I'm like, what did I say?

1301
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I was like, you like swore at the team.

1302
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
You like you got like so.

1303
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Not him.

1304
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
But you were like you were like, I just need to know what the fuck is fucking going on.

1305
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
You said something like that.

1306
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Because you were so close.

1307
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And I was supposed to, too, because again, like I'm I'm trying to figure out these this restraint.

1308
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And I again, I have the same fear like you're going to like step into the car and the thing is going to take off with your leg or something.

1309
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It feels like that.

1310
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
In your guys' defense, this is a twisted ride.

1311
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And you did just deal with the Clown Prince of Crime himself, the Joker.

1312
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Yeah. So I mean, it's in the air.

1313
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah, there's madness in the air and fog.

1314
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Pineapple, piña colada flavored fog.

1315
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I definitely swore.

1316
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I don't think it was directed at the team, but I definitely was like to myself was like, I can't hear what this guy's fucking saying.

1317
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Like he's speaking too fast.

1318
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And so then I'm getting in and I run in the same problem Mike's getting with like your crotch area.

1319
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And then I'm not convinced my seat belt is none of it felt so secure.

1320
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Nothing felt so secure.

1321
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And I was again, I was distracted by what's going on with you.

1322
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And I'm trying to get seated.

1323
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I'm still like, oh shit, it just feels like it's like crushing my groin, my my genitals.

1324
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And I'm just like, oh, God, like in like like especially like my pain, like like my pain.

1325
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Like I hate to say my penis is like being forced back into my body.

1326
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
The girl and twister.

1327
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And then what happens is and then what happens is a teen walks by on the other side and I had already.

1328
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
So the restraints on this are just on your thighs.

1329
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
They're not on your body, your upper body.

1330
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
It's just on your thighs, which was going to play into the how crazy the coaster is.

1331
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I had had the thing down on my thighs.

1332
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:08,000
A teen comes in, cranks it down on my legs, even making the issue with my penis worse.

1333
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So it's it's crushing my lower extremities.

1334
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And I'm trying to get out of I'm trying to like move it and like figure out a way that this is going to be comfortable.

1335
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And you're and I can just like see you're like seeing like white.

1336
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Do you like you're not even with me.

1337
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I think. Yeah, Mike's dick's getting crushed.

1338
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I think that I almost would prefer to have been crushed because I'm convinced I'm flying out of this thing.

1339
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Like and so it just goes, it just just goes.

1340
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And I'm still I'm just like wiggling around in this.

1341
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
There's barely any room and we don't even have any idea what we're in for.

1342
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
We have no idea.

1343
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
It's all part of all of this part is all what we're concerned about.

1344
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And it's a slow it's a pretty slow ascent.

1345
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And it wasn't even that this is another thing with the coaster.

1346
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I was like, well, it doesn't even look like as tall as the other one.

1347
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So it's probably not going to be as bad.

1348
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And we get to the top and I didn't even know there's a gimmick like this, but it's similar to what and I haven't done it yet.

1349
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Hang time at knots, which just droops you over the side of the first lift hill and hangs you there for what feels like your whole life.

1350
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Let's say long enough to look in the distance and see the little brown shack where Mike's car is plugged in.

1351
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
The marauders have arrived.

1352
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It's being stripped for parts.

1353
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Steering wheel.

1354
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I need that.

1355
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
My last like moment on earth was going to be looking at that shack.

1356
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
You could have turned around and it should have been the sign.

1357
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So it feels so you hang off of it and it's such an interesting feeling.

1358
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And I'm going to do not scary in a few days.

1359
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And I plan to try hang time.

1360
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And I think it's going to be similar.

1361
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,000
But I think you've said it best is that and maybe you were not talking about this moment, but this is a moment in the right when your brain releases.

1362
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
The death chemical.

1363
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Yes, but just to make you euphoric, because what this is it obviously.

1364
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Right.

1365
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:19,000
If you were like on the plains thousands of years ago and you a big cat was going to eat you, your brain would just give you a little squirt of like, you get ready for it.

1366
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Yeah, like you're done for.

1367
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
It's really interesting because I do.

1368
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I totally agree with what you're saying, because as it was happening, my brain is one.

1369
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
OK, like, well, whatever.

1370
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Like I was truly like euphoric in a weird way because of how insane the feeling was like because remember you're not strapped in chest wise.

1371
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
It's just your thighs.

1372
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:50,000
So imagine you're like being pulled over and there's not even this feeling of OK, I'm safe locked into the car.

1373
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
You're being pulled over and then it just feels like your top part of your body is loose.

1374
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:02,000
So that sensation is really what is doing it is really what's making you feel like, oh, this is it.

1375
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
And in my case, my top and bottom were no loose.

1376
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I felt I was too much.

1377
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I had too much movement.

1378
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And so, yes, you were loose.

1379
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I was way too tight.

1380
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
So the podcast is over.

1381
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Anthony Geo died in pursuit of a story.

1382
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I just couldn't do it anymore.

1383
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
He would be too sick or like he would have wanted us to go on.

1384
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
He was really serious.

1385
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Surprise the right.

1386
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I was three guys.

1387
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I'm always RIP.

1388
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I'm RIP.

1389
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Give it up for him.

1390
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:47,000
We as long as you guys get one of those big ornate like back window decals of my birthdate, my death date.

1391
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
You're in the loco now.

1392
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
The loco is a dedication to you.

1393
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Angelic glow.

1394
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
We would have had to have some sort of a spirit of you come back in an episode.

1395
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
That could have been an idea.

1396
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Yeah, it's an idea.

1397
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Ghostly version of you on the other side.

1398
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
So we'll finish this section of the story.

1399
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
One second.

1400
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I believe if the park was smaller and we weren't exhausted from walking to try to find each maze, we may have done this again.

1401
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yeah, I considered it.

1402
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
There was something so perverse about the experience.

1403
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And like I admit it, like admittedly, it is like a little fucked up.

1404
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:34,000
But like there's something about it that was so haunting in the coaster was like fantastic.

1405
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Like it was so.

1406
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So yes.

1407
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Yes, exactly.

1408
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:44,000
So it wasn't like it was without fun, but there was so much surrounding it that was so stressful.

1409
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
That was so unbelievable.

1410
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:56,000
So yeah, what happens is you shoot down and this is like these are curves and turns and like I've never imagined before.

1411
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And all of it is designed without the chest piece to make you feel like you could fly out of the coaster.

1412
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
You get air time.

1413
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
You get air time so much.

1414
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
So you you whip around and whip up.

1415
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And I was just giggling like an asshole the whole time because you just you don't know.

1416
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I couldn't catch my breath.

1417
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I didn't know what was happening.

1418
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
It was so unbelievable.

1419
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And then, which I didn't realize before either, you go on it twice.

1420
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
You immediately go on it twice.

1421
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You go to the second.

1422
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
You go back to the lift hill on the other track.

1423
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Right.

1424
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
So I sort of thought we were done.

1425
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I don't think I realized that's what was happening until you just said it.

1426
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Really?

1427
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I really didn't realize.

1428
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
You remember doing a lift hill twice.

1429
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Yeah, I just thought we were a different part of it, I guess.

1430
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
But that was the same lift.

1431
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Same exact lift hill.

1432
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It was just on the green track.

1433
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
You start on the blue track and start on the green track.

1434
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It's not a racing thing.

1435
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
You do both of them.

1436
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
You do both of them.

1437
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
This is where I was.

1438
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Sometimes I think they both go at the same time, but I don't know that we really like they passed.

1439
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I know people say sometimes they pass each other because they both like one goes over and one goes under.

1440
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I don't know if we had that happen.

1441
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
That being said, I don't remember a lot of the experience, so it's possible it happened.

1442
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I was just like only remembering every 10 seconds of it.

1443
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
So we go up to the now we're on the green lift hill.

1444
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
It's the same lift hill.

1445
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:28,000
And I will say I start having an unreasonable panic attack that I won't be able to pull my genitals out of the ride.

1446
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You wanted to do this ride again.

1447
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Yes.

1448
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And I'm not.

1449
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Fortune favors the bold.

1450
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I am not exaggerating.

1451
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I am not exaggerating for the sake of comedy.

1452
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I'm just having a little bit of a mild panic attack that like something's wrong.

1453
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Something's wrong.

1454
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
And I know I keep knowing that it's not.

1455
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I keep knowing that it's of course it's fine.

1456
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Like it's not going to disappear.

1457
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
That's your stuff is not going to disappear forever.

1458
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:02,000
But I am like, oh, God, because like it's so I'm so like freaked out after the first ride that I and I have to calm myself down.

1459
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
And then it goes away.

1460
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:13,000
It goes away once we go on the next hill, which is the same situation of your the death chemical being released and going, oh, I'm dead.

1461
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And then that one is an even better track because there's a long stretch where you're upside down.

1462
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Doesn't you feel like weightless?

1463
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
You know, you remember that?

1464
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Yeah.

1465
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Like you just go upside.

1466
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
You turn upside down so fast and go weightless.

1467
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And I just remember like, like, what is this?

1468
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
This is insane.

1469
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
It's like a tight corkscrew.

1470
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Yes.

1471
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's so tight.

1472
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
It's insane.

1473
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And then we get off the ride and another we're just like we're fucked up.

1474
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
We're both like fucked up from it.

1475
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And we're both like we need a second to recalibrate.

1476
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Do you remember the first thing we saw when we walked out?

1477
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
No.

1478
01:11:47,000 --> 01:12:01,000
So we we walk out and we're both kind of like, you know, trying to basically explain what each felt and kind of pause and we turn and we look and we we see a teen with his mouth.

1479
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:09,000
On a fog machine like and then he pulls up and he blows it like he was like sucking the fog.

1480
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
He has a big fog flu.

1481
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Oh man.

1482
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Do you remember that?

1483
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I don't even remember that.

1484
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I think I thought somebody was just vaping.

1485
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
No, because I saw him in the bushes put his mouth.

1486
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
So the joke I made earlier was actually a thing I saw and didn't realize.

1487
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
That is a vapor.

1488
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
That is a YouTube vapor who probably makes more than any of us in a year.

1489
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
It's more money combined.

1490
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
You really should become a YouTube vapor.

1491
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Oh, yeah.

1492
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
My lungs would be jacked to do that.

1493
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I love that.

1494
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Start working on it.

1495
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Make it.

1496
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Figure out how to make a skull.

1497
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
But yeah, to come off something, be like, oh man, that felt insane.

1498
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
And like it was like equal parts like not fun, but fun.

1499
01:12:52,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And just to see like a careless teen suck up a fog machine and blow it out for his like kind of paying attention.

1500
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I'm not.

1501
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I'm struggling to connect with the part of the story where you want to return to six.

1502
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Well, I'll say.

1503
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Well, OK, so immediately we both kind of acknowledge that because I said like the ride actually didn't.

1504
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Other than my the problem with the seating, it didn't hurt.

1505
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It was smooth.

1506
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
It was scary, but it wasn't like my neck hurt.

1507
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
It wasn't like some of those knots, things where you're like jacked up afterward necessarily.

1508
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
And your balls and dick are inside your body now.

1509
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
But they're fine.

1510
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
They'll unleash slowly over like seven or eight weeks.

1511
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Yeah, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

1512
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Just like pop.

1513
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:47,000
But I'm a life would be much simpler if my genitals were destroyed by a roller coaster.

1514
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Is that a cup of coffee?

1515
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,000
The Sun Also Rises Part Two roller coaster hijinks.

1516
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Finally focus on my studies, becoming a better man.

1517
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
No more childish pursuits.

1518
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
My butterfly collection.

1519
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Finally, I could focus.

1520
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Mike, you're going to say that you're going to have to go back to Six Flags on the day they're running the coaster backwards to get your penis to like pop back out.

1521
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Good as new.

1522
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
So what?

1523
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
So where did you head?

1524
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Did you go to a maze?

1525
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Yes.

1526
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
This is going to be three and a half hours.

1527
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I'm sorry.

1528
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I'll get lunch and come back.

1529
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
You guys get you guys want anything?

1530
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
No, I'm good.

1531
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
So we're okay.

1532
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
So we walk in.

1533
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
There's a scare zone there with the fog.

1534
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It's funny that I didn't realize that kids suck the fog.

1535
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And then we wander for a while because it's hard.

1536
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Even though there's a map, it's hard to tell.

1537
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Very difficult to tell.

1538
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And we didn't have a good idea of the land during the day.

1539
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Yes, because this is so this is a very spread out park.

1540
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Yes, very, very spread out.

1541
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And there are elevations.

1542
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
So there's a mountain.

1543
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
It's why I didn't realize that at all.

1544
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
It's like a playful tower esque.

1545
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:13,000
The King's Island, Kings Dominion parks had to have this too, where there's like a big lookout tower.

1546
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
You know, you know who that was originally built for?

1547
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Hugh Hefner.

1548
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
What?

1549
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
We looked into this.

1550
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
What was the story?

1551
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
It is.

1552
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
That is real.

1553
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:31,000
He wanted it to be a he commissioned this roller coaster company to build a big tower for one of his Playboy lounges.

1554
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
OK.

1555
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And when they finished building it, he was like, now that looks like ugly shit.

1556
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And he didn't want it.

1557
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And so then Six Flags was like, well, take it.

1558
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And that's like that is the tower.

1559
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Yeah.

1560
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Wow. Yeah.

1561
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Yeah.

1562
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Am I wrong here? Mike, is that right?

1563
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
That's right. I'm looking at it again.

1564
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah. It was built for Hugh Hefner.

1565
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And yes, the whole night, Mike and I were like, what is that?

1566
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Like, is it a ride?

1567
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Are you allowed to go up?

1568
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
It's just it hasn't been worked.

1569
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's not working.

1570
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
It hasn't worked in years.

1571
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
The elevator isn't up to code.

1572
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Yeah. And they don't want to fix it.

1573
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I should say when I was up there for an event, it was a couple of days after those earthquakes we had.

1574
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Oh, no.

1575
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
So didn't seem like a lot of those coasters were running.

1576
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Like, I think Colossus started running as I was walking back to my car.

1577
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I was like, oh, OK.

1578
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Yeah.

1579
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Like, huh.

1580
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Yeah. The towers feels like the right kind of earthquake will take it down.

1581
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
A lot of things here.

1582
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And I and so we were before we knew it was an attraction that was just wasn't open.

1583
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
We were speculating like, what is this giant tower?

1584
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And the conclusion I came to, that's where the oldest teen stays and just watches over the park.

1585
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
The king of the teens, king and queen of the teens.

1586
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
We went to sewer souls next, right?

1587
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yeah. We went to sewer of souls and sewer of souls had 3D glasses, which I thought was fun.

1588
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
That's cool.

1589
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And this is where we met the king of teens.

1590
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Yeah. He came down from the tower.

1591
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:16,000
So we were wandering around up there and I was like, I need like any sort of mild buzz I had, of course, gone.

1592
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Like just erased by my adrenaline.

1593
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And I was like, is there like a can you get a drink?

1594
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
There's nowhere to be found up on this hill eating or drinking.

1595
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Maybe a water you could get somewhere.

1596
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
There's like a beer garden by Justice League, but you cannot leave the beer pen.

1597
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Well, we went back there. Yes, we would do that.

1598
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
So we were up there and I'm asking a few, I think we asked a person or two, like, is there a place to get?

1599
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And they're like, they don't seem to know.

1600
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
They're not very sure or they just don't want to talk to us.

1601
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And then we also was unclear because we had the VIP passes because of the press and we didn't know where to go.

1602
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:57,000
So we were wondering, we went to the front of the of the sewer of souls and we found an employee and we were like, oh, is this where the like the fast pass line is?

1603
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And he and we were blown away because he went, oh, yeah, right this way.

1604
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
He goes, you know what? Follow me. I'm going to show you exactly what you want.

1605
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
And we were looking at each other. We were like, oh, my God, I couldn't believe that.

1606
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Give this man a right. This kid should be running the whole park.

1607
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
He was future president.

1608
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Future president of Six Flags.

1609
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
He also directed you towards a restroom.

1610
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Yes, he told me everything I needed to know in an efficient manner very quickly.

1611
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
He was taking a shit.

1612
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Yes, he helped me.

1613
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
He's where you can leave your kid and tell the other kid to watch him while you take a shit.

1614
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Your shitty kids can wait while you take a shit.

1615
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And we got to sewer of souls and we were like, I mean, we kept talking about that kid for like 30 minutes.

1616
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
We were so blown away by him.

1617
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
We were enamored.

1618
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Sewer of souls, pretty, the 3D was actually kind of a fun gimmick.

1619
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I would say like a black light heavy 3D experience.

1620
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Yes. And this is where Gio learned my technique of following the teens very closely so I wouldn't get the jump scares.

1621
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Yes. So basically what Mike does is he will like, because there's two of us, we would go in with a group almost.

1622
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I don't think it was always teens. Yeah, right. It was always in the early 20s.

1623
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Yeah. And so he like really gravitates to them as they go early because because he's so far ahead, I was just kind of like trailing.

1624
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
You were getting all the scares.

1625
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
What's that? You would get like the scares.

1626
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I would get like residual scares because like they would reset.

1627
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:31,000
But if the timing wasn't right for a couple of the mazes, I was just seeing the resets, which is like kind of me just kind of going by like, oh, hello.

1628
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And like a teen like crouching behind a concrete block.

1629
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Nice.

1630
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:49,000
The sewer souls, I'll say, kind of a cool aesthetic, but yes, they it really, how do I say it, really fires off the grand finale early because when you first walk in.

1631
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Oh, right. Yes.

1632
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And I felt like it was unfairly deliberate.

1633
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
They had a heavy set scare actor.

1634
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Yes.

1635
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Standing in front of a giant mound of shit.

1636
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,000
And the implication being like that that's his.

1637
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And the sewer.

1638
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Also, there were no other.

1639
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
The shit was an animatronic, but I don't have a better word for it.

1640
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
There were no other like moldings.

1641
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Yes. Like that.

1642
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
It threw me off.

1643
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Like the first thing you see is like the size of that couch, amount of shit and then nothing really ever after that.

1644
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Yeah, it was.

1645
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
That was the shit was the climax.

1646
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Yes.

1647
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
That we saw.

1648
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Yeah.

1649
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
It's the first thing you see.

1650
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Because a lot of the mazes, you know, not to something that have a big like puppet or something at the end and like that's the big finale.

1651
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
So like you could imagine the big shit would be at the end.

1652
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
It's the sewer of souls.

1653
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
You got to build towards the mound of shit.

1654
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Yeah, I agree with that.

1655
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
You can't turn into the sewer of souls and see a giant pile of shit.

1656
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
It's interesting that the sewer of souls is also a sewer of shit.

1657
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Yeah, regular sewer.

1658
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
There's a commentary on our souls are just shit.

1659
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
That is true.

1660
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Just a couch sized pile of shit.

1661
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
That's what I say to myself every morning.

1662
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
This was maybe the least good.

1663
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Yeah, I agree.

1664
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I think we started with the least good maze.

1665
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
But the 3D gimmick was kind of cool.

1666
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I will admit that.

1667
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
That's true.

1668
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
They were paper 3D glasses.

1669
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So, you know, the moment the teens crossed the exit threshold, they were just throwing them on the ground.

1670
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
We should have taken them and gone back on Justice League.

1671
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I know.

1672
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
That would have been a really good idea.

1673
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
So then we went there's another one up on the hill, which is Willoughby's Mansion.

1674
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Willoughby's Resurrected.

1675
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Oh, I watched her walk through this.

1676
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
This looks pretty cool.

1677
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
This is just them ripping off the Haunted Mansion.

1678
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
It's like you're walking through their Haunted Mansion and there's paint.

1679
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
What are the paintings?

1680
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
There's paintings of the.

1681
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
So when you walk in, the entrance is a little hard to find.

1682
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Like it doesn't look like a mansion from the outside.

1683
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It just kind of looks like a quarter of a house.

1684
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:21,000
But when you walk in, they're trying to establish like this is the Willoughby family and they have their portraits.

1685
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,000
But like the moment you pass them, they're kind of like holographic.

1686
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
So like, you know, Mr. Willoughby looks normal.

1687
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And then like as you pass them from a certain angle, he looks ugly.

1688
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
You know, whatever.

1689
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Yeah.

1690
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Like, yeah.

1691
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And I told Mike, I was like, oh, I wish they would have set the scene like a little more of like early on.

1692
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I mean, I don't know how else to put it.

1693
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:57,000
They showed the mound of shit too early because they should have just like made me feel like I was in the house and then let the scare actors like kind of play play the role.

1694
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I think we need to put that phrase into our ride vernacular showing the showing them out of shit too early.

1695
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Jackov's gone introduced and then emptied immediately.

1696
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
It's a little bit of a mound of shit too early situation.

1697
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Interesting sets on this one, though.

1698
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Like lots of different things and stuff.

1699
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
That's like a higher production value than the sewer.

1700
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
And it felt like there was the scare actors felt varied.

1701
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Like some you had who were just like kind of wandering and weren't trying to like jump out and scare you.

1702
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
They kind of just look dead eye.

1703
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
And like that one library room I thought was cool.

1704
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:40,000
They were like kind of twin like girls in there sort of just kind of floating through.

1705
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I thought that was a cool moment.

1706
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
It's all one.

1707
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
There was like a room with dolls and mannequins with veils over their face.

1708
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
One is clearly a person.

1709
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Yeah, there's that's that's really will still get me like a room full of mannequins or dolls.

1710
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And one of them is clearly a person.

1711
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
As soon as you turn the corner and you realize that that's the setup, I go, oh, shit, shit.

1712
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Every time that happens, it's a good very effective because your brain is like, oh, maybe they're all human.

1713
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
So we do Willoughby's.

1714
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Then we're weighing Tatsu.

1715
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:21,000
But I'm so like skittish still, even though I wanted to like I kind of say no, because I'm a little freaked out about lying on my stomach.

1716
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
So we don't do Tatsu like the office.

1717
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It's a unique sensation, but you say it's very smooth.

1718
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
At least it wasn't 2008.

1719
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I regret not doing Tatsu.

1720
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Don't ever show your face in that office depot again.

1721
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I know.

1722
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I'll laugh your ass out of there.

1723
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Speaking of which, I just got an email asking for feedback.

1724
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Oh yeah, because you gave your phone number.

1725
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

1726
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I sent it for a reward.

1727
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
You walk in again and they go like you came back.

1728
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
They always come back.

1729
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Should have done it twice.

1730
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Should have done it twice.

1731
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Like that lighthouse trailer.

1732
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
You got to spill your beans, Michael.

1733
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1734
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Do you not know?

1735
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Okay, there's this movie coming out with Will and the Foe and Robert Pattinson.

1736
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
It's black and white.

1737
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
They're in a lighthouse.

1738
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
They're the only characters.

1739
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And I haven't anticipated a movie like this in years.

1740
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I know what you're talking about.

1741
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
It's shot in like four by four.

1742
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It's shot in.

1743
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1744
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It looks so weird.

1745
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
It looks like a movie from 1930 or something.

1746
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
It looks like there may be a sinister mermaid at some point.

1747
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
It does look cool.

1748
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I can't wait.

1749
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I agree.

1750
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
So we're trying to figure.

1751
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
So what do we do now?

1752
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I can't.

1753
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I'm misremembering.

1754
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Well, we tried to go to Superman.

1755
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
We.

1756
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Yeah, we try to go to Superman.

1757
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Shut down.

1758
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:39,000
But there's like the way that Superman's position in the park, you have to walk for like a while

1759
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
down.

1760
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Everything has is almost like in cul-de-sacs.

1761
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Like, and so we had we walked all the way to Superman where they could have put barriers

1762
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
up for a while because there's no shops or anything to go to.

1763
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So they could have just put a barrier up and be like Superman's under maintenance.

1764
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But what was happening was just droves of people were walking all the way to Superman

1765
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and there was like a single parking cone in front of the door.

1766
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
In front of the fortress of solitude.

1767
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
It's all the crystals from the fortress of solitude and it's like, no, closed.

1768
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
This is Superman the escape.

1769
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Yeah, this is that thing that just shoots you straight.

1770
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And he finally escaped.

1771
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
He got out.

1772
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Flew straight up.

1773
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Yeah, so we were going to do that and then it was closed and then it's like, well, we'll

1774
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
never be back here again.

1775
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Like, there's no way we're going to walk back up here.

1776
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
No.

1777
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:30,000
So we walked back down and then did we did I get a drink or do we do another maze?

1778
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Well, you got, yeah, you got a drink and then we had to sit in a little circle because you

1779
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
can't walk and drink.

1780
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yes.

1781
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
There is literally like three tables.

1782
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
They're like only here.

1783
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Yes.

1784
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
There's pens.

1785
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Drinking pens.

1786
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Which normally I would be annoyed by this draconian nature, but knowing that there are

1787
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
teens eating fog.

1788
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Yeah.

1789
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It's probably for the best to not have open.

1790
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
You're probably right about that.

1791
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:02,000
No, yeah, I don't think we can trust like people at Six Flags.

1792
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Because we watched a guy that was like maybe a teen, but also maybe in his 20s tackle a

1793
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
trash can to impress his friends.

1794
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
That's scarier than anything you've described.

1795
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
That was a show that was entertainment.

1796
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Man fights trash.

1797
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Tacklers of the Eve.

1798
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
But next thing we did, Mike, was once you got your drink, that's when we went past the

1799
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
coffins again and saw that they were empty.

1800
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
We forgot.

1801
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
And we went and saw.

1802
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Well, we were doing, did we do Riddler?

1803
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
We did Riddler first.

1804
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Then the Hypnotist.

1805
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Yes.

1806
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
So we did Riddler first.

1807
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So I said, you know what?

1808
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I need to go on at least one or two others.

1809
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I'm trying to get better at coasters.

1810
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And I had a drink and at Riddler's Revenge, there's a standup coaster.

1811
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And I love the Riddler, one of my favorite characters.

1812
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
So I said, well, all right, I think it's good.

1813
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
It looks like the Hulk to me too.

1814
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
The whole track.

1815
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I don't know if it's the same company.

1816
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I didn't look into it.

1817
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Same color.

1818
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Same color.

1819
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Green.

1820
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
But similarly, so I go, you know what?

1821
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
This will probably be okay.

1822
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:17,000
So we went on the ride and I will say, I immediately, I didn't realize it before.

1823
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
It's Batman Forever themed.

1824
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Edward Nigma's big like mind thing or whatever.

1825
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
When he's got the cable on the top of the cable boxes at home, it looks like a blender.

1826
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
There's a big version of that on the ride.

1827
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
You get kissed from a rose at the end.

1828
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Oh, I wish.

1829
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I don't think there was any licensed music.

1830
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
There's also, I posted on Twitter, the Batman Forever font is used elsewhere in the park.

1831
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Yeah, it's used as a font in the boardwalk games.

1832
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Yes.

1833
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You can like win a prize as in Batman Forever font or something.

1834
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Yes, which is very exciting.

1835
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
So we went on Riddler's Revenge and I'm trying to think.

1836
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So Riddler's Revenge, this won't be nearly as long.

1837
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Riddler's Revenge, I really liked.

1838
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
It was fun.

1839
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Stand up.

1840
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
It was no problem, except the seat also.

1841
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Yeah.

1842
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:11,000
It's like a curved banana, like a banana seat, but curved up because it's a stand up coaster that basically just goes up your ass.

1843
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
It's weird.

1844
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Yeah, it was uncomfortable.

1845
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I also think that none of the seats in any of the coasters are cushioned because they would have to replace them more frequently.

1846
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:26,000
So it's all kind of this like hard rubber plastic that's more durable, but it releases a different euphoria.

1847
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Riddler's Prostate Revenge.

1848
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:37,000
The stand up coasters for me are really for a five foot one man, when that banana seat comes up, my legs are like an inch off the ground.

1849
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
So I'm not really standing.

1850
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Did you have that too?

1851
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I had that issue as well in that it's if it locks early, then you're like your feet aren't planted.

1852
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Yeah.

1853
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Right. You want your feet planted.

1854
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
You want your feet planted.

1855
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Otherwise your body weight is on your taint.

1856
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
It's on your taint.

1857
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I don't know what other way to say it.

1858
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
No, yeah.

1859
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
So to describe it to Scott, like this.

1860
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
So you get in and it's like there's shoulder restraints.

1861
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
And yeah, take a photo of this.

1862
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Take pictures.

1863
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I really should have another.

1864
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Let's see if there's anything I can use to.

1865
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Let me use this ET doll as the seat.

1866
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
This is recorded.

1867
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
This is going up.

1868
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
That's OK. This will be recorded.

1869
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,000
So there's like sort of a shoulder harness and then there's this like banana bicycle seat.

1870
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I apologize to ET for doing this to him.

1871
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Edwin's watching.

1872
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Edwin is now going to haunt me probably because he thinks this is erotic.

1873
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
So the seat is here.

1874
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So it's like a little bit raised past.

1875
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:38,000
So you have to like literally put your leg over her and then like drop into this weird seat.

1876
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It's like I'm so glad I'm filming this.

1877
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I just did a really crucial zoom.

1878
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Let me turn ET around so it's not like he's got his face.

1879
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:52,000
So and then you like kind of like have to put you have to put your you have to like sit on it like this.

1880
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
So it's like you're like it's like driving up into Jason said.

1881
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I'm not paying attention to what you're conveying.

1882
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
That's OK.

1883
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I'm just enjoying filming this so much.

1884
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And I will finish the video by zooming into Leonardo.

1885
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
His penis.

1886
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Yeah, I can't.

1887
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
My zoom isn't good enough to see his little tail penis.

1888
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
But it's over there.

1889
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
And that's that cut.

1890
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Yeah.

1891
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
So so it's just it's odd.

1892
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I don't know why it has to be like that.

1893
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Yeah.

1894
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1895
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I'll say there was one part of this that when we first got on the ride, we were trying to determine if our media badges were fast passes.

1896
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Oh, right. Right.

1897
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
And we asked the team and he looked at it.

1898
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
He looked at it, looked up at us, looked at it again, looked up at us.

1899
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
He goes, I don't know what that is.

1900
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
And we were like, oh, OK.

1901
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I don't know.

1902
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Yeah, he's like, I've never seen any.

1903
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I've never seen that.

1904
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And we were like, OK, well, thank you.

1905
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
And then he was he was they're all like up for it.

1906
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
They're up. They're up to help.

1907
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
But you like almost have to like help them help you.

1908
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Sure. Yeah.

1909
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
They just don't.

1910
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Giving them practice, having a job.

1911
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
They just don't know.

1912
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
They don't know.

1913
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
They just don't know.

1914
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I don't even blame them for like being out like.

1915
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,000
They're thinking about the college essays and whether they have to do an SAT or not.

1916
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,000
They're bad enough to the SATs, let alone those subject specific ones.

1917
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
So Revenge Good.

1918
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I liked it.

1919
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Fun ride smooth.

1920
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I would do that again.

1921
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
And then we're walking.

1922
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
We pass the coffins.

1923
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And then I'm glad you said it, because Gio was like, oh, the hypnotist.

1924
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
We should go see the hypnotist.

1925
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
So there's a stage show like twice in a night, a hypnotist.

1926
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I won't.

1927
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
We have a picture of the billboard, but we'll leave her name out of it.

1928
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
We walk in.

1929
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
It's a pretty big size theater.

1930
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It's like the size of the Indiana Jones stunt show.

1931
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It's massive.

1932
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
It's a massive and it's up way up.

1933
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
It's like it feels like there are 50 rows.

1934
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Yeah.

1935
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Easy.

1936
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Easy 50 rows.

1937
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And she has brought, I would say probably 15 people on stage.

1938
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
20.

1939
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Yeah.

1940
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
15, 20.

1941
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And then we sit down and we're like, oh, it seems like it's just starting.

1942
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And it seems as if like her warmup is just confiscating their phones and then

1943
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:22,000
calling out to the crowd who is with that particular person so that they can

1944
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
then walk down to the stage and hold on to the person's phone.

1945
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
And like, Mike, did it feel like it was supposed to be a warmup?

1946
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I don't know.

1947
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
We were there for like probably 45 minutes.

1948
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I think like 30 or 25 minutes, but nothing happened.

1949
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Nothing fucking happened.

1950
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
No hypnotism happened.

1951
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
She put them to sleep, I guess.

1952
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
But that was it.

1953
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
And to put them waiting for something like a chicken waiting for the standard.

1954
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And yeah, it was just so confusing.

1955
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,000
And so in like I was also again, I'll leave her name out of it, but like some

1956
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:07,000
very problematic banter happening with like stereotyping and whatnot.

1957
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Who wrote the hypnotist set Shane Gillis?

1958
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Actually, he did.

1959
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
He's getting a lot of work these days.

1960
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Shane Gillis got cast on SNL from Six Flags Hypnotism.

1961
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,000
They scouted Groundlings, Second City and Six Flags Hypnotism shows.

1962
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
So do you remember what happened at the very end of it?

1963
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Let me can I say a joke?

1964
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
She said that I kind of like.

1965
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
OK, yeah.

1966
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
She was talking and she's doing crowd.

1967
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
She did so much crowd work, so much crowd work.

1968
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
And she was like talking like, oh, you're a couple.

1969
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
But how old are you guys or whatever?

1970
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Oh, 24.

1971
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
And she's like, oh, you got any kids or whatever?

1972
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And I can't know.

1973
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
She's like, hey, this is Valencia.

1974
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
You're behind.

1975
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Wow.

1976
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Wow.

1977
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Like, wow. OK.

1978
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Whoa.

1979
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
The crowd loved it.

1980
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Crowd loved it.

1981
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Yeah.

1982
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
And there's just there's she kept a little bit of hypnotism.

1983
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Yeah.

1984
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I don't know if we have to get into it.

1985
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
They were me for what it was.

1986
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Yeah.

1987
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Yeah.

1988
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Things are a little different in the high Sierra's.

1989
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
That is the official name.

1990
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
High Sierra.

1991
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Yes.

1992
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Yes.

1993
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Yes.

1994
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Oh, really?

1995
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Yeah.

1996
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Yeah.

1997
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Wow.

1998
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:30,280
So the little bit of hypnotizing we saw was she would be like, focus on me, focus on me,

1999
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:31,280
focus on me.

2000
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:36,280
And then when I snap, you'll fall asleep.

2001
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:40,640
But you could tell that she was really guiding these people.

2002
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:45,280
Like they were just kind of like not to say that I believe in hypnotism, but like she

2003
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:50,280
would snap and like you can see her like really pushing on the person's head for them to like

2004
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:55,280
fall asleep because like some people maybe didn't know what she was asking for.

2005
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:59,560
You think she just hit a pressure point and like knock them out?

2006
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:06,280
There were certain people where it seemed like it was more her than them.

2007
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:09,280
Like it's forcing them to sleep.

2008
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,280
Sleep.

2009
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:14,200
Also, the before she started, because basically the only trick I saw her do is make people

2010
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,080
like hug each other.

2011
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:21,820
She made a young girl switch spaces because she felt she was underage and the older man

2012
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:24,560
next to her, he was, she's like, I don't want you hugging her.

2013
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:25,560
Yeah.

2014
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,560
I don't want you getting arrested tonight.

2015
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:27,560
Yes.

2016
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,560
That's what she said.

2017
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,560
Oh my God.

2018
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:30,560
What is this show?

2019
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,560
Yeah.

2020
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,720
But now again, I felt like it was a long time.

2021
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:37,200
You said probably half hour, but like we never really saw anything.

2022
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,680
I was waiting for just something.

2023
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,920
Like when you wake up, you'll all be barnyard animals.

2024
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,080
Like, and we were just like, let's get out of here.

2025
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,080
Wow.

2026
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,120
Might have happened as soon as you left.

2027
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:46,120
That's probably true.

2028
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,100
As soon as the fun started then.

2029
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:52,120
Or you got hypnotized without realizing it, thought nothing had happened.

2030
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:57,640
You're missing like a, like 40 minute gap in your brain where you both were the chickens.

2031
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:59,360
You're actually still in Valencia.

2032
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,360
You were hypnotized.

2033
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:03,360
You thought you lived the next month of your life.

2034
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:07,280
Also, I'm looking through my phone and I realized just when we were at the full throttle bar,

2035
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:12,040
somebody tried to airdrop me this picture of the Pope with a cat in it.

2036
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,040
I don't know what it is.

2037
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,040
Did that just showed up on your phone?

2038
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,040
It just showed up.

2039
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,960
So this is like a cat poking out of a, I don't know what it is.

2040
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:20,240
I've heard of, do you have airdrop open to anyone?

2041
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,240
Yeah.

2042
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,240
I've heard of that.

2043
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:25,560
People in airports or stuff like teens playing pranks with airdrop.

2044
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:29,120
Here's us cheersing our dreamsicle milkshakes.

2045
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:31,040
It does look like a glass of fog.

2046
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,040
Yeah.

2047
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,680
So then we went, did a couple more mazes.

2048
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:35,680
We went to condemned.

2049
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:36,680
Condemned.

2050
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:37,680
Yeah.

2051
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,680
Was that one closed or no?

2052
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,020
No, it wasn't, it's condemned.

2053
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:42,020
It's not condemned.

2054
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:43,020
Oh.

2055
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:44,020
It's condemned.

2056
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It's condemned forever damned.

2057
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Oh, I thought it was condemned.

2058
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Was that the one that was closed for some reason?

2059
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Yeah, it was closed.

2060
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
We didn't get to do it.

2061
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
The condemned was closed.

2062
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
It was condemned.

2063
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
It was condemned.

2064
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Yeah.

2065
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,340
We were like waiting in line and then they're like, okay, the maze is down.

2066
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:01,060
And we're like, the what?

2067
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,060
What does that mean?

2068
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,060
All the teens ran away?

2069
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:04,060
Am I wrong?

2070
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:07,100
Wasn't there a sign that had the E crossed out?

2071
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:08,100
You might be right.

2072
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:09,940
It says it on the website, but.

2073
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:14,000
Maybe the, but the, the, the teen came out because we, we had hopped in the, the, the

2074
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
fast pass line.

2075
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,040
We were going to do condemned and then right.

2076
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:19,040
Red Riding Hood.

2077
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,040
Red's Revenge.

2078
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,040
Red's Revenge.

2079
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:28,000
And this team comes out the front door of the condemned building and goes, uh, he goes,

2080
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:33,000
uh, Hey folks, uh, just let you know, it's going to be, uh, quite a while.

2081
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,760
Uh, it's going to be quite a while.

2082
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,320
What could have gone wrong with the maze?

2083
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:42,480
He told us, he goes, uh, we had a foam board fall over and we're having trouble getting

2084
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,480
it back.

2085
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:44,960
Hear that.

2086
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:45,960
Is that right?

2087
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:46,960
Oh my God.

2088
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:51,080
I think I know why it was condemned.

2089
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:52,080
Wow.

2090
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:54,760
Foam board problem as well.

2091
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,040
Foam suggests light.

2092
01:38:56,040 --> 01:39:01,720
I just remembered something when I was at Magic Mountain recently.

2093
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:07,400
Um, I guess on Fridays, everyone wears helpful Honda days polos.

2094
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:10,600
Oh, there was a helpful Honda days ride.

2095
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,600
What?

2096
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,600
What was that?

2097
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,520
Or was it the coming soon ride?

2098
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,480
No, there was like a Honda.

2099
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,480
Oh, whoa.

2100
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:23,840
When we were, when we were many, one of our many times lost, it was like by the rip cord

2101
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:24,840
thing.

2102
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,160
And I go, look, Mike, it says Honda days, like helpful Honda.

2103
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:32,840
Oh, the rip cord thing that looked like they were just going to sail them to their death.

2104
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:33,840
Oh, I forgot all about it.

2105
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:34,840
Talking about that.

2106
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:35,840
Okay.

2107
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:36,840
We gotta, we gotta keep, we gotta finish.

2108
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,840
It's like a, it's like a time.

2109
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:38,840
It's a very confusing time.

2110
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:39,840
Yes.

2111
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,080
Helpful Honda days.

2112
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,960
I don't know if the nationwide promotion, but in Southern California, it's like a lot

2113
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:50,200
of radio spots where it's like, Hey, heard you needed your electricity bill paid.

2114
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,040
We're going to pay is the helpful Honda days guy.

2115
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,360
And we're going to pay your utility bills for a few months or like we're going to pay

2116
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:58,360
for your karate lessons.

2117
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,560
That's a ride of this.

2118
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,560
Yes.

2119
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,440
There's some, there's some ride themed of it, but yeah, that is the idea.

2120
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:09,960
Like the like, like capitalism has eroded our society so much that like, if you like,

2121
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:15,880
yeah, as a corporation, like masks helping in some way when like the civilian support

2122
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:19,440
staff of the justice league are all welling helpful.

2123
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:27,200
It gets a little confusing in my work for the justice league or Honda.

2124
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:35,480
Was Red's Revenge where I got a woman ran about 10 miles an hour into me.

2125
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:39,000
And then, and then grabbed me as if I was her significant other.

2126
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,600
This is a guest.

2127
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,600
Yes.

2128
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,600
Yeah.

2129
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:48,400
Someone just literally ran full speed away from a scare actor into me on Red's Revenge,

2130
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,400
which I liked Red's Revenge.

2131
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,480
I thought that was a nice, that's a fun maze.

2132
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:56,080
I'll say Red's Revenge did a little something Willoughby's did, mixed it up.

2133
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:58,320
Not everything has to be someone jumping out.

2134
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,320
Yes.

2135
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,320
You can build a mood and atmosphere.

2136
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,320
Yes.

2137
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:09,240
They had a nice little moment at the end where there was a, like a teenage girl dressed as

2138
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:13,360
a little Red Riding Hood, like above you as you walked underneath.

2139
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,480
And she was lip syncing to some dialogue.

2140
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,480
Dialogue.

2141
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,480
Yeah.

2142
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,480
Yeah.

2143
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,480
But it was good.

2144
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,480
It was a nice show piece.

2145
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,480
Yeah.

2146
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,480
It was a good little moment.

2147
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:26,760
With the forest, you know, like.

2148
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:27,760
Yeah.

2149
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:32,120
But I'll say as we, this was later in the night and this was the first maze where I

2150
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:35,480
started to see the teenagers get tired.

2151
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:39,520
What was the one where I, you said I made one of them laugh and they broke?

2152
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,520
That was it.

2153
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,520
That was Red?

2154
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,520
Yes.

2155
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,520
Yeah.

2156
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,520
Because what happened?

2157
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:47,960
She was like kind of checked out and like, as opposed to like, I won't do it too hard

2158
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:50,740
in the mic, like screaming.

2159
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:53,360
She went like, ugh.

2160
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:59,800
And you, you, you kind of clocked that and you go, okay, hello.

2161
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:02,880
And she goes, she laughed and said hi.

2162
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,400
Is that it?

2163
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:05,960
Do teens like you now?

2164
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:06,960
Maybe that was the acceptance.

2165
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:07,960
Yeah.

2166
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:08,960
That was the turn.

2167
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:09,960
That was the turn.

2168
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:10,960
Yeah.

2169
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:15,520
So then did we see the rock and roll show before the last maze?

2170
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,520
Yes.

2171
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:17,520
Okay.

2172
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,000
So I, these are just, I have to mention this.

2173
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,540
So there's a whole, there's a stage show set up in the, closer to the front of the park.

2174
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:27,680
And this is not something I've actually even teased before on the show, but I should have

2175
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:31,280
because it's something that Lindsay and I have talked about a lot.

2176
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:34,160
So there's a person that comes out and they have like a vocoder and they're like announcing

2177
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:38,560
this like graveyard band, evil band, and there's a DJ or whatever.

2178
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:43,400
And I look at the sort of lineup for who's there.

2179
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:48,680
And I get very excited because we live around Burbank and there was a place, there was a

2180
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,720
bar in Burbank that's closed.

2181
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:51,720
I forget what it's called.

2182
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:52,720
It's had two stories.

2183
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:53,720
It's right.

2184
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:54,720
I forget what it's called, but I,

2185
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,200
The Burbank Bar and Grill?

2186
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,200
Yes.

2187
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,200
Thank you.

2188
01:42:58,200 --> 01:42:59,200
Okay.

2189
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,200
And there was a couple of times when Lindsay and I were trying to figure out what to do

2190
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,080
on a Friday or Saturday.

2191
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:06,640
And I saw that at Burbank Bar and Grill, there was someone named DJ Ricky Rocks.

2192
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,640
Have I mentioned this?

2193
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:08,640
No.

2194
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:09,640
You've told me this.

2195
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,640
I've mentioned this to you.

2196
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:14,680
This is a bar and grill actually located above like a Color Me Mine type pottery store.

2197
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:15,680
Yes.

2198
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,120
You had to walk up a very steep staircase to get to the bar and grill.

2199
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:23,760
Oh yeah, which I did once and saw what the bar was like and then immediately turned around.

2200
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,760
I ate there once years ago.

2201
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:26,760
It was fine.

2202
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:28,760
It was just burgers and chicken finger.

2203
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:29,760
Yeah.

2204
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:34,360
So we saw there's like entertainment Friday or Saturday, DJ Ricky Rocks.

2205
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:38,040
And I always used to be like, and Lindsay's like, no, we're not going to.

2206
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:39,920
And I found YouTube videos.

2207
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:42,920
Lindsay and I are pretty simpatico in this area.

2208
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:48,320
Yeah, I found YouTube videos and like he's a dude who I think does a lot of like weddings

2209
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:52,840
and bars and he like plays drums to DJ songs.

2210
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:55,520
So I found all of his reels on YouTube and watching them.

2211
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,960
And I'm like, we got to go see DJ Ricky Rocks one of these days.

2212
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,840
And I always would say it and then she would always put it off.

2213
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:04,320
And then the Burbank Bar and Grill closed.

2214
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,520
And I was like, no, we're not going to get to see him.

2215
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:08,920
I look on this fucking thing.

2216
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:11,080
DJ Ricky Rocks.

2217
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:12,640
And you didn't know that till then?

2218
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:13,640
Oh, my God.

2219
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:20,640
And I was as the fog cleared, the sign emerged and the party became a rock fest.

2220
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,040
I was I don't even know.

2221
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,560
I probably was like just not even making sense to you.

2222
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:28,200
I was like, oh, this guy, this is a guy that rock and rust.

2223
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:32,800
That's kind of it was like, yeah, whatever.

2224
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:35,960
You like went, oh, DJ Ricky Rocks.

2225
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:41,640

2226
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,680

2227
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:47,160
He like wasn't he couldn't get it out.

2228
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,080
Lindsay, Paul's in body.

2229
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:51,920
What?

2230
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,960
So Homer yelling, Tramampoli.

2231
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,480
DJ Ricky, Ricky Rocks comes out.

2232
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:06,240
He's wearing spooky makeup and then is playing on my phone.

2233
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,160
Hold on. He's playing.

2234
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:09,560
I'm forgetting.

2235
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:16,560
And that voiceover, of course, Dr.

2236
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,760
Fright's going to be teaching everybody the Thriller dance.

2237
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:22,960
They're bangering.

2238
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,440
What? So he's just playing.

2239
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,560
What are you saying? That's the song name of the song is bangering.

2240
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:35,120
Is this Skrillex? Is it a Skrillex song bangering?

2241
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,160
I think it is. I think it is.

2242
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:40,600
I don't know. You so do you think that's like something like that?

2243
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,600
Yeah. Look, the citizens of Valencia are getting juiced.

2244
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,880
Hand stuff is getting done tonight.

2245
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:48,320
The music is bumping.

2246
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,440
I'm texting to stuff.

2247
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:51,920
I'm texting.

2248
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:58,240
In an environment where there is no soap.

2249
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,440
Where is there is no soap?

2250
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,160
Apparently a large young pregnancy rate, even though

2251
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:06,800
the area is known exclusively for the hand stuff.

2252
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,400
It's what a place. What a place.

2253
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,680
Watch your brother. I'm going to do some hand stuff.

2254
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,560
Go show your brother the giant piece of shit.

2255
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,440
Let's do some hand stuff in the toilet.

2256
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:25,680
You were going to say you did the coffin challenge.

2257
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:31,720
The coffin challenge, are you saying?

2258
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:37,920
The 30 best hours of my life.

2259
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,000
Baby boom every year.

2260
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Nine months.

2261
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:50,680
Everyone in Valencia is born.

2262
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:53,600
Valencia hospitals are rushed on June baby.

2263
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:57,040
July 31st.

2264
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,320
T.J. Ricky Rocks.

2265
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:03,360
Yeah, Ricky Rocks.

2266
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:07,360
So Ricky Rocks, I texting Lindsay video of your video,

2267
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:10,920
and she's pretty she's pretty she's very happy for me.

2268
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:13,520
You're dreaming your dreams solo.

2269
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:16,720
Yeah. You know, one thing that made my jaw drop

2270
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:20,640
and you can hear it in the video is I think you picked up on it, Scott,

2271
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:25,480
is that the the DJ goes and come back at midnight.

2272
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,400
We'll be teaching everyone the Thriller dance.

2273
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:30,840
I turned to Mike and I was like, how fucking late is this open?

2274
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:33,240
And Mike said, I think one or two.

2275
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:34,840
One a.m. one.

2276
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,720
I still can't get an answer.

2277
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:39,280
I put up the website on weekends, though.

2278
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,240
The park is open.

2279
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:44,400
It does say 1030 a.m. to 1 a.m.

2280
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:47,880
I cannot find an answer of when Fright Fest

2281
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:50,640
or the monsters unleashed every night.

2282
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:53,480
Was that for the grand opening ceremonies every night?

2283
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:55,000
OK, I think so.

2284
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,120
I cannot find a kickoff time for managed to coordinate

2285
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:00,400
a bunch of people running around every night.

2286
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,400
Yes, somehow.

2287
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,800
We downloaded the app to try to wrap our heads around it,

2288
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:09,040
like just like, where is some stuff and like, you know, blah, blah, blah.

2289
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:11,520
And the app was closed. Yes.

2290
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:15,360
According to the app, the park was closed.

2291
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:18,440
Yes, the app said that all the rides were closed because it was Fright Fest

2292
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:20,720
and they hadn't recalibrated it to Fright Fest.

2293
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:25,600
So you clicked on the hours button of the app and then a video of a team came up.

2294
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:29,720
I don't know.

2295
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:32,080
There's Wi-Fi in parts of the park, which is good,

2296
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:37,120
because there is like no data reception, no cellular reception up there.

2297
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,080
Yeah. So we just so then we were like, we were trying to like, what else do we got?

2298
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:44,920
And then there was a whole section of the park we didn't even walk to.

2299
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,440
We were thinking we were done.

2300
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:49,600
And then we were like, well, what if we oh, there's another there's aftermath.

2301
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:54,280
And we walked, I swear, it felt like another seven thousand steps.

2302
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,560
We walked to this other part of the park,

2303
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,160
which is where the construction for that new ride is going. Yeah.

2304
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:02,000
And we first we saw the ripcord.

2305
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
That was a thing with the flying. Yeah.

2306
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,760
That was way before. Really?

2307
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:08,880
Yeah. That was that was early in the night.

2308
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:09,680
Maybe I did die.

2309
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:14,240
But that's there's something like that back by the West Coast.

2310
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:17,440
You can sort of see where we were, but we saw we were much closer

2311
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,840
to earlier when we were standing.

2312
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:22,520
It's just a thing where they just hook three people to a wire,

2313
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:26,840
haul them about 150 feet in the air and just release them.

2314
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:28,600
Were you release yourself?

2315
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,120
Yes, you're right. You really wish.

2316
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:33,240
And it's an upcharge to release yourself.

2317
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:38,120
No, no, I mean, I'm really sure I'm trying to pay $15.

2318
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,640
They'd rather do it myself than let a team do it.

2319
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:48,680
Yeah. To me, it feels like you pulling the cord yourself is like fine print.

2320
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:51,720
Like, well, if you die, it was a suicide. Right.

2321
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,560
They roll with that.

2322
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:56,160
Is aftermath through the construction site?

2323
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:58,840
Isn't that in the very corner? Yes, yes.

2324
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:00,360
It was way tucked away. Yeah.

2325
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,680
And it's a lot of it's outside.

2326
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:04,680
And that was like, oh, there's like a zombie apocalypse or outbreak or something.

2327
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,280
I liked it. And I liked it, too.

2328
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:09,440
They were they didn't quite fulfill the promise,

2329
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:12,840
but they kept doing a thing where they would split you off into groups on different paths.

2330
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:14,720
And then I would be like, oh, that's cool.

2331
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:16,600
So we'll get split up. And that's like scary.

2332
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,720
And literally we would like round a bend and then Gio would be back with me.

2333
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:20,880
Yeah. Like, wait a minute.

2334
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:23,720
Like, how would you be like there was like a military guy?

2335
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:25,320
I guess the whole thing is like, it's an outbreak.

2336
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,360
And he'd be like, left, left, left.

2337
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:28,640
And then he'd point to Mike.

2338
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:30,040
He like deliberately like separated.

2339
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,880
He goes, no, you're right, right, right. Right.

2340
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:35,760
And so then we go and I'm thinking, I'm going to have an experience Mike didn't have.

2341
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:39,200
Right. And then we literally just like go around like 10 feet of fence

2342
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,680
and we're back with each other. Right.

2343
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:42,240
And there's nothing in between.

2344
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:44,880
Because we did this thing, Delirium.

2345
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,320
Was that the name of it? Oh, yes.

2346
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:49,160
Yeah. Siva Anderson for taking us to Delirium.

2347
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:50,080
That's a while ago already.

2348
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:53,520
But they that immersive theater experience that it was almost a little haughty.

2349
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:55,400
Yeah, very haughty.

2350
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:59,960
But all we would get split up and you would truly have different experiences.

2351
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:03,840
And I was like, this was not that this was the idea, the kernel of the idea.

2352
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,160
But not the idea.

2353
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:08,640
The color of the tarp was different for you.

2354
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,680
It might have been. I don't really remember.

2355
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:13,880
Yeah. It had been puked on in his version.

2356
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:17,000
Yeah. Yeah. Puked tarp. Puked tarp.

2357
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:22,000
But this is where we saw this character literally just quit.

2358
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:25,800
Yeah. Like he was just like we went through this little courtyard

2359
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:28,840
where they had like a pyro thing shoot fire over the top.

2360
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,440
Oh, yeah. That was cool. That was cool.

2361
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:32,360
Yeah. That was like that was neat.

2362
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:35,240
And the idea is like it's kind of coming out of a building and you're in this.

2363
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:38,720
There's like a couple of like abandoned cars.

2364
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:40,960
You're kind of like you're supposed to be in a city, I think.

2365
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:43,880
And there's a couple of scare actors doing it.

2366
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,200
Like they were like they were trying to scare you.

2367
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:50,640
And then as we came around the car, there was a guy just like arms crossed

2368
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:53,680
back against this like abandoned yellow cab.

2369
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:56,800
And he was done like it's 11.

2370
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,240
Yeah. Yeah.

2371
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:01,360
I think he was honestly like waiting for his manager to come fire him.

2372
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,040
How many? Yeah. How many quitters on the first night of these did they get

2373
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,640
where they go, oh, shit, what did I sign up for?

2374
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,280
They might hire over hire about like 40 percent.

2375
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:13,760
Yes. We always hear about the people doing like

2376
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:20,480
scary form and horror nights like loving it, like being into it, being jacked.

2377
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,240
I cannot speak to the fright festers.

2378
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:28,000
Well, I just mean like maybe even with those, there's still like 10 percent of them

2379
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,720
are like, I can't do this for.

2380
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:30,960
That's true. 45 days.

2381
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,680
People get very hoarse.

2382
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,440
Of course. Like from all the screaming.

2383
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:35,640
It's exhausting.

2384
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:38,640
There is like when I worked on the Universal lot, I

2385
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,160
I was there like last fall, so around this time

2386
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:47,840
and where we had to park, I actually had to walk through the

2387
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,400
like part of the back lot

2388
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:54,440
basically through like a line of people waiting to like

2389
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:57,440
get into the horror nights attractions down in the back lot.

2390
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:02,920
And as we'd walk up there, like next to where Nick and I, my Nick Mandernack,

2391
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:05,480
I think past guests, yes, more of a money episode.

2392
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:09,080
We we would park next to their holding area.

2393
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:14,520
And the vibe was like really positive and kind of cool of like the horror

2394
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:18,160
night scare actors where it kind of felt like a theater troupe.

2395
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,440
Yes. Yeah.

2396
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:22,160
It felt like they were like almost warming up.

2397
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,280
I just ran into him. He said something.

2398
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:27,680
He was talking about this and how it seemed like they were like trying out

2399
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:30,040
types of scares on each other.

2400
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:31,480
Like, what if I did this? Yes.

2401
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:34,560
Yeah. Like there was like this like exercise happening.

2402
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,960
Or shopping scares.

2403
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:37,720
Oh, yeah. Or shopping scares.

2404
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:42,000
And so then we on the last night of it, like we were walking to our car

2405
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,640
after a kind of late night of work, and they had set up like these sort of

2406
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:51,520
like these couple of like not tents, but like overhead tarp type

2407
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,960
tents, like that you would like like cover

2408
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,000
almost like a tailgate tent like type thing.

2409
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:02,000
And they had set it up to create their own mini maze

2410
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:06,120
for themselves to like go through and scare each other.

2411
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:09,880
It's so great. Like I hear it's it is like doing the run of a play

2412
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:11,840
where like everyone gets very familiar.

2413
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:13,440
It is like a full company.

2414
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,360
And then the last night, there's this catharsis.

2415
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:17,800
There's this great release at the end when it's all done.

2416
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,520
Yeah, that is so charming.

2417
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,280
It was very charming. Very charming.

2418
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,600
Everybody releases with each other.

2419
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:26,440
I'm sure some of that happen.

2420
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:29,000
If it's like a play, some of that's happening.

2421
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:29,920
Yeah, for sure.

2422
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:34,600
So then we make the long trek back to the front of the park.

2423
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:38,320
And that's I think when I looked up the steps and I was like twenty two thousand

2424
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:41,240
steps. You look what is that mileage?

2425
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:45,960
Because the health app will put will give you the episode.

2426
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:47,720
I'm curious.

2427
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:49,040
But do the math.

2428
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,000
But ten thousand is five miles.

2429
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:53,680
It's eleven miles.

2430
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:54,560
Something like that.

2431
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,720
Like ten thousand is like, oh, that's a good healthy day.

2432
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,960
Eleven point one is what mine says.

2433
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:02,000
I got it. Great. Wow.

2434
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,520
So we walk out.

2435
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,920
We're leaving.

2436
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,520
It's around midnight.

2437
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:10,080
We see all these old Warner Brothers, like Looney Tunes, like

2438
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:14,400
statues, big statues, and they're all just like they haven't been repainted

2439
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:16,520
or touched it on a shift manager.

2440
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:17,920
Do you remember this?

2441
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:21,280
No, shift manager with a flashlight in his mouth.

2442
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,400
And he was writing.

2443
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,360
He was signing people out on a trash can.

2444
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,640
Oh, yeah. It was like it was bizarre.

2445
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:30,800
He was no, he was doing it when we walked to the maze and then on the way back.

2446
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:33,320
Yes. And it was in the middle of the scare maze.

2447
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:36,040
It was like felt like he was a character, but he was just you were you're right.

2448
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:37,280
Signing people out.

2449
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:39,240
He was just signing people out for the night.

2450
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:41,880
And I was like, you got to do this somewhere else.

2451
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:44,720
Like just pick a table at like the dining area.

2452
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,080
Right. Right. Go, go, go.

2453
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,120
You stay. I have to write.

2454
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:52,720
What was your lunch again?

2455
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:56,600
And then I was very excited because I saw Taz and Mrs.

2456
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:57,600
Taz in the window.

2457
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:00,320
Mrs. Taz. Well, that was that's not his mom, right?

2458
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:01,520
That's Mrs. Taz. Or am I wrong?

2459
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:02,320
I think that's his mom.

2460
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,680
Tasmania. Yeah. Wow.

2461
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:06,320
So we're leaving.

2462
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:10,280
And again, I am pretty worried my car is not going to be there

2463
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:12,640
or walking the cars there.

2464
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:15,920
Now, we've been in there since 430, so it's midnight.

2465
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:18,800
So, you know, seven and a half hours or whatever.

2466
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:21,960
My car has charged 12 percent.

2467
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,160
I thought it was six percent.

2468
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:26,040
No, I don't have a good scale for this.

2469
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:27,960
What at a regular charging station?

2470
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:31,720
Well, a regular charging station, it takes two and a half hours for a plug.

2471
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:33,320
It should take six hours.

2472
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:35,320
It was six miles, right? Six miles.

2473
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:38,360
Yes, I could get six miles on the battery,

2474
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:43,560
which means that the amount of power in those outlets

2475
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,760
were so low. Oh, boy.

2476
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:48,200
It got me something.

2477
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:50,480
So that's good. I can serve some energy.

2478
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:55,440
And then we just one last laugh and we left Valencia.

2479
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:58,040
Went down the hill

2480
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:00,800
vowing to return to Six Flags.

2481
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:05,840
Truly. Now, I hope we're invited back to some sort of press event.

2482
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,440
They're not going to listen. We'll see.

2483
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:08,800
They're going to go behind a pay.

2484
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:09,960
They're not going to go behind the paywall.

2485
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:12,960
So hopefully there's some sort of need their money to give to.

2486
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:17,840
They need the five dollars to give to the the the coffin challenge.

2487
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:22,560
The one that's a pretty large percentage of that six, six dollars.

2488
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:27,000
Yes. So I mean, just a fantastic night.

2489
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:27,800
Wow.

2490
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:32,240
Like I said, like it fucking sucks and I loved it.

2491
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:36,280
I I do really want to go back soon.

2492
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:40,760
I've never been so happy to miss a podcast, the right related event.

2493
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:42,680
Oh, no, you're missing out.

2494
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:45,200
So the least up my alley.

2495
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:45,960
Jason, what about you?

2496
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:48,120
How are you feeling after you heard this story?

2497
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:53,200
Uh, you know, I I probably would have been.

2498
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:56,240
I think I would have been enjoying it

2499
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:58,760
because I would have had the experience with you guys.

2500
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:02,800
I think the mazes would have worn on me.

2501
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:07,760
One maze at knots last year, I was like, OK, it was they had a zap gun.

2502
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:10,240
At least they had like a laser tag gun.

2503
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:13,320
You don't get that in most mazes. That's true.

2504
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:18,160
I mean, these scares, though, even though I was cowardly, weren't that bad.

2505
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:21,200
Yeah. So I watched a couple of them.

2506
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:24,880
And the the name there's a YouTube channel.

2507
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:27,280
And I have to give the person credit.

2508
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:29,280
It's Sharp Productions.

2509
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:33,400
And it's a woman going through these mazes.

2510
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:36,400
And I guess that night, if you came with a camera person,

2511
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:40,120
you could ask them to like, oh, can you can I go in?

2512
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,800
Can you hold the line a little bit?

2513
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:46,640
And like she essentially is going in with no one in front of her, no one behind her

2514
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:50,040
and just her camera person following her.

2515
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,040
So she's getting every scare.

2516
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:56,400
And it seems like she did every maze at knots and six flags.

2517
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:58,320
And the footage looks good.

2518
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,320
But I really have to give her credit because just a single

2519
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:06,360
person walking through the mazes, they everyone's going for you like.

2520
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:09,040
Yeah, well, we I'm sure I'll say this either.

2521
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:12,560
I have said this and you've heard it on the episode or I will say it is that

2522
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:16,600
when I went into the us maze, the party I was with made sure

2523
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:18,760
we they held everyone off. So we got all of it.

2524
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:21,560
Oh, wow. Four of us in the us maze. That's great.

2525
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:24,560
Which which was scary, but good.

2526
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:27,080
It was good to experience it like that.

2527
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:30,120
So, yeah, but safer with teen bodyguards.

2528
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:33,160
If you. Yes, I was. Yes, for sure.

2529
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:36,520
And then at Horror Nights, they're probably like late 20s

2530
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:38,760
more or maybe my age.

2531
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:40,760
I don't get that level of quality that comes.

2532
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:42,920
Yeah. Partial college graduation.

2533
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:45,200
Mm hmm. So anyway.

2534
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:47,320
Wow. Oh, my God. Quite a journey.

2535
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:51,680
Yeah. I'm glad you didn't twist your ankles on that classic Valencia cement.

2536
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,400
Yeah. We'll be back.

2537
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:55,800
Yeah. There's more scares than just in the mazes.

2538
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:56,920
They're all over there.

2539
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:02,000
All right. The scare of your car possibly being the limited Panda Express menus

2540
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,280
at the Express Express location.

2541
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:06,720
Is there a Christmas event at Magic Mountain?

2542
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:09,960
Will there be a press event we would be invited to for that?

2543
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:12,440
Yeah, I would love that.

2544
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:15,360
I love Christmas time.

2545
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:17,840
I love the magic of Christmas.

2546
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:21,440
Yeah. You can be the hot guy and I'll be the Yuletide man.

2547
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:27,440
And man, you clashed it up to you're not going to be no guy.

2548
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:29,440
I boy. Oh, I like that.

2549
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,240
You'll tell me isn't shared in the Yuletide boy.

2550
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:38,000
No waddling for me. Just Coco, please.

2551
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:41,040
The scare actors hand out candy canes.

2552
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,760
Get it. Yeah.

2553
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:44,040
It's just the elves handing out.

2554
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:47,000
How can they unleash the elves at the start of the night?

2555
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,520
Low. A child has been born to us in the coffin.

2556
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:52,840
Nick place with the coffins.

2557
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:55,000
There's the manger challenge.

2558
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,320
The main thing is you survive Christmas Eve.

2559
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:02,040
You've got to sleep in a slightly elongated major

2560
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:06,280
and also not get hoof and mouth disease from all the farmatoles.

2561
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:09,680
Not pass out from frankincense fumes.

2562
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:17,280
All right. Well, let's say goodbye to our own personal slider of the pod.

2563
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:23,040
Anthony, you survived podcast on the fright, the cemetery.

Thanks for having me.

2566
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:27,920
It's just to the gift shop.

2567
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,960
Anything you'd like to plug or where can people find you?

2568
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:32,760
Oh, plug.

2569
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,800
Check out this spring.

2570
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:39,240
There's a new show that I'm writing on called Duncanville.

2571
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:42,880
It'll be on after the Simpsons before Bob's Burgers.

2572
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,640
So, oh, yeah, yeah.

2573

Yeah. So keep an eye out for that.

2574
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:52,720
Yeah. And then on Twitter, a GIO, a generally mostly WGA.

Yeah, we got a historic victory.

2576
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:58,040
That's good. Yeah, we did it.

2577
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:01,120
David Goodman, if you're listening, congratulations.

2578

2579
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:04,120
If he's listening to podcast, I should have him on.

2580
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:10,200
He's fending off the monsters of anti-union sentiment.
