1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,400
Welcome to Podcast The Ride,

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,640
the second gate, hyperspace hoopla edition.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,800
My name is Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,720
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,560
Hi.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,440
And Scott Garner.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,000
That's right, and I'm gonna let you steer the ship here

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,200
because this is something I wasn't aware of

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,800
and you did this to us, so the blood's on your hands.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,640
Okay, yeah.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,040
So teach us how to dougie, Mike.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,560
Teach us how to dougie.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,400
So okay, so I actually, the first time,

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,920
I think I've seen clips of this and not known what it was,

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,440
but I think on one of our social media things,

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,640
maybe Facebook and apologies to the person,

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,640
I think someone did suggest this months ago

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,960
and in the back of my mind, I was like, hmm, hmm, okay.

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,400
And then I was just looking through YouTube,

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,400
probably searching, I don't think I searched Star Wars,

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,360
but it pops up because of the algorithm.

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,560
And one of these showed up and I finally watched it

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320
and I went, oh, we have to.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,480
This is a thing we have to do.

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,280
So I do remember someone mentioning it,

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,760
but I did not actually see it in earnest

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,400
until a couple of weeks ago.

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,160
And with the Rise of Skywalker.

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,720
Rise of Skywalker, always good to time stuff.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,560
Days away.

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,720
Days away at this point.

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,960
With Rise of Resistance.

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,920
Oh yeah, ours coming.

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
Open, Rise of Resistance open and us,

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,360
we could look, we're not, we can't do,

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,440
we're just in Orlando, we're not gonna go back.

38
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,720
We'll wait till it's, we'll get to it when it's in LA.

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,880
Yeah. We will.

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,120
It's killing me though.

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,560
I've had a couple things spoiled for me.

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,200
I know. Without even looking.

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,680
Everybody's suddenly like, okay, so videos everywhere.

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,640
Twitter would know, like maybe some of us would like to,

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,440
and YouTube is just set up in such a way

46
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,880
that if you're holding on the thumbnail for a second,

47
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,720
it just starts playing.

48
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
So we're like, ah, get it away.

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,080
And pictures of, people just post pictures of robots.

50
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,240
It was disappointing to learn the robots.

51
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,440
Yeah. Bummer.

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,800
I think there's still some stuff I don't know, hopefully.

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,840
We know the ride is very long.

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,320
Yeah. So as much as I think I've seen

55
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,840
too many show scenes or pictures of show scenes,

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,280
I'm very excited because it sounds like it's 12, 15,

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,800
18 minutes, depending on how long things are.

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,240
And I don't know if you saw this,

59
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
and I know this is not a spoiler,

60
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,080
but the way the ride is set up,

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,520
different rooms have additional scene type things

62
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
and dialogue if you get stuck in.

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,720
So say there's a loading issue on the ride

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,120
and you get stuck in one of the rooms for a little while,

65
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,920
there's extra stuff.

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,720
Whoa. So you don't kind of just get stalled.

67
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,240
Like if it's pirates at the end

68
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,720
and you're just hitting boats, it's not like that.

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,920
There would be like additional things that might happen

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,520
or like dialogue from the pirates in that scenario.

71
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,880
I'm gonna say, I think this come up for,

72
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,080
the way they have been running pirates for like a decade

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
drives me insane.

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,920
Like I hate how many boats are in there.

75
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,240
Not Japan, I think.

76
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,600
Well, I can do it in Japan.

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,440
I bet it's not in Japan.

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,120
I'm sure it's very well organized in Japan.

79
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,960
Yeah.

80
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,280
But the whole ride is faster a little bit in Japan.

81
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,640
Yeah, but in case you know what we're talking about,

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,000
for pirates, basically there's a backup at the end

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,520
before you go back up the lift hill to get off the boat

84
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,960
where just boats smash into each other.

85
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,160
Slam into each other and.

86
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,120
It's amazing with all the concern of it,

87
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,320
like kind of quality of guest experience,

88
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,360
how much that you just watch people who don't know

89
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,120
that's gonna happen get really flustered and upset.

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,960
Yeah.

91
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,120
And they put these big like whatever plastic,

92
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,960
whatever their cushions.

93
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,880
Bumpers. Bumpers on the end of the boats.

94
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,360
And they just, you literally get like smashed into

95
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,000
and do smashing into people 10 times.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,960
Like while big show scenes are happening around you,

97
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,480
while you're supposed to be looking around you.

98
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,400
At the end when the pirates are drunkenly firing cannons

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
and guns at you, you're getting assaulted

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
by different boats at the end.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,320
So yeah, that does not happen on Rise of the Resistance.

102
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,000
Hopefully not. I've been told.

103
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,680
So this is, you know, what with the most cutting edge

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,160
Star Wars, the most like 2019, 2020 Star Wars experience

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,160
now coming to the park and process of being put in the parks.

106
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,480
We're gonna harken back to a very different time

107
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,040
that wasn't that long ago.

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,880
No. When they were a little more fast

109
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,040
and loose with these.

110
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,240
Yes. Properties.

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,840
So this is for the most part

112
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,320
before the Disney Lucasfilm sale.

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,440
Right before. Which I think is very important.

114
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,440
This was a part of, just to be very specific,

115
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,680
cause I seemingly love to do this.

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,760
This ran from 2006 to 2013.

117
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,360
2013 was the last year.

118
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,880
Real blowout year too.

119
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,920
I mean, we'll get to it.

120
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,360
They had upgraded them to the bigger stage.

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,520
At that point there's running jokes.

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,400
There's running characters.

123
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,920
And Star Wars Weekends goes back to the late 90s.

124
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,560
You guys ever go to one of these?

125
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,360
No. Never.

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,360
I went in 1999, I think.

127
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,240
And I waited two hours to get Jeremy Bullock's autograph.

128
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,280
Yeah, Boba Fett.

129
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,680
Boba Fett, the man underneath Boba Fett.

130
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,040
I didn't know who that was.

131
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,680
He's also an Imperial officer in another scene.

132
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
We saw. Where you see his face.

133
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,080
I have seen Jeremy Bullock speak at Comic-Con in Chicago.

134
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,480
It was the Men Behind the Masks tour.

135
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,240
It was him, Peter Mayhew, who it was, shoot, I'm thinking,

136
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,440
oh, David Prowse, who was Vader.

137
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,720
Anthony Hopkins, The Silence of the Lands.

138
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,840
Anthony Hopkins, Behind the Mask.

139
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,560
And it was, oh, the gentleman passed away.

140
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,400
He was R2-D2.

141
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,520
Come on, help me out here.

142
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,480
Kenny Baker.

143
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,320
Kenny Baker, thank you.

144
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,280
It was the four of them.

145
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,760
So I have witnessed Mr. Bullock in the flesh.

146
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,720
Now he was on stage, like at the opening ceremonies,

147
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,120
it was him and Carrie Fisher,

148
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,640
but her autograph session filled up immediately.

149
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,480
Okay, sure.

150
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,320
But he was very nice.

151
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,960
But you still waited two hours for him.

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
We got tickets and waited two hours.

153
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,000
He signed one for me and one for my buddy back home,

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,880
headshots.

155
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,320
Do you still have it?

156
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,600
Yes, I definitely have it somewhere.

157
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,680
So Star Wars Weekends, these events that they do,

158
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,120
where they announce upcoming Star Wars stuff,

159
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,640
and there's people from the franchise who appear.

160
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,680
And as part of it, this special,

161
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,920
musical celebration event, essentially.

162
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
It got topical by the end.

163
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,120
Kind of topical.

164
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,080
Pop culture-wise, it was topical.

165
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,360
Like I would say 2010 to 2013,

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,600
especially 2012 and 2013 was very heavily

167
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,880
the songs of the time.

168
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
And revisiting some of that music,

169
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,080
I truly felt like, what a simpler time.

170
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,680
That was not that long ago.

171
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,920
What a simpler era.

172
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,960
But really, I think you could call this

173
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,960
the kind of, I'm trying to think the D&D grid.

174
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,760
If Bill and Ted is chaotic evil,

175
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,200
this is neutral or good.

176
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,240
This is chaotic good, you're saying?

177
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,560
This is chaotic good.

178
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,400
I like it.

179
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,040
I think it's very charming.

180
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,280
I think it's very harmless.

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,120
It's very fun.

182
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,480
What is it that I feel like we need to get out?

183
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,400
Just literally, what's the blurb of it?

184
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,040
It is literally, I mean, I don't know.

185
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,440
It's not gonna be more than a couple.

186
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,840
It's more than a sentence.

187
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,040
But it's basically, there's two characters

188
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,200
that are hosting some sort of a live performance show.

189
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,520
And then there's generally a narrative

190
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,800
that happens during it.

191
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,680
And all the Star Wars characters come out

192
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,040
and dance to modern music.

193
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,880
It's a dance off.

194
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,280
It's a dance off, dance show, dance performance.

195
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,680
The bulk of it is a dance off

196
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,680
that is usually seemingly like Dark Side versus good.

197
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,240
The character sometimes will dance to a modern song

198
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,880
that might slightly relate to whatever the relationship is

199
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,480
in the Star Wars movies.

200
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,920
And we'll get to the later ones.

201
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,560
But like for instance, Padme and Lord Vader

202
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,880
dancing to Trouble by Taylor Swift.

203
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,200
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.

204
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,720
I don't know if it's quite the perfect song for them,

205
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,400
but that's the general idea.

206
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,320
It's really a big Jimmy Fallon lip sync battle

207
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,200
with all Star Wars characters.

208
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,240
Because they are not performing the songs.

209
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,120
It's not a Beetlejuice Graveyard review

210
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,680
where they're performing them as the characters.

211
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,640
It is all lip sync and dance off.

212
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,480
There's a little narrative depending on,

213
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,800
and then they go a little bit,

214
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,680
one of them ends up being sort of the emperor takes over

215
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,120
in later years.

216
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,400
So there's a little narrative that they would,

217
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,720
they definitely expand the show

218
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,560
because the show basically starts out

219
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,320
and they're kind of closer to the Star Tours.

220
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,720
There's a smaller stage next to Star Tours.

221
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,920
And then in 2011, they got upgraded to the big stage.

222
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
You've seen some of this, I assume.

223
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,680
This is the original location.

224
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,200
It's right by Star Tours, pretty modest size.

225
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,920
Boy, this blew up.

226
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,000
I've only seen the bigger stages.

227
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,120
So this became-

228
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,680
This is where I saw Leia and Bullock,

229
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
Fisher and Bullock,

230
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,080
kicking off Star Wars weekends in smaller stage.

231
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
So yeah, they start on a smaller stage

232
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
and you can tell that there's just not quite

233
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,400
as many characters and the scale is obviously not as big.

234
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,240
Well, because what you find as these things go on,

235
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,800
like in what you're watching,

236
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,240
there's our hosts of the show

237
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,800
and then like Luke and Leia came out

238
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
and there's storm troopers and characters you'd expect.

239
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,040
And that was Kit Fisto, by the way.

240
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,880
That was Kit Fisto.

241
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,680
One of the running jokes of it.

242
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,160
They say, Kit Fisto comes out and they go,

243
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,920
Kit Fisto, he never comes out.

244
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,880
And it's a joke in that you just repeat it so many times.

245
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,040
The people who see it every year know it's going to come.

246
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,360
I guess it's more of a reference.

247
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,200
There's Django.

248
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,120
That's Django Fett right there

249
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,960
because he has his blue and a silver outfit.

250
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,160
What's amazing about this thing as it goes on

251
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,760
is that like, boys, every character represented,

252
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,240
there is such a vast array of performers

253
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,880
and like deep cut people from Star Wars Universe

254
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,800
all singing and dancing, not singing, but dancing.

255
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,760
It all gets deeper too as it goes too

256
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,600
because there's a ton.

257
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,880
Like Kit Fisto in year one is pretty crazy.

258
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,080
That's pretty obscure.

259
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,040
Oh yeah, the assassin from episode two.

260
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Oh, Wessel.

261
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,880
What's her name?

262
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,120
Zam?

263
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,000
I wrote it down.

264
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,280
I always forget her name.

265
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
Zam Wessel.

266
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,400
The assassin, you know, Scott from Attack of the Clones.

267
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,240
Yeah, of course.

268
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,080
They go through Coruscant.

269
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,920
Yeah.

270
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,760
Yes, yeah.

271
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,720
The prequels are good now, I agree.

272
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,760
And I know for sure who that character is

273
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,640
and I don't need to restay the Zam.

274
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,800
Zam Wessel.

275
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,320
Zam Wessel, of course.

276
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,160
It was good.

277
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,000
Zam is good!

278
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,760
That's what we're supposed to be doing, right?

279
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,880
Zam Wessel is good.

280
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,640
Obviously, I have taken the podcaster mantle

281
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,640
where we've all agreed that the prequels are very good.

282
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,480
That's right.

283
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,880
And that's me and I'm part of it.

284
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,840
That's right.

285
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,080
And there's gonna be a lot of those characters

286
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,920
that are good showing up.

287
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,200
You know, we've gone on and on about what this is

288
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,840
and then various, and then I turn and look at the screen

289
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,920
and it's like Chewbacca doing YMCA.

290
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,960
Yes, so okay, so my first thought,

291
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,480
I watched a little bit of maybe this first one.

292
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,960
Oh, I watched like six of these.

293
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,120
Oh no, I watched six too.

294
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Yeah, okay.

295
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,240
I'm saying though that.

296
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,280
Me too.

297
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,120
Sure, yeah.

298
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,080
It's fine, it's fine.

299
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
I'm saying that I initially was like,

300
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,800
okay, so their characters are,

301
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,840
these are original Park-specific Star Wars characters.

302
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,320
Snig and Oopla, a male and a female.

303
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,320
So it's- Conveniently named to rhyme with Oopla, clearly.

304
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,280
Very convenient.

305
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,280
And they are like hosting some sort of, you know, like-

306
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,480
What do you think it's gonna be before problems happen?

307
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,960
It's like the Emperor comes and they seem surprised.

308
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,600
Like what do you think, it's like when Mr. Show starts

309
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
and they're making one show

310
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
but then a character interrupts and what's this?

311
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,200
Right.

312
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,760
Like what do you think Snig and Oopla are starting to do?

313
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,280
Honestly, it's like, and this is gonna be

314
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,840
a real modern reference, it's like a Steven Eady

315
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,760
off the strip Vegas show, Steven Eady,

316
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,800
where like performers would open up for Sinatra.

317
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,640
Oh yes, yeah.

318
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,200
Well let's say Donnie and Marie who just ended their run

319
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,280
at the Flamingo after 11 years.

320
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,120
Yeah.

321
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,400
A lot of emotions in the air.

322
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,080
The, but like something where, you know,

323
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,080
yeah, it's a fun little variety show in Star Wars world

324
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,880
and then maybe some extra characters might pop in.

325
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,720
Yes.

326
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,480
But they're surprised to the extent to which

327
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,560
all of the dynamics and fights all play out

328
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,800
during the fun variety show.

329
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,760
Yeah, so they have a lot of like dumb jokes and puns

330
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,760
and I first, I was like, this is kind of bad, okay.

331
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,040
But we'll still talk about it.

332
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,520
And then especially these early ones that have such a scale

333
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,600
and then by the end of 2012, 2013,

334
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,560
there are some big moments, some big surprises.

335
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,400
Yeah.

336
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,520
And I was like, this is good I guess.

337
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
They hit their stride and then they immediately

338
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,360
got canceled.

339
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,200
Yes.

340
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,040
In fact, at Star Wars Weekends 2014, they said,

341
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,920
oh, Snig and Oopla have been frozen in carbonite.

342
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,160
That's why they weren't here.

343
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,640
That's so grim.

344
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,480
Like that's so.

345
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,320
Yeah it is.

346
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,480
But it implies they could come back.

347
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,320
It doesn't imply they could come back.

348
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,520
It does.

349
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,440
Did you, do you know the end Scott of the 2013 one?

350
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
I don't know the years off end.

351
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,280
The 2013 one is the PS there is a wonderful vintage.

352
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,040
There is a big reveal at the end of 2013

353
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,480
that I am so delighted by.

354
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,600
You probably know what I'm talking about.

355
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,960
I just don't know how to, like I saw a lot of dancing

356
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,160
and I can't put a year, I can't associate a year

357
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,000
with a year.

358
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,920
Well there's two, there were two moments in 2013

359
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,840
that I was applauding for.

360
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,680
It's like a coda to the whole show.

361
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,160
Whatever these are.

362
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

363
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,480
For all this build up.

364
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,320
It is.

365
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,680
Oh yeah, you know what's gonna deliver.

366
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,520
It's great.

367
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,360
You know what has to deliver.

368
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,400
So there was three times I marked out

369
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,240
that I popped to watch this.

370
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
There's stuff I really like.

371
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
I'm just saying that there was one thing

372
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,880
that was very unexpected that happened at the end.

373
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,960
Kind of a fitting ending.

374
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,800
Oh yeah.

375
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,240
Kind of a fitting ending.

376
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,920
Oh yes, very poetic.

377
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,360
You know what these feel like to me

378
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,160
from watching them is it feels like a,

379
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,640
it's like a high school rally.

380
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,040
The way that high school rallies,

381
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,320
at least at my school were kind of like,

382
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,560
it's the day when people say,

383
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,200
when people are snooty about sketch comedy

384
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,520
and like it's not skits, it's sketches.

385
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,200
Skits is the epitome of what rallies are.

386
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,120
And where there are this like meandering,

387
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,000
some of it is, you know, the football team

388
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,360
dancing to the Spice Girls and some of the like.

389
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,920
They have a cheerleader outfit on,

390
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,880
which is what I think would happen at our school.

391
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,720
Yeah.

392
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,920
The football players would have a cheerleader,

393
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,080
the cheerleader outfits on and people would like

394
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,440
melt down because of that.

395
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,840
And at the time I remember we were like, this sucks.

396
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,600
This could be a little, if this were written better.

397
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,440
You push your glasses up.

398
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,520
But the audience for those rallies on board.

399
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,800
The audience for hyperspace, blah, blah, blah, on board.

400
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,440
The microphone on all of the recorded versions of this.

401
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,160
And there are a lot on YouTube.

402
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,720
The microphones are struggling on the cameras

403
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,360
because there's so much screaming.

404
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,200
Yes.

405
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,960
People are losing their shit.

406
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,320
There was the moment I'm talking about at the end of 2013,

407
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,560
someone yells next to the guy in the camera.

408
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,200
Oh my God.

409
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,840
So loudly.

410
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,680
It's so funny.

411
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,160
Is it fucking Gangnam Style?

412
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,000
What is it?

413
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,840
No, no, Gangnam Style.

414
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,680
Well that's right before it.

415
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,520
Don't worry.

416
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,360
That's right before it.

417
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,180
Don't worry.

418
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,180
I want a best of this.

419
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,740
When all the characters started doing Gangnam Style.

420
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,260
I will guarantee that you will like it.

421
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,180
You will certainly think I'm building it up too much.

422
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,620
But I will guarantee you'll like it.

423
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,460
Okay.

424
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,300
Yeah.

425
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,140
I will guarantee that.

426
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,020
So how do we begin?

427
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,100
How do we dissect this?

428
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,420
So I'll say this.

429
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,020
Basically I think what happened is,

430
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,900
and this is, you could see it happen at the park.

431
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,100
So Disney buys Lucasfilm in 2012.

432
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,700
This has another year.

433
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,540
And then it's sort of the mandate of like,

434
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,420
no fun for Star Wars anymore.

435
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,780
There's that robot.

436
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,740
It's the best decision anyone ever made.

437
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,580
Yeah.

438
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,400
Cause they discontinued,

439
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,820
they had those Muppet Star Wars characters

440
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,540
in the park toys and stuff.

441
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,500
And it was a lot of like maybe sillier things.

442
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,420
Cars Star Wars.

443
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,420
I have a Guido and Luigi as R2-D2 and C3PO.

444
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,740
And I think when they bought it,

445
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,620
it was like no more fun.

446
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,700
Cause there's no reason in a theme park

447
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,420
this couldn't have still been happening.

448
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,540
Like this isn't, you know, fine.

449
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,340
Don't put a movie out about the Hyperspace.

450
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,580
Also this, there's so many costumes in this.

451
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,500
It's such an intensive costuming

452
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,700
and they have to get all these dancers.

453
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,700
This only ran for like nine or 10 nights a year.

454
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,700
Yeah.

455
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,420
So once a night, this was how the night would end.

456
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,840
That is a running joke that like imperial regulations

457
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,260
require the show to wrap up by 8 p.m.

458
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,500
Like.

459
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,460
I mean, look, they should,

460
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,620
they put it over at the California Adventure stage.

461
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,460
Yes.

462
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,300
Yeah, sure.

463
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,620
Maybe it will.

464
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,780
You know, there's some sillier stuff on Mandalorian now.

465
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,200
Maybe we're slowly.

466
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,700
I think as soon as Kennedy's out,

467
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,900
we're getting silly again.

468
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,740
Maybe.

469
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,580
I hope, I hope.

470
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,420
It's possible.

471
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,240
Silly, yeah.

472
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
And then release the hashtag

473
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,720
release the bug main Han Solo comedy sketches.

474
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,780
Wherever they are.

475
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,620
Yeah, yeah.

476
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,860
Can you explain that to the audience again?

477
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,180
I, before Star Wars decided it couldn't be funny,

478
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,760
there was an officially mandated YouTube sketch series

479
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,400
that a lot of guests on this show were part of.

480
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,280
And it included the casting of bug main as Han Solo.

481
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,040
And I don't know where it can be seen.

482
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,200
I don't think he knows.

483
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,920
I don't think anyone, if anyone listening,

484
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,760
if anyone's listening,

485
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,720
it was like an editor on it or something, please.

486
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,560
But yeah, hashtag release bug main Han Solo.

487
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,760
That's our Snyder cut.

488
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
Yes, much more important.

489
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,440
Yeah, yeah.

490
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,280
And it's gonna be a,

491
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,080
it's gonna be a tidal wave when Ben Affleck

492
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,040
tweets about that.

493
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,200
Oh.

494
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,040
There's a whole season.

495
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,480
I can see it by the way in that happening in 2020.

496
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,760
Not even like it's stopping my day that much.

497
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,840
Being like, huh.

498
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,680
Wow.

499
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,200
Okay, well, yeah, of course I guess.

500
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,240
He just ran into him and he heard about it.

501
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,080
Jeez crazy.

502
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,400
Well, I gotta go get gas.

503
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,640
Yeah.

504
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,880
Ben Affleck tweeting about the Han Solo played by bug main.

505
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,360
Yeah, okay, cool.

506
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,680
I think I've mentioned before,

507
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,640
there's a whole season of television

508
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,200
called Star Wars Detours.

509
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,040
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,880
I believe it is.

511
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,240
Stop Motion from Stupid Buddy who make robot chicken.

512
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,800
Like, Stop Motion Star Wars.

513
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,640
And that got canned as well.

514
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,460
That got canned.

515
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,660
There was specials, but there was a whole season.

516
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,500
I don't know if people know this,

517
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,740
there was this Han Solo comedy movie being made

518
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,580
by like some of the best comedy directors in the world.

519
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,780
And it got canned and they got fired.

520
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,500
I'm not sure what happened to it after that.

521
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,100
But like, you know those guys who every movie they make

522
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,220
is a massive, mass genre defying hit.

523
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,580
Those, they were gonna, Lord and Miller,

524
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,500
they were gonna make a Han Solo comedy.

525
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,380
And I don't know what happened.

526
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,820
I mean, release, is there a release of Lord and Miller cut?

527
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,900
I mean, they never made a cut maybe.

528
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,740
I'm not sure it's possible.

529
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,580
But there's 80%, there's like,

530
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,200
they shot 80% of the movie.

531
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,100
Oh, and they did film like all of the jokes.

532
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,620
So those are shot.

533
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,900
That's what I wanna see.

534
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,740
Yeah.

535
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,540
Is whatever all that footage was.

536
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,380
They exist.

537
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,420
Yeah, unless every single time Lawrence Kesden

538
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,140
walked in front of the camera and,

539
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,980
no, no, no, no, don't use it.

540
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,140
She shakes the camera so it's un-usable.

541
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,260
Grading papers for his USC class.

542
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,860
Like, stop making me come down here so much.

543
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,700
I have to teach.

544
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,380
Stick to my dialogue.

545
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,420
Stick to the dialogue in the script.

546
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,420
Which is supposedly what the issue was,

547
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,980
is they wanted to punch that dialogue up.

548
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,820
No, no, no.

549
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,900
Stick to the, I am a Solo traveler.

550
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,020
Star Wars has no jokes cut to jokes,

551
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,540
lots of jokes in New Hope.

552
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,100
No, no, no, George didn't want them.

553
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,980
They, somebody made them put it in.

554
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,840
Excuse me, there's jokes.

555
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,740
They fly now, okay?

556
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,580
They fly now.

557
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
They fly now.

558
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,700
They fly now, which was a clip that was released,

559
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,060
again, we have not seen Rise of Skywalker.

560
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,780
Jet packs, not an unusual sight in the Star Wars universe.

561
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,900
Kind of been canon for a while.

562
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,420
Like, the Mandalorians have jet packs.

563
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,620
Boba Fett has a jet pack.

564
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,460
Yeah, not a structure.

565
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,940
Like, I don't quite understand why these characters

566
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,860
were so shocked at like, suddenly someone has a jet pack.

567
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,460
I don't, that was a little.

568
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,860
I don't even, that's less my issue and more that we're like,

569
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,740
letting like, you know, scrubs type delivery of,

570
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,260
of alt-y lines into the Star Wars franchise.

571
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,580
I know I'm saying I want Star Wars to be fun again,

572
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,580
but maybe not that type of fun.

573
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,140
We want it to be, okay, yes.

574
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,860
We want it to be a dance battle fun.

575
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,700
Yeah.

576
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,100
We want it to be Lord and Miller riff fun.

577
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,580
We can approve the type of fun

578
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,500
and as much, as much bug main as possible.

579
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,620
And as much bug main Han Solo.

580
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,340
I mean, who doesn't want that?

581
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,580
So, yeah, so basically they stopped this.

582
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,340
They still do these big fan events.

583
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,140
They still have all the actors out and everyone likes it.

584
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,500
And they, they do plenty of serious stuff too.

585
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,020
They do a pretty cool show where they show clips

586
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,840
from the movies.

587
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,740
Did you see that while we were there?

588
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,140
Or where they, they show like, it's a projection show.

589
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,820
Oh, I saw some of that.

590
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,660
It's kind of fun.

591
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,500
It's like, you know.

592
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,660
I was weaving Toy Story Land during that.

593
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,220
And like, pyro is so close to you.

594
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,420
They don't block off where like massive pyro is going off.

595
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,700
Yeah, it's really nuts.

596
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,300
Yeah, we were on the Toy Story.

597
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,180
We were on Slinky Dog when that was happening

598
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,460
or what, right after it happened.

599
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,300
I think so.

600
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,860
We were walking through like just smoke.

601
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,700
Smoke, yeah.

602
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,860
Yeah, yeah.

603
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,660
But the show, I saw the show last time I was there

604
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,420
and it is fun and they do plenty of fun.

605
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,700
Captain Phasma walking down the street is fun.

606
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,740
All that stuff is fun.

607
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,700
So, so yeah, anyway, they, they said no more Snig and Hoopla

608
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,540
and it's a tragedy.

609
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,540
So they did it for a few years

610
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,140
and it starts pretty modestly as Scott was saying.

611
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,900
I think sums up best in 2008 is YMCA with Ewok,

612
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,140
with an Ewok, the Rancor Keeper, Stormtrooper

613
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,780
and maybe another Ewok.

614
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,620
I forgot.

615
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,820
Now this is all fine.

616
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,080
Like, you know, good for you.

617
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,920
Go for it.

618
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,800
I don't quite understand why you would watch that happen

619
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,720
and go like, yes, hell yes.

620
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,560
I like, I.

621
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,440
Well, it is fun to see Chewbacca dance.

622
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,280
Yeah.

623
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,800
I think it's the juxtaposition.

624
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
The early seasons, they were really leaning on that.

625
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,440
Yeah, and YMCA is not, I've never loved YMCA.

626
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,880
I sort of always sort of been an annoying wedding song.

627
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,000
Oh, you better believe my wedding do not playlist was.

628
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,920
Oh yeah, yeah.

629
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,760
That's.

630
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,040
Very detailed.

631
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,680
Never have I been so concerned

632
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,200
about the crafting of a document.

633
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
Yeah, no, I can respect that.

634
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,440
There's a lot.

635
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,360
While I love my family, we will not be,

636
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,160
there will be no we are family.

637
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,000
We are family, yeah.

638
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,820
Yes.

639
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,740
I'll tell them that on my own time.

640
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,040
I used to say no Casper slide at these events,

641
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,080
type of events, but I'm a little bit looser

642
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,360
on the Casper slide these days.

643
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,200
I don't know why.

644
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,880
Wait, is that that to the left?

645
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,120
Yeah, I do.

646
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,880
I got to do that on a boat in New York and I'm blessed.

647
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,720
Yeah, that's not.

648
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,560
Yeah, I'm okay with them.

649
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,920
They used to play that at like school dance.

650
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,480
They'd play YMCA at school dances and I go this, why?

651
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,880
Why are we doing this?

652
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,600
I don't hate, it's just the song I don't like that much.

653
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,080
I don't dislike it, but then I don't,

654
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,920
it's not fun to do, whatever.

655
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,600
Anyway, so yes, I don't know why Chewbacca doing that.

656
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,360
Yeah, well obviously though,

657
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,660
they didn't want even though a single Buffett song

658
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,080
I can go along with is Finns,

659
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,560
where you give which involves a dance.

660
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,400
Yes.

661
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,440
That gives me a lot of joy.

662
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,560
Funny you bring up Buffett

663
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,480
because there's a gag in one of these.

664
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Because there's a running joke

665
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,520
that the Cantina band comes out

666
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,800
and the only song they know is the Cantina song.

667
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,640
Oh yes, yeah.

668
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,240
And there's one where they do start to play Margaritaville

669
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,040
and then switch to the Cantina song.

670
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,040
They do a Johnny Carson style, what's the bit?

671
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,240
Stump the band.

672
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,080
Stump the band and they,

673
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,160
so they'll take suggestions from the audience

674
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,320
and then throw it to Figrin Dan and yeah,

675
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,080
then they just play the ones.

676
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,000
And they play the Johnny Carson theme.

677
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,840
Okay.

678
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,680
When the segment happens too,

679
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,520
which I think is funny.

680
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,360
Nice.

681
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,240
Because I don't know how,

682
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,080
he had been off the air for how many years?

683
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,160
Oh, in the show?

684
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,000
Yes.

685
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
I missed, I didn't even pick up on that.

686
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,840
Yeah, you're right.

687
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,520
Yeah, they play it and it's like.

688
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,120
Well, they still have to make it read

689
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,240
because the Leno Tonight Show had no,

690
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,680
it was just kind of general.

691
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,520
Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan,

692
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,240
like it had no, you could not hum a Leno theme.

693
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,760
Yeah, why is that?

694
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,600
That's weird.

695
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,640
Similar to SNL, SNL, like, okay, sing the SNL song.

696
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,600
Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan,

697
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,440
like what is this?

698
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,480
There was no melody.

699
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

700
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,560
Yeah, whereas like Conan, you can.

701
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,160
There was a Conan song, Fallon has a song.

702
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,680
Letterman I remember, the light show theme I remember.

703
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,520
Thick of the Night has a song.

704
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,360
Uh-huh.

705
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,880
Make a point of saying.

706
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,720
Yeah.

707
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,560
It was a wonderful song.

708
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,760
I remember the Craig Ferguson one

709
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,600
because I always remember he wrote it

710
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,640
so he could get the money every night.

711
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,480
That's really smart.

712
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,320
Which is a smart trick.

713
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,160
So canny.

714
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,520
Gryphon has that trick too, I think.

715
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,920
Isn't it possible, did Johnny Carson have a writing credit

716
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,360
on his theme?

717
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,200
Very possible.

718
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,040
I think he may have.

719
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,680
Yeah, because they would just also add that.

720
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,080
I think Conan co-wrote, or Conan sort of co-wrote

721
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,920
the TBS Conan's, I don't think it's the same one

722
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,800
they use now, but when I was there.

723
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,640
Uh-huh.

724
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,280
Like he, it was a guitar riff of his or something.

725
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,200
Yeah, that makes sense.

726
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,040
The dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

727
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,880
That one, yeah.

728
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,240
Yeah.

729
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,520
But I mean that weird funny business,

730
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,680
like Dolly Parton, Elvis wanted to sing

731
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,520
I Will Always Love You,

732
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,280
but they insisted on putting Elvis's name on the publishing,

733
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,320
so she said no.

734
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,240
Oh.

735
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
So she wanted Elvis to sing that song,

736
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,560
but she was like, I don't want you to,

737
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
you didn't write the song,

738
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,200
you should not get the publishing.

739
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,880
So they said no, and obviously a very good decision

740
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,400
because Whitney Houston would go on

741
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,480
and make billions of dollars with her version,

742
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,960
and she didn't take publishing.

743
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,360
Prince and Kiss, he was like mostly not in the room

744
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,000
when Kiss happened, like the band,

745
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,440
like the bass player was messing around.

746
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,000
And he took it back.

747
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Right, isn't that the story?

748
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,840
I think so, yeah, yeah.

749
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,920
Where like they made a very cool version of Kiss,

750
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,440
and he wasn't that into it, and then he heard it,

751
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,360
and he was like, oh shit,

752
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,960
and then he just stole it back from them.

753
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,800
He like left for an hour, they made it cool,

754
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,200
and like uh-oh, I'd like to be on that again.

755
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,360
Yeah, so yeah, anyway.

756
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,200
Anyway.

757
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,040
Jason, what were you saying?

758
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,840
Oh, I was trying to, were we on a specific year?

759
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,680
2008, 2008.

760
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,720
Okay, 2008.

761
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,760
Very broad, I mean there's Footloose,

762
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,560
performed by Chewie and Ajaahwa.

763
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,200
There's a Girls Just Wanna Have Fun

764
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,560
with Leia Padme and Zam Wessel, the bounty hunter.

765
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,160
That's fun, yeah.

766
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,720
Vader and Stormtroopers do Thriller.

767
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,000
You see, these are a little bit more like general,

768
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,840
like they're not as-

769
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,200
Ages eight to 80 references, you know.

770
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,320
Yeah, so like people are gonna like Vader

771
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,360
and Thriller and stuff, but it's not connected

772
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,320
maybe to the characters, like is it just because they're

773
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,920
scary?

774
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,600
Kind of luchantientually, because yeah,

775
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,560
they're doing the scary dance.

776
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh, YMCA2, they do Yoda, it's Y-O-D-A, I believe, right?

777
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Well, I like that.

778
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,720
And then there, it's also, which is funny,

779
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,240
because it's on the, I think we talked about it before,

780
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,240
there's that Star Wars Connect game, the dancing game,

781
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,360
where it's I'm Han Solo instead of-

782
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,960
Boy, I loved, when I went down that rabbit hole after,

783
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,200
I was very delighted.

784
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,240
And there is also a YMCA parody in that,

785
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,120
which is Empire Today.

786
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,640
It's like, boy, I'd like to be in Empire Today.

787
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,360
Which is-

788
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,000
You can't do hand signals for that.

789
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,960
No, but that was the thing they went with.

790
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,320
So yeah, so this first one is like, I was like, yeah,

791
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,560
okay, I didn't love it.

792
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,840
Would you say that's right?

793
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,520
I think that's right.

794
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,320
2010 was the year that I saw where they started to have

795
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,120
a little more fighting watch 2009.

796
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,200
We can't do every year, let me just,

797
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,000
MC Hammer can't touch this in 2009 with Vader.

798
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And then they introduced Ahsoka Tano and Aura Singh,

799
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,160
who are other characters who do Pisces Girls.

800
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,280
I don't know any of the things you just said.

801
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,600
Well, I always mispronounce her name

802
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,880
because I have not seen the Clone Wars

803
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,400
and don't yell at me because I will watch them

804
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,240
now that we can watch them all.

805
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,560
Ahsoka Tano, who people are saying

806
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,560
Brie Larson is gonna play, but she's like a hero character.

807
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,960
Is this the character, there was a character who came up

808
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,920
when I was watching these with Aaron and she said,

809
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,200
who's the Sphinx?

810
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,800
Yes. Kind of red and white.

811
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,960
Yes, yes. Is this the Sphinx?

812
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,200
She is, I think Obi-Wan's other apprentice, is that right?

813
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,000
Or kind of an apprentice level.

814
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,960
She's a learner to Anakin Skywalker.

815
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,200
Oh, she's Anakin's apprentice.

816
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,240
Yeah, so she has like kind of a Sphinx-y kind of a thing.

817
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,920
So she's a Jedi and yeah, so they danced the song

818
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,320
Pisces Girl, which I had to look up.

819
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,160
What was that?

820
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,280
Hold on, let me find it.

821
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,680
Yeah, I don't know that one.

822
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,360
Let me find this.

823
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,440
There were songs I had to really look up.

824
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,600
It's amazing how much you forget.

825
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,560
It's like that song. I can't find it.

826
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,200
That like, we're gonna light it up.

827
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,720
I guess I know I could not place that

828
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,560
because the Tio Cruz has not been as omnipresent

829
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,280
of a person as that song is, which is everywhere.

830
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,720
When we were on the Talking Simpsons podcast,

831
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,040
which is out or coming out,

832
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,560
we talked about Wright said Fred's I'm Too Sexy.

833
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,880
And I meant to say like, yeah, I'm too sexy.

834
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,920
I don't think that's still a reference used.

835
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,840
I don't think anyone thinks about the phrase

836
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,200
Wright said Fred though.

837
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,680
I think it's kind of removed.

838
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,240
It's taken on a life of its own.

839
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,320
Some songs outlive the band.

840
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,280
Yeah, it's very trivia who the band was.

841
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,640
Yeah, okay, let's just go to 2010.

842
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,040
2010 is when they start to like play.

843
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Okay, Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru

844
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,120
dancing to doing Burning Down the House.

845
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,000
That's dark. That's a pretty solid joke.

846
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,560
So that's sneaking one by.

847
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,240
So like, you can't be mad at that.

848
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,480
This is where the Margaritaville Cantina joke happens.

849
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,160
The Johnny Carson thing.

850
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,880
There's the one I was,

851
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,080
Rancor Keeper does You Know You Want Me.

852
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,640
Like, you know you want me.

853
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,760
And I think that's sort of like,

854
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,680
he's not in the best shape, that's the joke.

855
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,880
Which is not, of course, the best joke.

856
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,600
Or like the Rancor wants him, like wants to eat him.

857
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,520
Maybe. Maybe.

858
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,720
But the Rancor doesn't want,

859
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,400
no, the Rancor doesn't want to eat the Rancor Keeper.

860
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,440
He's his friend.

861
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,400
But he eats him.

862
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,520
No, no, Rancor Keeper, you're thinking of the

863
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,800
of the Gamorrian Guard who gets eaten in Jedi.

864
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,680
Oh, the Keeper, okay, yes.

865
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,800
The Keeper who cries at the,

866
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,040
so in Return of the Jedi, Luke and,

867
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,640
you've seen Return of the Jedi.

868
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,120
The Gamorrian Guard and Luke fall in front of Jabba

869
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,280
in Return of the Jedi.

870
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,440
Yeah, I know it's Gamorrian,

871
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,280
of course I know it's Gamorrian Guard.

872
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,120
The green tusk.

873
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,800
The green guy with the like kind of pig nose.

874
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,640
Yeah, Gamorrian Guard.

875
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,480
Gamorrian Guard.

876
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,800
And the Rancor is that giant monster

877
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,720
and it eats the Gamorrian Guard and Luke kills it.

878
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,960
And then that kind of bigger dude with the headdress

879
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,680
and the open chest cries because his Rancor is dead.

880
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,160
Luke kills the Rancor.

881
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
And that's the Rancor Keeper.

882
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,040
2010, this one is real close.

883
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,000
They were right in front of the stage.

884
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,600
Yeah, so there's a.

885
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,040
And that's the people who filmed these.

886
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,880
Yeah, there's the Sphinx.

887
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,720
Sam Wessel.

888
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,440
That's Material Girl.

889
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,320
There's Aura Singh who is also a bounty hunter.

890
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,800
She has the long hair.

891
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,560
There are.

892
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,400
No.

893
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,220
Tusken Raiders.

894
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,240
Tusken Raiders are dancing support for Material Girl.

895
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,080
Yes, like a.

896
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,900
They're backup dancers.

897
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,920
The back of an SNL sketch.

898
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,080
Who's kind of leading.

899
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,440
That's Queen Amidala.

900
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,280
Queen Amidala.

901
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,080
In front, it could be one of her decoys, honestly.

902
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,360
But the whole number she kind of leads Material Girl.

903
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
Yeah. Yeah.

904
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,000
Mixed with like old like 70s Leia.

905
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,800
Yeah, so see, original Star Wars

906
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,120
white costume Leia is dancing.

907
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,440
And eventually Amidala becomes.

908
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,600
Amidala in the white like.

909
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,440
The Attack of the Clones.

910
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,720
Attack of the Clones action gear.

911
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,180
Not that like big Queen gear.

912
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,480
Right, so yeah, so they're getting,

913
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,440
they're getting, you know, they're getting saucier maybe.

914
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,760
They're getting a little.

915
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,600
Some of these jokes are.

916
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,080
Chewie as Axel and the Ewok as Slash.

917
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,800
Yeah, so that is this year, right?

918
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,320
Yeah, that's this year.

919
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,840
And then they're always using Figurine Dan and the modal.

920
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,160
They're always in the show.

921
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,800
I forget, let's just open this.

922
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,800
There's a whole.

923
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,440
We could have just done a watch along

924
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,520
with one of these, honestly.

925
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Oopla gets most of the good lines.

926
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,120
Sneeg is the theme park archetype

927
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,480
of like a man who is yells in your face.

928
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,440
He just yells.

929
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,120
And they're different performers each year.

930
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,320
Sometimes they're the same people.

931
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,040
They are not always the same.

932
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,880
Yeah.

933
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,600
I will say I did not watch one second of these two.

934
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,000
No offense to anyone who played these people.

935
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,480
I don't think I cared about the banter

936
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,240
between Sneeg and Oopla.

937
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,080
Right.

938
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,520
Well, the banter didn't really get,

939
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,640
it got a lot more fleshed out as time went on.

940
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,080
And the costumes got better too.

941
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,680
This is the Kesha song.

942
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,640
Blah, no, no, no, this is Lady Gaga.

943
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,480
Yeah, yeah.

944
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,840
Tell telephone.

945
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,040
It was a huge hit.

946
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,880
Yeah.

947
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,720
And the FIG and the mode, the Wasse Isley Cantina band

948
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,160
are doing not well choreographed dances to it.

949
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,600
Still fun to see them with their fun heads.

950
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,720
No, wait, I did hear some blah, blah, blah.

951
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,560
Tis not back.

952
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,920
But blah, blah, blah.

953
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,760
That was like a Kesha.

954
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,320
There's a lot of Kesha in all these.

955
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,920
You forget how like everywhere Kesha son,

956
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,760
not just TikTok, but the was the one blow

957
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,280
this place about to blow.

958
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,960
Beat it.

959
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,360
So Darth Vader is dancing to beat it.

960
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,560
Which like, I like that.

961
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,400
I do like that.

962
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,360
I mean, I can't deny.

963
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,280
And they're a little more polished.

964
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,680
Them doing the dance is good.

965
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,880
I don't know how it relates again to the character, but.

966
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,480
He wants the. Oh, he's got the glove.

967
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,560
He wants, you know, Luke to beat it.

968
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,440
He just grabbed his dick to beat it.

969
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,800
This is the last year, 2010, that they're on the smallest stage.

970
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,320
2011, they got upgraded to the big stage.

971
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,160
And it was sure like people knew like this show can't be contained on the small stage

972
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,000
any longer.

973
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,960
Storyline wise, the emperor lends the money to get the bigger stage.

974
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,680
That is established in 2011.

975
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,280
Explain they make it part of the.

976
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,480
I like that too.

977
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,720
And in 2011, that's where you get teach me how to Dougie

978
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,560
Luke's in this one.

979
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,000
And there is a Skywalker incest joke.

980
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,080
A minute. Yes, yes, yes.

981
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,000
So here's the huge stage in front of Grauman's, which has the sorcerer's

982
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,480
hat still in front of it.

983
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,360
Yes, you can see the sorcerer's hat in the video behind the stage.

984
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,000
It's just like in the hand to on the left.

985
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,680
Now we're now on a multi layer stage.

986
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,360
It's double decker like big pod doors.

987
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,040
Snaggen, OOP, was hyperspace.

988
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,600
So Laughinplace.com for posting this one and perhaps some of the others.

989
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,480
And like we got we get like figure it figuring Dan and the modal nodes to teach me how to

990
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,720
do. They're the ones who do teach me how to Dougie.

991
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,080
And then there's some let me get to the here.

992
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,320
Let me get to the section with the emperor.

993
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,960
So the emperor, let's see.

994
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,520
And they sing.

995
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,640
Oh, yeah, we should have mentioned that they do like lyrics to the famous Star Wars.

996
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,640
Lyrics to the famous Star Wars theme disco version.

997
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,040
So that's fun when it's.

998
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,760
And they switch explains what the show is.

999
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,160
Yes. So this one has the emperor and his guards, which are the guys in the red.

1000
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,880
And the emperor gets just gets hamier as these last three years go on.

1001
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,600
The emperor. Yes, the emperor turns into like an old genie or an old, you know, one of the

1002
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,800
characters from the theme park.

1003
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,720
He says we got mad skills.

1004
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,000
Yo, so that's here.

1005
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm actually thank you for saying that, Scott, because I'm about to go to the mad skills.

1006
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,240
Yo part of the emperor when he dances.

1007
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,640
OK, so it's like the mad skill.

1008
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,360
Oh, it just happened.

1009
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,800
So this one is maybe my least favorite emperor performance.

1010
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,160
This is just back in black.

1011
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,080
And he's like.

1012
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,320
Just sort of like using his cane as a microphone.

1013
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:15,040
Yeah, some years the songs had themes like one once one year, the theme was all the songs are in

1014
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,040
three D to honor the release of Phantom Menace 3D.

1015
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,240
It's just very aggro in your face songs.

1016
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,920
One year it was 80 stuff.

1017
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,240
This seems like if they just put me in an emperor costume by the old Greedo has come out

1018
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,680
with Django and Boba Fett.

1019
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,440
This is like if they put a robe on me and we're like here, go dance to back in black

1020
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,320
with your cane.

1021
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,880
It doesn't look very rehearsed.

1022
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,080
So and then Darth Maul makes an appearance, which is very exciting.

1023
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,040
People going nuts.

1024
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,640
He gets a pyro.

1025
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,320
She gets huge pyro.

1026
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,000
Darth Maul.

1027
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,160
And then he comes out and he is like good at lightsabering and.

1028
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,480
People are losing their minds and then.

1029
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,760
You got to go to the go to the clip here of 2011 and watch him like barely do any dancing

1030
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,280
and then get his lightsaber back.

1031
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,080
He's good at twirling the lightsaber.

1032
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,680
He's good at twirling the lightsaber.

1033
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,480
So 2011 we get Ewoks wearing slash his top hat.

1034
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,440
We get playing drums on stormtroopers heads, which is fun because the Ewoks do that at

1035
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,640
the end of Return of the Jedi.

1036
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,120
Yeah, which is a nice little callback.

1037
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,440
We get like Joan Jett stuff.

1038
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,640
There's an Avril Lavigne.

1039
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,480
I never heard called Goodbye Lullaby.

1040
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,040
Wow, I was she there was.

1041
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,160
I mean, this was a single, but her song What the Hell was the factors in and like these

1042
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,960
Latter Day Avril songs didn't really register with me, but I guess at the time they're

1043
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,480
like, all right, what's on the charts?

1044
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,320
Yeah, I guess I would be interested to know if there's any interviews with people who

1045
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,120
put these shows together, what their process was.

1046
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,840
I just say it's crazy that this is gone.

1047
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:58,240
It's crazy that this is gone now because I think we're at the point where it has been

1048
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,600
like over 40 years since A New Hope.

1049
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:07,280
So this is the time where people would be it starts to make sense to like, OK, we've

1050
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,160
had decades.

1051
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,560
We can do a decent critical analysis.

1052
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:18,640
We have the historical context like we can start to it's yeah, let's let's have a little

1053
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,040
fun with it.

1054
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,120
Let's make fun of it like Disney lighten up like I think that's what I like about the

1055
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,160
Mandalorian.

1056
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,560
It's like there's sillier costumes.

1057
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,560
I have ideas at the end, but I have some ideas of the show comes back.

1058
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,200
Oh, I have so many ideas for 2019.

1059
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,480
So so yeah, we'll go here.

1060
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,600
But like some other highlights real quick because yeah, I think we all agree that like

1061
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,280
let's this is so this is 2012.

1062
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,520
Vader dancing to Pitbull International Love.

1063
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,360
And also this is Alien Ant Farm part of it.

1064
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,800
There's like a medley of songs.

1065
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,320
Oh yeah, Alien Ant Farm smooth criminal is dance to it.

1066
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,200
One of these, which is such a funny choice.

1067
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:08,480
Now I will say I like this Chewie comes out to LMFAO.

1068
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,600
They're all dressed as LMFAO and the robot from LMFAO.

1069
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,000
C3PO has the metal the square robot head from the music video at one.

1070
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,040
And I will say I unironically like this.

1071
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,840
What year is this?

1072
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,120
This is 2012.

1073
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,600
Okay, 2012 is when it starts to heat up.

1074
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,280
2012.

1075
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,920
So Vigor and Dan and the modal nodes have like cool stretch pants on now.

1076
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,760
Not costume appropriate stretch pants at a certain point.

1077
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,600
So yeah, C3PO has yes, you just said that.

1078
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,880
R2D2 has a wig on his head over in the corner.

1079
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,000
I like that.

1080
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,240
Scott's coming around now.

1081
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,720
Lay it out.

1082
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,360
Lay it out.

1083
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,000
A wig.

1084
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,880
Slave Lay is out.

1085
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,840
Slave outfits.

1086
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,280
Padme in the cool white outfit with the Padme.

1087
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,720
And she's shaking her butt.

1088
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,960
This is getting going here, this show at this point.

1089
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,680
And Chewie's hair is so big.

1090
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,480
And it does have, it's certainly in the audience, it has the feeling of

1091
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,440
all the people in the audience know the performers.

1092
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,720
There does feel an extra level of energy probably because-

1093
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,640
It's why it's so high school for that reason.

1094
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,440
Yes, for sure.

1095
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,200
That's why I have the toughest time with this.

1096
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,160
I'm flashing to, because I was the one who didn't know anyone in the high school rallies

1097
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,080
because I wasn't friends with anyone who did sports.

1098
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,440
I 2012-

1099
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Well, when it comes back and one of us are in the show and you can go and see us do it,

1100
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
then you will have that energy surge.

1101
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,880
Like, I know, I know Jason.

1102
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,040
They really start to-

1103
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,160
Jason's playing Vigor and Dan.

1104
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,280
We've in the movie lines in this one as like gags or punch lines.

1105
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,960
But I think what I like about this compared to like Bill and Ted,

1106
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,480
where it's like the butt of the joke is-

1107
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,240
Gay people.

1108
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,960
Gay people, women, minorities, the disabled.

1109
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,360
The butt of the joke in this is Star Wars.

1110
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,200
Like it kind of acknowledges, there's using the lines as jokes.

1111
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,720
Like it's kind of silly.

1112
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,160
It's kind of ridiculous.

1113
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,360
We can laugh at it.

1114
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,640
Yeah, there's no victim.

1115
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,760
People having a good time, audience having a good time at the end of a day.

1116
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,240
And I give George credit too for like signing off on it.

1117
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,920
This kicks ass that Vader dances to a song with the lyrics, Annie, are you okay?

1118
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,080
And he is Anakin Skywalker.

1119
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,320
Oh, see, you can't be mad at that.

1120
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Annie, are you okay?

1121
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,820
Fine.

1122
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,120
And that it's the alien ant farm.

1123
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,840
One of the funniest reference to make in 2012.

1124
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,640
It should have been.

1125
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,200
You're right, Scott.

1126
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,600
The punch up on it is Watto should have been singing.

1127
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,040
Annie, are you okay?

1128
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,160
Now this one also, there are sketches in 2012 that happened.

1129
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,920
Pre-filmed.

1130
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,640
Pre-filmed Emperor sketches.

1131
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,280
We don't need to recap any of the jokes or what happens.

1132
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,240
Just know that like.

1133
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:00,740
Yeah.

1134
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,680
He's just punching like kind of a punching bag or whatever you call that toy.

1135
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,960
The inflatable toy of Vader.

1136
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,560
That's the Emperor.

1137
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,960
So this year, yes, this is the year when you really make a case for it

1138
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,120
being a mainstay in the Disney perks forever.

1139
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,120
Yes. And they start a running joke.

1140
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,440
It only goes for two years, but it's essentially the Paul Rudd, Mac and Me joke.

1141
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,120
Where the show ends with the clip of Vader.

1142
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,120
Vader walks the Emperor off stage and then it plays the clip of him

1143
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,640
tossing him down the Death Star hole.

1144
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,760
Which is fun.

1145
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,820
Fun.

1146
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,320
Fun.

1147
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,420
So then this is the year we're mentioning.

1148
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,860
So Vader and Padme are dancing.

1149
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:48,020
Which is strange because Padme never met Vader.

1150
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,180
Well, right, Anakin is.

1151
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,680
Yes.

1152
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:51,940
So it is the guy.

1153
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,340
That's who's in there, but she's never seen this suit before.

1154
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,660
She died before there was a suit to see.

1155
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,980
Yes, but I guess it would probably be worse if it was like no legs Anakin dancing.

1156
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1157
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,860
But this exists in a multiverse where all Star Wars possibilities are on the table.

1158
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,660
Everything's on the table.

1159
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,780
Yeah, this is including the possibility of one of Snake's lines this year.

1160
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,620
He says, give it up for Star Wars.

1161
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,940
Who's what?

1162
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,820
Snake yells, give it up for Star Wars.

1163
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,660
Oh, I wrote that down too.

1164
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Well, because apparently that seems to happen.

1165
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,420
I wrote down a sequence of events every day.

1166
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,700
I'm shuffling.

1167
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,540
Boom explosion.

1168
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,380
Give it up for Star Wars.

1169
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,580
People freaking out after every day I'm shuffling.

1170
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,580
That could only happen in 2012.

1171
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:47,140
Well, and Figran, Dan and the modal nodes dance to a medley of songs,

1172
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:52,820
including a song that I know only as Oh, sometimes I get a feeling.

1173
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,900
I don't know the name of that.

1174
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,700
Oh, sometimes I get a feeling.

1175
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,700
I get a feeling.

1176
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,980
I have no idea the name of the song.

1177
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,260
I have no idea who sings it.

1178
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:04,980
I can't find it.

1179
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,780
I don't know what this is.

1180
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,460
I'm sure you've heard it.

1181
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,260
Is that a Vici song?

1182
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,640
Maybe.

1183
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,460
Yeah, I also didn't know who did that, but I know the song very well.

1184
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,300
Boba Fett dances to moves like Jagger.

1185
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:18,980
Is that 2012?

1186
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:19,540
2012.

1187
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,260
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1188
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,300
Kip Fisto dances to Party Rock.

1189
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,180
Yeah, and Soka.

1190
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,220
Yeah, they do Party Rock.

1191
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,540
Yeah, so we could have had it all was the Vader Padme.

1192
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,900
And then they also-

1193
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,180
Rollin' in the deep.

1194
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,460
Yeah, they always have a song that's about their push and pull,

1195
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,020
like about the torment of the relationship.

1196
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,700
A lot of sexual energy there.

1197
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,460
Yes, and then 2012 is where the Emperor does-

1198
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,340
Do you know 2012's Emperor performance?

1199
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:51,640
Nope.

1200
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,260
All right, I'll show it to Scott if he hasn't seen it before.

1201
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,900
It's a real sort of fake out.

1202
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:02,420
So they start out with the Justice intro to D-A-N-C-E.

1203
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,420
This is the 3D year.

1204
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,020
All these songs are very in your face.

1205
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:11,940
So Emperor comes out, he drops his cane, he throws the hood off,

1206
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:17,620
he's got like a bucket hat, and then does Mama Said Knock You Out.

1207
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,220
Is this one of the ones that I'm supposed to-

1208
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,340
No, no, I don't like this.

1209
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,100
I think this one's funny because it's bad.

1210
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,500
So there's a difference on my spectrum level of what I like and why I like it.

1211
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,780
So this one I think is bad.

1212
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,160
But it is-

1213
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,180
It's better than the ACDC one.

1214
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,340
So they're getting there with the Emperor's thing.

1215
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,020
Because you know, they're workshopping this every year.

1216
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,620
The end of this year, when they're saying good nights,

1217
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,780
they're playing Tonight We Are Young.

1218
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,940
Oh, sometimes I get a feeling comes back.

1219
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,620
We are young.

1220
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:54,580
One of the years ends with that whatever the fuck song that-

1221
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,980
I belong with you, you belong with me.

1222
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,260
Oh yeah, The Lumineers.

1223
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:58,900
That's what that is.

1224
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,180
That's The Lumineers.

1225
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,660
Hey, ho, hey, ho.

1226
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:10,020
But people just put up their lighters for cell phones and just sway earnestly.

1227
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,420
And the Star Wars content is kind of done.

1228
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,580
People are just earnestly digging that song.

1229
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,180
Which I can't understand why you would sit there.

1230
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:24,740
Darth Vader is gone and I'm just going to sway my phone to I belonged with you.

1231
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,340
Everyone had an experience together and they're all just sort of celebrating.

1232
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,180
They needed to come down together.

1233
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,340
This is the finale, after everyone bows at the end of 2012.

1234
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,940
This is the one where Darth Maul comes out and dances a little.

1235
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:43,220
And then there's some explosions and people are psyched.

1236
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,020
People love it.

1237
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,580
People love it.

1238
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,780
Okay, so that's 2013.

1239
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:52,500
The final year of this and again, they're hitting their stride hard here.

1240
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,460
Let's see, Jason, you have highlights as well?

1241
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:55,960
Yeah.

1242
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:03,780
So 2012 established to not just the Vader throwing down, but 2012 hit the joke about

1243
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,700
this show must be over by 8 p.m.

1244
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,220
That's when the park closes.

1245
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:11,540
2013 starts off with its own crawl.

1246
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,580
An exclusive crawl.

1247
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,100
Exclusive crawl.

1248
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,620
Exclusive to this show.

1249
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:18,900
Do you have it?

1250
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,340
No, I don't have it written down.

1251
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,380
I have it transcribed.

1252
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:27,140
Last year, the evil Emperor Palpatine once again crushed the party and tried to destroy

1253
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,620
Snegan Upla's hyperspace hoopla.

1254
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:35,940
After quote, bring in the pain, yo, it looked as if it was the end of the hoopla.

1255
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,740
With some quick thinking, Upla showed Darth Vader an incriminating video of the emperor

1256
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,740
and a Vader punching bag.

1257
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,180
Embarrassed, the emperor admitted defeat and made his exit.

1258
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:51,140
As the emperor was about to vow his return, Vader grabbed the emperor and tossed him down

1259
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,220
a ridiculously long chasm.

1260
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,060
With the emperor gone, peace was once again restored to the galaxy.

1261
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,860
So full Star Wars, yellow text, Starfield crawl.

1262
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,420
Yeah, fine.

1263
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,500
Saying that very long.

1264
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,580
Important because if you didn't know the story.

1265
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:06,980
Yes.

1266
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,540
Why would they?

1267
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,340
Why would they?

1268
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:13,060
Yeah, you wouldn't know what's happening or why Chewie was shaking his butt.

1269
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,700
So they, oh, there's a, I wrote on one of this.

1270
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,300
So the emperor has a bigger presence.

1271
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,820
Is this the year where the emperor takes over?

1272
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,780
Yes, this is where it's Palpatine's hoopla.

1273
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:29,620
And he says if I had a dollar for every time Vader threw me down a ridiculously long chasm.

1274
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,020
I'd have money for a third Death Star, he says.

1275
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,260
And then he says, blinged out.

1276
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:42,100
This is, I'm like, I feel like an alternate title for the film that's coming out this

1277
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,980
week or next, I forget when we're putting this up, but the, you could call it episode

1278
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,380
nine, uh, Palpatine's hoopla.

1279
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,380
Oh, that's good.

1280
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,060
He may have a hoopla in the new movie.

1281
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:53,860
We don't know.

1282
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:59,060
They revealed that title at Comic-Con and everybody like, there's just a, like a, like

1283
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,740
5,000 people all together go, huh?

1284
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,900
Return, Star Wars returned to the fair.

1285
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,060
Two people would know it.

1286
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,780
It's like, and now it's playing a snaggin' hoopla.

1287
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,500
Uh, who are the two most famous actors that are in Star Wars?

1288
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:22,340
The listeners to this might know that, we may already know if hoopla returns for the

1289
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,340
final battle of the franchise.

1290
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,460
Oh yeah, that's a good point.

1291
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:30,580
I am hoping rise of Skywalker is like the end of the, the Fellini movie eight and a

1292
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:34,820
half, where just all of the characters from the guys life comes back and they all just

1293
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,820
kind of walk in a conga line.

1294
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,460
I guess essentially that's what the ending of end game is.

1295
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,820
So like, why not make it the end of the end of a life aquatic?

1296
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,500
Like they all just take a big walk.

1297
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,540
Yeah.

1298
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,340
Ocean's 11.

1299
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:47,940
Yeah.

1300
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,540
This bow.

1301
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,660
Everybody takes a walk.

1302
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:56,740
So yeah, we got, uh, Vader and Greedo fight for your right to party.

1303
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:01,700
Uh, stormtroopers play an off key version of the Cantina song and everyone booze.

1304
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,380
And then the real Cantina band comes out and shows them how it's done.

1305
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,180
Yes.

1306
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,740
Uh, then there's, this is another chewy, oh man, we're going to get an ad.

1307
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,140
Uh, there's a chewy dance off again.

1308
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,300
It's they knew what worked last time.

1309
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:20,420
They went with, uh, uh, another like high energy chewy, uh, dancing.

1310
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,780
But it's a different song.

1311
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,780
We of course, we're looking at an ad for Richard.

1312
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,740
It's an ad for Richard Jule.

1313
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,140
Yeah.

1314
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,380
I'm looking forward to the, to Julepla.

1315
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,540
So here goes.

1316
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,500
Richard Julepla.

1317
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:35,220
So chewy dancing to hey, uh, Jason, is this one of your favorite moments from all of this?

1318
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,580
I think this is pretty great.

1319
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,780
Jason, if you just got missed it.

1320
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,740
This song is 10 years old at this point.

1321
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,820
Jason had his hands in the air.

1322
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,620
You missed it, Scott.

1323
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,500
He was celebrating.

1324
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,980
He's got a crown on and sunglasses.

1325
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,540
It's fun.

1326
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,460
Can you recreate that for a video?

1327
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,180
Oh yeah.

1328
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:52,980
Great.

1329
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:57,380
Whoever it seems like it might be the same chewy from 2012 and 2013.

1330
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:57,940
Maybe it was same.

1331
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,780
And then look at the Scott, the Ewok is playing a guitar with a beret.

1332
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,340
You can't be mad at that.

1333
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,140
And there's the drum.

1334
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,820
There's a stormtrooper helmet drums.

1335
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,300
You can't be mad at us at an Ewok.

1336
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,340
He's he's all over to the right there and they've cut him out of frame.

1337
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,100
I can't be mad.

1338
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,540
I'm not mad.

1339
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,900
I wouldn't say I'm mad.

1340
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,400
No.

1341
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,140
Uh, there he is.

1342
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,260
He's got a guitar.

1343
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,780
He's playing guitar with a beret on.

1344
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,700
Oh, here's some beautiful ladies.

1345
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,220
The Sphinx.

1346
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,740
Uh, Leia and her mother.

1347
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,340
In their most sexy modes.

1348
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:30,580
Yes.

1349
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:34,660
When you get together and your sexiest outfit as does your mother.

1350
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,180
Now that is a Fellini move.

1351
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,580
You and your mother are the same age and you're both very attractive.

1352
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,380
Yeah.

1353
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,500
And then there's here, you see him?

1354
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,500
He's got the beret playing guitar with sunglasses.

1355
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,140
He's like that.

1356
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:45,460
Yeah.

1357
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,020
Yeah, that's great.

1358
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,100
And the Figuring Dan and the modal nodes are all in little hats and they're like up,

1359
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,940
up on the stairs there.

1360
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,820
Like this, this thing is.

1361
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,940
They're blowing it out.

1362
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,700
This show is, you know, this is at its peak right here.

1363
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,260
OOPLA.

1364
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,860
And then this year, right around here, OOPLA says you can't be Sidious.

1365
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,300
Right?

1366
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:03,540
Yes.

1367
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,340
Like Darth Sidious.

1368
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,140
I don't like that.

1369
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,180
I don't like as much.

1370
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,060
I don't know.

1371
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,020
I don't dislike it.

1372
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,460
I just don't like it as much as so let me ask, let me guess Jason, what your second,

1373
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:16,420
I'm going to play what I think your second favorite moment is from 2013.

1374
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:17,380
Yeah.

1375
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:18,900
Let me just.

1376
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,140
It's kind of tied.

1377
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:21,700
Okay.

1378
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,100
It's the smaller number.

1379
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,660
Is it involves C3PO?

1380
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,700
I forget what the 3PO one is.

1381
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,740
C3PO does the Harlem Shake.

1382
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,260
Well, that is very good.

1383
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:34,500
Yeah.

1384
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,300
If you have that.

1385
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,940
Well, if that's not your moment.

1386
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,300
I mean, no, see 3PO doing the Harlem Shake, actually the audience,

1387
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,260
that is a good example of the audience going crazy.

1388
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:48,420
And that is staged pretty well because he comes out and you think he's kind of stiff,

1389
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,940
but then he starts to move.

1390
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,820
We don't have to go see.

1391
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,660
They built in a little more.

1392
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:56,820
No, my favorite is I think the Jawas and the Tuscan Raiders number.

1393
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,140
Here comes 3PO.

1394
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,140
This is something different.

1395
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:01,700
I think.

1396
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,740
Yeah, this is not the Harlem Shake.

1397
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,300
This is not.

1398
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,660
I screwed up.

1399
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,460
What were you saying, Jason?

1400
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,100
Sorry.

1401
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,660
Oh, the Jawas and the Tuscan Raiders number.

1402
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,700
I think is probably the best.

1403
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,660
And what's that song again?

1404
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:11,940
It's Thrift Shop.

1405
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,820
It's the scavengers are dancing to Thrift Shop.

1406
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,060
I'm so glad it's not 2013 anymore.

1407
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:22,740
No, it is good.

1408
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,540
Jason's right.

1409
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,220
What is what's is it?

1410
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:25,780
Lobot?

1411
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,340
What's his name?

1412
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,860
Lobot from the club city.

1413
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:28,100
Yeah.

1414
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,940
Unrolls like a DJ booth.

1415
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,420
The only way I'd approve is if it was Greedo leading it and they call when he came out,

1416
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,940
they called him McClunklemore.

1417
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:40,020
We could write the show in an hour.

1418
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,660
The new show.

1419
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,460
I know.

1420
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,340
3PO coming.

1421
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,060
Give us this one.

1422
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,340
Give us Bill and Ted.

1423
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,180
This is what we're dying to do.

1424
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:46,680
Yeah.

1425
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,780
This is one of the lesser parts of it.

1426
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,220
I forget this is like a Pink song.

1427
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,060
The biggest thing I had was going back and going, what is this song?

1428
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:02,260
Is Pink's song or is this even the same song with that set like so raise your glass.

1429
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,060
And then I don't remember what a different sign.

1430
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:08,180
Pink has a blockbuster hit every year.

1431
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:08,340
Yeah.

1432
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:13,380
Pink is for 17 years with like no scandals.

1433
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,500
She's got a family.

1434
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,860
It's no scandals.

1435
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,460
No, there is a profile.

1436
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,660
Well, you're like a low key way.

1437
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:20,980
Yes.

1438
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,480
Yeah.

1439
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,460
So Bounty Hunter's dancing.

1440
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,540
Yeah, this is the bounty hunter number song.

1441
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,540
This was a big song.

1442
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:31,380
I think so.

1443
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,860
And they're doing this sort of swim.

1444
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,100
Yeah.

1445
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,060
Go to the can you find the Harlem Shake?

1446
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,100
You remember what part of the show it is in?

1447
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:43,780
Good time.

1448
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,740
This is now in 2013.

1449
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,660
You have to remember this isn't what every TV show was always.

1450
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:55,300
It is a good point because this is someone I know and a song I know.

1451
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:55,540
Look.

1452
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:56,420
Yes.

1453
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,100
Yeah, I can't find the just from looking at this.

1454
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,700
Yeah, this is everyone does Gangnam Style.

1455
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,820
This kicks ass.

1456
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,020
This is probably the best part.

1457
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,140
Kid Fisto.

1458
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,140
There are so many characters on stage.

1459
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,260
There's two dozen people on stage doing the horsey dance.

1460
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,540
The horsey dance.

1461
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:17,140
Well, you also within this have Leia dancing to Gangnam Style,

1462
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:22,020
which is exactly what happens in Nick Weiger's Funny or Die classic Gungan Style.

1463
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,580
Gungan Style.

1464
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:28,340
His deconstructionist, his adaptation of Funny or Die, of the internet videos.

1465
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,580
Featuring also an amazing performance by Ryan Perez.

1466
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,980
It's a very excellent acting performance.

1467
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:35,300
Yes.

1468
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,980
Please, if you haven't seen Gungan Style.

1469
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,220
The sexy lady.

1470
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:41,940
The sexy Leia.

1471
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,980
The sexy Leia.

1472
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,180
Weiger changed it too.

1473
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:44,660
Yeah.

1474
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:50,260
What we're watching basically is what Weiger does in the first act of Gungan Style before

1475
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,140
it takes the turn.

1476
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:51,380
100%.

1477
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,780
He was making earnest type or space.

1478
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,100
Once again, let's hear it for Star Wars.

1479
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,700
Let's hear it for Star Wars.

1480
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:02,820
They know, all these characters know that what they're doing is Star Wars.

1481
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,300
Yes.

1482
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,820
In this reality, it was just a whole bunch of Star Wars.

1483
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,540
Yeah.

1484
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,900
It turns out the true Star Wars were the friends we made along the way.

1485
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,780
Are we ready for the last thing or do you have one other one,

1486
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,500
Highlight, you want to bring up?

1487
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,300
I'm ready.

1488
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,420
I know Scott's ready.

1489
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:16,980
Oh, no.

1490
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,700
I think the, see, try and find the thrift shops not too far back.

1491
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,660
It's going to be hard because I can't.

1492
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,740
Let me, I'll pull it up on my iPad.

1493
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,180
Jason is going to be like scouring thrift shops for cool clothes.

1494
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,100
Jason is insisting on thrift shop.

1495
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,060
I wrote just on, I love Kit Fisto doing Gangnam Style.

1496
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,460
Darth Malta is too legit.

1497
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,660
She was sure putting on a shirt.

1498
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,300
Darth Malta is too legit to quit, which is good.

1499
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,180
But of course the Emperor Vader throws him down the hole again.

1500
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:52,660
And I'm assuming that would have been like a running joke for years if this had kept

1501
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,620
going for years.

1502
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,940
I'll tease the end moment right now.

1503
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,740
This song is something I had to look up.

1504
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,620
Feel this moment Pitbull featuring Christina Aguilera.

1505
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:02,660
Yeah, what?

1506
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,540
I don't know.

1507
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,820
Which is a huge hit.

1508
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:05,380
A huge hit.

1509
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,180
I believe a huge hit.

1510
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,060
I've heard it, but I didn't.

1511
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:07,860
I had to look it up.

1512
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,060
I had to like Google a couple lyrics that I was hearing.

1513
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,740
I think Jason, it's okay.

1514
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,900
We're going to post that clip later and I just want to show Scott so we can get to our future.

1515
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:22,020
Thrift shop from the Tuscan Raiders and Jawas and 3PO doing Harlem Shake.

1516
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,620
It's a simpler time.

1517
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,580
The show ends.

1518
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,740
The show ends.

1519
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,980
And then there's a little bit of a surprise here.

1520
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,420
Oh my god.

1521
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,580
It's Mickey Mouse dressed as a Jedi.

1522
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,100
Blinking Mickey.

1523
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,140
So.

1524
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:40,260
Wait, why?

1525
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,980
Hold on.

1526
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,300
Hold on.

1527
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,460
And now he's dancing.

1528
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,260
Right.

1529
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,540
The audience loses their mind.

1530
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,060
This is not the video.

1531
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,780
A different video.

1532
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,940
A guy goes, oh my god.

1533
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,020
Why would you say oh my god?

1534
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,020
Because this has never happened.

1535
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,300
Or in Disneyland.

1536
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,820
If this happened on the street.

1537
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,220
If we were walking around Galaxy's Edge in Batuu and we saw Mickey roaming around in a Jedi

1538
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,700
costume, I think we'd all go, hey, sure.

1539
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,660
I think we'd all be very excited.

1540
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,220
This is like Carson gave the nod.

1541
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:15,460
Mickey wasn't in any of the other years, but he's like the big reveal.

1542
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:18,100
This is like the after the credits Nick Fury scene.

1543
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,060
People are worked up in a lather at this point from the show.

1544
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:26,260
If they're going to get even a little bit more of a piece of fun, which is Mickey,

1545
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,100
they're going to lose their minds.

1546
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,740
So that's why that guy yelled, oh my god.

1547
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,660
He was so jacked.

1548
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,740
And then Mickey danced.

1549
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,420
And then Mickey danced and then that's it.

1550
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,460
That was the end of 2013.

1551
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,700
And the end of the hyperspace hoopla.

1552
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,500
Rest in peace.

1553
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,660
Hyperspace hoopla for now at least.

1554
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:48,660
But I think we all independently, we did not agree to do this.

1555
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,180
No, we knew this.

1556
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:51,460
I'm glad nobody was left out.

1557
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,500
I cannot wait.

1558
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,620
Yeah, we did not.

1559
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,900
We did not say, hey, we better have some pitches for future hyperspace hoopla.

1560
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,540
But obviously.

1561
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,340
Yeah.

1562
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:03,220
So I just wrote it in my notes as 2019 hyperspace hoopla.

1563
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,980
I think most of mine would work with that.

1564
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,620
I was a little more evergreen with my piece.

1565
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,500
Okay, sure.

1566
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,620
Yeah, well, you know, everybody throw them in as you see fit.

1567
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:17,060
I mean, this isn't like, not to start just with like one we can just agree on.

1568
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:22,820
And it's not the most clever thing, but the Billie Eilish, the bad guy, you know, Captain

1569
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,060
Phasma that works with a lot of people.

1570
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,500
That's an easy one to plug villainess into.

1571
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,000
Sure.

1572
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,300
I'm going to start big here.

1573
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,580
Somebody's playing Princess Leia, General Leia.

1574
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:41,700
And obviously two stagehands come out, hook wires to her.

1575
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,340
She flies across the stage as a medley of Fiverr Fighting Superman

1576
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,260
and three doors down Kryptonite plays.

1577
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:51,460
And she supermans around the stage like she does in Last Jedi.

1578
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,460
I mean, that's going to bring down the house.

1579
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,100
That's great.

1580
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:54,600
Sure.

1581
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:59,060
I went more 2019, like top 40.

1582
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:06,180
Rey comes out with Finn and Poe and she's like pushing each one away to thank you next.

1583
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,500
It's the Ariana Grande song.

1584
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,140
Thank you.

1585
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:15,220
Well, I also have a thank you next, but it's with Kathleen Kennedy and all the directors.

1586
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,260
Oh, that's good.

1587
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:17,780
That's good.

1588
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:24,820
I want to go a little more off the beaten track for the indie rock crowd.

1589
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:30,100
Rose Tico and her late sister come out and dance to a Hame song.

1590
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,900
Maybe I want you back.

1591
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,460
Sure.

1592
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:33,700
Yeah.

1593
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,300
That's really morbid.

1594
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:37,620
This one is dead.

1595
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,580
Jesus.

1596
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:39,780
Oh, I didn't even think I was.

1597
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:40,280
She was a bar.

1598
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:42,580
What's the one?

1599
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:43,620
That's going to be sad.

1600
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,300
I guess.

1601
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:47,780
Some of them are bittersweet.

1602
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,940
The we are young at the end.

1603
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,940
Anakin essentially kills Padme and they dance to like womanizer.

1604
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,300
She dies of a broken heart.

1605
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,500
Yeah. And who caused that?

1606
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:57,940
That's true.

1607
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,460
But also maybe she just had a weak heart.

1608
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,140
You don't know.

1609
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,420
She might have had a condition before.

1610
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,620
They just are also by the way, the doctor at the end of the prequels are just like,

1611
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:10,420
yeah, she died of a broken heart or he's like, she just didn't want to live anymore.

1612
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,540
And they're like, oh, okay.

1613
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:14,500
Like if that happened now, wouldn't you be like, wait a minute.

1614
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,900
That's what happened to R2D2 in Force Awakens.

1615
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,620
That is what happened.

1616
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,660
He's too sad to do funny things in this movie.

1617
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,860
Let me bring it to some some park stuff, some Galaxy's Edge stuff.

1618
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,500
Oh yeah.

1619
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,460
Hondo? Any Hondo?

1620
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:27,860
I don't.

1621
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:32,100
You know, I don't have a Hondo idea, but actually I don't even know what character to put this with.

1622
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:37,780
But you got to do a Lizzo and they blame it on Moof Juice.

1623
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:41,700
I think that we have to get the Podraisers involved.

1624
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,780
We have to get Team Topagaly's involved.

1625
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:47,140
Juan Sandage, Subulba, Little Anakin.

1626
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:52,500
We got to have a child break dancer and they can do a little bit of a medley of like cake,

1627
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,380
the distance, Highway to the Danger Zone.

1628
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:00,900
Let's like, let's, you know, we can really any road song, Highway 61 by Bob Dylan.

1629
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,300
You got to go for the kit.

1630
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,220
So let's update the Run DMC reference.

1631
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:10,260
Let's have Finn and Poe do Run the Jewels.

1632
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,220
Okay.

1633
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1634
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,060
Absolutely.

1635
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:21,220
I don't know what song it is, but you get, you know, you, oh, this is a, this could just be with

1636
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,740
with actual ships.

1637
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:26,580
It's actual ships and they come out like, but you'd have to build costumes of the ships and

1638
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:33,220
they're or the planes and they're wearing, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

1639
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:38,180
you know, like wig, like curly wigs and tassel jackets.

1640
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,780
And then you come out and you call them Rebel Van Fleet.

1641
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:43,460
Nice.

1642
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:44,740
Hell yeah.

1643
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:45,300
I like that.

1644
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:46,900
That's good.

1645
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:50,420
Ray and Kylo, Fix You by Coldplay.

1646
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:51,940
Ray wants to fix.

1647
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:57,060
That's their, that's their like song of, you know what, was it, was this, did these years not line

1648
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:00,020
up? How did they not do somebody I used to know?

1649
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:01,780
That's like a guy.

1650
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:02,820
That is shocking.

1651
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,940
I didn't see it, but maybe we missed that, but I didn't see it.

1652
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,540
My one for that slot.

1653
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,700
That's also the Weiger of Batman.

1654
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,100
I used to know.

1655
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,300
A bad, the other one Batman.

1656
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:11,860
I used to know.

1657
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,500
Yeah.

1658
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,860
Vader and Padme do Shape of You by Ed Sheeran.

1659
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,220
Sure.

1660
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:25,060
Oh, you know, isn't there the current like, wait, is that what's the Kamiya?

1661
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,140
The Kamiya Kabeo song.

1662
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,420
Yeah, I forget.

1663
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,620
There's a duet right now.

1664
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,100
Yes.

1665
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,140
That'd be the one I'm saying.

1666
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,620
Like her boyfriend, not boyfriend.

1667
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,120
Yeah.

1668
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:34,740
Yeah.

1669
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:35,860
I just learned.

1670
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,820
Han and Kylo, First Cut is the deepest.

1671
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:41,220
That's good.

1672
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,220
That's a good reference.

1673
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,420
You're sticking with early 2000s with the.

1674
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,500
Yeah, it's the cover of First Cut is the deepest.

1675
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:48,900
Yes.

1676
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:49,380
Yeah.

1677
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:54,260
What about our most important 2019 musical dance sensation,

1678
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:58,740
General Leia and Admiral Hodo do the Mayor Pete dance.

1679
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:05,940
I think she was about fucking civility and thinking things through and all that.

1680
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:06,340
Sure, yeah.

1681
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,980
Bob Iger and George Lucas, Sorry by Justin Bieber.

1682
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:16,900
George Lucas, of course, famously upset that Bob Iger threw his outlines out that they,

1683
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,340
he felt betrayed by Bob Iger and Disney after he sold to them.

1684
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,860
So Justin Bieber's, is it too late now to say sorry?

1685
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:29,540
Ivan Iger, Iger and Kathleen Kennedy do Big Banks Hate Lil Banks.

1686
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,220
What is that song?

1687
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,740
Big Banks Hate Lil Banks.

1688
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,580
Big Banks Hate Lil Banks.

1689
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,980
This is a radio sensation.

1690
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:37,460
Really?

1691
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:37,620
Yeah.

1692
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,220
Jason knows the cool stuff.

1693
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:39,620
So young.

1694
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,500
Jason's so young.

1695
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:42,900
This one's omnipresent.

1696
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:50,580
Let me dovetail it into, if you had three younger versions of Hondo Anaka,

1697
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:55,620
like the Onakas brothers and they do Smuggler instead of Sucker.

1698
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:56,340
That's good.

1699
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:56,740
That's good.

1700
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,460
I like that.

1701
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,180
Yep.

1702
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,700
Dexter Jettster, Arlo Guthrie's Alice's Restaurant.

1703
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:06,500
So that's a 19 minute.

1704
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:11,540
19 minute Dexter Jettster, Arlo Guthrie's Alice's Restaurant.

1705
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:15,460
I gotta say, me and my nerd friends in high school thought that song was very funny.

1706
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:18,180
I've always been befuddled by that song.

1707
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,500
Look it up everyone.

1708
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,460
I'm sure everyone will listen to it.

1709
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,380
I think I've avoided it actively.

1710
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:23,700
Yes.

1711
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,900
A bunch of rebel pilots do whatever it takes by Imagine Dragons.

1712
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:39,380
If you want to get the song Circles in, I'm just all about amending these names.

1713
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:42,660
You do this song Circles with Post Mandalorian.

1714
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:44,980
That's good.

1715
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,540
You're doing more dialogue stuff too.

1716
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,580
I mean I want to give Oopla stuff to do.

1717
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:56,980
There's probably R. Kelly obviously is a monster, but Ignition, maybe like when they,

1718
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,700
like we're the spark that'll ignite the fire in the alliance.

1719
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:02,660
Firework?

1720
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,700
Oh then Firework.

1721
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:03,940
Yeah.

1722
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:04,500
Maybe that's Firework.

1723
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,020
That's gotta be in there somewhere.

1724
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:10,580
Portugal the man, feel it still, parentheses rebel just for kicks.

1725
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,260
Oh rebel just for kicks man.

1726
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,140
Oh that's what that's.

1727
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,180
How is that not?

1728
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:14,820
Oh that's good.

1729
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:15,860
It's a bunch of rebel people.

1730
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:16,420
That's good.

1731
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:16,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1732
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:18,260
I have one.

1733
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,180
This is a bring down the house.

1734
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,620
It's Chewie and Maz Kanata usher make love in this club.

1735
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:26,820
That's good.

1736
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,980
Because Maz Kanata is horny for Chewbacca.

1737
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:29,700
Oh yeah.

1738
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,380
So there's going to be like they're on stage together and then that starts playing and

1739
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:35,140
it's very, people whoop and holler.

1740
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:38,980
Do you think they'll consummate in this, in episode nine?

1741
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:42,500
JJ has promised a lot of storylines being wrapped up.

1742
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:47,060
So I do think we will see Chewie and Maz Kanata.

1743
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:47,220
Yeah.

1744
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,020
In the first Star Wars sex scene ever.

1745
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,740
I've got two, I'm stuck, I'm really stuck.

1746
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:54,980
Sure.

1747
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,700
This is for obviously for the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda.

1748
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,700
Yeah we don't got Baby Yoda covered yet.

1749
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:08,020
The given, the big crowd pleaser would be Old Town Road.

1750
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,980
Ah yeah sure.

1751
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,980
But I think the better song.

1752
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,260
When they're like on the road.

1753
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,380
They're on the road.

1754
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,580
They're sort of not, they're like a surprising match.

1755
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:24,260
That's why I think the better song though is Kenny Chesney's Get Along.

1756
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:28,660
Because the first lyrics get along, get along, get along.

1757
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,980
We got a long, long way to go.

1758
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,140
And so I feel like.

1759
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,300
But is that going to bring down the house?

1760
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,340
I think that.

1761
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,500
Old Town Road is very big.

1762
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,780
Old Town Road I think is probably the bigger.

1763
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:46,900
And there's probably some intermingling of Baby Yoda and Baby Shark.

1764
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,420
Oh yeah.

1765
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:48,740
Yes.

1766
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,700
I'm not sure what it is.

1767
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,100
I think you can give Baby Yoda multiple things to do.

1768
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:56,660
In fact alternate version, it could be the the Yodas Brothers.

1769
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:00,420
And he wants to suffer like a pacifier.

1770
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:01,780
That's good.

1771
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,820
Yeah Old Town Road have to be in.

1772
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,340
I think that's the closer.

1773
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:08,900
It's good to know what you're building too.

1774
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:09,940
It's definitely the closer.

1775
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,740
Yeah do you have any?

1776
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:13,860
I'm out of my.

1777
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:14,900
I think I'm out.

1778
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:16,980
Yeah.

1779
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,740
I mean I was very satisfied.

1780
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,380
That was a real pleasure to come up with new ones.

1781
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:25,860
I would love to be take some meetings and be involved in bringing this back.

1782
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:26,740
Take some meetings.

1783
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,620
Take some meetings.

1784
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:31,940
Well as Star Wars is allowed to be fun again, yeah.

1785
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:32,180
Yeah.

1786
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:34,500
It's time.

1787
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:39,220
I mean that they have to know also that that Old Town Road lip sync.

1788
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:43,220
You're talking 12 million views on YouTube.

1789
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:43,460
Yeah.

1790
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:50,100
I mean they want, they're looking for things to absorb crowds and move crowds elsewhere.

1791
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:54,020
So I understand maybe it's not, it doesn't like Star Wars is only in Disneyland,

1792
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:56,340
but move put this somewhere else you know.

1793
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:57,540
Why not?

1794
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:58,740
Like tour it.

1795
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:03,140
Yeah do 12 nights at the Stable Center.

1796
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:03,380
Yeah.

1797
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,500
They do Disney on ice.

1798
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,420
Hyperspace Hoopla on ice.

1799
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:07,460
Sure.

1800
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:08,660
Yeah.

1801
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,020
Yeah you maybe kind of limit.

1802
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,940
Some of those things are hard to do.

1803
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:12,340
Yeah that's true.

1804
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:17,860
Although we watched, I guess we watched ice skaters do Gangnam Style at Knott's Berry

1805
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,380
for a long time ago.

1806
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,020
Do a club.

1807
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,140
The step is hard but.

1808
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:24,500
Snoopy on ice skates did Gangnam Style.

1809
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:24,900
Yeah.

1810
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,460
Yeah.

1811
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,580
So if he can do it.

1812
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,300
If he can do it.

1813
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,060
Well maybe you're right.

1814
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,100
Maybe it's a club tour.

1815
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,940
Maybe it's just a smaller venue.

1816
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:32,980
More intimate.

1817
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:33,460
Intimate.

1818
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,220
You get involved.

1819
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:35,700
Largo.

1820
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:36,900
It's a Largo show.

1821
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,820
Yeah it's a Largo acoustic show.

1822
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,220
You know it's just John Mayer and a guitar.

1823
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,300
It's not John Mayer and Dead and Friends.

1824
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:43,460
You know.

1825
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,580
Amy Mann is there.

1826
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:45,780
Yeah.

1827
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,820
Paul F. Tompkins.

1828
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,140
Sure.

Everybody would want to.

1830
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:49,220
And Kit Fisko.

1831
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,940
It's Amy Mann, Paul F. Tompkins, Kit Fisko.

1832
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:52,980
John Bryan.

1833

John Bryan.

1834
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,380
A surprise appearance from John Bryan.

1835
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:56,820
Yeah.

1836
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:58,100
No way.

1837
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,100
Look this has to come back.

1838
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,700
So please if you work in Disney just please.

1839
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,500
Yeah we can scale.

1840
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,500
We've proved we can scale it for any venue.

1841
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,060
Yeah we'll make it work for whoever wants it.

1842
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,180
And whichever characters.

1843
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,420
Doesn't matter.

1844
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:12,820
Great.

1845
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,900
Well so we'll see you in 2020.

1846
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:19,300
This is a good like sort of let's like plant this seed and then hopefully

1847
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:24,020
at the end of the year we're I don't know when the weekends happen.

1848
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,540
I say the end of 2020.

1849
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:26,020
I don't know.

1850
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,020
When is Star Wars weekends?

1851
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,980
I don't know if they're doing it anymore though.

1852
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:31,620
Oh really?

1853
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,260
I thought they were.

1854
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,220
All things done?

1855
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,740
No they have like a whole little.

1856
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,220
I'm pretty sure.

1857
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,500
It's just different.

1858
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,260
What's that convention they do?

1859
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,940
Oh well that's just like their Star Wars D23 thing.

1860
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:42,740
Yeah.

1861
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,260
Star Wars weekends.

1862
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,580
Yeah I guess I guess they sort of they do a different thing.

1863
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:50,420
I don't think they call it Star Wars weekends anymore but it's they still do like a fan thing.

1864
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:56,020
Whenever it is just when we're like you know so in the thick of it and like running like okay

1865
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:02,740
we got to do it again okay Yoda Mandalorian back on her ones and we're stressed out about it and

1866
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:07,780
then I'll turn to you guys and go remember when this was now the stress is eating us alive but

1867
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:12,100
this was like what we dreamed of months ago on the podcast and now we're here.

1868
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,260
We're on the big stage and we're doing it.

1869
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:16,660
You have to reset our thinking about it.

1870
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,180
Got the rancor in the back.

1871
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,700
Lanspeeder is attached.

1872
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:24,660
Jason has a figure in Dan head that he's about to put on

1873
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,220
because he's about to play figure in Dan.

1874
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,280
Yeah.

1875
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,420
He's getting his legs warmed up.

1876
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:42,740
Lando and L3-37 are gearing up for their romantic duet and they and like yeah like they're

1877
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:47,300
they're practicing like getting all up on each other and we're going like we made this happen.

1878
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,220
Yeah all of me right.

1879
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:57,060
The Leia thing too with the wire work I was thinking was going to be kind of a slower thing

1880
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,780
so she could do Cirque du Soleil stuff while she's up in the air flying.

1881
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,980
Oh that's good Superman.

1882
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:01,480
Yeah.

1883
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,300
So yeah.

1884
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:03,800
Great.

1885
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:04,920
