1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Warning! The following podcast may contain

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
sordid tales of the Disney surveillance state,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the saying of names of original Simpsons writers,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and long-dead puppeteers,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
plus barely-sourced speculation about the future of the Simpsons in theme parks.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Alan Siegel, author of A New Simpsons Book,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
joins us to talk about a bunch of Simpsons stuff

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
in a perfectly-cromulant Simpsons episode on Podcast The Ride.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, which like the Simpsons,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
has characters who are yellow,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
which in our case means cowardly.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm Scott Gardiner, joined by Mike Carlson.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It means cowardly, it also means maybe we had too much Taco Bell Caliente sauce,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
because the sauce itself was made from an artificial yellow dye.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That is always a danger, yes, that you consume so much of that,

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
despite its prior effects on you, that you end up the color of the sauce.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Jason Sheridan, who struggled with said sauce.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, I was worried you were going to say we were jaundiced,

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and I was like, no, jaundice is one of the health battles I've not faced.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You are not currently, yes, yes, well congrats, there's always time.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There's always, oh yeah.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes, we're happy to not particularly resemble the Simpsons,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but we are happy also to talk about the Simpsons,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and to revisit the world of the Simpsons in Springfield,

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and the intersection of the Simpsons in theme parks.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We talked about the Simpsons ride with the Talking Simpsons gentlemen,

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
but today we're going to dive a little deeper.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We're going to talk about stuff that's beyond the ride,

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
the Springfield areas and Universal Studios,

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and the theme parks they visited in the show,

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and what we'll be losing, I was going to say if,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
but I'd say when the Simpsons disappear from Universal Parks,

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
it's certainly seeming that way.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
More, it's tipping towards when.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
A grab bag of Simpsons stuff, and this comes to us courtesy our great guest today,

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
who's an excellent writer, who has a book that is available for pre-order right now

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
called Stupid TV, Be More Funny,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How the Golden Era of the Simpsons Changed Television in America Forever.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's Alan Siegel, hello.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hi guys, thanks for having me.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Absolutely.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you for coming, thank you for making us aware of your book,

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
for sending us copies of the book, which we've been diving into already.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think you had all of us at Golden Era of the Simpsons.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's a starting point that we love.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But yeah, I mean, congrats to you,

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and I'm excited to check it out and spread awareness of it here.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you, I just got back from Orlando,

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
it was the first time I'd been there since 2001,

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and there were a lot fewer Dick Tracy products there than I remembered

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
from the early 90s of my first trip,

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and also Jessica Rabbit had a lot, you know,

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
there was no presence of her, there was no giant Jessica Rabbit sign

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
like there was in 1991.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's right, Pleasure Island.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, there were still the lingering little,

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
it really did loom large, I guess.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Like so many props around, because it's what they had just done,

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and they had to like populate that studio's park with something,

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
so it was all that.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Couldn't they leave Jessica up and put her in like a big coat, you know,

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
at Disney Springs?

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Like they did on the ride, you're saying,

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
because there was an old neon sign,

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and you're saying just amend it with a second neon sign.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Give her the big coat and put it back up.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Like put it under the, you know, Morimoto restaurant, you know.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You know, it's like, hey, it's like a weird, it's a funky thing.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It would fit somewhere at Disney Springs.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Right, that's what I'm saying.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And it nods to the history.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How was your trip in general?

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This was a thing with niece's nephews?

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, so it was my dad who's a retired engineer,

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
he planned this whole thing.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We took my seven and nine-year-old nieces to Epcot,

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Animal Kingdom, and Magic Kingdom,

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and we did pretty much everything.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My oldest, older niece managed to do Tiana.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It took some psyching up, but,

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and the photo where I look like a psychopath,

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sticking my tongue out,

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
but she is like kind of like bending her head down,

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and she looks scared out of her mind,

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
but at the end of the ride, she was happy she did it,

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
so we were happy too.

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's a huge one to get over.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I was much older when I did it,

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and then I completely reset for decades,

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
so a nine-year-old is a better time to begin.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You mentioned that, well, okay,

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
you mentioned a little bit of like,

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
when we were talking before,

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
there was a little bit of like,

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
mostly went very smooth,

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but a little bit of like tension of perceived space

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
at the end of the day,

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
like in the fireworks kind of zone.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It was very funny, again, as a childless adult,

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
things that I don't run into too much,

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
but we were watching the fireworks at the end of the day

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
on Main Street USA,

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and we staked out a good spot,

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and my dad, again, amazing planner,

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
wanted to sort of protect our little three-by-three space.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You're implied.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If everyone spreads out a little bit,

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you can't put tape on the ground,

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
but you can just sort of try to convey a bubble.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And a guy sort of stepped in front of him

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
completely innocuously,

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and my dad, again, is a very sort of rule follower,

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and he kind of said to the guy,

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
like, oh, you're right in front of us,

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and the guy scoffed very loudly,

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and he's like, dude, there's 10,000 people here.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We're going to be fine.

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And my brother kind of tapped my dad on the shoulder

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and was like, all right, let's just leave this alone.

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It was perfectly fine.

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I was telling Scott that they,

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
my parents are 75 and 72,

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and they walked, you know, three straight days,

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
like 10 to 14-hour days.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It was really impressive, and my nieces, too, were,

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
again, I think they just are on such a high

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
from being there that they were great.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, yeah, it's sort of like the magic of that place

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and all of these places where you sort of, yeah,

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
you go, like, beyond your bounds of kids stay up later,

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
kids push it harder.

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, your parents, I find that, too,

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm always astounded by the step count at the end of it.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Like, I did what?

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Where if you told me at the beginning of the day

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
to do that in my neighborhood, I'd say, absolutely not.

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm going to get so tired, I'm going to get so bored,

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
but it doesn't happen.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's not even possible.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It doesn't feel like it's possible in real life.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It only is possible in Orlando.

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah.

146
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I have more energy.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, it's possible if you're, I don't know,

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
if you run, if you're in a workout.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not talking about those people.

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm talking about normal people, regulars.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes, like us.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm happy it was successful and that the dad situation

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
didn't overflow into a worse situation

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
because another thing you mentioned

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
when we were sorting out this episode,

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
you alluded to some amount of issues.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You said that you have a tale involving the dreaded,

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the place that we all avoid trying to,

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that we're all good boys to try to avoid going,

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
which is Disney Jail.

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So the Disney Jail story is actually secondhand,

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
but I'm going to build it up.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It wasn't your father.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It was mine.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No, thank God.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's what I was wondering.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So it was a story told to me by my buddy,

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
who I used to work with at the newspaper

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I started my career at.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And he mentioned it, I think, before he went on

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
a different trip to Disney World.

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And he told this story.

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So this was 2004, approximately.

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So my friend went on a spring break trip

176
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
at the end of college with 10 other guys

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
in their early 20s to Florida.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And it was like Daytona, Miami, and Orlando.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And there was this one kid who had no money.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So he saved up for a plane ticket and then had nothing.

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, jeez.

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So as young men tend to do, they were like,

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
all right, we're going to exploit this situation.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So they started having the guy with no money do dares.

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, no.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And so it started with, you know,

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
take a shot of Tabasco, get this girl's number.

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think it was like, wink at the pilot on the plane.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So they go to Magic Kingdom one day.

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And well, let me back up a little.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This guy had no money.

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So all of my friend and their friends

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
had to pool their money to get him a ticket

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
so that he didn't have to stay in the parking lot

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the entire day.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, you got grand old time, though,

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ticket and transportation center.

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You know, you're watching monorails go around.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, you take the monorail, you go to Disney Springs.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No, that is a free ride.

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's true.

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, this was clearly the juncture point.

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Should have just had a fantastic day at the ticket transpo.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But instead, a foolish decision.

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They had their day at Magic Kingdom.

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They had a good time.

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And then they boarded the ferry from Magic Kingdom

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to the parking lot.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So it's like the Seven Seas Lagoon.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Am I correct on that?

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah.

213
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah.

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's a big, crazy hassle.

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's like the transportation, as we just

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
found when we were there, like the transportation

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
decisions just to get over the moat.

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
There's a lot to work out.

219
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
A lot of second guessing on our part.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Should we do the boat?

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Should we do the monorail?

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That looks full.

223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No, we've got to do the monorail.

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Never mind.

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's a real process.

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So they're on the ferry.

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's nighttime.

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And someone goes to this guy.

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not going to say his name.

230
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He said, hey, why don't you jump in the lake?

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh, no.

232
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, god.

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And my friend said, this is my friend's mind here.

234
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He said, before I could tell him there are alligators

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
in there, all of a sudden, this guy is gone.

236
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He jumps in the water.

237
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, god.

238
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And my friend looks back, and he said it was nothing

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
but a splash in the distance.

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And my friend said that he was laughing the hardest

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
he's ever laughed in his life until he started

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
seeing sirens and boats.

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And all kinds of like, I'm snapping here, immediately,

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
like within five seconds.

245
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Wow.

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So they don't know what to do.

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So the ferry lands.

248
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They get off.

249
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The friends are all led to like a holding room.

250
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And my friend said it felt like, you know, five hours.

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And all of a sudden, a little while later,

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
their friend shows up.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He's still damp.

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He doesn't have his shoes or glasses.

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And he, quote, had to sign his Disney life away.

256
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Whoa.

257
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So they told him, don't ever try to come to a park again.

258
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't go to Euro Disney.

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Don't go to Disney Cruise.

260
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Nothing Disney.

261
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So let's tell you about the Vacation Club hotels.

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Now, these are full of wonderful amenities for families

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
to visit, but not for you.

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No, you cannot live in Cotino, a story living by Disney.

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah, no planned communities in Palm Springs.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We'd prefer if you didn't visit a Disney store,

267
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
but there's a lot of those.

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's a lot for us to honor.

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There's no ticket, so we can't really stop you.

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But still don't, probably.

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So from then on, they kept referring,

272
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
or they kept saying that Disney was no longer

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
the most magical place on Earth.

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And so my friend, when I brought this up to him,

275
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
asked the offender, like, have you been back to Disney?

276
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And he said no.

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And my friend said, you should try.

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah.

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Because how long?

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Like, how do they try?

281
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
They didn't, like, scan his face in some way

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that tracks how he ages.

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They're screwed.

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
They got nothing.

285
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, I really doubt it.

286
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But I kind of want to see.

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I want to hear if he tried.

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I would love to know.

289
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Would they flag him if he signed up for Hulu?

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like, if he signed up for Hulu or Disney Plus

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
or tried to order a Mickey t-shirt on the Disney store

292
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
website, would they track him down?

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Are you saying that that would help?

294
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Or would it ease the call?

295
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Would it be like, oh, he's a subscriber?

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You know what?

297
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
All that's in the past.

298
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
No, it's certainly not in the past.

299
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm just wondering if it's like, like, you know,

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
because it's talking about Simpsons.

301
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Like, we're out of board license plates in the gift shop.

302
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah.

303
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Will he immediately get pounced on by, like?

304
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I suspect he will not be applying to join the Club 33.

305
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah.

306
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No, no, no.

307
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He will not reach the highest echelon.

308
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
No, the Disney Pinkertons, like, dive right for him.

309
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But Universal welcomes him with open arms.

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We have a new customer, you know?

311
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I, there's a lot.

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's all fascinating in general.

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I think it's interesting that they clocked the Friends.

314
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
How did, like, were there telephoto lenses?

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Were they lip reading?

316
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Were they like, we watched that conversation.

317
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That guy said, you should jump.

318
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Well, like, we know that the Friends were part of it.

319
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I feel like Disney, like, employs technology that's, like,

320
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
that was, like, ahead of the Patriot Act.

321
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Like, I saw guys, I was going to ask you guys about this.

322
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Like, these mostly gentlemen walking around Epcot

323
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
in tasteful polos and khaki shorts

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
with their trash pickers and sunglasses.

325
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I was like, I wonder if these are security folks

326
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
who are trying to appear, like, as friendly.

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, and, like, a thing that would be around

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that you wouldn't question,

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
but then the trash pickers can be, like, you know,

330
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
like, those turn into tasers.

331
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah, exactly.

332
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There's different levels.

333
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Like, there's the security guards you see

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
with, like, wide-brimmed hats and, like, nice clothing.

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And then there's, like, plain clothes.

336
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There has been photos of, like, someone got, you know,

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
stopped at a metal detector for whatever reason.

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And then there's a guy, like, making a report

339
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
or talking on a walkie-talkie, and he's just in shorts

340
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and, like, a Dad is Darth Vader t-shirt.

341
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Like, there's plain clothes guys, for sure.

342
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Here's one that threw me of the themed t-shirts

343
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
was the first Princess Security t-shirt I saw.

344
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I was like, oh, shit, is this, like,

345
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
is this what the security people wear?

346
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And I'm like, no.

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And I saw, like, 400 of them around, you know.

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What is that shirt? Maybe I haven't seen that shirt.

349
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I think it's, like, you know, it's, like,

350
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Girl Dad kind of theme, you know?

351
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's, like, a guy, like, I'm gonna protect my daughters,

352
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
you know, that kind of thing.

353
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, Mike knows he's a hashtag Girl Dad.

354
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's true, yeah, and I have that shirt.

355
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And I saw a shirt yesterday at Disneyland

356
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
where it was just the Godfather font

357
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and it said the Girl Father.

358
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And I was like, I'm gonna get that too.

359
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's badass.

360
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It used to be, up until three years ago

361
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
when the term Girl Dad was invented,

362
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
it was embarrassing and shameful

363
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
to be the father of a daughter.

364
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And, you know, though billions of people

365
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
had this experience, they all hated every second of it.

366
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And that phrase did a lot of good,

367
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and Girl Father, that's even better.

368
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's the next generation.

369
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
This was a guy with a big beard.

370
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He looked like he'd beat someone up, too.

371
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He looked tough.

372
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He had two girls, though.

373
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know, can a Girl Dad be tough?

374
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't know.

375
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I mean, the shirt makes me think they can.

376
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah.

377
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh, it's so lame.

378
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's possible.

379
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There's one more thing about that story

380
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I have to ask you about, which is that, like,

381
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
does the timeline imply that they forced the friend

382
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
to shiver for hours, like, lay in your own filth

383
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
after what you did?

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
No, we will not give you towels.

385
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We will not help you.

386
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So here's what I don't know.

387
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That whole, like, elapsed time

388
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
might have been 20 minutes.

389
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Sure.

390
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, because, like, my friends were probably,

391
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
my friend and his friends were probably terrified or,

392
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
you know, but yes, I don't think he had a change of clothes.

393
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No way.

394
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
They did not provide, I'd like to think

395
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
that they'd made it psychological torture

396
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and that they, like, took him to, like, a sundry shop,

397
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
to, like, a place with a lot of towels,

398
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
or just to the pool area at the Contemporary.

399
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Like, made him look at 500 towels

400
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and then said, you can't have it.

401
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I think, yeah, or they found a bibbidi-bobbidi-broke T-shirt

402
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
for him that I saw in Disney World several times.

403
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's like these guys who think that they're being clever

404
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and they're definitely not.

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And the guy who got in the water, he didn't.

406
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Do you know if he tried plausible deniability of,

407
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
like, I lost my balance, I fell?

408
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You know, that's a missing detail

409
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
that I will surely pass along to you guys

410
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
because when we're done, I will ask my friends.

411
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You will get a fill on the gaps, yeah.

412
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The railings are kind of high on those boats,

413
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
so it might have been, like, a camera caught him,

414
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and he kind of had to vault over,

415
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
so we couldn't pull that excuse.

416
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
All of this stuff, it does tie together very nicely

417
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
into, you know, like, the biggest intersection

418
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
between the Simpsons and theme parks,

419
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
besides, obviously, their presence in the theme parks,

420
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
but which is the Golden Era episode,

421
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Itchy and Scratchyland.

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And, like, besides, you know, it's, obviously,

423
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
we've all been big fans of that one in particular,

424
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and we were little park fan kids.

425
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We loved that episode.

426
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But it only gets, like, it stays so fresh and so true

427
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
because while it, like, it gets the Disney parks details

428
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
right, like, the public-facing things,

429
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
it's just so smart with its observations

430
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
about the security state

431
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and the underground Disney World that you don't get.

432
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And in particular, it really, like, it does, like,

433
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Itchy and Scratchyland feels a lot more like Disney World,

434
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
where there is, like, the hassle

435
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and all of the transportation that we're talking about

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and the feeling of, like, being stuck on the campus

437
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
with no way to contact the outside.

438
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That, uh, the combo of Disney World and Jurassic Park

439
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
that it found is so smart and continues to be funny

440
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
over 30 years later.

441
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Can you believe that?

442
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah, and I didn't, this is a very Simpsons thing,

443
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
which is, you know, I didn't know what Westworld was.

444
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, right, right.

445
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You know, in the early 90s,

446
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
so that's another one that it definitely sent up.

447
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But the, like, glut of merch

448
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
is just something I think about all the time.

449
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I mean, and I saw it in Disney World a couple weeks ago.

450
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The, you know, the famous joke

451
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
is the bored license plate joke, as you guys know.

452
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And a couple years ago,

453
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I tracked down people who had real bored vanity plates.

454
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And let me tell you how, A, envious I was

455
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and, B, like, the delight in their voices

456
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
when they talked about it was so good.

457
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Like, they, one guy was like,

458
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
it's probably not that funny a story,

459
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
like, basically, like, got let off on a ticket

460
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
because he had a bored license plate.

461
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh, wow.

462
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
One, you know, one guy was afraid to put it on his car

463
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
because he didn't want somebody to steal it.

464
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And...

465
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, yeah.

466
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I mean, those at Universal, don't those sell out?

467
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I think I've read that in places.

468
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, I don't know, or I feel like I've been there

469
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and seen that they were out of bored license plates.

470
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And I thought, is that the joke,

471
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
that they always have, like, a permanent spot?

472
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Or was it genuinely sold out

473
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and I was watching the joke play out

474
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
in a meta way in our actual world?

475
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, I have a very dorky story

476
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
that somehow I don't think I've shared before.

477
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Ah.

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But when the Simpsons ride

479
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
opened at Universal Hollywood

480
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
in 2008, I was working across the street

481
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
in office space rented by Vivid Entertainment,

482
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the pornography company,

483
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
but they were making, like, Tabitha's salon takeover

484
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
in the rented space.

485
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And I...

486
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So you were not in the space being a performer.

487
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No, no. And you...

488
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Just a wishful performer.

489
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just hoping, like,

490
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
drop them headshots once in a while,

491
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
if you need me.

492
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
People would have to go up to the top floor,

493
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
the actual Vivid office,

494
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to get, like, keys and key cards.

495
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And I don't think I ever got up there,

496
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
but apparently there was a lot of billowing drapes

497
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
at the top, like, cartoonish decoration.

498
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Anyway...

499
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Just layers of hundreds of layers of drapes before you.

500
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The show wrapped,

501
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and then they let everyone go early,

502
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and I was like, oh, my God,

503
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
the Simpsons ride opened yesterday or today.

504
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So I drove up to Universal,

505
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and I rode it,

506
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and I immediately went in the gift shop

507
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and started looking for bought license plates.

508
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And then I went back a few weeks later,

509
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and still they had nothing both times.

510
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Wow.

511
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So I ended up buying, like, a name keychain,

512
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
but the name was blank.

513
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And I, with a Sharpie, wrote BORT on it.

514
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And I carried that around for years,

515
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
long enough that eventually the gift shop

516
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
did start selling BORT keychains

517
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and, like, license plate pins and stuff.

518
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Wow. You had to take matters into your own hands.

519
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What did you use to write?

520
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
A Sharpie.

521
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
A Sharpie, okay.

522
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Look, I didn't have a lot going on at 22, you know?

523
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'd entertain myself somehow.

524
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah, wow.

525
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
He had the entire six minutes

526
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
to write the name on the license plate.

527
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And then carry it close to my heart

528
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
until it eventually just got scratched off.

529
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, wow.

530
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Not literally close to you.

531
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It wasn't to, like, fend off bullets.

532
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
No, I don't tend to keep my house keys

533
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
on my upper chest area.

534
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
On your upper chest.

535
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You could be smart if anybody's after you.

537
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What a funny thing, though, that it isn't, like...

538
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah, it's in the world of the...

539
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I was meditating on that joke on BORT license plates,

540
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
which in the context...

541
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Well, it's BART looking for a BART license plate,

542
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and they have every possible name surrounding BART

543
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
except for his own and including BORT,

544
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and immediately a real BORT walks up,

545
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and then later there's an emergency

546
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
that is the shortage of BORT license plates.

547
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I think Barclay is an underrated step

548
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
of this joke sequence as well, for sure.

549
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, and don't forget the one beat

550
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
where the mom is calling for BORT,

551
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and a stranger goes, are you talking to me?

552
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
She says, no, my son is also named BORT.

553
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And it's really funny.

554
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's kind of just like a stray...

555
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I mean, I love the episode for that reason,

556
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
that there's a lot going on in the episode.

557
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
There's a lot of story,

558
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and there's a lot of themes to touch on,

559
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
but then they will still just stop down

560
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and do kind of a free joke

561
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
that is not so attached to anything,

562
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
because it's not really...

563
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I mean, is there a greater point about theme parks to it,

564
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
or is it just like...

565
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's almost just one thing

566
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
that makes the day more unpleasant for BART.

567
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
There might be people that probably have that experience

568
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
with their name that's a little more unusual.

569
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, or being in a...

570
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Somebody thinking, my name is a fairly common name.

571
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
How am I in this alternate universe

572
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
where you have this and you have this, but not mine?

573
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Right.

574
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Well, I know I've definitely seen people

575
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
or encounter, like, oh, they're out of Jason's today.

576
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But even more, like, my wife is Jane with a Y,

577
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and that's harder than with that.

578
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah, you're not gonna find that.

579
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So that's pretty common.

580
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You gotta get the Sharpie out for that name.

581
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah, well, I gotta get the Y.

582
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They have different spellings of Caitlin

583
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
or other names that are escaping me at the moment.

584
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
There's always an Alan,

585
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
because every Alan besides me is, like, over 70 years old.

586
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Well, this is the...

587
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Like, I was gonna ask you about this, Mike,

588
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
now with children in the picture

589
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and without revealing our kids' names.

590
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You've been in these gift shops.

591
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You find in your daughter's name in there.

592
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Is it in the stand?

593
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Never. I've never looked.

594
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh, really? You haven't done this?

595
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Wow, wow, no kidding.

596
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I don't think...

597
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You know what?

598
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Maybe we looked at the Minions the other day,

599
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
but I think maybe she ran away,

600
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and then we didn't finish the job.

601
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Okay, sure, yeah.

602
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It seemed like she cared.

603
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
She knows how to spell it.

604
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
She's known how to spell her name for a while.

605
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Sure.

606
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But she doesn't care.

607
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Well, it'll be, like, a year or two

608
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
before, like, the seeing the name is, like, the biggest...

609
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yes, right.

610
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Wow, my name printed out.

611
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Both of my son's names are a little bit old-fashioned.

612
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I will sometimes see my younger son's name.

613
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Oldest never.

614
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Really?

615
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It has never happened.

616
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But, like, yeah, you might think,

617
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
due to it being, like, kind of traditional,

618
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
quote-unquote, that you would run into it,

619
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
but I think they don't, just in that, like...

620
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's just not on the short list of, like...

621
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
They're like, come on, nobody under five

622
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
is gonna be named this.

623
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Go ahead and guess, I guess.

624
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's all...

625
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So, listener, guess what you think it might be.

626
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Zachariah?

627
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Come.

628
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Ulysses?

629
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Abraham.

630
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Abraham.

631
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

632
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
They don't have your son's name,

633
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
but they have a million variations of Jaden, Kaden, Aiden.

634
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It is, I know, if it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

635
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If it's an Aiden, really, yeah.

636
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
A Zaden, a Zaden with an X Zaden.

637
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Harley.

638
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, yeah, plenty of those, yeah.

639
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You're both kind of out of luck at the Minions shop,

640
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
because it's all just Kevin, Bob, Kevin, Bob, like...

641
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

642
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
No, it's really unfair.

643
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Stewart.

644
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Sticky in those lanes.

645
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So, I have a question for you guys.

646
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
When you were first going to Disney,

647
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
like, how into the merch were you?

648
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Because I feel like I was obsessed

649
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and, like, pissed my parents off in 1991

650
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
to, like, fur a stuffed animal,

651
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
whereas my nieces, like, I think they got,

652
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
they each got one souvenir.

653
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I don't know, like, the pull of that stuff is so strong.

654
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, right.

655
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You guys remember it.

656
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Oh, tons and tons.

657
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I wanted, I didn't want big stuff.

658
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I just wanted a million little pins and flashlights and pens.

659
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And then I just kept, I have so much, like, paper products,

660
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
maps and coasters and matchbooks, you know.

661
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, those are free.

662
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You're describing free things.

663
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh, yeah.

664
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You can grab as many of those as you get.

665
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I, like, every time I was packing my duffel bag or suitcase,

666
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
like, to leave Disney, I would, like,

667
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
take the biggest Disney gift shop bag

668
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and just throw everything in.

669
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
All the maps, all the pins, all the stuff.

670
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This feels like a part of the Disney World tradition,

671
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
is that, like, needing to make, like, checking the,

672
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
making sure that the airport,

673
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
your airline's policy is, like, personal item.

674
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And go, well, how big can that personal item be?

675
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Because that personal item might be, like,

676
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
a full-size monorail box that I'm bringing in

677
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
with, like, you know, seven other shirts stuffed into it.

678
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I don't know.

679
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah, big merch thoughts for yourself.

680
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I mean, I wanted everything, yeah.

681
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And I was, the stuff that looms largest

682
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
is getting, like, the goofy stuffed animal

683
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
one of my first trips.

684
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And then I was just always obsessed

685
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
with getting one of the Disney characters,

686
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
generally one of the big five or six,

687
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
a plastic head of theirs

688
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
that was full of tart and tiny candy.

689
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I have a goofy one, I think, still somewhere.

690
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And then I think I have a Mickey one as well.

691
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And that, I was obsessed with it.

692
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The amount of tart and tiny's you would get in this big head.

693
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And that, like, that, for whatever reason,

694
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
is, like, those are the two exciting,

695
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
the most exciting things.

696
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Of your entire childhood.

697
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Of my life, my entire life.

698
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Is that where the tart and tiny fixation came from?

699
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That's where I got my tart and tiny fetish.

700
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Yeah, well, because we've been at,

701
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
there's a candy store in Burbank,

702
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
up the block from the movie theater.

703
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And Mike once got in a fairly long conversation

704
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
with a clerk about tart and tiny's.

705
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Well, because I was, I learned online

706
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
that tart and tiny's were back.

707
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Like, out of commission for a while.

708
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I don't think, I think somehow in all these years,

709
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I haven't heard tart and tiny's specifically.

710
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Really?

711
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Tart and tiny's.

712
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah, they're these little things.

713
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They eventually had candy coated tart and tiny's,

714
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
which I still liked as well.

715
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But I didn't like them in their original,

716
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I didn't like those as much as the original.

717
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Can I say this?

718
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
They look like crayons.

719
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Crayons?

720
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yeah, so what I'm looking at,

721
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
yeah, they look like crayon stumps to me.

722
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Probably taste like it too.

723
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That's what I'm wondering.

724
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I mean, they must not, if they were so.

725
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
They do not taste like crayons.

726
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Were they a little?

727
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Well, that's good.

728
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Were they chalky?

729
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
They're chalky, yeah, like sweet tarts in a way.

730
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah, so another company picked up the lucrative IP

731
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
of tart and tiny's a couple years ago.

732
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
For feature films, you're saying?

733
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
For tart and tiny's the movie.

734
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I own the rights for that.

735
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I own the rights to the tart and tiny movie.

736
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You were both at each other's throat trying to get

737
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
the script duties for tart and tiny.

738
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I've heard about it a lot.

739
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I was only in the game just trying to dethrone Mike.

740
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I didn't care and give two shits.

741
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That's why you ended up winning.

742
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You had the passion.

743
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Right, right.

744
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It says on this tart and tiny's website,

745
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
pucker up, we're back.

746
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Which is gonna be the tagline of the movie.

747
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So yeah, no, I got very excited tart and tiny's were back.

748
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I went to the candy store in Burbank,

749
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and I think I said something about tart and tiny's

750
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
or asked or they had them.

751
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I forget what it is, but then the guy who owns there

752
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
was like really into the tart and tiny conversation

753
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
because I think he's owned that candy place for many years.

754
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So he knows the news about candy.

755
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So I really was talking his language.

756
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Well, they also like sneak candy in a movie theater.

757
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I feel like they don't care now,

758
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
but that candy shop will give you a discount

759
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
if you show a movie to them.

760
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yes, now I believe we have mentioned that on the website.

761
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
This is absolutely the time or more that has been said

762
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
on the show.

763
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That is my favorite.

764
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The only downside post pandemic

765
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
is they don't let you scoop anymore.

766
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Where everything's like kind of pre wrapped.

767
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
They don't let you scoop in this particular,

768
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
but you can still go to the American.

769
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
They don't let you just put your hand in it,

770
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
walk into a movie theater.

771
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
As long as you can hide it in your fist,

772
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
no one will notice.

773
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Because you want a lot of chocolate covered pretzels,

774
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
but you might only want one or two gummy sharks.

775
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Scott, you know what this is like.

776
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's really, they're pretty sizable.

777
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Do you have candy predilections in this?

778
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That's not the right word.

779
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That's a creepy word.

780
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
How about candies you like?

781
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I like any kind of Reese's or in my Boston accent,

782
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I call it Reese's or any kind of Reese's peanut butter stuff.

783
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I like Sour Patch Kids and Sour Watermelons.

784
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Those are my.

785
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Nothing wrong with those.

786
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
That's my predilection.

787
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Sure.

788
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Well, thanks for using the word.

789
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm going to do a talk show transition now.

790
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm going to do Byron Allen transition now.

791
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
In your book, which once again is called Stupid TV,

792
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Be More Funny,

793
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
is a great Simpsons reference.

794
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
This isn't as clean as Byron yet.

795
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Hold on.

796
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
There is one of the first licensees of Simpsons products

797
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
is Butterfinger.

798
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And that relationship, God, is it still going?

799
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
There still should have been a speaking of candy in there.

800
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You needed one more thing to make it.

801
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
What do you mean?

802
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The transition wasn't until the end of the thing.

803
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, I got very excited.

804
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Also, the Byron Allen transition is so.

805
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You like Butterfingers?

806
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That's the Byron Allen transition.

807
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I see you wrote about Butterfingers in your book.

808
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I just wanted to shout out his nice book.

809
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Well, I appreciate it.

810
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And Byron Allen.

811
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well, that's good, too.

812
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The crazy thing about that license is that

813
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Simpsons was advertising for Butterfinger

814
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
before the show started.

815
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's like when the shorts were on, which is insane.

816
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It goes back to that.

817
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I was doing research, and I thought,

818
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I couldn't believe that it was actually true,

819
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
but that's quite dramatic for this fact.

820
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But the New York Times was reporting it,

821
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
interviewing Matt Groening in 1988 about it.

822
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So they had the license for a while.

823
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It went away, and I think it came back for a while.

824
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
But it was really funny interviewing the writers

825
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
just about the gobs of Butterfingers

826
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
they would get in the office.

827
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I mean, okay, you guys have all been there.

828
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
They would put them in a gumball machine

829
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
when it was those Butterfinger BBs,

830
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
those little balls.

831
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And they would pour water in it,

832
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
and then it would get moldy,

833
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and they would throw it at the ceiling.

834
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I mean, these are very mature guys,

835
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
but I remember John Vede, the writer, said that,

836
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm not sure if this actually made the book,

837
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
but he said whenever they were pissed or cranky

838
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
about Fox or the show,

839
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
they would take a shot at Butterfingers.

840
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh, wow, wow, that's funny.

841
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Did the writers room, or is it still,

842
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
or what's the deal?

843
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Because my understanding has always been

844
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
that even in the success of the show,

845
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I think you allude to this in the book,

846
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
even in success, that they kept the writers room

847
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
kind of shitty on purpose.

848
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Just kind of like, let's keep it just this humble,

849
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
kind of bad place,

850
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
as if to just connect to the roots,

851
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
or just like, I don't know,

852
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
there's a humbling quality to it.

853
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah, they definitely liked having it

854
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
like a dorm room for better or worse.

855
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I mean, they would sit around,

856
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and I think George Meyer told me this story.

857
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
There was a pool cue that they had

858
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
in the middle of the floor,

859
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and nobody knows where it came from,

860
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and they would compete to see who could unscrew it

861
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and screw it back together as fast as they could,

862
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
because they would just be there for hours,

863
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and most of them didn't have kids,

864
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
so they were there for 12 hours a day.

865
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And yeah, it was just like a dump,

866
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and everything, their whole day was basically based on lunch,

867
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and that was the only thing they looked forward to.

868
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh, sure, yeah, yeah,

869
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
the biggest variable in the day.

870
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yeah, I recall hearing like the Oakley-Weinstein era,

871
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
season seven and eight, that it would just be,

872
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
it's like, it's past midnight every day.

873
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's just like, they all live to be there.

874
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, in a pre-kids time,

875
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
you can just pack it full of jokes upon jokes upon jokes.

876
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah, Oakley had a line that like,

877
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
he said that he would, I think, drive into the Fox lot,

878
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and he would like see like a valet Parker,

879
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and he would be like, I wish I was doing that

880
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
instead of putting the show together,

881
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
which I know, he's self-aware.

882
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I just thought he, have you guys heard the,

883
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm spoiling my material in the book,

884
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
but the famous Simpsons lunch Conan O'Brien story?

885
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That was really funny.

886
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I can get to that.

887
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Maybe.

888
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So they would have a PA every day get the lunches.

889
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh, I know, yeah, yeah.

890
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And so people would put in their orders,

891
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and it'd be like Pavlovian,

892
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
the PA would come up the stairs,

893
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and people's mouths would water.

894
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So one day they hear the PA coming up the stairs,

895
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and then all of a sudden they hear a scream,

896
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
and they hear the box just tumbling.

897
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And so people are like, oh fuck, is he hurt?

898
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And also our lunches, what happened to our lunches?

899
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And they fuck.

900
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So they go outside, and it's Conan O'Brien

901
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
with a box full of garbage

902
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
that he had just thrown down the stairs

903
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
to fuck with them.

904
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And one of the writers was like,

905
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
it was like a devastatingly effective prank

906
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
because that's all they looked forward to.

907
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Everyone pledged to the absolute worst.

908
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And they would go, the other story,

909
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Bill Oakley is saying like, yeah,

910
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
we would order so much food,

911
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
like you would just order an appetizer

912
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and an entree and dessert,

913
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
and the anecdote that when he left the show,

914
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
he quickly dropped like 65 pounds.

915
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah, it's wild.

916
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I mean, there are stories like they would,

917
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
this is a very LA reference,

918
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
but they would order like whole pies from Apple Pan

919
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
and just like be eating, you know, out of,

920
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
which is like a famous greasy spoon here.

921
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So yeah.

922
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Delicious pie.

923
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Multiple entire pies being split.

924
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So Jason's getting a lot more motivated

925
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
to try to get into a writer's room.

926
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Thinking about starting this writing thing.

927
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah, the like one talking head

928
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
for documentary interview did,

929
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I got like a free granola bar at craft services.

930
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
That was the most fancy.

931
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah, I don't think, yeah,

932
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I think everything's pretty bare bones

933
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
most places these days.

934
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Do you chalk up the quality of these seasons

935
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
that we all really admire?

936
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I mean, I think especially through eight

937
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
seems to be the magic number people refer to.

938
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Is it like the dorm quality

939
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and just that all these brilliant people

940
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
are hanging out all hours of the day

941
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
and packing everything full of stuff?

942
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Or was it like, was there something special

943
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
also maybe to like the lack of the feedback loop

944
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
that we're not like, you know,

945
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
getting obsessed with what the audience is saying yet,

946
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that they're a little bit in a bubble

947
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and they're just doing what they want to do?

948
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I think that's a very good point in question

949
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
because so the show kind of became

950
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
at least famous among comedy writers

951
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
for like the no notes rule.

952
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So because of James L. Brooks,

953
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
they were allowed to,

954
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
like the executives didn't have creative feedback,

955
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
but one of the writers said that it's kind of misunderstood

956
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
because he said that the, you know,

957
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
people think that the perception is

958
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
that all the notes were shit.

959
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
They were really bad, stupid,

960
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
but he said that's not really what it was.

961
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
He would get good notes sometimes,

962
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
but it was the fact that notes took time to respond to

963
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
so it was really just to not have to worry about that

964
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
in your day.

965
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
They had more time to, you know, like you said,

966
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
sit in the room and go over every single joke

967
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
over and over and over.

968
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And I mean, again, it's a cliche,

969
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
but they sort of talk about how the best joke would win the day

970
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and it was sort of competitive,

971
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
but not in a way that like SNL was

972
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
where the writers were sort of fighting

973
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
to get their material on the air.

974
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh yeah, because it's a different thing

975
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
because you're all building the same thing.

976
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's not like you're not competing

977
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
for three minutes of Simpson space.

978
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That's another, that's chilling as you say that

979
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
because of the things that I've worked on,

980
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
it is like the amount of effort that goes into

981
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
like getting this step ready so that the people

982
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
who need to approve it can take nine days to get it done.

983
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And then as soon as we get it back,

984
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
we have to hurry, hurry, hurry to get all of their thoughts.

985
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Like it's the wrong thing, drive it.

986
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Wow, that's interesting that it was just like purely the,

987
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
just the time saved.

988
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We'll make it better for us.

989
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And then it's, and then it's all of these episodes

990
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
that we, everyone devout and that haven't aged a bit.

991
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And 30 years later, we're still now,

992
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
we appreciate them as adults in a different way

993
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
than we did when we were kids.

994
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's like insane, the timelessness.

995
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I was, I watched like three or four episodes yesterday

996
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and I was laughing so loud.

997
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
That the police were called by your neighbor.

998
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah, normally it's just a polite chuckle

999
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
and they thought something was different.

1000
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
They could tell something was different.

1001
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It screams, oh no.

1002
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But I, the sins I got reading the book

1003
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
was that a lot of the original, you know,

1004
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
for lack of a better term,

1005
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
a lot of them were just different flavors of weirdo.

1006
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Like they were all complimentary,

1007
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
but they were different, like George Meyer

1008
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and John Schwartzwell, like they were all different

1009
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
in the way they approach stuff.

1010
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah, and they all had weird obsessions.

1011
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I mean, it's sort of what you're saying.

1012
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Like the, John Vede, who's another really good writer,

1013
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I was sort of asking him,

1014
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
because you know, the lore of the show

1015
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
is that it's Harvard Lampoon guys, which it is.

1016
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And I was like, well, what made the Lampoon

1017
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
like a good breeding ground

1018
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
beyond just a bunch of smart nerds?

1019
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And he said it's like,

1020
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
it would be the best place to procrastinate on campus

1021
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
because instead of studying,

1022
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
they'd watch like a Brady Bunch episode 12 times in a row.

1023
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And like dissect every aspect of it

1024
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and what made it good, what made it funny, what made it,

1025
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
and you know, that also caused like a,

1026
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
or created like a meta sense of humor for those guys.

1027
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Like they love things like both ironically

1028
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and earnestly somehow, which is pretty impressive.

1029
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yeah, the give and take is like one of the things

1030
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
that seems to make those golden era Simpsons really work,

1031
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
you know, and appreciating it on different levels.

1032
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Like when I was a kid, I was just amazed by it all.

1033
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Like, and I spent a lot of time at the Jersey Shore

1034
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
growing up in every souvenir shop, knickknack shop,

1035
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
half of it became The Simpsons at some point.

1036
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That's funny because there was a writer, Jeff Martin,

1037
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
who maybe I've mentioned before,

1038
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
but so he had a Disneyland annual pass

1039
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
in, you know, late 80s, early 90s,

1040
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
and he had a small, I don't know if it was a newborn,

1041
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
but he had a kid, and he would push the kid around Disneyland

1042
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and he said in 1990 there were more Bart Simpson T-shirts

1043
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
than Mickey.

1044
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah.

1045
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
At Disneyland.

1046
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm sorry, at Disneyland.

1047
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah, well.

1048
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It makes sense, like they sold, I keep repeating this,

1049
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
but they sold 15 million Simpson shirts

1050
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
in the first year of the show alone, which is insane.

1051
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Which is like, if you go to a vintage store or flea market,

1052
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
you'll see them on sale for like 50 bucks, 70 bucks.

1053
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
They are so expensive, like original Simpson

1054
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
or like Black Bart Simpson especially.

1055
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Very expensive.

1056
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The bootleg shirts.

1057
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah, there are, there's Black Bart.

1058
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I mean, there are two, there are like inappropriate,

1059
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I mean, not, you know, inappropriate ones.

1060
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
There are like anti-desert storm,

1061
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
or rather, no, I take the pack, pro-desert storm.

1062
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
What's the ayatollah ass hola is like a Simpson joke

1063
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
that seems like, oh yeah, your shit

1064
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
was getting modded and bootlegged.

1065
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, like it was, there's one I saw for like over a hundred bucks

1066
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
at the Silver Lake flea market.

1067
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It was like Bart hitting a bong.

1068
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And I was like, I should have bought that, but I didn't.

1069
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
There's no way to make that now.

1070
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
There would be no way to recreate it.

1071
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I was, I'm trying to find ones that I can read.

1072
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I mean, here's one called Ram Bart,

1073
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and it's Bart, very strangely drawn,

1074
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Bart kicking Saddam Hussein in the butt.

1075
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And then another one, Warren the Golf, 1991.

1076
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I was there, dude, and it sucked.

1077
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I don't think I knew about this particular slice

1078
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
of insane bootleg shirt.

1079
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Wow.

1080
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It was the voice we needed in the Desert Storm discussion.

1081
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
His name is escaping me, but there was an attorney

1082
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
who was sort of famous for helping Disney secure the land

1083
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
for Disneyland, for Disney World,

1084
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
who was involved in like trying to police these things for Fox.

1085
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And so there were literal stings.

1086
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I couldn't stop laughing.

1087
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I found a report, it was like, Operation Dizzy Fox,

1088
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
like yielded 30,000 Simpson shirts in Washington, D.C.

1089
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Next to the Keep Off the Grass marijuana shirts.

1090
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh my God, what a waste of time.

1091
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But doesn't it not, didn't it in a way,

1092
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
just like, well, now people are walking around,

1093
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
like so many people are walking around with advertisements

1094
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
for our show, even if the design is wrong.

1095
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah, of course.

1096
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Yeah, yeah, that's a...

1097
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yo, Saddam, I'm Bart, and I'm pissed.

1098
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Geez, I'm starting to want one of these.

1099
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Well, you talked about in the book that the rise

1100
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
of graphic tees being like such a huge thing,

1101
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and you chalk that up to like stores like The Gap

1102
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
selling their logo and Hard Rock Cafe

1103
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
selling souvenir shirts, but also Simpson shirts

1104
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
just like taking it to the next level.

1105
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
They were so ubiquitous.

1106
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yeah, and I was, again, I found this really funny.

1107
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So the big one, like the two in the late 80s

1108
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
were Ninja Turtles and the Tim Burton Batman merch were huge.

1109
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And there were articles in like early 1990,

1110
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
just as the Simpsons were taking off, again,

1111
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
about Disney's hoping Dick Tracy products

1112
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
will be the newest hit.

1113
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And there were a ton of them.

1114
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
They were ready.

1115
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It worked on me.

1116
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Same, I have a photo of me with,

1117
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
there was a charity event in my hometown near Boston.

1118
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It was like me and my brother next to Kevin McHale

1119
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
of the Celtics, and I have a Dick Tracy shirt,

1120
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
and I look very sad and pissed off

1121
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
because we were waiting for Larry Bird and he had to go.

1122
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So we only got the second Hall of Famer on the team.

1123
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Kevin McHale.

1124
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Wow, wow.

1125
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
That's, wow, but Dick Tracy.

1126
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah, that really, yeah, they were ready for it.

1127
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
They were like, well, all right,

1128
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
we have watched this phenomenon happen of the Bat logo

1129
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and we are ready for it to come to us.

1130
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Here it is.

1131
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And it wasn't a failure by any of me,

1132
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
but it's just as fast as time goes on.

1133
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Yeah, you don't put that, it's not the big four.

1134
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
No, I don't.

1135
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I don't, it's also funny, like Disney executives

1136
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
watching these dailies with kind of sleepy Warren Beatty

1137
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
as Dick Tracy and going, I don't know if this is it.

1138
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1139
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I have to imagine.

1140
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So it's like they had the plan

1141
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
without even stopping and thinking

1142
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
about what the movie would be.

1143
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah.

1144
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
All right, now let's see.

1145
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
What's that?

1146
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It's like this big, exciting action,

1147
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and then he's kind of mumbling.

1148
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You're like, is this the same thing

1149
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
as Michael Keaton and Jack Nichols?

1150
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I don't know.

1151
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
This all where the marketing for these,

1152
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
the old comic strip, 90s movie adaptations,

1153
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
worked hook, line, and sinker on me,

1154
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
because I loved Dick Tracy.

1155
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
It was like second movie I ever saw in theaters.

1156
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I had the shadow toys.

1157
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I went to 7-Eleven to get the Phantom,

1158
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
the ring with the skull on it

1159
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
that Billy Zane punches people with.

1160
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
They had Phantoms at 7-Eleven?

1161
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I remember the ring being available.

1162
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Wow.

1163
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Did I have the ring too?

1164
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
The ring was available a lot of places,

1165
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
and I'm sure they sold it purple.

1166
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And you saw shadow in the theater?

1167
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
No.

1168
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
No, I never saw it.

1169
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But you had the merch.

1170
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I just had the toys.

1171
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I just thought it was cool.

1172
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
What about The Rocketeer?

1173
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, I love The Rocketeer.

1174
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah, that would fit along.

1175
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah.

1176
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
You were a 40s boy when you were five.

1177
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I was a 40s boy.

1178
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
A big part of that, besides Disney, MGM Studios,

1179
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
was Simpsons reference.

1180
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I would pick up stuff from The Simpsons,

1181
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and sometimes I would just like the parodies

1182
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and the jokes,

1183
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and then sometimes I would hunt down

1184
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
what that was a reference to.

1185
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Sure, sure.

1186
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Sure.

1187
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That actually brings up something

1188
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
that I found really fascinating,

1189
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
because you guys have all worked in comedy,

1190
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and you're trying to reference

1191
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
a lot of different stuff.

1192
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It's like they were trying to reference

1193
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
the works of Diane Arbus

1194
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
and the movie Sorcerer in 1992.

1195
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Oh, yeah, way to Mr. Plow, right?

1196
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That's one I didn't understand

1197
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
until a couple years ago.

1198
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I didn't get that until I saw that

1199
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
at Los Feliz III a couple years ago.

1200
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I was like, oh my God,

1201
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
it's not a cliffhanger reference?

1202
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah, I always thought it was a cliffhanger.

1203
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1204
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Kind of a hard movie to track down,

1205
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
even until a few years ago.

1206
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
They would send PAs to the Warner Brothers archive

1207
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
to get stills of whatever movie,

1208
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
and it's insane to think about

1209
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
in terms of time spent.

1210
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Yeah, yeah, it's crazy now

1211
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
that everything is at our disposal.

1212
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Similarly, I just remember hearing

1213
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
about how for the Saturday TV Fun House,

1214
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
for Robert Smigel to do a parody

1215
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
of the Harlem Globetrotters cartoon from the 70s,

1216
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
you had to sneak a camera

1217
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
into the museum of TV and radio.

1218
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
In fact, that was how committed you had to be,

1219
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and now you could tell AI to do his stuff,

1220
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
which is not better.

1221
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
The love that Smigel had going,

1222
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
it's very evident in that piece,

1223
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
how hard he had to work to get it right.

1224
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
That's what we're going to have to do

1225
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
to find that King Koopa's Cool Cartoon episode

1226
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
that's in an archive at UCLA,

1227
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
because we were given a tip

1228
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
that there is a full episode in there.

1229
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, I forgot that.

1230
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
We're going to sneak a camera in

1231
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
or something and record it.

1232
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
This is lost media, kind of.

1233
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
This is a Saturday morning show.

1234
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Nintendo licensed.

1235
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
This is insane.

1236
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I, of course, did a story

1237
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

1238
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Oh, okay.

1239
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I guess I remember watching,

1240
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
was the intro of the Koopa show available on YouTube?

1241
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Yes, there's clips of it.

1242
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
He's leading a bunch of rowdy kids down this,

1243
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and it's very like,

1244
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
ah, gong, gong, gong, gong, gong.

1245
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Yeah.

1246
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It's so janky, even jankier

1247
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
than the wraparounds for Super Show.

1248
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It was just a bozo show hosted by an angry man

1249
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
playing King Koopa from Mario.

1250
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's starting to come back.

1251
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I think all told, there were six minutes that existed,

1252
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and it's all starting.

1253
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
We have a second gate on this on the Patreon,

1254
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
but then I guess I'll give the big reveal away at the end

1255
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
that we don't believe necessarily.

1256
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Do you remember this?

1257
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That we don't believe.

1258
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Wait, I don't know.

1259
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Well, we were skeptical of the claim,

1260
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
is that Michael Eisner got it canceled.

1261
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh, right, right.

1262
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Oh, I forgot that.

1263
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
He's the one who got it pulled off the air

1264
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
by calling someone and saying he didn't like it.

1265
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah.

1266
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It seems odd.

1267
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Why would he care about a local...

1268
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
It was on a local affiliate that they owned,

1269
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
or that they didn't own.

1270
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I don't know that they owned it.

1271
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
He just thought it was bad.

1272
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah.

1273
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
That's where it was a weird,

1274
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
yeah, there wasn't a lot of detail in there.

1275
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
This is the most name-dropping I'll ever be,

1276
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
but I interviewed Michael Eisner once about...

1277
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh, Jason, make a noise.

1278
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
This is the place to drop that name.

1279
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
...about BoJack Horseman.

1280
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Oh, okay.

1281
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
He was a...

1282
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And Raphael Bob-Wicksburg, the creator,

1283
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
had a funny line to me that he's like...

1284
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It took him a little while to realize that Michael Eisner is just a guy.

1285
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
He has this image of...

1286
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I don't want to hear that.

1287
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah, I know.

1288
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Not us.

1289
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I think he called BoJack maybe the best show he's ever worked on,

1290
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
which is pretty crazy considering all the things he's...

1291
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I mean, better than the show he was on,

1292
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
The Magical World of Disney,

1293
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
where he gave the greatest performances ever given by any performer,

1294
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
with no offense to BoJack.

1295
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
He has to say that.

1296
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
He has to say it.

1297
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It's his current project.

1298
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I didn't ask him about soaring, even though I wanted to.

1299
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1300
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Well, I figured it out.

1301
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
That was a little bit of journalism I did,

1302
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
that it is, in fact, not him.

1303
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Did you see somebody posted on our Reddit,

1304
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Quartzide at the Clippers game, game four?

1305
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Oh.

1306
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Did you see this?

1307
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yes, with...

1308
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Eiger and Eisner together, sitting Quartzide.

1309
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Proof of life.

1310
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
We haven't really...

1311
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
He's getting up there.

1312
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
He's in his 80s.

1313
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
We haven't been sure.

1314
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Right.

1315
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So seeing him at an event was like...

1316
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
He looks great.

1317
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
This is a nice thing.

1318
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

1319
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Some people might be excited to see Jack Nicholson show up at a game,

1320
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
or at SNL 50.

1321
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
We're just like, oh, he's Eisner.

1322
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
He's always there.

1323
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
He's always there.

1324
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Not lately.

1325
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
No, less and less.

1326
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I think it was very...

1327
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
A real rarity that he was at SNL 50.

1328
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah, he's not...

1329
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah.

1330
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So, Alan, here's a question.

1331
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
You've gotten to talk to so many of these brilliant writers from the classic era,

1332
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
and probably the drive for the book was to talk about, you know, the show.

1333
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
That's pretty important is the show and the episodes of the show.

1334
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
But the theme park presence of The Simpsons,

1335
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
how often did this come up or do any of them give a shit at all?

1336
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So, I think it means a lot to them.

1337
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Like, Jeff Martin, the writer,

1338
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,000
remembers going to Simpsons land at Universal when it first opened

1339
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
and seeing, you know, Cletus's chicken shack.

1340
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And he just was dumbfounded because Cletus was his little league coach.

1341
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Oh, Cletus.

1342
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And he came up with that.

1343
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And, you know, I think these guys, and it's mostly guys,

1344
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
have been so successful and done so well that they are not at all bitter.

1345
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1346
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I do think it's an honor to them to have this thing that just, like, lives forever.

1347
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I mean, the story that he also told me was the Dapper Dans, the...

1348
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Disney acapella.

1349
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Yeah, the acapella barbershop quartet.

1350
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
He said people...he talked to those guys at one point.

1351
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm sure there are several groups of them,

1352
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
but people will come up to them and ask to sing...

1353
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
ask them to sing Baby On Board from The Simpsons episode,

1354
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Homer's barbershop quartet.

1355
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And they can't because of some copyright issue, which is really funny.

1356
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Now it probably is not a problem.

1357
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But that's the reach of the show, I think, that I was sort of delighted to learn about

1358
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
and I want people to enjoy.

1359
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Well, yeah, I think you do a good job, from what I've read so far,

1360
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
of, like, just highlighting that the...I think it's the...

1361
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:33,000
like, of course there are, you know, subcultures within fandom of particular...of shows,

1362
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
but it's almost that The Simpsons gets so granular that there's an entire world of stuff around...

1363
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
yes, around that song that people like, around Steamed Hams, around Bortles,

1364
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
but, like, the amount of sub sub subcultures is so insane.

1365
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Like, what other show could...like, one joke out of 500 in an episode

1366
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
have such a, like, this deafening chorus of fandom about just the joke, let alone the show?

1367
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It's like a show with a thousand secret handshakes.

1368
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Like, if someone...

1369
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Oh, yeah.

1370
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
The Bort license plate one is a perfect example, I think,

1371
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and I just don't think that's been replicated at all.

1372
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Well, that's...you talk in the book about not being allowed to watch The Simpsons,

1373
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
and that happened to me, too, but yours was the, like...

1374
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
the go...there's Princess Cashmere, the belly dancer.

1375
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Mine, I went yesterday, I found the episode, and it's in Lisa the Greek,

1376
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
and it's not even the gambling stuff, because there's a big...

1377
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
They kind of predicted, you know, they couldn't have had any idea

1378
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
how much sports gambling is a thing now.

1379
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Oh, without having to call a guy on the phone.

1380
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Without having...

1381
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
You're Barton.

1382
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You're opening an ESPN bets app, which still makes me laugh,

1383
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
because Disney owns that, too, but they don't want any gambling anywhere near Disney parks.

1384
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
But when I was...

1385
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Would you rather? Do you want gambling in the Disney parks?

1386
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I love slot machines.

1387
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
But he wants a penny slot so he can spend about $10.

1388
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And he goes, ah, damn, I'm down 49 cents!

1389
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Cleanest!

1390
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Son of a bitch!

1391
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I almost had nine cleanesses to trigger the bonus.

1392
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Do you want them in the parks? Do you want the slot machines?

1393
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I've said that I believe slot machines will be in Disney parks in the next 25 years.

1394
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
That was my prediction, I think, on the show.

1395
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Yeah, yeah, I believe that. Yeah, yeah.

1396
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But what got me not allowed to watch The Simpsons in Lease of the Greek,

1397
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Bart is melting an army man, a toy soldier, with a magnifying glass,

1398
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
and he says, I'll see you in Hell, soldier boy.

1399
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And my family was watching that, and my mom just turned that right off.

1400
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Just in that mere profanity.

1401
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And that was about first grade, and then come seventh grade,

1402
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
everyone's talking about The Simpsons, because it's on every weekday.

1403
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Like, the best ones are on syndication at that point.

1404
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And I'm like, Mom, I'm old enough to watch The Simpsons,

1405
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
and I'll be a social pariah if I don't watch The Simpsons.

1406
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And that's what I remember from seventh grade,

1407
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
is watching Simpsons trading comic books and doing plays.

1408
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And punching villains with your phantom ring.

1409
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and getting that phantom ring.

1410
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Take that, see?

1411
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I think one thing that's funny to me is,

1412
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I don't think people now realize how edgy that show was considered.

1413
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Oh, yeah.

1414
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Which is hilarious, like, it's on postage stamps now,

1415
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
and it's this institution.

1416
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
And now, I mean, back then, you know,

1417
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
the president of the United States was calling it out on the campaign stump,

1418
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
like, multiple times, so.

1419
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1420
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Oh, more like The Waltons, less like The Simpsons.

1421
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Exactly, yes.

1422
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
That it was even, I feel like, you know,

1423
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Beavis and Butthead probably kind of, like, you know, took the heat.

1424
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Took it up a notch.

1425
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Not long after. Yeah, yeah.

1426
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And then, like, crazy Jackass, whatever, really crazy.

1427
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yeah, but it is strange.

1428
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Oh, yeah, it is, like, a big distance from,

1429
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
that it's a thing that people bring their families to in theme parks

1430
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
when there was a time where both of you, me to some extent,

1431
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I think I had the thing of, like, I think they thought,

1432
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
my parents thought, as good Catholics,

1433
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
maybe we shouldn't let them watch The Simpsons,

1434
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
maybe we should watch it, too, so.

1435
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Which is, what a beautiful thing, what a great, like,

1436
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
that it was, like, they couldn't deny it, even.

1437
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Yeah, my parents, like, gave in very fast.

1438
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I think it took a couple of months, and they were like,

1439
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
all right, this is okay.

1440
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And, you know, it's been a part of my family since then, so.

1441
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1442
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I, it's been nice for me to be exposing my oldest son to it.

1443
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
We watch it, and God knows, there's five,

1444
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
you know, it's just going over his head,

1445
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
but it's really, like, just watching, like,

1446
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
just basic stuff, kind of, just, like, I don't know,

1447
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
the look of a, he just got really fixated on Sideshow Bob,

1448
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
and it really helped him with some ride bravery,

1449
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
because he was avoiding anything that's even,

1450
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
like, was a remotely rocky ride,

1451
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
anything where the lights go down,

1452
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
anything that's, like, 2% a ride.

1453
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
He was becoming his dad in that way.

1454
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
But being able to tell him, this is a ride about Sideshow Bob,

1455
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
it's not even just a Simpsons ride,

1456
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
he would ask for those episodes specifically all the time,

1457
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and it really helped him get, like, you know,

1458
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
the lure of you get to see Sideshow Bob on this thing.

1459
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
That's funny.

1460
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And then it led to a nice thing,

1461
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
and just, like, in terms of these, like,

1462
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
these little subcultures and odd, you know,

1463
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
mini Simpsons experiences,

1464
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
something I, like, I never clocked it

1465
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
until he got interested in Sideshow Bob,

1466
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
but I didn't realize how many people in Universal Studios

1467
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
would be in the Sideshow Bob wigs.

1468
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
You go down the starway,

1469
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
and you're passing by a few at least,

1470
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
and I'd never thought of that as some kind of new mouse ears

1471
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
or anything, and it isn't,

1472
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
but you see more than you think.

1473
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I think because it is a prize in a carnival game,

1474
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
and with a lot of cheating for this five-year-old,

1475
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
who can't exactly pick up a big heavy mallet,

1476
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
we did attain a Sideshow Bob wig for him,

1477
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
and he wears it in the house,

1478
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
and he has so much fun with it.

1479
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Here's maybe the point that I'm driving to,

1480
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
is that, all right, we know that the Simpsons days

1481
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
are numbered at Universal Studios,

1482
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and you think, okay, well, this happens all the time.

1483
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You take a ride out, and you put a new ride in,

1484
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
but the footprint is gonna be so much bigger than,

1485
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
like, something like that, that, like, wow, you look around,

1486
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and there are a lot of these wigs,

1487
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
or there's a lot of people with the Homer donuts

1488
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
or people at our window, like, you know,

1489
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
like, the amount of merchandise, Homer slippers, whatever.

1490
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It feels like, because it's not just the ride,

1491
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
but also, like, the Springfield surrounding area,

1492
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
it is gonna leave such a massive crater

1493
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
that has to be filled by whatever property

1494
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
it ends up being that replaces it.

1495
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
You know what I mean?

1496
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It's a little bit more than just,

1497
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
like, it's more of a seismic change, I think,

1498
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
than just changing up the ride.

1499
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Well, it's not at this level,

1500
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
but you're saying, along the lines of, like,

1501
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
the amount of times you see people in, like,

1502
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
wizard robes now walking around,

1503
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
something like that would just disappear

1504
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
if that presence wasn't there.

1505
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You know that's never gonna happen,

1506
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
but it is, like, I don't know,

1507
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
it's just, like, physical footprint,

1508
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
amount of stores and restaurants.

1509
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
They're, like, to make these change-outs

1510
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
at Hollywood and Orlando

1511
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
is gonna be a pretty major operation, you know?

1512
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yeah, it's gonna be interesting to see,

1513
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
because, yeah, they do have a big, like,

1514
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
food infrastructure, like, situation going on.

1515
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
They're both of them.

1516
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Because they're, I assume,

1517
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I assume they're gonna just replace the restaurant.

1518
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I don't think they're gonna tear everything down.

1519
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
This is based on nothing,

1520
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
so I guess I don't know why I'm saying it.

1521
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Okay, sure.

1522
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
But, I mean, you could,

1523
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I guess you would re-theme, like,

1524
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Cletus's chicken shack to, like,

1525
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Glinda's chicken shack or something,

1526
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
or what a wicked character.

1527
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
What was the chicken before that?

1528
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Was it like Doc Brown's fried chicken?

1529
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yes.

1530
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
It was Doc Brown's.

1531
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Supposedly, it's the same recipe.

1532
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
The same not very good recipe.

1533
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
The same delicious recipe.

1534
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Well, people, it has its fans.

1535
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Oh, come on.

1536
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Like, everything.

1537
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I swear to you, I swear.

1538
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Who?

1539
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
That as opposed to any other theme park fried chicken.

1540
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Well, I don't know.

1541
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I feel like my son wasn't even into the,

1542
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
like, you like chicken tenders, right?

1543
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Can I not have these?

1544
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I gotta ask, does your son know the Sideshow Bob rake gag?

1545
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yes, yes.

1546
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I thought that was the funniest thing in the world

1547
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
is kids Sideshow Bob stepping on all those rakes.

1548
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
No, I know.

1549
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
He's imitated it.

1550
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It's wonderful to see.

1551
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's wonderful to see.

1552
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And we've tried to point out that Stinky Pete in Toy Story 2

1553
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
is the same voice.

1554
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Like, this is the same voice in things that you watch.

1555
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
That's a heady thing for kids to understand.

1556
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
They don't, like, voice actors, they can't.

1557
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
They're barely, like, getting their heads around reality

1558
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
in general.

1559
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Alan, let me ask you this.

1560
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Have you been up to, well, like, okay,

1561
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
we already talked about the ride.

1562
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
We can touch on the ride a little bit.

1563
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
But have you, like, have you been up to

1564
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
The Simpsons stuff at Universal?

1565
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Is there anything you especially,

1566
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
anything you like up there in terms of big experiences

1567
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
or just, like, that little detail is a great thing?

1568
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I like Moe's a lot.

1569
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Yeah.

1570
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Yeah, and the, like, Flaming Moe.

1571
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I mean, it's, you know, it's a little,

1572
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
it's hard to translate the animated world, like,

1573
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
into the real one, but I think they do,

1574
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
they do a really faithful job.

1575
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And I was gonna say, I think, you know,

1576
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
if and when that area closes or changes,

1577
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
like, I do think they'll lose, you know,

1578
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
the, I don't know, 30 to 60-year-old visitors

1579
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
will be less.

1580
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Like, I don't know, like, I feel like people our age

1581
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
maybe go to Universal for The Simpsons.

1582
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'm not sure, though.

1583
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
It's fun, and it's done really well.

1584
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I mean, I remember specifically taking a trip.

1585
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
When Moe's was open, I remember, like,

1586
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
that might have been with you, Mike.

1587
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It was.

1588
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Yeah, right, well, we gotta do,

1589
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
let's get drunk at Moe's is what we'll do.

1590
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
That we ran into Evan Susser coming up

1591
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and doing the same thing.

1592
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And then I think we all just stayed.

1593
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I think we were about to leave,

1594
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
and I think we ran into Evan Susser,

1595
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
and then we all just stayed.

1596
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Wow.

1597
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Well, to have the experience, you know,

1598
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
the glamor, the fun of Moe's,

1599
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
that's kind of a funny thing,

1600
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
is that we would all like, yeah,

1601
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
we get to be in Moe's, the saddest place,

1602
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
the place where people go to get drunk.

1603
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
We have a photo of it.

1604
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Where people frown at each other

1605
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
and don't speak for hours.

1606
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I guess there's times where Moe's is fun.

1607
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Yeah.

1608
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
You know, when Barney wins the contest

1609
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
and gets the Duff Man package,

1610
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
and then he can't participate in it.

1611
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
But mostly, it is just a funny,

1612
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
like, there's so much subversion in The Simpsons,

1613
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and a lot of it does have to go away

1614
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
once you're in a theme park.

1615
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You do have to like, Moe's is just a fun water and hole,

1616
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
where you can grab yourself a great couple of beers.

1617
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It's like, cheers but miserable, you know?

1618
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Yes, yeah, yeah, that is what it is.

1619
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It's tricky because it's not a place that makes,

1620
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
like, it doesn't immediately lend itself

1621
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
to being what a theme park needs

1622
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
for something like that, where it would be like,

1623
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
it needs a lot of seating,

1624
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
it needs, like, to get people in and out.

1625
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Like, Moe's is a place you just kind of want to go in

1626
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
and hang out, but I feel like lately,

1627
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I don't really ever do that.

1628
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I haven't done it in a while.

1629
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Yeah.

1630
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I will grab Duffs.

1631
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Sure.

1632
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Like, whatever they frame as Duffs.

1633
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I don't know if that changes in and out,

1634
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
but I am always satisfied by whatever I...

1635
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's gonna be Glinda's beer now.

1636
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Now, is this, yeah, do you believe

1637
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
that this is becoming, is this a strong theory?

1638
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
You know what, I don't actually think that.

1639
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I have, my guess is that it becomes, like,

1640
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
some sort of, like, English city or French city,

1641
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and that leads you down to the tram loading,

1642
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
which will be Hogwarts Express.

1643
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
That's my theory based on a ton of rumors I've seen.

1644
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Really?

1645
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
So you don't think Pokemon?

1646
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
In Orlando.

1647
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Oh, okay, yeah.

1648
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
That's different.

1649
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Orlando, yes, Pokemon is the rumor.

1650
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Oh, it's not the rumor here?

1651
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
No.

1652
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Really?

1653
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Not enough room.

1654
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Oh, not enough room,

1655
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
because there's gonna be a whole new ride system

1656
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
for Pokemon that's, like, supposedly Scoop style

1657
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
transformed into Spider-Man.

1658
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Oh, so does that mean that in Orlando,

1659
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
the simulator ride that we know that's been back,

1660
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
that building's gone?

1661
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Burned to the ground.

1662
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Or maybe they keep some facade or something,

1663
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
but wow.

1664
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That's the word.

1665
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I mean, that's good, I think,

1666
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
because how many more times are you gonna be able to do...

1667
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah.

1668
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Re-skin it.

1669
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and be, like,

1670
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
it's already a little bit weird.

1671
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
You're in a theme,

1672
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
but you're in a Krusty the Clown carnival.

1673
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Now, go into this weird little room that shakes.

1674
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Be trapped in there and watch a free show video.

1675
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
The only thing that gives me pause with that theory,

1676
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
because then, like, okay,

1677
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
you could make a bunch of, like, I don't know,

1678
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
quick service English Harry Potter food, I guess,

1679
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
in the place of Springfield,

1680
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
and then demolish the ride

1681
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
and put up some cool-looking buildings,

1682
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
and then you go through to the, whatever,

1683
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
the railroad system.

1684
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
The only thing that makes me think, like,

1685
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
maybe that's not it, is the fact that they just dumped

1686
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
a giant Fast and Furious warehouse

1687
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
right at the start of Hogsmeade.

1688
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Yeah.

1689
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So it's not like,

1690
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
because in that way, you'd be like,

1691
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
oh, man, then they can perfectly create

1692
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
a little Harry Potter thing up there.

1693
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah.

1694
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
But there's a big warehouse now dumped

1695
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
right when you enter Hogsmeade,

1696
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
so it's not the end of the world if it's there.

1697
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
That was the only thing that makes me think.

1698
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Well, you could kind of transition monsters,

1699
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
like, universal monsters.

1700
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
You could, but I don't know where you put the big ride.

1701
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah.

1702
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Is the building not big enough?

1703
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
The Simpsons building?

1704
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Not at all, no, no.

1705
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Oh, okay.

1706
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
That's not big at all.

1707
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And you're going off a cliff.

1708
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Yeah.

1709
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
You couldn't build past that.

1710
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
You couldn't really.

1711
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Maybe, I don't know,

1712
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
because they're doing stuff

1713
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
with the sides of the mountains now,

1714
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
so it's possible you can put a little bit all out.

1715
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah.

1716
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Kind of hang it a little bit.

1717
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Yes.

1718
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Universal Hollywood has a unique problem

1719
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
that many theme parks don't.

1720
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Cliffs.

1721
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
There are a lot of cliffs.

1722
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
You've got to deal with the cliffs and the hillside.

1723
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
So I went back through my Instagram,

1724
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
and I found, when they opened Springfield in Orlando,

1725
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
this is me with a Duff Beer in 2014.

1726
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
And that was the first time I had it.

1727
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And the thing that sticks out,

1728
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
because I think the bartender took this picture,

1729
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
because I was like-

1730
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
You were alone.

1731
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I was not alone.

1732
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I was with family.

1733
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
But I was very excited about the bottle.

1734
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
And they're like,

1735
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
they poured out the Duff Beer into a cup,

1736
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
and they're like,

1737
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
you can't, the bottle is glass.

1738
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
We cannot allow you to keep it.

1739
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Yeah.

1740
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
But we can take a picture of you with it,

1741
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
but I need that bottle back.

1742
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And that was before,

1743
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
they're like,

1744
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
maybe we should just put these on tap.

1745
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Oh, okay.

1746
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
That was before they built the Duff Garden,

1747
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
the Beer Garden,

1748
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
which is on both coasts, I believe now.

1749
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That's when you see those,

1750
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
you see the seven Duffs,

1751
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
you get Surly,

1752
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
you get the gang,

1753
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
that's nice to see.

1754
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

1755
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I mean, that's a good,

1756
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
being one of the theme park episodes,

1757
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
that they get some real estate in the-

1758
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah, that's great.

1759
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

1760
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
The Duff Gardens,

1761
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I was shocked to learn that was season four,

1762
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and Itchy and Scratchy Land was season six,

1763
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
so Duff Gardens came first.

1764
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Mm-hmm.

1765
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yeah, I think Itchy and Scratchy Land

1766
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
just kind of dwarfed it

1767
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
in terms of like,

1768
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
yeah, cultural-

1769
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I mean, look, Jason,

1770
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
those of us who watched it from the start knew.

1771
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Yeah, this is what you were missing out on

1772
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
when you were a social pariah.

1773
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Don't, don't even.

1774
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
From episode one,

1775
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
the family, Carl Saffellini,

1776
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
was locked in, okay?

1777
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Don't you dare.

1778
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
My mom still quotes the original episode,

1779
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
but when they got sent us out,

1780
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
but when they got sent us a little helper.

1781
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Yeah.

1782
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
We knew, we knew.

1783
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
But I have to think,

1784
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
there were some Simpsons writers

1785
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
who were from Southern California,

1786
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
and until the 70s,

1787
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
there was Busch Gardens Van Nuys

1788
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
by The Bottling Plant.

1789
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Oh, yeah.

1790
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
So I'm wondering how much of those memories

1791
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
like leaked into that script.

1792
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Yeah.

1793
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Well, that's, yeah,

1794
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
that's why, yeah,

1795
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
they cover different areas.

1796
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
One is more like the local park

1797
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
and the beer-oriented park,

1798
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
and one is the like,

1799
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
insane, scary compound

1800
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
that is itchy and scratchy land.

1801
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Here's a question, I guess.

1802
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It's like, well, first of all,

1803
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
like, okay,

1804
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
so we will maybe miss Moe's,

1805
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
if Moe's goes.

1806
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I mean, I will,

1807
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I'll go do a final Moe's.

1808
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
We all have to do a big final Moe's,

1809
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
if that's what happens.

1810
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Yeah.

1811
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
So we'll miss Moe's.

1812
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Do we miss anything else up there?

1813
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Or do we view that zone as just like,

1814
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
well, it's, you know,

1815
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
it's nice to walk around

1816
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
and see, you know, yeah,

1817
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
reference to Cletus,

1818
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
or here's the, the,

1819
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
the Androids dungeon,

1820
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
or the, you know,

1821
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
like, like,

1822
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
you know,

1823
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
that is a nice, like,

1824
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
that area is a nice chance

1825
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
to, like, see references

1826
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
and recreations of King Toots

1827
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
and whatever,

1828
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
and things that I like.

1829
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Or do we feel like

1830
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
that's had its time

1831
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
and we're, we're good?

1832
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
The Krusty Room

1833
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
is the thing that I will miss.

1834
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
The Krusty...

1835
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Like the Palm style.

1836
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
There's the one special room upstairs

1837
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
that is like the Krusty memorabilia room.

1838
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
It's got the big gabo on the wall.

1839
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Have you been to,

1840
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
have you been to the special room now?

1841
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Oh, yes.

1842
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah, and this is what I've said

1843
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
for many years now.

1844
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
With the caricatures.

1845
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I would buy a gabo like that

1846
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
if they made it.

1847
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
No one has done this.

1848
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Although, um,

1849
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Jack's Pacific is making

1850
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Simpson's stuff

1851
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
and I have the Krusty evil

1852
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Krusty plush doll

1853
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
with the drawstring.

1854
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So maybe we'll get to gabo doll,

1855
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I don't know.

1856
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
But that I will miss.

1857
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Did, is, um, uh,

1858
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
did Krusty buy gabo

1859
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
in a way of, like,

1860
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
owning and crushing his enemies

1861
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
in the way that,

1862
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
uh, like a David Copperfield

1863
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
would, like, buy all of his rivals things

1864
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
and then put them on display?

1865
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Is, is if he vanquished them?

1866
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I think that's probably right.

1867
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
There should be, like,

1868
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
For him to have a gabo,

1869
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
you think, Krusty probably views that

1870
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
as, like, I'll put him in a glass case

1871
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
as if to suffocate him.

1872
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Right, right, right.

1873
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
No, you're probably right.

1874
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I mean, it should be like,

1875
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
he should have, like, at least, like,

1876
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
one, like, punch through his head

1877
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
or something to signify

1878
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
the Krusty.

1879
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Broken teeth.

1880
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Gabo.

1881
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Get some anger out on gabo.

1882
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Gabo, the creation of likely influence

1883
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
by a recurring topic on this show,

1884
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Jerry Mahoney and Knucklehead Smith.

1885
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
These little gestures

1886
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
you're doing to each other,

1887
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
you're so proud.

1888
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And that's it.

1889
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
That's Jerry Mahoney.

1890
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Well, when he makes a good point,

1891
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I have to gesture to him

1892
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
to signify that he's being right.

1893
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
He's being correct.

1894
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Alan, do you know what this is?

1895
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Have you ever heard this reference?

1896
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
You gotta fill me in.

1897
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Oh, okay.

1898
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So you're saying that Jerry Mahoney

1899
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
is not a very common reference.

1900
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I mean, for me, it actually,

1901
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I am surprised that you guys have referenced

1902
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
something that I don't get,

1903
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
because normally I do get the references.

1904
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
You are deep.

1905
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
This is what I'm saying,

1906
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
that even for a deep-cut pop culture person,

1907
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
the Jerry Mahoney is not something people are saying

1908
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
all the time.

1909
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
We're trying to educate people.

1910
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
We're trying to make this more known,

1911
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
because the great Paul Winchell,

1912
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
who did Tigger's Voice, of course,

1913
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
had two ventriloquist dummies

1914
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
that were very famous.

1915
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
One more famous than the other

1916
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
named Jerry Mahoney.

1917
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
What happened?

1918
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Why were?

1919
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Why not today?

1920
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Well, some kids just don't appreciate

1921
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
sort of the finer comedy of yesteryear.

1922
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
That's what I would say.

1923
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Comedy that you yourself played on the show,

1924
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
that all of us just stared at,

1925
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
all of us just glared at in silence, even you.

1926
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
That's true.

1927
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Well, maybe it wasn't the best clip for a podcast.

1928
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
But you can appreciate...

1929
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
We stepped into a long-running argument.

1930
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
You can...

1931
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I mean, the argument is settled,

1932
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
as far as I'm concerned.

1933
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
As soon as we talked about it,

1934
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
we met, someone sent us,

1935
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
like right after we recorded,

1936
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
or the episode came out,

1937
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
you sent me a text to a video clip

1938
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
and said, shit.

1939
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Oh, right, right, right, right.

1940
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And it was Paul Winchell and his dummies

1941
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
on The Lucy Show.

1942
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And Lucy Ball, like, flirts with Knucklehead Smith.

1943
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
But these were dummies

1944
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
that also people were behind them

1945
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
with, like, human arms.

1946
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So it is, granted, a little unsettling, but...

1947
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Why the shit?

1948
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
What do you mean, shit?

1949
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Like, we missed it.

1950
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
We missed him.

1951
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
We should've brought it up.

1952
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
We should've talked about it on the show.

1953
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
It's behind the paywall.

1954
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
You gotta pay us to get that good content, folks.

1955
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

1956
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
This is like the Podcast the Ride 4D experience,

1957
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
and I'm loving it.

1958
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Like, the Podcast the Ride.

1959
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Genuine argument about Lucy and puppets break out.

1960
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It really does happen.

1961
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I think you were working at the time,

1962
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
but for Mike's birthday,

1963
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I did get him an 8 by 10

1964
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
of Jerry Mahoney and Knucklehead Smith

1965
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
and Paul Winchell, and I framed it.

1966
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Yes, he did do that.

1967
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Congratulations.

1968
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And now you feel like your life is complete?

1969
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Complete? No.

1970
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Not until all the children of the world

1971
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
know about these two glorious dummies.

1972
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
He needs more cursed objects in his home.

1973
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Yeah.

1974
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Look, I just want that Gabbo that's up at Universal.

1975
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
We should try to steal it before...

1976
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
You want that Gabbo?

1977
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
You have to have that one?

1978
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Well, I don't have to, but I'm saying...

1979
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I don't think you're gonna get it, unfortunately.

1980
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I think that's owned by Universal Studios.

1981
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Of course it is.

1982
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Well, maybe it's owned by Disney, technically.

1983
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I don't know, at this point,

1984
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
what the ownership situation is.

1985
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
But that's gonna go away.

1986
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I don't know that I missed the upstairs eating area

1987
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
of Cletus's Chicken Shack.

1988
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
No offense to it.

1989
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Okay, sure, sure.

1990
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It's like a spider pig, but I'm not...

1991
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
That upstairs room, though, is...

1992
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I watched this video,

1993
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
and I don't think I had even clocked this,

1994
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
that this upstairs secret room

1995
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
has become a place for Simpsons artists

1996
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
to draw characters, and they're allowed to sign it

1997
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
in a way where most Simpsons art out there

1998
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
is signed by Matt Groening alone.

1999
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
But it's become this weird secret museum

2000
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
where somebody can draw Troy McClure

2001
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
or whatever it is, and they get the credit for it.

2002
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Yeah.

2003
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
So that's a neat thing,

2004
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
that it's become this organic...

2005
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Is it still the artists go up there

2006
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
and just like, all right, I'm gonna draw a character?

2007
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
That's a good question.

2008
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I would save that room over Moe's,

2009
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
no offense to Moe's,

2010
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
but I think that's the coolest room of all of it.

2011
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I won't miss the Krusty Burger.

2012
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I haven't eaten a Krusty Burger in many years.

2013
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Okay, if I find myself up there,

2014
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
and I really want chicken fingers or a burger,

2015
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I feel like, for whatever reason,

2016
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
surrounded by all the Simpsons stuff in my mind,

2017
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
it's just like, ah, this is better quality

2018
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
than the fake American graffiti Mel's Diner

2019
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
that has made me ill multiple times.

2020
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Is it?

2021
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I don't know.

2022
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Well, if it hasn't made you ill,

2023
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
then that implies that it's better.

2024
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But yeah, it is not.

2025
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It is not a thing.

2026
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
It's the same.

2027
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Yeah, I watched my son who eats,

2028
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
that eats any garbage burger or chicken.

2029
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I feel like he was underwhelmed by the burger

2030
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
and the chicken fingers.

2031
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
It is like the Simpsons joke

2032
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
where they sphere gray meat,

2033
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
and it's just from the same vat,

2034
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
and it goes to different restaurants.

2035
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Yes, yeah, yeah.

2036
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
The food jokes on that show, it's wild.

2037
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
There's a reference to the Good Morning Burger.

2038
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's 18 ounces of ground beef soaked in butter.

2039
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
But that sounds like something Guy Fieri would have now.

2040
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
It's a different world.

2041
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Yes, now that would be an upscale food challenge situation.

2042
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Also, the way writers talk about the lunch breaks

2043
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
being their savior in these incredibly long days,

2044
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
sometimes when they talk about what they were ordering

2045
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
or eating, it's disgusting.

2046
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's so gnarly.

2047
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Yeah, I think Oakley's word was aggressive or vindictive.

2048
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
They would order caviar spreads,

2049
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
which is a joke from The Simpsons,

2050
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
the American excess or whatever.

2051
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
That seems like it happened a lot

2052
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
where they would joke about something

2053
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
or satirize something on The Simpsons,

2054
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
but then people would adopt it at face level.

2055
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
They didn't intend to give Bart so many catchphrases,

2056
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
but kids repeat stuff they hear on TV.

2057
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Sure.

2058
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Yeah, the writers would say that it was like Sam Simon

2059
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
being like, well, these are things Bart hears on TV,

2060
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
so he's just repeating them, and it's a bit.

2061
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And then you think about it though,

2062
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
and it's like, well, we don't see Bart picking that up on the show.

2063
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
No, we don't.

2064
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
But at 7, I just see Simpsons merch everywhere

2065
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
saying, don't have a cow man underneath my shorts.

2066
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Were you saying it even though you weren't watching it?

2067
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I wasn't really saying it.

2068
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
But you were saying not the mama.

2069
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I was saying not the mama, yeah.

2070
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
But you were watching it.

2071
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
So I was repeating, yeah, so I was repeating.

2072
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Yeah, which it's funny because in terms of,

2073
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
oh, I can't let my kids see this,

2074
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
it's like, well, Simpsons was a little more thoughtful

2075
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
than dinosaurs.

2076
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
How so?

2077
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
What was the problem with dinosaurs?

2078
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
What do you mean?

2079
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Well, no, it was just kind of like a B sitcom.

2080
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Oh, sure.

2081
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Like Simpsons is a better show, you're saying.

2082
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Yeah, Simpsons was a better show,

2083
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
but I don't think my parents picked up,

2084
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
like, oh, it's all these Harvard nerds, Harvard books.

2085
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
You should have told them about the Harvard connection.

2086
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I didn't know about that until I was much older.

2087
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Do you know, can I tell you about where the writers were educated?

2088
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Mom and dad.

2089
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Dad, you like Letterman?

2090
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
A bunch of these people came from Letterman.

2091
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
You're five years old.

2092
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I wish.

2093
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I was.

2094
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
This was a pre-IMDB era.

2095
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I don't know how you were going to find that out.

2096
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Well, you just had to have a giant phone book size,

2097
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
like history of movie, like movie reference books.

2098
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Oh, I remember stuff like that.

2099
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Yeah, here's a big book that just lists every movie who's in it.

2100
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Yeah, you did need stuff like that.

2101
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
We had a couple of those.

2102
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2103
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I had a lot of them.

2104
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Roger Ebert's Guide to the Movies,

2105
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
we had one or two of those.

2106
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I had a lot of those for comic books,

2107
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
which as soon as that book came out,

2108
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
it was immediately out of date

2109
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
because he just kept publishing more comic books.

2110
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

2111
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
It only goes up to a certain time.

2112
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Okay, let me ask this.

2113
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Also, this like Simpsons inflection point that we're at.

2114
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
If we lose it, Universal Studios,

2115
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
if we no longer have a Simpsons presence in those parks,

2116
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
now the ownership is with Disney,

2117
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
and this is why it probably needs to go away

2118
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
because we're at the two corporate umbrellas that get along the least.

2119
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Disney has done polling about

2120
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
would you like to see Simpsons characters in the Disney parks?

2121
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Would you like experiences, rides, attractions?

2122
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
So there is the possibility

2123
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,000
that Disney does a second round of Simpsons stuff.

2124
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I guess two questions here.

2125
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
One, do we think this will happen?

2126
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Two, would we want this to happen?

2127
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Feelings either way, Alan?

2128
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I think, well, I know I'm going to throw it back to you guys,

2129
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:31,000
but first of all, could Disney deal with the mild subversion of the Simpsons?

2130
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
What's the closest property they have in the parks to that sort of theming?

2131
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Muppets, which is going away.

2132
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Deadpool.

2133
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, true.

2134
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
He did a little show where he was subversive.

2135
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Yes, but they have not invested in a subversive or offensive permanent Deadpool attraction.

2136
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
That is a very good question to bring up.

2137
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I mean, I would love to see a ride.

2138
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I mean, it's funny, I, of course, did my homework about this.

2139
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
My best friend, he is an 11-year-old,

2140
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
and I kind of polled him, like, what kind of Simpsons ride would you like to see?

2141
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And he said, like, a roller coaster that's, like, escaped from Burns Manor or something like that.

2142
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
But see, my pitch would be, and this is sort of inspired by going to Disney World,

2143
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:21,000
like some sort of, it's like Guardians of the Galaxy and Tron both sort of inspired this idea.

2144
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Oh, great, yes, they're good ones.

2145
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Basically, you're, like, on a skateboard like Bart.

2146
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
So, from the perspective of Bart, I don't know how you would do that in a, like,

2147
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I was thinking of, like, the Tron light cycle or something like that, but, like, something to recreate the idea of being.

2148
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You have less support, but maybe there is something that you could sort of, like, position yourself on.

2149
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
A skateboarding simulator ride is a diff, that's, like, that's its own good idea, even, regardless of Simpsons.

2150
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Right, but almost like a coaster simul-, like, a combo.

2151
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And so, the opening credits of the show is about a minute long, and it's full form.

2152
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:58,000
So, basically, you would be Bart going through, like, the ride through Springfield or something like that.

2153
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
That would be my ideal.

2154
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Going out the window. Yes.

2155
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
There's a different chalkboard gag on a screen every time you ride.

2156
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
They change out a zillion.

2157
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And it didn't, it doesn't have to be the exact path of the credits, but, like, that would, like, you start with the clouds opening and,

2158
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
that would be, like, the best ride.

2159
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
That would be, like, the best ride.

2160
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:21,000
And I do think a, some sort of movie or, like, Muppets-like presentation would be really cool.

2161
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Like, I don't know, the Simpsons characters in the Disney park and, like, a 15-minute movie.

2162
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
So, those are my pictures, yeah.

2163
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Wow, opening sequence, yeah, yeah.

2164
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And, and I would, I would require that they stick with all of the very season one stuff in it.

2165
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:42,000
That he, like, that it's, you're Bart and you narrowly miss Jacques, the, uh, Marge.

2166
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Is that the bowling?

2167
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Yes, yeah, the bowling.

2168
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Yeah, Albert Brooks.

2169
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
The Albert Brooks bowling structure.

2170
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2171
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Uh, uh, uh, or the, who's the, like, who's the belly dancer?

2172
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Princess Cashmere.

2173
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
That was the, that's the, that's why you couldn't watch it.

2174
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Yeah, for, for a while.

2175
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Because of Princess Cashmere.

2176
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:03,000
She is kind of, like, uh, became, like, a Simpsons, like, side, or, like, Blinky, the three-eyed fish,

2177
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:10,000
where after the episodes that directly address them, they just kind of are in the periphery of all the characters.

2178
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
They're not around as much.

2179
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
But never do anything again.

2180
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Yes.

2181
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Marvin Monroe.

2182
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Sometimes you'll see Mindy.

2183
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2184
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Now, it's been 36 seasons.

2185
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Maybe Blinky and Princess Cashmere get their own arcs.

2186
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,000
If you told me that there were 15 episodes about Princess Cashmere at this point, I would be like, oh, yeah, probably.

2187
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Yes, yeah, yeah.

2188
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,000
No, I, I, I assume that by the, you know, I, yeah, I'm just not as versed in, you know, the recent seasons,

2189
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
by which I mean the last, uh, 22 years.

2190
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,000
So, yeah, I, no, I assume that every single marriage combo has occurred.

2191
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Has been tried, yeah.

2192
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

2193
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Well, that's what happened, like, the X-Men and stuff.

2194
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Well, like, Wolverine's with Storm now, and you're like, okay, let's see how that works.

2195
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Yeah, they had tension over the years.

2196
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Sure.

2197
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Well, they all did.

2198
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Yeah, they all did.

2199
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Well, the X-Men, especially.

2200
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
But, uh, yeah.

2201
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I had tension with all the X-Women, too, when I was growing up.

2202
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Well, sure.

2203
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
One-sided tension.

2204
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Yeah.

2205
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Uh, the, um, oh, God, I forgot what I was going to say.

2206
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I threw Jason off.

2207
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I threw Jason off.

2208
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Which X-Women was popping in your head that distracted you?

2209
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Well, like, when I was a kid.

2210
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Who was it?

2211
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Was it Jubilee?

2212
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
No, Jubilee was my, like, friend.

2213
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Okay.

2214
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Like, Jubilee and I were just friends.

2215
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Who was it?

2216
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
No, Psylocke was too ridiculous.

2217
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Jean Grey.

2218
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Maybe Jean.

2219
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Jean or Rogue.

2220
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Rogue got that cool jacket.

2221
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Mine was Rogue.

2222
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Yeah.

2223
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
That's, that's definitive.

2224
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Anyway, you got your back on track?

2225
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Yeah, I stayed with the Simpsons, like, into high school.

2226
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Like, a lot of people capped a lot earlier, but I think, like, the behind the laughter,

2227
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
like, that could have ended there.

2228
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Like, it's season 10 or 11.

2229
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Behind the laughter's, like, yeah, yeah.

2230
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yeah, there's some good stuff in there.

2231
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I think you got some spotty stuff on the way to behind the laughter, for sure.

2232
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Sure.

2233
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Yeah.

2234
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I think the Poochie episode would have been an amazing finale.

2235
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Oh, yeah.

2236
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I think it's just, like, a good capper of, like, what, you know, basically the fans fighting

2237
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
back.

2238
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I ruined my, in high school, I ruined my guide to our favorite family, the big book, the

2239
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Simpsons episode guide, because we were, I was in a class where we were doing screen

2240
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:17,000
printing, and we projected an image up on the wall, and then you had to trace it on

2241
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,000
paper, and then you cut it out with X-Acto knife and screen print it over that.

2242
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And the heat of that overhead projector killed the glue that held the book together.

2243
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
So it is, I still have it.

2244
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Did you keep putting it on there to trace different characters?

2245
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Well, and then I tried to screen print Poochie.

2246
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Easier said than done, he's got a very complicated plaid shirt on.

2247
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Oh, okay, okay.

2248
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
It takes a while to draw those lines.

2249
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And then I, the next section, I just did the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the little

2250
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
circular guy that used to be on the book covers.

2251
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Yeah, much easier.

2252
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I'm making a googly eye face, so much simpler after the Poochie debacle.

2253
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I was going to say, as far as rides are concerned, like we've talked a little bit about this

2254
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
before, like there's other stuff that I think is a higher priority than getting the

2255
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Simpsons into the Disney parks.

2256
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I'm not going to be mad if they do it.

2257
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Yeah, that's my, you know, this question came up in a second game mailbag episode, and

2258
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
we were both like, I guess so, but I feel like with Disney, I'm like, well, as long

2259
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
as you get to like 13 other things, but if Disney's only going to do every like a couple

2260
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
things, should one of them be Simpsons?

2261
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I don't know.

2262
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Is that like, is that a weird thing to, do I seem like a Fairweather fan?

2263
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I know, I feel bad saying it like that too, because I don't know that I'm, like the thing

2264
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I would want is some sort of like kind of retro ride, which is something we kind of,

2265
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I don't know if we've touched on this lately, where I've been thinking like, it would be

2266
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,000
fun if Disney built like a Mr. Toad ride in this day and age.

2267
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And I mean that by like a small ride.

2268
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Yeah.

2269
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Like something that is not even like, cause they even build like a new dark ride and it's

2270
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Ariel's undersea, which was a big ride compared to the old Fantasyland dark rides.

2271
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
They don't truly do little dinky rides anymore.

2272
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
That's true.

2273
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And I guess like if they built something new and then they advertise that people might be

2274
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
upset by that, like that's maybe their thinking is that like, you can't do that anymore.

2275
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
It would be a let down, like too minor of an attraction.

2276
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Right.

2277
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I feel like the Ratatouille ride might be an interesting model for it.

2278
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

2279
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Like in and out of a physical space.

2280
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Yeah.

2281
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Some is practical.

2282
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
It's not, it doesn't necessarily have to be super scary or have a lot of thrills, but

2283
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
immersive.

2284
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

2285
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
But like fun and wild, quote unquote.

2286
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Where were you going somewhere specific?

2287
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,000
A little, well I have my, I have a pitch for it that will never be made is that like you

2288
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
do, it's like the size of Mr. Toad or Pinocchio or, or what, whatever.

2289
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
And it's basically just robots and it's small.

2290
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,000
And it's based on one of my favorite as a kid, Simpsons video games, which is funny because

2291
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
all the Simpsons video games were like about the Simpsons beating people up, which is

2292
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
hilarious.

2293
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

2294
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Marge assaulting people with a vacuum cleaner.

2295
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Right.

2296
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
With a big heavy old vacuum cleaner.

2297
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
And the Nintendo game, which I played was Bart versus the Space Mutants.

2298
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It was Bart fighting aliens.

2299
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Bart.

2300
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Bart or Bartman?

2301
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Bart.

2302
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
There was Bartman in different, oh maybe you turned into Bartman in that one.

2303
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I forget which one.

2304
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Yeah, you might have done both.

2305
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Or was it El Barto?

2306
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
That's the thing I think is funny.

2307
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I was just watching, I was watching like a walk through the places I haven't been in

2308
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Universal Florida, Springfield.

2309
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I was like, it's funny that they, El Barto really looms large.

2310
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I'm like, has there ever been like anything like big with El Barto on the show?

2311
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It's just what he writes on walls and it's, it's just his graffiti.

2312
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

2313
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
But I feel like theme parks end up, and you know what we'll do is we'll have El Barto

2314
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
everywhere.

2315
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I'm like, that feels like a season one not relevant thing.

2316
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Did not catch on.

2317
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It's like set dressing, like Blinky the Three-Eyed Fish.

2318
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Oh, sure.

2319
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
You know?

2320
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
The nod to the roots.

2321
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
But like yeah, Bart, you remember this at all?

2322
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Did you just play this?

2323
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Yes, I do.

2324
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
It was punishingly difficult.

2325
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Oh, it was very hard.

2326
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Yes, very, very hard.

2327
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
It was very hard.

2328
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
But more fun, and I see people talking about like, they need to put this out or they need

2329
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
to remaster it.

2330
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Simpson's Road Rage?

2331
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Road Rash?

2332
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
That's later.

2333
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It's later.

2334
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Yeah, it was in like high school.

2335
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
But it's like one game, I think.

2336
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Grand Theft Auto, essentially in Springfield.

2337
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Might be a good ride.

2338
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Might be a good ride too.

2339
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
But I would pitch as a tiny little dark ride with a bunch of robots where like Bart and

2340
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
aliens have invaded Springfield and it's just static figures basically.

2341
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
And you're going through in a little Simpsons car and you're coming, the stuff is coming

2342
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
and you have Kang and Kodos can be there too or whatever.

2343
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
But it could be more themed to the actual show.

2344
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
You see Lenny and Carl.

2345
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
You see Snake and Pony.

2346
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

2347
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
So like just a little dark ride and like Moe's with a beer garden seems like, oh, that might

2348
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
not be so expensive.

2349
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
You could put that in Hollywood Studios somewhere and you got a little Simpsons there.

2350
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I like a little modest, fun little, not high pressure.

2351
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Right.

2352
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
There's merchandise there because Simpsons will never stop.

2353
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So you may as well sell Simpsons merch forever, I guess.

2354
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Something smallish but still has a fun little ride.

2355
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
That's an interesting, I see a unique way to do it.

2356
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
You know, I was thinking in terms of what could they do that they haven't already done

2357
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
and that the original Simpsons ride does not already accomplish.

2358
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And I feel like, I think you would have to get the Shearer characters.

2359
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,000
That's like the only way that they can, because I was watching some video last night where

2360
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
somebody said, so why don't any of his characters like Burns and Smithers appear?

2361
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Well, it turns out he was unavailable for the recording.

2362
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
And I'm like, you poor, you blindly optimistic vlogger.

2363
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
You don't know what's happening here.

2364
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Wait, is that what, the reality is probably just he didn't want to do it.

2365
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
The reality is he hates the show and doesn't want to participate any more than he could

2366
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,000
step away from Lay Show for a minute to record some voice.

2367
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Must have recorded and set up his whole busy building more floors in his home from Simpsons.

2368
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2369
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Proceeds.

2370
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
While being extremely furious at what funded the floors.

2371
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
No, but I think Disney would have to shell out.

2372
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And you would have, because like, I was like, okay, you know, yeah, we go to Moe's.

2373
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
We go to Krusty Burger.

2374
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
You go to so many places on the ride.

2375
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
The place that is not really represented is the power plant.

2376
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
And then in tandem with that, you're, wait, your niece or nephew.

2377
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I forget who you asked about.

2378
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Oh, yeah, my nephew, my friend's son.

2379
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Yes, yeah.

2380
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So that also Burns Manor is definitely, I think, to like do something with a big Burns presence,

2381
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
because those are like, those are grand spaces, scary spaces.

2382
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
And it's like a very easy sort of Disney good versus evil scenario.

2383
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Yes, absolutely.

2384
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And you can kind of put any ridiculous thing in Burns Manor, and it would make sense.

2385
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Yes, well, he has like a thousand rooms full of nonsense.

2386
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Yeah.

2387
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

2388
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
So behind any door could be any craziness.

2389
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:11,000
If there was something that could like take you from, I don't know, like Homer causes a meltdown

2390
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:18,000
and you experience it in real time and have to escape, you know, like there truly is like giant plutonium,

2391
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
you know, the kind of thing that makes the whole plant grow, glow green or whatever.

2392
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Yeah.

2393
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And you have to, you've only got seconds to escape.

2394
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Which kind of tangentially happens on the ride, but it's not no Burns or Smithers.

2395
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yeah.

2396
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
It's subbed in for, Krusty is subbed in, Krusty and company is subbed in.

2397
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Oh, as kind of as the corrupt businessman.

2398
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah.

2399
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:52,000
But yeah, I mean, I think getting to see like, and physically Bill to be in a queue of big, scary, Gothic, imposing Burns space.

2400
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And I also want animatronics.

2401
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I think that is the only way to justify doing new Simpsons because we've already done, we've done screen ride and it makes sense.

2402
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
It's an animated show. You do screen ride.

2403
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:11,000
But getting to see like physical eyes, like a Mr. Burns physically in the room.

2404
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Yeah.

2405
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Taking you to task, throwing stuff at you, throwing items, throwing paperweights in your face.

2406
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I think that that'd be the thing.

2407
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
They're going to look weird, though.

2408
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Yes.

2409
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
They just will have to, there's just for whatever reason, it's really hard.

2410
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I mean, the closest I've seen actually is this company, Super Seven, which makes Simpsons.

2411
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I don't make them now because of Disney, they lost the rights.

2412
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:42,000
But they made these Simpsons, Super Seven toys that are the closest I've seen to 3D Simpsons looking good.

2413
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
But I just like, oh, like anytime you ever see the like 3D Simpsons, it's always odd.

2414
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
It is, yeah. But I'll tolerate.

2415
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I'm for it. I'm for it.

2416
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I just want to know what they would do.

2417
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Don't get me wrong, I'm for it.

2418
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I just want to round a corner in a physicalized.

2419
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Yeah, they're always scary as mascots.

2420
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
They're so scary.

2421
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
They're weird in the park.

2422
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,000
They're as weird in the parks as they were on the ice capades 35 years ago.

2423
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It's just, yeah, it's strange.

2424
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I'm imagining like the Yeti in the Expedition Everest coaster.

2425
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
It's like Mr. Burns looming.

2426
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Oh, that would be nice, yeah.

2427
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Oh, that'd be awesome.

2428
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

2429
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Are there giant characters?

2430
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I mean, like a sci-fi, I mean, you were like, you were like a huge king in CODIS.

2431
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Huge king in CODIS, yeah.

2432
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
And they have, obviously they have that spinner in Orlando.

2433
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Alan, I'll shout out, mention in your book again, because again, I really enjoy this.

2434
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:37,000
But the mention of Homer fantasizing about if he wins the lottery.

2435
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And his fantasy is he is giant and covered in jewels.

2436
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And gold too, right?

2437
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And gold, and that's such a weird joke.

2438
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:50,000
And then years later, I feel like there's a different Homer fantasizing about coming into money

2439
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:58,000
where he's sitting on the porch of a solid gold house and twirling a revolver and marches in a bikini go-go dancing next to him.

2440
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Yeah, if he robs the Kwik-E-Mart, I think is the, oh yes, that's the life.

2441
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,000
But the writer, I think the Homer growing and being jewel-encrusted was a Swartz Welder joke.

2442
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
And another writer was like, it doesn't make sense.

2443
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Like, why would being rich make you grow?

2444
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Like, why would it make you grow?

2445
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
But doesn't Lenny kind of get those?

2446
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And I think that they love that Swartz Welder would come up with these jokes that were like, they made sense, but they made all the sense.

2447
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
They made no sense, but somehow made all the sense in the world.

2448
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Some operation you could get, presumably with all the money in the world, there's something that could widen your bones while keeping your same physical structure.

2449
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
He doesn't want hair.

2450
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
That's not part of the equation.

2451
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
He will still remain bald, a much easier surgery to get.

2452
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
He just wants to be giant and gold.

2453
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I've read a couple of his books, Swartz Welder's books, and it is a thing where I need to take a break when I'm reading, because it's joke after joke after joke.

2454
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
And they're all good.

2455
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
You're laughing so loud, you start concerning your neighbors.

2456
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I'm concerning my neighbors, but they're all so funny.

2457
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
And he is, I mean, he's the best kind of weird.

2458
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:17,000
There's like one profile of him in The New Yorker from 2021, and I feel like all of my comedy group chats that day were like,

2459
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Swartz Welder, Mike Saks piece, The New Yorker, it's so long, because he's such a recluse.

2460
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Yeah, and that interview was done over email.

2461
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
So what was crazy about it is if you read it, it's like you're reading a Simpsons episode.

2462
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
It's his voice. It's crazy.

2463
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:39,000
He sort of crafts these answers that are in ways that you can't really do if you're just speaking it.

2464
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Oh, like it's hyper written.

2465
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Yes, exactly.

2466
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
But in a good way.

2467
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
That's cool.

2468
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I bet he knows who Jerry Mahoney is.

2469
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Oh, I absolutely bet he does.

2470
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
100%.

2471
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Very well, then that's the key to being relevant today.

2472
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,000
He doesn't do a lot of interviews, but could we get Swartz Welder on to talk about Jerry Mahoney?

2473
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Does Swartz Welder know the pandemic happened?

2474
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I would hope so.

2475
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I feel like I always just hear like, yeah, he's just in a house in the Hollywood Hills smoking in the diner booth he bought.

2476
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I think it's funny because some of the writers said they wouldn't call him a recluse.

2477
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
They would just call him someone who doesn't do interviews.

2478
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
But then George Meyer was like, it's OK, he's a recluse.

2479
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:26,000
But I think he loves baseball and will rent out Safeco Field in Seattle to play games.

2480
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It's crazy.

2481
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Perfect story.

2482
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Well, God, anything we've missed on the way out the door here?

2483
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I mean, another like, all right.

2484
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:46,000
If the modern Disney company, if they really they want to have Simpsons representation, but they truly don't have the money to do it, which feels very current Disney.

2485
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I would settle for of all the part of any like anything theme park you to recreate on the newly in a theme park, Homerland.

2486
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I would I would happily take Homerland, which is, of course, when he buys a trampoline and then flashes to an expanded operation with the trampoline as the base.

2487
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:11,000
But that also includes Muckville, USA, which is just a bunch of mud and then Fort Adventure.

2488
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
It's a bunch of soil mattresses.

2489
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,000
If there is a perfect kids play zone of Homerland.

2490
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Yeah.

2491
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
With the same with that graphic design and that did smell.

2492
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I think I would accept that.

2493
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
And I actually I think my son would be crawling around there all the time.

2494
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I you could leave your son at Homerland and then all the millennial parents are by the photo op by the barbecue grill that Homer did not successfully build in that one of us.

2495
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Oh, yeah.

2496
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I have real.

2497
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I just had a thought.

2498
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Sorry.

2499
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:49,000
This is a different idea to get Simpsons in Hollywood Studios is that we canceled that Muppets rock and roller coaster thing.

2500
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
While you're trying to get rid of that anyway.

2501
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I'm trying to get rid of that.

2502
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I'm still going to try until it's gone.

2503
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Mm hmm.

2504
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
But we replace Aerosmith with Simpsons Aerosmith.

2505
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
The Simpsons version of Aerosmith.

2506
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
This you will allow.

2507
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
That keeps.

2508
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Yes.

2509
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Yeah.

2510
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
The Flamin' Mo Coaster.

2511
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Well, it'll still.

2512
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Well, it's still called Rock and Roller Coaster featuring Aerosmith, but they just look like the Simpsons versions of themselves.

2513
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
So it's the same.

2514
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Alan with a pitch that's fun.

2515
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And you're like, no, no, because I need Aerosmith to be in the title.

2516
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Let's not go crazy here.

2517
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I'm so sorry.

2518
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I'm in the zone and I'm so creative right now.

2519
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I respect it.

2520
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
The man loves Aerosmith.

2521
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
What can I say?

2522
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
But yeah, there'll be some other Simpsons references in the rock and roller coaster at that point.

2523
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Simpsons, David Wayne, Simpsons.

2524
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Who plays their manager?

2525
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Simpsons Camerino is what you're talking about.

2526
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Oh, yes.

2527
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Simpsons Camerino.

2528
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Sorry.

2529
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
There's a dozen people.

2530
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Ileana Douglas.

2531
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Simpsons, Simpsons.

2532
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Simpsons, the Ileana Douglas.

2533
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
If she hasn't been already.

2534
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Just get them all.

2535
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
I assume there was a full state reunion on there.

2536
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
With zillions of episodes, that must have happened.

2537
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
But a lot cheaper than whatever this Muppets thing they're doing is.

2538
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
It's a lot cheaper.

2539
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
It's a lot cheaper.

2540
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
So to have them do their iconic performance of their animated performance of Walk This

2541
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Way where Mo joins them, you would accept this?

2542
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Would you let Mo be in there or is that a little too much too?

2543
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
When you said it, I kind of winced.

2544
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I just prefer they keep the tracks the way they are.

2545
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
And it just still reads the same because it's Aerosmith.

2546
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Would you want it to be like the show where they are animated into it with their manager

2547
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,000
at the time, which was part of the deal of them being in the show?

2548
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Do you know about that?

2549
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
It cuts to them at a booth at Mo's and then there's some guy.

2550
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Why is he there?

2551
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
I think they initially turned down a different episode because they didn't think it was cool

2552
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
enough, Aerosmith, and now they're on a roller coaster at MGM.

2553
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Or, I'm sorry, Hollywood Studios.

2554
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Wow, that dated me.

2555
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
No, no, no.

2556
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I will never stop calling it Disney MGM Studios.

2557
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
We're cut from the same cloth.

2558
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I could not have predicted as a child that now when I was saying MGM, it would be Jamie

2559
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Foxx telling me all about Bet MGM.

2560
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
You know all the bet apps.

2561
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I know all the bet.

2562
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I know all the commercials.

2563
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,000
He's getting ready to be on that and be putting up those 40 cents a day.

2564
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
That's how much he wants to hit the gambling bricks.

2565
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
You can do the gambling casino from Springfield in Hollywood Studios.

2566
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
That is true.

2567
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
When Marge has a big leak problem.

2568
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Yeah, the Burns casino.

2569
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Well, there's another massive scary mystery.

2570
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Yeah, okay.

2571
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
We can do that.

2572
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I want all the Burns stuff.

2573
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
You could flip the Hollywood Studios Brown Derby to the Simpsons fancy restaurant pretty

2574
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
easy.

2575
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Oh, that's true.

2576
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
The Gilded Truffle.

2577
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Sure, yeah.

2578
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
The Gilded Truffle.

2579
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Yeah.

2580
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:49,000
But my pitch is very doable and less fun, but you would do a Simpsons after hours event.

2581
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Photo opportunities, all the songs in the Key of Springfield.

2582
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Well, you're speaking Disney's language.

2583
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Walk around characters.

2584
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Exactly what it would be.

2585
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
So it's $180?

2586
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Yeah.

2587
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
That is data collection to save people like it.

2588
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:07,000
It's like live, real-time data collection to see if people would accept it, you know?

2589
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
What is?

2590
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
You mean to get it something more permanent?

2591
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Is that what you're saying?

2592
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Yeah, to see like, is there still enough interest?

2593
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Have our shorts where like Maggie meets Baby Yoda on Disney+.

2594
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Has that kept the Simpsons in the public spotlight enough?

2595
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,000
There's a good chance that's more popular than all the stuff we've been talking about.

2596
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Possibly.

2597
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
A good chance that that's more relevant.

2598
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Well, we all know what it's going to be, which is just they take all the theaters they have

2599
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
that aren't playing anything and they start playing this Simpsons in plus-aversary.

2600
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2601
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
The Disney plus-aversary shirt.

2602
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So they can implement that day one as soon as Universal loses the license.

2603
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Well, but it's nice to brainstorm.

2604
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
It's nice to think about.

2605
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Nice to think about.

2606
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Nice just to talk Simpsons for a while.

2607
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
So thank you for being here to do that.

2608
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Alan Siegel, you survived podcast The Pride.

2609
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Much appreciated.

2610
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
This is a good time.

2611
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2612
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Anything you want to tell us?

2613
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Obviously you have something to plug.

2614
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
We've been referring to it the whole time.

2615
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Anything else you want to tell us about Stupid TV?

2616
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
It'd be more funny.

2617
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Well, first of all, thank you guys for having me.

2618
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
I feel like I'm sitting with my three podcast brothers talking about this stuff.

2619
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
So it's a blast.

2620
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
So Stupid TV.

2621
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Rod and Todd.

2622
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
The characters we most resemble.

2623
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Two rods and a Todd.

2624
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Someone asked me who would you be and I'm like a combo of Milhouse and Lisa.

2625
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
That would probably be Milo.

2626
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2627
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
There's a lot of Milhouses in there too.

2628
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,000
So the book Stupid TV Be More Funny is out on June 10th.

2629
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
You can pre-order it.

2630
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:44,000
If you don't want to use a giant online retailer, you can go to bookshop.org.

2631
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Great website.

2632
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And that connects you to a local bookstore if you would like to buy it that way.

2633
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Wow.

2634
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Okay, that is a very good specific plug.

2635
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
So yeah, for sure, do it that way if you can.

2636
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And from what we've read already, such a great book and such a great deep dive.

2637
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
And I've enjoyed your writing in the past.

2638
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
So congratulations on this.

2639
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Yeah, great work.

2640
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Thanks, guys.

2641
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Absolutely.

2642
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000

2645
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And then I propose that we end like a Simpsons episode, which is, of course, with

2646
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I forgot the shush.

2647
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
The shush comes first.

2648
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Mike edit the shush.

2649
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I'll do it.

2650
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Don't worry.

2651
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Okay.

2652
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And then you'll edit all this that I'm saying right now, right?

2653
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
That'll be cut out.

2654
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Okay, thanks.

2655
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I know.

2656
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I could trust you as an editor and as my brother and as my friend.

2657
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:50,200
