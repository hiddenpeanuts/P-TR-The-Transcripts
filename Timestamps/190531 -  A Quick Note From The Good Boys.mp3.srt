00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Hello and welcome to a very special podcast the ride logistics announcement.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,280
This is Scott joined by Mike and Jason.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,280
Hi.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
Here's what's happening.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,680
If you didn't get the memo on Twitter or elsewhere, we are moving the release dates of the next

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,560
couple episodes to Monday.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,760
It's Friday right now and you're not hearing a new episode, but it's for very good reasons.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,420
We got some big events coming up.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,940
On Monday, you're going to hear our Star Wars Galaxy's Edge spectacular.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,940
That's right.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,940
We're doing it.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,020
We will have something to say about it and you will find out everything that's going

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,660
on in the Black Spire Outpost next Monday.

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,660
Yes.

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,960
And then the following week we are doing a live show.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,340
It is our hundredth episode spectacular and it's live and there's going to be all sorts

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,660
of fun things and surprises and a very special topic that you're all going to like a lot.

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,020
I can guarantee that.

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,580
It's on a Friday so we have to release that a little bit later too.

20
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,580
We're sorry.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,580
This will just be two weeks.

22
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,580
We'll be back to Friday.

23
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't worry about it.

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,580
We'll be a little bit off.

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,260
Back to Friday ASAP, but there's so much exciting stuff going on.

26
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,260
Our hundredth episode.

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,740
Those of you joining us live in theater, thanks so much for coming.

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,700
You'll get to experience episode 100 with us and the rest of you will hear it at home

29
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,500
and it's going to be great either way.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,340
Just so we get a little bit of podcast ride content on this specific tiny episode.

31
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,540
Jason, have you eaten any hot dogs lately?

32
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,060
Great question, Michael.

33
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,620
No, I don't think I have.

34
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,060
I think I'm just bracing myself for that Star Wars.

35
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,780
They want to hear that you just ate a pile of hot dogs last night.

36
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,780
I am preparing my body.

37
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,020
My body is ready for the Star Wars.

38
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,020
Okay, fine.

39
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,020
That'll be hot dogs.

40
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,060
So in the next episode, you are promised, you are guaranteed to the listener, you will

41
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,820
be have eaten a hot dog.

42
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,700
Well, they'll just have to tune in to find out.

43
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,700
I'll guarantee it.

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,820
We don't know what's going to happen at Black Spire Outpost.

45
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
Will it make it happen?

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,100
Can you guarantee getting one?

47
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,500
Natching of teeth, dogs and cats together.

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I guarantee it.

49
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Alright, stay tuned.

50
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
I guess we better.

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,060
Alright, so we'll see you the next couple of Mondays, then we're back to Friday and

52
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,100
many hot dogs to come.
