1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,180
Welcome to podcast the Ride the Second Gate.

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,660
Jason here is rustling a little purple bag,

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,180
the tissue paper in the purple bag.

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,440
We're going to talk about Disney afternoon avenue.

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,800
By the way, my name is Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,000
Joining me is always Scott Gardner.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,840
Hi.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,660
And Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,500
Hello.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,340
And he's a little-

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,040
You're pile driving to Jason, what Jason has in store.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,880
Yes, I am.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,600
I want to go right to it.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,780
Because we were just planning on talking about this thing

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,460
that happened in the early nineties at Disneyland,

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,360
but instead Jason came with a purple bag

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,280
from an estate sale of a dead celebrity.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,240
And I have never been to an estate sale before.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,080
Really?

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,900
Yeah.

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,740
I don't believe so.

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,820
I've seen sales that I guess technically

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,240
may have been estate sales,

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,540
but I don't really know the clarification

26
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,580
or what differentiates like a garage sale yard sale

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,480
from an estate sale.

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,840
I guess it was big enough and grand enough.

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,480
That's a guy's name you know, maybe.

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,320
Yeah, I think-

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,480
In this case, yes, I knew who it was.

32
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,320
Okay, so yeah, just quickly tell us

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,440
who's estate sale were you just at?

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,700
Okay, so our friend Anthony Geo,

35
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,080
who's been on the show before-

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,920
Right, he's dead.

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,600
That's a long time ago.

38
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,500
Sorry he's gone,

39
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,620
but glad you got some good stuff at the estate sale.

40
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,460
Yeah.

41
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,580
All right, Anthony.

42
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,140
Rest in peace, Geo.

43
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,740
We'll have to have him back one day.

44
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,100
So he texted the other day saying he was at the estate sale

45
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,540
of Joseph Cotton, who is one of my favorite actors.

46
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,200
Joseph Cotton, of course, the star of The Third Man,

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,500
the co-star of Citizen Kane,

48
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,080
also stars in a very odd movie that I like

49
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,100
called Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte,

50
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,700
which was the spiritual sequel

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,120
to whatever happened to Baby Jane.

52
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,960
Right.

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,760
It's where Betty and Joan hated each other even more,

54
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,900
so much so one of them quit the movie.

55
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,520
Yeah, keep going.

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,120
I was just gonna say, Joseph Cotton died in 1994.

57
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,980
1994, yes.

58
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,820
Oh.

59
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,660
Yes.

60
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,500
So-

61
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,040
And was born in 1905.

62
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,240
1905, yeah.

63
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,240
So I think I was out of town and I was like,

64
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,080
can you just get, like, he's, I love him,

65
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,680
can you get me something, just something to fit on,

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
he's like, oh, it goes until Tuesday.

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,680
So-

68
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
You were out of town and I was-

69
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,720
I was out of town, now I'm back.

70
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,960
So today is Tuesday.

71
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,040
Yesterday was Monday and I tried to go yesterday

72
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,820
and no one would open the door or answer the phone,

73
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,240
so I just wandered around Silver Lake for a while.

74
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,120
Do you know, is this his house?

75
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,200
Or was this his former house?

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,800
This is an abandoned church in Silver Lake.

77
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,120
When you say abandoned-

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,960
This is an empty church.

79
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
You can rent it.

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,000
No, yeah, you can rent it because also-

81
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,680
Regular service there is what you're saying.

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,320
Well, it's full of crap at the moment

83
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,160
and also there's contractors.

84
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,800
So I think there was two things going on,

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
this big liquidation of state sales going on

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,660
and then there was contractors there to,

87
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,600
whatever is gonna move in there,

88
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,960
if a church is gonna buy or they're gonna convert it

89
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
or something.

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,840
So I tried to go yesterday and no one showed up

91
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,320
and he warned me, this isn't the best organized thing.

92
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,160
Oh, GEO did?

93
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,000
GEO did.

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,760
Not some old prospector that was,

95
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,880
or not prospector, some old groundskeeper

96
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,720
on the church grounds being like, I must warn you.

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,440
There hasn't been an estate sale around these parts

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,480
25 years.

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,800
I was kind of, because any of the contractors

100
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,880
had no idea what I was talking about.

101
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,280
The third man, the spiritual sequel

102
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,920
to whatever happened to Ravi Jain?

103
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,800
So this morning I was working on research

104
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,760
for an upcoming episode and I was kind of wrapping up

105
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,440
and having breakfast and stuff.

106
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,960
I was like, I think I have enough time

107
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,520
to try to swing by this and then get to this recording.

108
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,240
And I was like, it probably won't be open.

109
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,560
But I drive by and this big gate is open.

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,560
So I park and I go in and it's just stuff everywhere.

111
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
And- Right, old looking stuff

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,840
from a man who was born in 1905.

113
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,080
And there is another, there is a person there

114
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,960
who is, the woman running it is talking to this guy

115
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,920
for a while and he's talking about how like,

116
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,360
one of his, he's like, oh, I buy,

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
yeah, I love to get this by Friday

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,560
because I have to fly to Paris on Saturday

119
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,640
and then I go to Belfast on Sunday.

120
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,120
And this guy is talking about how one of his clients

121
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,000
for furnishings is the Hard Rock Hotel in Paris.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,200
And then when he leaves, she starts talking

123
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,360
to one of the other worker and she's like, oh yeah,

124
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,880
he owns the Jack Warner estate.

125
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
He owns the building, he owns the mansion

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
and all the stuff inside.

127
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,680
And- The skeletons of Yakko, Wacko and Don.

128
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,520
That's right.

129
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,480
And apparently this person had bought,

130
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,160
she's like, yeah, he just bought a desk for $2,200

131
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,040
that the cottons had bought for $15,000.

132
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,720
So he knew what he was getting.

133
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
So, and so-

134
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,960
So he's probably sitting on all of Jack Warner's stuff

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,960
and could have a similar estate sale if he so chose to do.

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,280
I overheard them saying that there was a chandelier

137
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,600
he sold from that house that cost more than the house.

138
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,440
Whoa.

139
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,800
So, so I find a moment to chime in and go,

140
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,160
so is all of this stuff from the cotton estate?

141
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,600
Like, cause I am like looking at like pins

142
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,680
and like- What do you have in the one to $7 range?

143
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,120
Yes, basically.

144
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,880
And she's like, oh no, some of it's from an antique sale.

145
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,440
Some of it's from another estate

146
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,480
and some of it's from the Joseph Cotton's estate.

147
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,800
I can tell you what's from which.

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,640
And I grabbed a couple of things.

149
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,480
I was like, how about this?

150
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,760
There's a little ceramic bumblebee.

151
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,440
And she's like, no, that's from the antique store.

152
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,480
It'd also be funny if she's just like,

153
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,720
yeah, yeah, that's his.

154
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
That'll be $3,000.

155
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,600
I was waiting for that.

156
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,160
But no, she was very, and I was like,

157
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,520
what about this little thing?

158
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,720
And she's like, oh, that is from the estate,

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
from the cotton estate.

160
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,440
But I think my partner was gonna get it for him.

161
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,400
Let me double check.

162
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,280
So I'm like, what, the clock is ticking.

163
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,960
This is another like the Mark Twain Sunday incident

164
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,880
where I'm like, I'm gonna be late.

165
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,640
And I have it, I need to get some food.

166
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,880
I need to go and trade her joes

167
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,120
and get a Clif Bar or something.

168
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,640
And so like the clock is ticking.

169
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
And finally she gets them on the phone

170
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,160
and she's like, okay, I can sell it.

171
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
And thanks, I was like, okay, I could sell it.

172
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,920
And so I was like, oh yes, it's all worked out.

173
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,720
So for $10, I bought this small glass bucket.

174
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,000
It is a little beautiful yellow glass bucket.

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,840
I think I'll keep pens on it.

176
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,680
Can I see it?

177
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,760
It's yellow.

178
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,440
It is, yeah.

179
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,200
And they had so many, they had so much glassware,

180
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,200
but so much of it was like $30, $40 for single glasses.

181
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,640
I am holding in my hand Joseph Cotton's

182
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,920
piss yellow glass bucket.

183
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,760
Little glass bucket.

184
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,360
And I was delighted.

185
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,720
So found a great deal, all worked out.

186
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,160
When this goes up, we gotta post a photo

187
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,480
of you holding your Joseph Cotton bucket.

188
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,120
Yeah, we'll post a photo with the bucket.

189
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,000
It's gonna sit on my desk next to a Marvel Mania plate.

190
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,920
A Marvel Mania plate.

191
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Our coin from the world of, what was that movie?

192
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,400
Alita, Battle Angel.

193
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,440
The Battle Angel and the coffee coin,

194
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,040
the City Walk coffee coin.

195
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,640
Wow, your many treasures, treasures untold.

196
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes.

197
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
So was that the cheapest thing that Joseph Cotton?

198
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,840
That was pretty much the cheapest thing.

199
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah, I think the cheapest thing,

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,560
there was these little ceramic bumblebees for $3 each,

201
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,560
but they were so tiny and they weren't from the estate.

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,520
If they had been from the estate,

203
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,280
they would have cost more than the chandelier.

204
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,720
I guess so, yeah.

205
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,720
There was a few film canisters with film inside,

206
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,680
and I was like, I don't know, this is a $25 mystery.

207
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,800
I would have no idea how to play them

208
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,400
or get them projected.

209
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,600
Anyway, but I'm thrilled with my little bucket.

210
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,960
Put that on a T-shirt.

211
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,400
So are we, and so are the listeners.

212
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm thrilled, there's gonna be people at theme parks

213
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,600
across the country with,

214
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,760
I'm thrilled with my little bucket T-shirts.

215
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,280
Sure, yeah.

216
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,600
And let the record show, you were the one of like,

217
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,640
save this for the show,

218
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,760
because I was just telling you guys what I had done today,

219
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
and you said like, save it.

220
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,160
I didn't barrel in here and say like,

221
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,800
I gotta talk about my little bag on the show.

222
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,080
I was interested, I just think it's interesting

223
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
that you went to Joseph Cotton, who has been dead.

224
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,920
I'm curious about why he always took 25 years to get.

225
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,840
I think they had a lot of antiques in the house.

226
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,760
Oh, that was the other, she showed me a scrapbook,

227
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,120
because I said, oh, he's my favorite actor.

228
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,760
I really just wanted a small thing.

229
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,000
And she's like, oh, well, look at this scrapbook.

230
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,560
The family gave it to me as a gift.

231
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,760
Like she was the one pricing all these antiques

232
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,000
in this house, and it was just these giant photos

233
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,480
of each room of the house.

234
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,120
And he built this giant mansion up in Malibu,

235
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,160
and it really did look ironically like Xanadu,

236
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,040
like Charles Foster Cain's mansion.

237
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,800
So yeah.

238
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,080
If we picked up a biography of his,

239
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,400
an autobiography of his, and like a full chapter

240
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,880
was about that bucket, but of all my belongings,

241
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,280
of all my many awards and my riches,

242
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,640
nothing more important than my good old bucket.

243
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,240
And if my, God forbid my bucket fall into the wrong hands,

244
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,240
please smite that man, whoever should end up with it.

245
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Smite him.

246
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,920
Smite him.

247
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,480
He's from the past, so he would have said smite,

248
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,560
you know, like the Bible.

249
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,960
During that Orson Welles, Peter Bogdanovich interview,

250
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,600
he's always talking about, and Joseph Cotton

251
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,840
always had his tiny piss colored yellow bucket.

252
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,600
His tiny fucking bucket.

253
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,880
He would never be without the bucket by his side.

254
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Joseph, it's time for a take.

255
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,480
Get your hands off that bucket for one goddamn minute.

256
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,240
Scott, you are comparing, the bucket is to Joseph Cotton,

257
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,480
as the sled was to Cain, so.

258
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,680
I almost, I was very good.

259
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,880
I almost said as the snow globe was to.

260
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,040
My citizen Cain wires are so crossed.

261
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,400
Yes, it was all about his beloved snow globe.

262
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,240
That's right.

263
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm glad you remembered it better than me.

264
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,200
Wow.

265
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,040
He had a snow globe though, didn't he?

266
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,880
Or is it the Burns, is that the Burns parody?

267
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,560
I'm confusing the Simpsons with, what does he drop?

268
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,720
He drops something.

269
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,960
It might be a snow globe.

270
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,760
It is a snow globe, yeah.

271
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
It's like it's the same shot.

272
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,480
Like he's trying to communicate, like,

273
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,040
his mind is gone, but like trying to communicate.

274
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,360
Right, he's dying and he's trying to sue Rosebud

275
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,400
and he's trying to get Rosebud back his whole childhood.

276
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,720
That's what he misses.

277
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,760
And of course we all know the dirty meaning of Rosebud, yes?

278
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,600
Yes.

279
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,680
Okay, then we don't have to say it.

280
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,600
Oh, you don't?

281
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,680
You gotta say it now.

282
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,800
Okay, well, supposedly.

283
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,640
On the spot.

284
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,480
I can't pull the name.

285
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,400
Fluster. Do you know the name?

286
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,680
I don't know the name.

287
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,520
It was an inside jab at William Randolph,

288
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,600
Hearst's wife.

289
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,720
Mistress, I believe.

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,720
A nickname he had for her private part.

291
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,560
So Orson Welles to get a jab in at him

292
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,840
called the Sled Rosebud.

293
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,120
And that was the name.

294
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,160
And that was supposedly the nickname for it.

295
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,000
And probably it was a little bit extra salt in the wound

296
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,480
on already a movie that was gonna make

297
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,000
William Randolph Hearst mad.

298
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Totally insane.

299
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,320
And then totally ruin Orson Welles' career.

300
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,080
After having made it.

301
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,800
Yeah, and by bringing it up,

302
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,960
we are now guaranteeing that Chris Hardwick

303
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,920
will never do our podcast.

304
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,920
I did think that as I was saying it.

305
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,200
We blew it, guys.

306
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
We blew it.

307
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,880
He's married to a Hearst and they couldn't make fun of,

308
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,280
he could never make fun of Citizen Kane on the,

309
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,120
or I think he could reference Citizen Kane.

310
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,760
I think Mention, I think, is what I've heard.

311
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,680
You know, they're busy.

312
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
They're busy entertaining their friend Giseline

313
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,280
who's in town, so, you know.

314
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,840
They're not listening to podcasts.

315
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,680
They have guests.

316
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,520
They've been in and out.

317
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,920
You gotta go, oh my God, no.

318
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,920
Sickbergs, dude.

319
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,680
What's the Patreon?

320
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,480
You know, all bets are off on the Patreon.

321
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
What do we have to lose?

322
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,200
Disney afternoon episode starts with William Randolph

323
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,520
Hearst talk and Joseph Cotton's tiny yellow bucket.

324
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Joseph Cotton, yeah, yeah.

325
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,280
Different types of nostalgia for the 1910s

326
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,920
and the era where Chris Hardwick was.

327
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,440
Out and about more.

328
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,840
But let's go back, hey, why don't we now go back

329
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,720
to the 90s, the totally 90s.

330
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,680
The 90s?

331
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,280
Does anyone listening to the show remember the 90s?

332
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,120
Guys, I'm gonna go out of limb.

333
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,680
The 90s fucking rocked.

334
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,160
Maybe it's almost like if it was the 90s again now,

335
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,000
maybe we wouldn't be having

336
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,360
some of the same problems that we're having.

337
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
Yeah, do you remember Trapper Keepers?

338
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,960
Cause those ruled.

339
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,880
Did a quiz recently about which Trapper Keeper am I?

340
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,760
I got purple.

341
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,520
Mine was Elisa Frank Trapper Keeper.

342
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,360
Mine was covered in.

343
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,180
It was a weird thing.

344
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,800
It was not cool for boys to have Elisa Frank,

345
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,640
but I had it cause they were cool.

346
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Mine was covered in orbs.

347
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,280
Oh my God, I had a lot of folders.

348
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,200
Like 3D orbs and platforms and stuff.

349
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,320
I had a lot of folders with orbs on them.

350
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,240
I have no idea if today is a good time for folders

351
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,800
as our childhood was.

352
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,320
I don't know if the folder trend continued.

353
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,280
Let's talk folders real quick.

354
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,800
Did you as a child get all picture folders?

355
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,360
I would only get a couple and then a couple boring ones.

356
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,500
I was only allotted a certain,

357
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,480
like you could get the cheaper boring ones

358
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,680
and then as a little treat,

359
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,720
you would get maybe two picture ones.

360
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,200
Like, you know, do you have turtles

361
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,360
or Ninja Turtles or orbs?

362
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm sure I had folders that I liked,

363
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,920
but I remain really fond of those.

364
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,240
But these folders are notebooks.

365
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,800
The like 50s sports ones.

366
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,640
You know what I mean?

367
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Like the like, just like generic kind of old timey athletes.

368
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,120
Oh, I don't even know.

369
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,960
I don't know.

370
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,800
I don't know.

371
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,960
I'll look up later.

372
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,800
I think people know.

373
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,600
I know what you, yeah, I kind of know what you.

374
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,400
I have more, I oddly have more fondness

375
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,400
for the 50s athlete brand of school supplies than my own.

376
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,040
I was, I guess that's me trying to be a hipster

377
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
even as a child.

378
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,480
I like these old notebooks more than my generations.

379
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,920
That's yeah, I don't, I'm sure I would recognize them,

380
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,920
but my memory is just like Ninja Turtles

381
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,360
and then X-Men and then, yeah.

382
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,960
Then in high school, I had wrestling notebooks as well.

383
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,780
Really?

384
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,620
Yeah.

385
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,620
I had notebooks and like folders.

386
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,560
I think in elementary school,

387
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,040
I had a lot of the like notebooks with characters on them.

388
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,920
I liked, and then by middle school,

389
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,220
the teachers started dictating they want it,

390
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,300
what they wanted.

391
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,780
Like they wanted the folders with the tabs inside

392
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,780
to put your papers in, which I hate it.

393
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,460
It never kept it organized.

394
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,940
Like, yeah.

395
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,460
And then, yeah, at some point the teacher started saying

396
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,060
like, and this is the kind of note,

397
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,540
whether it was composition book or the wire,

398
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,740
but I know some teachers like the composition books

399
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,020
because they're harder to just start losing pages.

400
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,220
Yeah, I remember then,

401
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,980
I feel like anytime they dictated what we needed to buy,

402
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,540
we really would not utilize whatever feature that was.

403
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,360
Even like they would be like,

404
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,360
you need to buy the $150 math calculator, the TI-86,

405
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,260
and then it would be like, we didn't use it that much.

406
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,660
Maybe one thing in college, I used it like a lot,

407
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,320
but we just use it for that game

408
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,780
that you would deal drugs with.

409
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,620
Oh yeah.

410
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,440
You know what I'm talking about?

411
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,280
Drug Wars.

412
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,120
Drug Wars, yeah.

413
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,620
There was a game you could download on your TI-86

414
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,420
that was like a simulator for dealing drugs.

415
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,260
Wow.

416
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,780
And like it would just go around.

417
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,660
It was like, pretty harmless.

418
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,940
I might have had a snake or something.

419
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,780
Yeah, I had Snackers on there too.

420
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,300
There's Space Invaders.

421
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,900
But you'd have to find like a smart kid who had the cord

422
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,660
and he would plug yours into his and then, or hers.

423
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,340
Finding that kid a drug operation in and of itself.

424
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,180
Yes. Absolutely.

425
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,900
And as close as we, good boys, came.

426
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,740
Right, yes.

427
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,540
I just found my calculator.

428
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,820
Like I didn't know I brought it to California.

429
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
It was in a box and I was like, what is this?

430
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,380
I was like, this is my high school graphing calculator.

431
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,100
Is Drug Wars still on it?

432
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,660
Well, no, I had to, the batteries had all acidified.

433
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,820
They had all like explode.

434
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,780
So I had like pried it out and cleaned it out

435
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,020
and then I don't think it's, I think once that,

436
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,260
once it fully died, like I brought it back to life,

437
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,460
but I don't think there's anything saved on it.

438
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,620
You're gonna have super powers

439
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,620
from this graphing calculator.

440
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,860
The old battery rust.

441
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,700
Sure, yeah.

442
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,040
You're gonna mutate.

443
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,960
The power of irritated fingers.

444
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,720
The folders I was talking about,

445
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,760
they are, the brand apparently is P-C-E.

446
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,640
P-E, spelled like P-E.

447
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,480
Oh, interesting.

448
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,320
I like that.

449
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,520
P-E-C-H-E-E.

450
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,360
That doesn't look familiar.

451
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,000
This doesn't look familiar to you guys?

452
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,840
I don't know.

453
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,660
It was a regional thing.

454
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,500
There's enough Google results

455
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,640
when I looked up 50 sports folder.

456
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,160
So I know it's not a, you know,

457
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,000
it's not so specific of a fondness,

458
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,960
but I think my dad had them and it's, you know,

459
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,520
really like, it's the kind of characters

460
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,640
who now would be on a poster telling you about marijuana

461
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,520
or, you know, that kind of art.

462
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,240
That's, that shitty.

463
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,560
I like, yeah, I like them a lot.

464
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,960
I just don't recall that even being an option.

465
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,540
Never had a P-G-A.

466
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,200
I'm looking at one with the most popular

467
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,280
sports of the 50s.

468
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,000
Football, golf, and ballroom dancing.

469
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,600
Oh, I would have killed for ballroom dancing in gym class.

470
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,440
We did square dancing once or twice,

471
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,800
but never ballroom dancing.

472
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Once in a while, our rigid characters on this show,

473
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,760
like crossover, like this is for sure

474
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,160
should be a Jason thing.

475
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,400
I know, I'm shocked.

476
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,320
Yeah, yeah, we're getting our, if we were pitching plots,

477
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,040
yeah, well, why wouldn't this be Jason?

478
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,080
Why wouldn't, no, Jason would be the peachy guy,

479
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,120
not Scott, that doesn't make sense.

480
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,040
Yeah, oh, you've never heard of a peachy before?

481
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,760
I've got a folder with some ballroom dancing people on it.

482
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,600
Like, huh?

483
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Ballroom dancing folder!

484
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,240
And then the audience is like, I get it, I'm on Jason's side.

485
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,920
Right, yeah, they're being mean to Jason.

486
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,360
I had the ballroom dancing folder too.

487
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,200
Somebody did this, somebody pointed out

488
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,320
that Mitch told the story after we went to Mike Mitchell

489
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,880
from Doughboys, I went to a pizza place with him

490
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,760
after a wrestling show, and I ordered a calzone

491
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,800
and I got anchovies in it.

492
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,000
And it was too, and he thought that was crazy.

493
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,320
And the calzone was giant,

494
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,760
and it was way too many anchovies to eat.

495
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,160
But somebody in our Facebook group, I forget who it was,

496
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
was like, do you think Mike has

497
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,720
as many food hijinks as Jason?

498
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,080
And like, that was another, like, I'm like,

499
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,240
yeah, that should have been Jason.

500
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,440
Like, I should have, I should have ordered a normal thing.

501
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,720
And like, we should save the food,

502
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,920
weird food stuff for Jason.

503
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,680
It's too salty for me, but I,

504
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,800
that's not the first time you've ordered something

505
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,960
and been like, gotten a weird result.

506
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
Yeah, I'm just saying, if we were noting us as a script,

507
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,240
I would have not ordered anchovies

508
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,040
and you should not have had the 50s folder.

509
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,280
We shouldn't have been fond of peachy.

510
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,240
But you know what, we don't line up.

511
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,480
No, we're complicated.

512
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,120
We're multitudes, we contain multitudes, we are multitudes.

513
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,720
We're all Jason, let's be honest.

514
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Well, let me add, let you to delve into our topic

515
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,680
of the Disney Afternoon shows represented

516
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,520
in Disney Afternoon Avenue.

517
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,240
Darkling Duck, Tailspin Duck, Tails and Gummy Bears.

518
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,080
What we-

519
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,520
Wait, before you finish that question,

520
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,840
we should say the Disney Afternoon Avenue

521
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,640
was an overlay in Disneyland in 1991

522
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
for what, they ran from March to November,

523
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,920
where everything from Fantasyland to Small World

524
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,720
up to what now is Mickey's Toontown,

525
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,840
which is being built at the time.

526
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,200
Everything transformed into this temporary area

527
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,560
devoted to the Disney Afternoon,

528
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,120
which is the block of shows.

529
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,000
You know that, people know what the Disney Afternoon is.

530
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,440
Much of it inflatable.

531
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,560
This was the height of Disney's experimentation

532
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,880
with inflatable temporary stuff,

533
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,040
like that Carnaval Mardi Gras parade

534
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,800
with giant inflatable Roger Rabbit.

535
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Oh yes, and those interweaving teal and purple,

536
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,960
that's my color scheme, very Trapper Keeper.

537
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,880
Oh yeah, the colors are really great.

538
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,720
The colors are beautiful.

539
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,560
The inflatable balloon stripes

540
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,480
that ran through this entire tent.

541
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,880
Now this whole area, if you can picture Disneyland,

542
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,400
it's never really turned into anything.

543
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,640
It's essentially, it's like the second major parade route,

544
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,880
really, and Main Street and then this.

545
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,080
So there's never been room

546
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,760
to really have anything substantial,

547
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,280
but this was probably the most populated it ever was

548
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,160
with these balloons and little recreations

549
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,440
of Duckburg and what have you.

550
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,280
Sure.

551
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Yeah, the balloons from the pictures,

552
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,640
I didn't get to experience this.

553
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,360
Again, I was a child, I never even heard of it.

554
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,800
I would never even, of course, let alone,

555
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
I knew I would never go to Disneyland.

556
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,320
Self-punishment.

557
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,240
Yeah, well, that's how I was raised.

558
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
But from the look of it, it's very appealing.

559
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,560
Like it really, like your memory of it,

560
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,920
is it like lived up to your?

561
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,760
It was so great.

562
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,640
Yeah. Yeah, and every picture from it,

563
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,800
it makes me so happy.

564
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,920
But here, I didn't want to interrupt,

565
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,400
I just wanted to make sure we got out

566
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,600
what Disney Afternoon afternoon was.

567
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
You were posing the question.

568
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,160
And yeah, the Disney Afternoon included a lot of shows,

569
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,440
it event, you know, Darkwing Duck and Goof Troop,

570
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,720
but in the era that this was done,

571
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,320
the four specific shows were, you were starting to say.

572
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,000
Gummy Bears, Dark Tales, Talespin.

573
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,200
Chip and Dale. Chip and Dale.

574
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,040
Wasn't Darkwing Duck.

575
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,920
It wasn't Darkwing Duck, excuse me.

576
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,960
Yeah, which did you, I liked all of them.

577
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,360
I did too, that lineup, yeah.

578
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,800
Yeah, which is funny to think that you read

579
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,440
like Disney history stuff, and that was kind of slapped at.

580
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,720
Like it was like Eisner's, like we need,

581
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,560
that was one I think, Eisner's endeavors was like,

582
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,760
let's get into the syndicated TV, like kids TV and stuff.

583
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,600
And. Yeah.

584
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,720
With some bumps in the road,

585
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,200
there was something called the Wuzzles

586
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,440
that did not. Oh yes.

587
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,280
Perform as well, but past, well wait,

588
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,160
was DuckTales first or was Gummy Bears first?

589
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,800
Gummy Bears was first. Gummy Bears was first.

590
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,960
Yes, I think. Which was successful, but maybe not,

591
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,520
but DuckTales like probably really blew it all

592
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,360
out of the water.

593
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,760
Yeah, it was really huge and had this full archive

594
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,760
of the like Carl Banks, Duck comic books to like draw upon

595
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,480
and inspire. It's a very popular area that, yeah,

596
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,520
that they weren't exploiting in any particular way.

597
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,920
Yeah, which now would never,

598
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,400
now once they find something to exploit,

599
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,520
like it's just immediately. Carl Barks.

600
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,120
Carl Barks and how he's do that, yeah.

601
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,360
Scrooge McDuck and his love of Banks.

602
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,560
Yes. Gummy Bears, I believe the impetus was like,

603
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,280
well, kids like Gummy Bears.

604
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,640
It was just a candy. Right?

605
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,760
It was just a candy.

606
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,840
Michael Eisner was eating the candy or his kid,

607
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,680
or Breck liked the candy. Something like that.

608
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,560
And then they might have like visited Europe

609
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,600
where the candy was more popular and it,

610
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,880
I think I'm not making that up.

611
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,240
I don't think, I feel like I've heard this story too.

612
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,320
And he's just like, make this a show.

613
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,720
It seems like a lot of these shows came from interpreting

614
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,040
the weird whim of Eisner. Yeah.

615
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,160
Him just kind of pointing at stuff and saying, do this.

616
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Up to that rescue Rangers existed in a form,

617
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,040
like they had built out the team and they might've even had

618
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,440
Gadget and Monterey J and the idea of these,

619
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,920
a bunch of like little bugs and critters,

620
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,520
all solving crimes they had.

621
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,960
But he, Eisner said, we got to put like one of the main,

622
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,440
like look what happened that we,

623
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,120
the DuckTales had Scrooge and therefore Donald.

624
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,160
Right. So let's keep going on the list. Who makes sense?

625
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,520
Mickey is not small, even though he's a mouse,

626
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,880
that doesn't make, he's too big almost.

627
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
So it's just like, let's go literally down the list

628
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,880
of characters until we get to ones who might make sense

629
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,600
in this and it was Chippendale.

630
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,880
Honestly, it makes a lot of sense.

631
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,920
And I don't know why there's not more fun.

632
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,760
I know that we're doing,

633
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,120
there's a Chippendale movie coming to Disney Plus,

634
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,400
but it does make, I mean, as silly as some of the fun,

635
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,400
like Eisner stuff of like splash on splash mountain,

636
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,840
the Hannah character, mermaid character,

637
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,920
this does sort of make sense.

638
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,560
Like, yeah, we're just sitting on Chippendale.

639
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,120
Why not do something fun with them?

640
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,840
I agree. And it all came out very polished too.

641
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,160
All four of these, I think of as like, not like cheap looking.

642
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,520
And I think he pushed it to where, like, why does,

643
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,360
why is it assumed the TV animation has to be worse than,

644
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,200
Right.

645
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,280
Than the films.

646
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,360
And it's not, it's more limited and less glossy than,

647
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,480
you know, the Beast and the theaters at the same time.

648
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,560
But with the Lost Lamp movie, DuckTales movie.

649
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,400
Oh yeah, sure. Yeah.

650
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,640
Which is great.

651
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,760
Yeah, I love that movie.

652
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,640
I think I was DuckTales or Chippendale,

653
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,320
I think would have been in my like leading ones.

654
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,400
Yeah, I think DuckTales,

655
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,480
but I do really have an affection for rescue rangers.

656
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,800
Yeah, yeah, me too.

657
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,000
Like those, I don't know what, yeah.

658
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,600
I had all the McDonald's toys.

659
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,080
There was something about it that was real fun.

660
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Dale for me fell into that character of the goofy one,

661
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,720
like Michelangelo.

662
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,560
Oh yeah. Yeah.

663
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,160
Bart Simpson, I guess you don't,

664
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,240
it's weird to think of it that way now,

665
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,320
but and that to a lesser extent,

666
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,360
that dinosaur, the cool brother dinosaur,

667
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,160
or Cody on step-by-step.

668
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Any of the like, whoa, like I liked any character like that.

669
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,960
Yeah, 90s cool surfery kind of guy.

670
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,920
He's not that surfery, but he's a fun,

671
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,760
he's got the Hawaiian shirt.

672
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,600
He's got the vibe.

673
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,560
Which people say is the Tom Selleck nod.

674
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,400
Yeah, it must be.

675
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,120
And Chip is Indiana Jones nod.

676
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,600
Very clever.

677
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,440
Yeah, fun.

678
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
I was upset.

679
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,080
I think the one I watched the least was Gummy Bears,

680
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,520
but I do like Gummy Bears.

681
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,600
Purely by age, I think.

682
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
That is, yeah, it's 100%.

683
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,760
I don't think it was any malice towards Gummy Bears.

684
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,240
It was just like, I was made aware that all this existed

685
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,360
because one is Gummy Bears like 88, 89.

686
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,200
Something like that.

687
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,240
I think they inherited a lot too, that one especially.

688
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,280
But at that point, yeah, the block,

689
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,280
I feel like my awareness of it was when Chip and Dale started.

690
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,440
So it was just like the other two were more appealing to me.

691
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,040
I like Tailspin as well.

692
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,360
And I like it more even now in concept

693
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,600
because it's so funny and ridiculous.

694
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,080
I like the adventuring aesthetic.

695
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,160
Yeah, and the tropical thing.

696
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,320
Okay, so if you had to, because I'm thinking

697
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,320
the way this block worked is there were four shows

698
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,600
and then once there was a new one,

699
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,200
the old one was let go.

700
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,320
So they'd cycle them out.

701
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,640
So my ideal cycle probably would have been

702
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,440
Chip and Dale, Tailspin, Darkwing Duck, Goof Troop.

703
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,400
That's okay.

704
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,720
Yeah, so if you're talking to, do you call them bonkers in there?

705
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,800
I mean, that's the last one, right?

706
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,560
No, bonkers is where it starts going off the rails for me.

707
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,080
Yeah, same for me as well.

708
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,120
I was not that into bonkers.

709
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,640
I'm just wondering, I'm trying to remember.

710
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,720
That's the last one.

711
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,640
I don't remember what came directly after Goof Troop.

712
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,560
Right.

713
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,920
Was Marsupa?

714
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,040
That's a different, that's Warner Brothers.

715
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,880
Yeah.

716
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,680
Marsupa, what is that called?

717
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,840
Marsupa Lommy?

718
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,160
That's not Disney?

719
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,000
Am I wrong?

720
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,840
Maybe I'm wrong.

721
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,680
Maybe I'm thinking of a different thing.

722
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,040
That's one of the ones that was like a European comic

723
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,560
for decades and now it's a guy.

724
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,400
Maybe I'm misremembering.

725
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,200
The orange creature with the big yellow tail.

726
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,120
Oh yeah, is that Disney?

727
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,000
But is that Disney afternoon?

728
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,840
I don't know, look it up.

729
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,120
That could have been Disney Channel.

730
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,240
I'll give it a ranking.

731
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,000
Or it was a Saturday morning thing.

732
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,040
Yeah, that might have been.

733
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,280
It gets fuzzy beyond,

734
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,520
there's a real like cleanliness and clarity

735
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,600
to everything Gummy Bears through Goof Troop.

736
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,040
It's really, if you think about it,

737
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,400
similar to the Disney film renaissance,

738
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,160
where everyone agrees essentially on Little Mermaid,

739
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,720
Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King,

740
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,080
and then it gets sloppier from that point.

741
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,560
There's this run that was so dead on and clean.

742
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,720
I think my number one is Darkwing Duck.

743
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,000
I was obsessed with Darkwing Duck.

744
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,920
It was like having a second Batman in a way.

745
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,840
Yes, a comedic Batman.

746
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,760
All the villains are very fun.

747
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,920
I liked the whole dynamic.

748
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,040
All of his vehicles,

749
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,960
this is all important stuff to me as a child.

750
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,360
His vehicles are fun.

751
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
I had the jet.

752
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,760
I never had the ship he flew in,

753
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,600
which I can't think of.

754
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,240
The one that looked like the giant duck beak.

755
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,080
Oh yeah.

756
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,960
The launch pad would fly.

757
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,680
I love that launch pad was on that show too.

758
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,400
Yeah, people crossing over between the shows.

759
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,840
That was fantastic.

760
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,400
Yeah.

761
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,440
That was number one.

762
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,680
Goof Troop could be number two.

763
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,920
Might be tied with DuckTales

764
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,160
and then Chip and Dale maybe last.

765
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,400
DuckTales I recognize is fantastic

766
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,920
and maybe even away the one that holds up the best

767
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,720
and there's a reason why that's the one they brought back.

768
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,560
Yeah.

769
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
And that's kind of the root of where the other,

770
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,160
because Darkwing Duck and the Talesman characters

771
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,720
are showing up now in DuckTales.

772
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,840
Right, but haven't officially spun out.

773
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,680
Yeah, yeah.

774
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,760
But I think purely it's age why I didn't,

775
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,040
but I don't have the same fawn as it was like,

776
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,160
I'm talking it was like two months before

777
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,720
I was watching the Disney afternoon.

778
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,040
Marsupilami was Disney.

779
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,880
Marsupilami.

780
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Originally published in a French comic in 1952.

781
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,080
So he had been around for a while.

782
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm thinking of some other weird Warner Brothers thing.

783
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,880
And the Darkwing Duck plane is called the Thunder Quack.

784
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,720
Oh yeah.

785
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,560
The Thunder Quack.

786
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,000
What a great name and that's a toy.

787
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,440
I should look on eBay and see if I can get

788
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,280
a Thunder Quack right now.

789
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,120
You can get a Thunder Quack.

790
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,480
I know, but let's see how much it is.

791
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,320
Sure.

792
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,800
Predated Batman the Animated series, right?

793
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,600
Who?

794
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,440
Barely.

795
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,280
Barely, right?

796
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,120
Like around.

797
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,360
Batman was like 92?

798
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,200
Yes.

799
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,280
What was it with the red Darkwing Duck?

800
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,760
Why was there a red one?

801
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,600
That was the bad guy.

802
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,000
You mean the bad guy Negaduck?

803
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,840
Yeah, yeah.

804
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,680
He had the yellow shirt.

805
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,520
Oh, okay.

806
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,600
And then had a red hat and black hat I believe.

807
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,440
Okay, okay.

808
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,400
Yeah, I'm trying to remember the,

809
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,720
he's not like a clone or anything.

810
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
I forget if he's a brother or not.

811
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,240
I don't know.

812
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,080
Negaduck was great.

813
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,640
Megavolt.

814
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,280
Quacker Jack.

815
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,360
Liquidator.

816
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,160
I was like, I really let all of this leak out of my brain,

817
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,080
but it may be the thing I was the most obsessed with

818
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,680
at some point in my life that I don't remember

819
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,040
at all anymore, but I loved the Darkwing Duck.

820
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,920
Yeah.

821
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,560
I had all the toys.

822
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,680
There was a, they only made like two waves of them

823
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,480
and there's a third unproduced wave if you look it up

824
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,120
that is just heartbreaking to me still that I don't have them.

825
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,960
So yeah, I would like a full revival.

826
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,720
This was one of the first things that trained my brain

827
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,080
in terms of TV programming,

828
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,520
because this got me into like,

829
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,760
well, that's on every day after school.

830
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,160
And then following this was Fox Kids.

831
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,280
Well, Fox had the Saturday morning stuff with the X-Men

832
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,960
and I believe briefly the Batman animated show

833
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,200
was part of Fox before Warner Brothers launched their-

834
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
Kids WB.

835
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,600
Kids WB.

836
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,480
So there was competing ones and they were,

837
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,920
I would just get used to, I was like,

838
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,600
the summer's ending, I have to go back to school,

839
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,760
but at least there'll be new stuff on Fox Kids

840
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,560
or Kids WB soon.

841
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,440
My version of that is that I very specifically remember

842
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
that Sesame Street used to air in such a way

843
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,760
that the newest Sesame Street was first up to bat

844
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,080
and then following that would be the previous days,

845
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,480
which I would rewatch.

846
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,880
And then the previous days to that,

847
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,440
which I would also rewatch.

848
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,200
So every day in my probably pre before I started school

849
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,640
and then thank God when it's summer,

850
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,360
I can get back to watching every single Sesame Street

851
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,800
for three straight days in a row.

852
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,800
I would for sure do that with Muppet Babies.

853
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,360
Like there's a 10 a.m. airing

854
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,040
and then there's another airing later in the day.

855
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,880
I would sit waiting for Tom and Jerry to be over

856
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,840
so I could watch Ninja Turtles.

857
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,560
So I have a bad memory of Tom and Jerry

858
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,200
of like the last 15 minutes of it

859
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,600
and I just sit watching it being like,

860
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,680
soon, soon you'll hear that beautiful Chuck Lorre theme

861
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,280
and see the sewer shoot up.

862
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,120
Sewer mantle cover.

863
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,040
Getting through the boring sports part of the news

864
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
so I could get to Saturday Night Live

865
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,880
and see the cheerleaders.

866
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,720
That's right.

867
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,540
Mango.

868
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,380
Yeah.

869
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,920
I mean, believe me, I was waiting for Mango too.

870
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,120
We all loved Mango.

871
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,000
More of a Mr. Peepers man myself.

872
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,880
I loved Peepers too.

873
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,240
Follow up question that I think

874
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,400
is almost potentially more important.

875
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,080
Let's just take the four represented in the,

876
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,040
in the Gummy Bears, DuckTales,

877
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,200
Tailspin and Chip and Dale songs.

878
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Rank the songs.

879
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,040
Well that's, yeah.

880
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,760
Yeah, DuckTales number one with the bullet.

881
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Yeah, it has to be number one.

882
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,440
I was thinking with the,

883
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,960
because I considered the DuckTales song

884
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,480
to be like one of the,

885
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,800
maybe one of the 50 best songs of the century.

886
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,640
Period, right?

887
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,480
Yes, yeah.

888
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,320
I agree.

889
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,140
Yeah.

890
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,000
It's so fucking good.

891
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,280
Goof Troop and Darkwing are both similar,

892
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,880
like a 90s feeling to me.

893
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,700
And the others are sort of-

894
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,620
I think they're not as good as the show.

895
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,600
I agree with that.

896
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,440
They're fine.

897
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,020
They set the stage.

898
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,480
They're more, yeah, they're more era specific to me.

899
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,960
Both of them.

900
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,240
But like Chip and Dale's an underrated theme.

901
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,760
So is Tailspin.

902
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,160
Tailspin's real good.

903
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,360
I don't know if it's as good as the other,

904
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,920
I don't know if it's as good as the original.

905
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,480
I think Gummy Bears is underrated too.

906
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
I think Gummy Bears has got-

907
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,140
They're all underrated

908
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,960
in that no one only DuckTales gets talked about really.

909
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,800
Yes, that's what I mean.

910
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,640
Yeah.

911
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,460
Yeah.

912
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,240
But Gummy Bears, there's a soaring chorus of Gummy Bears.

913
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,000
Sing out in chorus.

914
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,840
Yes.

915
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,680
Go ahead, say chorus.

916
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,240
As the song fills the air,

917
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,080
Gummy Bears.

918
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,480
Such passion.

919
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,800
Shout out Joseph Williams,

920
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,520
singer of Toto for a long time.

921
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,360
Sang that one.

922
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,200
Oh my God.

923
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,920
There's a lot of covers of Gummy Bears

924
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,240
on Spotify and Apple Music,

925
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,120
which I have played all of, I think,

926
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,960
at a certain point.

927
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,800
Like punk covers?

928
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,500
There might be one punk cover,

929
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
but I don't know off the top of my head.

930
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,720
I need to talk about a thing

931
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,920
I've been obsessed with for a long time

932
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,640
that I don't know why I stumbled into this a long time ago,

933
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,680
but since I, as you might know,

934
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,800
I'm a fan of the movie, I think Tiny Fuppets.

935
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,480
I miss translation, I enjoy so much,

936
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,520
and there is just the harshness of language

937
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,680
that can come when you switch between language

938
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,600
and then convert it back to the original language.

939
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,560
I somehow stumbled upon the Russian version of Gummy Bears.

940
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,480
So English, back into Russian, back into English,

941
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,820
and what happens.

942
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,440
And let me just play a little clip

943
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,080
of what that sounds like in general,

944
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,500
but then I'll have to read the lyrics.

945
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,300
Hang on a second.

946
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Okay, here we go.

947
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,240
Mishki Gummy.

948
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,000
["Mishki Gummy"]

949
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,280
Mishki Gummy!

950
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,320
That's great.

951
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,560
It's no longer on YouTube,

952
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,840
but I looked up the lyrics.

953
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,480
One of my favorite videos ever to exist

954
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,560
where you could read these very strange,

955
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,520
much stiffer lyrics along with that soaring,

956
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,340
Mishki Gummy!

957
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,080
Here are the, from English to Russian,

958
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,640
English lyrics of Gummy Bears.

959
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,840
"'All kids will love these bears.

960
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,200
"'Disney will tell us stories about them.

961
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,160
"'Smart, brave, kind, cute, they are really faithful friends.

962
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,720
"'Gummy bears will amuse us with their funny jumps.

963
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,280
"'You and I will visit them in the magic country of Gummy.

964
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,440
"'Disney will tell us mysteries.'"

965
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,320
Again, Disney, twice Disney factoring into the lyrics

966
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,000
despite not in the English version.

967
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,840
No, not at all.

968
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,640
"'Disney will tell us mysteries.

969
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,960
"'The Gummy Juice will disclose a wonderful secret.

970
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,240
"'Naughty ogres will be defeated.

971
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,800
"'The Bear Knights show no mercy.'"

972
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,840
Wow.

973
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,760
And that's one of my favorite things ever.

974
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,600
That is great.

975
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,200
I think I saw it elsewhere.

976
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,120
"'No mercy for them.'"

977
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,560
It's a lot harsher than the show.

978
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,560
To me, it's like the Bush's Axis of Evil speech,

979
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,720
rocker ran and the ogres of Gummy Glen.

980
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,640
Is it, in other languages though, those phrases,

981
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,840
those are the closest translations.

982
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,160
So perhaps the phrase-

983
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,200
It's an aphorism.

984
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,640
They will disclose, or what was it?

985
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,480
Disclose.

986
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,560
Disney will, well yeah,

987
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,400
Disney will tell us mysteries.

988
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,920
"'The Gummy Juice will disclose a wonderful secret.'"

989
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,760
So no mercy?

990
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,760
No mercy, maybe that is a softer thing.

991
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,600
What's the actual lyric there?

992
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,440
Oh, I gotta look it up.

993
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,880
Sophie, I don't remember.

994
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,080
It's dashing and daring, courageous and caring, right?

995
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,920
That's the first part.

996
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,760
That's the first part.

997
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,600
The second, I don't quite remember.

998
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,680
I don't know the second then.

999
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,600
But I certainly don't recall anything about

1000
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,440
decapitating ogres.

1001
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,640
I like this humor because you can't,

1002
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,800
you shouldn't make fun of somebody

1003
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
for speaking a language poorly.

1004
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,200
There's a victimization there,

1005
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,680
but there's no victim here.

1006
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,440
It's just, it's just like,

1007
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,200
there's a big problem when you bounce between languages,

1008
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,600
like the gummy bears bounce.

1009
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,480
Blood will pour from the wounds of our villains.

1010
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,360
Quickly, my friend, slice all their necks.

1011
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,600
Drink the blood, that's the juice.

1012
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,440
I've eaten their eyes and cut out their soft tongues.

1013
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,600
The secret to it.

1014
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Gummy bears, murder bears that kill without care.

1015
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,360
Their taste for juice is only passed or passed

1016
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,000
by their taste for blood.

1017
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,600
In terms of misinterpretation,

1018
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,360
I have to say there's some great pictures.

1019
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,520
The pictures of Disney afternoon, avenue,

1020
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,720
look very good because of all the bright colors and stuff.

1021
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,800
Very jealous, this picture is up on Yesterland.

1022
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,960
This woman in the foreground is wearing a shirt

1023
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,400
that I can't make out most of,

1024
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,960
but in bright yellow letters, it says onion.

1025
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,880
Not the onion, the onion wouldn't have really been a thing

1026
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,240
at the time, but just a shirt that says onion

1027
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,960
in big letters is very funny to me.

1028
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,880
That's grilled.

1029
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,920
Sorry, you can't have that.

1030
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,760
I know.

1031
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,360
No state sale where that's available.

1032
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,200
I know.

1033
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,800
But merch, another piece of merch for you.

1034
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,640
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,320
The yellow shirt that says onion.

1036
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,800
Can we recreate it perfectly?

1037
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,800
Okay, so the actual thing, Disney afternoon, avenue.

1038
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,960
Well, you know what?

1039
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,680
If you want an overview of what Disney afternoon, avenue was,

1040
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,720
I came with my actual map.

1041
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,000
Oh, that's great.

1042
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
My poster signed by some of the stars themselves.

1043
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,920
Wow.

1044
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,760
My Dale.

1045
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,580
This is great.

1046
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,480
My announced favorite.

1047
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,760
Yeah, look at the, yeah, this is like,

1048
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,840
I've apparently kept it in very good position.

1049
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,680
Just went through my childhood closet.

1050
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,880
I was really concerned you were about to start playing

1051
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,600
something else that we'll talk about in a little bit.

1052
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,920
Uh-oh, oh no.

1053
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,760
It's fine.

1054
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,520
Okay, no, no, no.

1055
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,800
We're looking at the whole gang together.

1056
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,920
And how nice is it?

1057
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,520
Now the sizes are a little off.

1058
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,240
Are Chip and Dale as big as gummy bears?

1059
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,080
No.

1060
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,840
And Chip and Dale's fly friend, Zip?

1061
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,000
What was he called?

1062
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,120
Zip, yes.

1063
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,400
By using him to demarcate.

1064
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,240
I just don't think they're,

1065
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,600
I don't think Chip and Dale are as tall

1066
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,920
as he would do in Louis.

1067
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,480
Yeah, the scale is wrong, for sure.

1068
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,320
But here I am finding fault in this great old poster.

1069
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,920
When I was six, I was too pure of heart to do such a thing.

1070
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,760
I was just enjoying meeting Dale,

1071
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,280
meeting Scrooge McDuck,

1072
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,960
who signed his autograph with a dollar sign.

1073
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,800
Wow. Yes.

1074
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,320
Which was, I thought was great at the time.

1075
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,160
That is great.

1076
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,720
And that's it, I got two, I guess.

1077
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,040
Come on, kids.

1078
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,720
Why are you nagging me?

1079
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,840
Come on, kids.

1080
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,360
Join your Disney afternoon pals

1081
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,200
for a fun, filled adventure.

1082
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,840
Walk down Afternoon Avenue,

1083
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,400
where you can collect all your favorite

1084
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,560
Disney afternoon character stamps

1085
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,760
and watch for your favorite stars along the way.

1086
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,280
There's action and adventure waiting around every corner.

1087
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,760
And you turn it around.

1088
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,600
I love this map so much.

1089
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,040
The simplified map of the area.

1090
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,440
You can see just the tip of the Matterhorn,

1091
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,200
a ride I probably thought I would never do in my life.

1092
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,800
The entrance, which where these great

1093
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,120
neon teal balloons start.

1094
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,800
And that entryway balloon also, so fantastic.

1095
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,320
It is a big hot air balloon

1096
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,160
that the characters are all leaning out of

1097
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,880
and greeting you hello.

1098
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,880
Off to the side, the modded out

1099
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,280
Autopia, just one track of the Autopia,

1100
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,000
because there were two at the time.

1101
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,720
There was the Tomorrowland Autopia

1102
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,840
and the Fantasyland Autopia.

1103
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,200
Fantasyland became for that run,

1104
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,280
Rescue Rangers Raceway.

1105
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,360
Which having a theme to the Autopia was so great.

1106
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,800
I guess now we sort of have it

1107
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,640
with the misadventures of Osimo and Bird.

1108
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,760
But this was maybe the first that a little story

1109
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,240
was ever added to the Autopia.

1110
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,360
Above that you got the Motorboat Cruise,

1111
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,480
which we have not talked about.

1112
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,480
And people may not even know about the Motorboat Cruise,

1113
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,680
because it has been for a very long time a smoking area.

1114
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,880
But no more of that.

1115
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,720
Is that gone?

1116
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,640
Smoking is gone.

1117
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,480
Oh, smoking altogether is gone.

1118
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,600
Smoking in the parks is gone.

1119
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,440
Oh, that's right.

1120
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1121
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,560
And they've clarified vaping.

1122
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,760
It ain't happening anymore.

1123
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,600
Oh, right.

1124
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,240
We'll have to talk about the Motorboat Cruise.

1125
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,080
That's a good episode.

1126
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,360
We'll cover that and smoking,

1127
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,720
Motorboat Cruise slash smoking.

1128
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,560
Slash smoking area.

1129
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,280
Uh, and, but yeah, they transformed that

1130
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,000
into the Motorboat Cruise through gummy glen.

1131
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,840
I love the gummy glen.

1132
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,200
Where you can see, learn how the gummy berries are made.

1133
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,040
And then there's a bunch of Xs,

1134
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,320
and that marks where you can get stamps.

1135
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,720
And I got all of them.

1136
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,160
I completed them all.

1137
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,480
It's a mix of all of the characters.

1138
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,200
They don't group them all together.

1139
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,560
It's, who did you get a stamp of?

1140
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,960
Because there's like some characters like Snout.

1141
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,560
I don't recall who Snout was,

1142
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,960
but he looks like Rizzo and he's got a 40s hat.

1143
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,400
Yeah, who is Snout?

1144
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,360
I don't really know.

1145
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,600
He is a baddie.

1146
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,440
Yes.

1147
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,680
From.

1148
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,040
Is he a DuckTales or is he,

1149
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,400
him being a mouse makes him maybe fit with Chip and Dale.

1150
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,120
Maybe Chip and Dale, is he one of Fat Cat's goons?

1151
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,960
Could be.

1152
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
He's sort of placed on this near Fat Cat.

1153
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
So. Yeah.

1154
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,080
Not totally sure, but you know, there's Gruffy and Zummey.

1155
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,160
The stamps you could get, Sunny, Zummey, Gadget,

1156
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,920
Chip and Dale, Monterey Jack, A Beagle Boy,

1157
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,600
Huey Dew and Louie, Uncle Scrooge, Louie.

1158
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,840
Confusingly two Louies.

1159
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,640
There's Duck Louie and King Louie.

1160
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,480
Yeah.

1161
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,520
And Blue and Kit Cloudkicker.

1162
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,560
Oh, and Cubby.

1163
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,480
I don't remember the, like,

1164
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,280
if you pointed at the gummy bears and said,

1165
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,320
describe this character, I don't think I could do.

1166
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,920
Yeah, I am not good on my gummy character names.

1167
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,760
No.

1168
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,040
A lot of these names I was struggling with.

1169
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,880
Yeah.

1170
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,200
Not that I forgot this one,

1171
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,120
but I gotta just give it up for Monterey Jack.

1172
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,200
What a great joke.

1173
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,800
That is a great nameslips joke.

1174
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,880
I thought you were just giving up for the cheese in general.

1175
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,440
No, I find, I like Monterey Jack.

1176
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,800
I think I like it as a topping, but as a cheese,

1177
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,960
like a sliced cheese, like I feel like it really,

1178
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,800
it doesn't have enough oomph for me.

1179
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,640
Interesting.

1180
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,460
It's maybe, you know,

1181
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,500
it's good in like a quesadilla, that kind of thing.

1182
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,340
Perfect.

1183
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,220
Where you don't get something like super strong, overwhelming.

1184
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,140
Yeah, or the cracker has to be like extra flavorful

1185
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,980
to balance it out.

1186
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,980
But I for sure remember saying, Monterey Jack,

1187
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,020
is this named after the character?

1188
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,620
I thought it was the other way.

1189
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,100
I am sure that was my introduction to the cheese.

1190
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,260
I'm sure I did not know that name before.

1191
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,660
And I think maybe my mom explained

1192
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,140
that that was a funny joke.

1193
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,340
And I'll go ahead and say, like,

1194
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,300
I never really thought about Darkwing Duck

1195
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,140
being like a parody of Batman.

1196
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,140
I was like, well, there's Batman and there's Darkwing Duck

1197
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,700
and they both gotta do their thing.

1198
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,540
Like it wasn't.

1199
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,860
As far as I knew, they both started last year.

1200
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,700
Yeah.

1201
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,020
These are new franchises for me.

1202
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,860
Yeah.

1203
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,100
I found the unproduced Darkwing Duck toys.

1204
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,300
Oh my gosh, this liquidator.

1205
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,100
This is like a trade magazine kind of thing.

1206
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,620
And there's Quacker Jack.

1207
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,580
Oh boy.

1208
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,940
And I remember, yeah, just cause, yeah.

1209
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,780
Wow.

1210
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,020
Negaduck, there he is.

1211
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,580
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1212
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,540
And Gizmoduck.

1213
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,620
Oh yes, Gizmo.

1214
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,460
So yeah, I'm really glad I have this thing.

1215
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,380
This is really neat.

1216
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,460
I got all the stamps.

1217
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,700
Fun to recall that these little kid activities

1218
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,980
were pretty important as a kid.

1219
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,780
We see them now and they don't matter to us,

1220
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,420
us without children at the moment.

1221
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,980
But the, you know, you,

1222
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,660
this clearly meant a lot to me.

1223
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,700
I had to collect them all.

1224
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,620
I met so many characters.

1225
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,540
I know I have pictures in front of a lot

1226
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,060
of these storefronts and everything.

1227
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,220
And I, this, I love this thing.

1228
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,780
This thing was so cool.

1229
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,740
To me it is like almost,

1230
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,820
it's kind of the first Disneyland I remember

1231
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,980
cause I went twice during this run.

1232
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,740
And like, so it's probably the first time

1233
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,180
I'm having memories that are still a little bit with me.

1234
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,020
Right.

1235
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,300
So to me, it was always gonna be Disney afternoon and avenue.

1236
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,580
I was probably sad when I went

1237
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,820
and they didn't have it anymore.

1238
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,700
That really seems heartbreaking.

1239
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,020
Yeah, yeah.

1240
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,300
But Toontown was right around the bend.

1241
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,140
Right.

1242
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,020
And they kind of went straight from this into that.

1243
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,460
There was a groundbreaking ceremony kind of as soon

1244
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,220
as all of this stuff was out of the way.

1245
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,660
Yeah, it's a nice transition, honestly,

1246
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,340
like to prime kids for the cartoon world.

1247
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,180
Yes.

1248
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,100
And I think that Ballou's dressing room,

1249
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,140
which was something that you could do

1250
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:42,860
because there was a show called

1251
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,820
We gotta talk about Ballou's dressing room.

1252
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,660
Yeah.

1253
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,500
Yes, yeah.

1254
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,500
Well, then it hasn't been as good a time as any.

1255
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,540
Ballou, you, there, you would go,

1256
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,220
there was a big fake sound stage,

1257
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,660
a kind of like pretty like huge building that they set up

1258
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,500
despite it being temporary.

1259
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,780
Yeah, impressive, like for a temporary thing.

1260
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,740
Yeah, yeah, massive structure.

1261
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,380
And you would go where today is the entrance of Toontown

1262
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,740
under the train tracks.

1263
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,940
And you would wait in line and you would get to go

1264
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,860
into Ballou's dressing room where he was preparing

1265
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,180
for the next performance of Playing Crazy.

1266
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,860
And they used this as kind of a dry run

1267
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,980
for the meeting Mickey, which was a more complex operation,

1268
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,500
opened to Toontown a few years later

1269
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,700
where there's multiple rooms.

1270
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,700
And I think they'd never like done a concerted spot, really.

1271
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,420
So let's give this a dry run.

1272
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,740
How do we do this when it's not just the character comes out

1273
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,140
and you take pictures willy nilly?

1274
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,220
But it leaves us, yes, with Ballou's dressing room

1275
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,140
or as one video I saw put it,

1276
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,540
you can meet Ballou in Ballou's private dressing room.

1277
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,940
Yeah, the weirdest, some of the weirdest phrasing for it too.

1278
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,860
And for whatever reason,

1279
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,820
I guess it's cause Mickey and Minnie have like

1280
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,500
been in short shorts and you sort of think of them

1281
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,660
as like the movie stars.

1282
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,620
So it's not as weird when it's like Mickey's dressing room,

1283
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,500
Ballou's private dressing room.

1284
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,900
His private dressing room.

1285
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,860
There's something odd about it.

1286
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,700
There's a child on his lap in the commercial

1287
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,540
and it's like what he's sitting.

1288
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,260
This is cancelable now.

1289
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,100
That's what I'm saying.

1290
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,020
There's something weird going on here.

1291
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,460
Ballou isn't a TV, like he's not a TV star in the world.

1292
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,140
I think within this, he was preparing for performances

1293
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:17,980
of playing crazy.

1294
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,820
Right.

1295
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,700
I think that was the justification.

1296
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,220
Yeah, but I feel like I want a little more,

1297
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,180
like why not meet him in his hanger?

1298
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,420
Like Ballou's hanger or meeting him in the place

1299
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,260
where all the pilots hang out.

1300
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,020
Yeah, some little garage thing

1301
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,620
would have been just as viable.

1302
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,700
Yeah. Yeah.

1303
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,220
Well, I think it got kids accustomed to the idea

1304
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,300
of meeting a star in his private dressing room.

1305
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,060
That's not- The thing that we don't know

1306
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,180
should never have been done.

1307
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,540
That's grooming behavior.

1308
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,140
This is Ballou's grooming.

1309
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,260
This might be like,

1310
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,660
we were talking about Elvis before this.

1311
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,500
Before I started.

1312
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,820
And bear with me, cause this is kind of a journey.

1313
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,060
But so Elvis- Bear with me,

1314
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,380
can do little buddy.

1315
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,860
No man.

1316
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,620
So I was talking about like, there was a certain age

1317
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,180
when I was a kid where I was like a little done

1318
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,900
when cartoons, I was like, all right, yeah, Elvis.

1319
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:07,740
Great.

1320
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,060
Like enough with Elvis.

1321
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,060
It's not funny to me.

1322
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,900
I don't know about Elvis.

1323
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,020
It's not, he's been dead for even, at the time I knew

1324
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,140
like he's been dead for years.

1325
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,540
Reference hammer, would you?

1326
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,380
Something I know.

1327
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,220
Yeah.

1328
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,060
My guy.

1329
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,700
But that, it does make sense to me

1330
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,700
cause he was such a big like cultural reference point.

1331
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,540
So it made sense.

1332
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,140
They would reference Elvis back

1333
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,460
when he hadn't been gone that long.

1334
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,820
So at the time Ballou in his dressing room,

1335
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,500
was that still close enough to old like,

1336
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,100
you know, screwball comedies

1337
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,780
where inevitably character would be high jinks

1338
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,500
in a character's dressing room backstage

1339
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,020
or on set or something.

1340
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:48,860
I guess it just doesn't.

1341
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,620
Where it was just like a location

1342
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,940
where a scene would happen.

1343
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,420
It wasn't necessarily seedy.

1344
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,540
It was just like a setting.

1345
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,260
My only thing is it doesn't make sense for the character.

1346
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,660
If it's like Roger Rabbit,

1347
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,780
that's like more of a show business property.

1348
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,780
That makes sense.

1349
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,740
Ballou though, especially, especially Tailspin Ballou

1350
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,500
in his pilot's outfit.

1351
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,700
We're already, he was in the jungle.

1352
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,460
Now he's a pilot and now it's his dressing room.

1353
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,700
And now it's his dressing room.

1354
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,540
It's weird.

1355
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,380
It doesn't make any sense.

1356
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,580
And the commercial just is weird.

1357
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,220
The commercials phrasing of it too is just strange.

1358
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,700
It should just be the hanger of the air,

1359
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,220
or like the break room or something.

1360
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,380
They obviously, yeah, they were like,

1361
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,380
we're gonna build the dressing room for Mickey and Minnie,

1362
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,580
but like, let's put Ballou.

1363
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,980
Is that the idea that they were like,

1364
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,860
we're gonna, this is,

1365
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,100
Ballou's gonna warm it up for Mickey and Minnie?

1366
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,860
Yeah, I suppose so.

1367
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,420
Come to my private gym, little buddy.

1368
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,580
It's a little few steps removed.

1369
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,220
Yeah, so I'm just saying character wise, yeah.

1370
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,060
And I get it that he's in the show playing crazy,

1371
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:52,900
but like, that's still.

1372
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,540
That I think makes it fine.

1373
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,180
He's, we know we're seeing Ballou in a play today.

1374
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,020
Yeah.

1375
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,820
That we're gonna go to his dressing room.

1376
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,420
But the reality of, although playing crazy,

1377
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,900
I would like to think is a real show

1378
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,980
that's actually happening.

1379
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,660
Yeah, I think that's actually happening.

1380
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,660
Which to me as a child, I was recalling how I did.

1381
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,860
I was, I feel like I somehow lived in a region

1382
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:18,820
between I'm seeing a show at Disneyland and this is real.

1383
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,660
Yes.

1384
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,540
Like I knew it was people in suits,

1385
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,460
and yet I was still kind of like, yeah,

1386
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,260
but I don't trust fat cat.

1387
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,940
Like, what's he gonna do?

1388
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:32,460
How are you able to like still think some things are,

1389
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,860
how can you be like percentages as a child?

1390
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,540
I guess when you're still a former kid.

1391
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,700
I think you can predict if the kid believes that hard

1392
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,460
in the reality of like, we have to watch out for fat cat.

1393
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,460
You can likely call it that that child will go

1394
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,180
into the arts and entertainment industry.

1395
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,260
If you're buying it that hard at that age.

1396
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,260
Yeah.

1397
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,420
It means you feel a little more than everybody else.

1398
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,460
Yes, that and like, I would say a few years ago

1399
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,900
if the kid is like, well, I gotta watch the special features

1400
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,260
on the DVD, like have to figure out how they did this.

1401
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,900
You know, that I feel like is a trait I,

1402
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,540
for a lot of people I know gravitated towards

1403
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,460
intensely believing the story and wanting to know

1404
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,260
so badly how they did it.

1405
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,140
Well, and also us both recalling, you know,

1406
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,180
fondly recalling learning about time structures

1407
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,740
of when our shows, our favorite shows were on.

1408
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,580
Oh yeah, programming blocks.

1409
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,020
Leads us perfectly to a future of like, okay,

1410
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,940
so on Friday we got Jurassic World coming out,

1411
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,580
but what do we have for next week?

1412
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,660
It's all, it's, but it's also, I mean, there's,

1413
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,780
I find that there's still a lot of problems

1414
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,140
where I intellectually know something is real and right,

1415
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:48,060
but my instincts or my emotions tell me I'm wrong.

1416
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,580
Like, oh, some, some, I don't know what it is.

1417
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,700
If it's a meeting or if like, even just like,

1418
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,060
sometimes you're like traveling

1419
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,100
and you're stressed out about that.

1420
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,540
And you're like, it's gonna be fine.

1421
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,780
Like it's gonna be two days.

1422
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,620
You'll be a little tired.

1423
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,060
You go back to bed, but your brain is like,

1424
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,940
no, you should be scared of it.

1425
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,700
It's gonna wreck you.

1426
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,740
This is gonna be so bad.

1427
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,940
Well, you run into travel mishaps

1428
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,340
almost every time you go,

1429
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,100
and it was so I could see why you'd be afraid.

1430
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,380
Yeah, well, okay, so you're saying actually intellectually,

1431
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,140
I shouldn't think that I should know

1432
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,340
that something's gonna go wrong.

1433
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,260
I should be 100% sure something bad will happen.

1434
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,260
Did you, you're just back from a trip to Vegas.

1435
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,420
Did hijinks happen?

1436
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,260
No.

1437
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,100
Okay, that's good.

1438
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,220
Maybe I'm a little tired.

1439
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,340
I wasn't really stressed about that,

1440
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,220
but you know, Christmas time, especially,

1441
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,700
I always get very stressed leading up to Christmas time.

1442
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,540
It's snowy.

1443
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,380
What are we gonna do with the dog?

1444
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,180
Is it gonna be,

1445
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,140
we're gonna circle the airport and the plane for an hour.

1446
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,780
Like that's happened before.

1447
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,540
So I'm just saying intellectually,

1448
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,140
you go, well, whatever, it's fine.

1449
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,180
You're gonna leave Edwin home alone?

1450
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,300
No, we would never, but he would.

1451
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,140
Edwin!

1452
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,500
His two paws up to his snout.

1453
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,660
No, we wouldn't do that.

1454
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,460
But you know, I'm just saying like our brains do that.

1455
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,100
But if there were like 18 other dogs around,

1456
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,820
and there was one that from behind looked like Edwin.

1457
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,980
We were carrying 18 different pet carriers,

1458
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,700
and we only picked 17 up.

1459
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,020
And there was one carrier left here, and it was Edwin.

1460
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,300
We should say you have 17 other dogs,

1461
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,740
and for some reason you only talk about Edwin.

1462
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,940
Well, he's the favorite.

1463
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,940
So the irony of leaving him home.

1464
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,060
The rest is like a Jane Eyre situation.

1465
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,340
The rest live in the attic, and we don't talk about them.

1466
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,180
Yeah.

1467
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,500
You're burning through dogs until you got a good one.

1468
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,500
And here he is.

1469
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,580
There he is, taking a nice nap.

1470
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,980
And he's blinking, he's up.

1471
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,460
He'll keep you updated.

1472
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,620
He jumped to try and eat a bug earlier and scared me.

1473
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,140
Scared the shit out of Jason, did you see that?

1474
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:40,980
Really?

1475
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,820
Yeah, he.

1476
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,580
There was a little bug buzzing around,

1477
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,500
and he jumped in the air a little bit,

1478
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,300
and went, and like did a big bite down.

1479
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,140
But Jason saw him.

1480
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,140
But directly at me.

1481
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,980
Jason thought he was coming at him

1482
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,620
to take a big bite out of Jason.

1483
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,220
And I could have, and I was like doing that,

1484
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,340
I was fiddling with my phone at the time,

1485
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:01,980
and I was like just turning it over in my hand,

1486
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,260
and I'm like, he doesn't like that.

1487
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,100
And I saw, I saw what was happening,

1488
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,860
but you were like, your eyes were wide,

1489
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,700
and I was like, no, no, it's fine.

1490
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,660
I was just trying to figure out

1491
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,140
how to make this symbol of a bug.

1492
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:16,140
So I like put my thumb and index finger together,

1493
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,620
and was trying to like make it fly,

1494
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,660
to be like, no, it's a bug.

1495
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,940
This is what a bug looks like.

1496
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:24,220
My endorphins are still up from getting the bucket, okay?

1497
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,860
Yeah, we have to, no, you're in a bucket-addled state.

1498
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,980
It was like, boy, it's like Edwin was full of gummy juice.

1499
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,900
He was like, Naughty Jason will be defeated.

1500
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,740
The dog, Knight, shows no mercy.

1501
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,540
That is the thing he thinks about Naughty Jason.

1502
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,660
That's why I'm not allowed to watch him.

1503
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,620
No mercy for Naughty Jason.

1504
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,260
Another shirt, we've done three shirts today.

1505
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,620
Cranking through them today.

1506
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,980
No mercy for Naughty Jason.

1507
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:59,580
So, I mean, is, well, you know what I'd like to play,

1508
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,620
actually, while we're talking about Ballou

1509
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,580
and Ballou's dressing room,

1510
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,100
I have a couple good videos lit up,

1511
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:08,100
and this, the song, the promo video announcing this thing

1512
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,860
where they're really pushing the phrase live,

1513
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:14,300
it's really important that Disney Afternoon is live.

1514
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,220
I be live.

1515
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,060
Come straight out of our cartoon show.

1516
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,660
You can meet us, greet us, say hello.

1517
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:26,620
Disney Afternoon, live, live at Disney Land.

1518
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,100
We got pride, shows, dancing to the beat,

1519
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,380
lots of adventures on a cartoon street.

1520
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,540
DuckTales, gummy bears, Tailspin 2,

1521
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,740
Rescue Rangers are here for you.

1522
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,220
Disney Afternoon.

1523
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,180
Wow.

1524
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,340
That's perfect.

1525
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,780
I love that so much.

1526
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,820
That's like a...

1527
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,220
Great time capsule.

1528
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,380
Yeah, the video is so like blue screen,

1529
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,300
zooming in and out to the brightest colors.

1530
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,340
How all kids things, especially Nickelodeon,

1531
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,340
why was everything that was like weird amorphous

1532
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,220
kind of orb shapes and then like squiggles,

1533
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,700
lots of like rotating squiggles.

1534
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,540
That's what we like to see.

1535
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,780
Yeah, like Clarissa explains it all

1536
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,260
and Roundhouse, those logos had that.

1537
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,100
Yeah.

1538
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,460
You got at least 70 squiggles per frame

1539
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,580
or kids lose interest.

1540
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,700
So many squiggles.

1541
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,220
Yeah, I would love if somebody,

1542
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,540
is there a person that knows where that starts?

1543
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,380
I'm always curious, like what started that trend?

1544
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,500
Because something had to.

1545
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,700
Is it like an interior design style

1546
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,220
that is not coming to me,

1547
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,900
that is sort of, I think where some of the,

1548
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:31,020
it's where there's 80s and then there's super 80

1549
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,540
when it got just like hyper, hyper colorful stylized

1550
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,380
right at the end of the,

1551
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,940
it's a little tackier,

1552
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,380
but that definitely dove tails

1553
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,500
into what Nickelodeon was playing with.

1554
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,900
And it's not coming to me,

1555
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,180
but there for sure is some...

1556
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,980
There's like an art movement essentially,

1557
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,820
or some style that it would be called something.

1558
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,300
These playhouse, you would say.

1559
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,140
Oh, okay.

1560
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,860
Probably an early one.

1561
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1562
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,460
And it's a little,

1563
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,700
there's a little bit of a 50s air,

1564
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,820
as there was a lot in a lot of Nickelodeon stuff,

1565
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,220
there were always like 50s style dads and moms

1566
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,740
telling us to eat meatloaf

1567
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:08,300
and like lame things that parents do that we don't like.

1568
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,900
Yeah, like a sweater vest dad with glasses or something.

1569
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1570
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,940
And like mom dressed like June Cleaver

1571
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,060
from Leave It to Beaver.

1572
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,500
Like, yeah, like we're not this any,

1573
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,260
we're not your parents' TV.

1574
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,100
We're cool.

1575
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,860
Do you recall the ago, Hi Honey, I'm home.

1576
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,380
I am, yes, yes I do.

1577
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,740
80s, more Roseanne family lives next door to a 50s,

1578
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,020
like literally out of the TV family.

1579
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,740
A show that I really didn't get at the time.

1580
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,900
But in hindsight I go, I don't know if it's good or not,

1581
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,020
but in hindsight I go.

1582
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,820
I've given it a watch recently, I might vote no.

1583
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,300
Okay, kind of a funny idea though.

1584
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,860
Kind of like Pleasantville, Pleasantville,

1585
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,380
Pleasantville, kind of similar premise.

1586
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,620
90s people going to 50s.

1587
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,460
That's absolutely right.

1588
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:57,580
That was, I alluded to earlier, that is, it was not,

1589
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,500
I thought you were gonna, when you pulled out the map,

1590
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,780
I thought you were gonna play a different promo.

1591
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,620
Oh, okay.

1592
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,220
Did you find that one?

1593
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,900
Did you find the Mary-Kate and Ashley promo?

1594
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,580
I don't have it ready to go.

1595
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,020
I don't either.

1596
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,380
It's a nightmare, it's crazy.

1597
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,900
Yeah, should I find it?

1598
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,820
Find it, it's long.

1599
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:19,020
You know, let me tell you why I didn't bring a clip of it.

1600
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,660
Because, yeah, so Mary-Kate and Ashley are on a school bus

1601
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:27,100
and the school bus is going to Disney Afternoon Avenue

1602
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,020
where they get out and dance with all the characters.

1603
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,780
And it is so hyperactive.

1604
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,020
And my guess is that why that is the case

1605
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,100
is that Mary-Kate and Ashley were having

1606
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,660
like a meltdown that day.

1607
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,260
Because they're barely in it.

1608
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,060
And you gotta, and you're watching it

1609
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,940
remembering more so than Full House

1610
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,180
where they're, that's what they know how to do.

1611
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,620
They're there every day.

1612
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,060
This, like them out in the wild,

1613
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,340
probably in a hot day in a theme park,

1614
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,100
they were, I bet they like broke down into tears.

1615
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,220
Because they're like five, they're so young.

1616
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,580
It does seem like chaos.

1617
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,500
This video is chaos.

1618
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,020
I've never seen so many edits in like two minutes,

1619
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,980
40 seconds.

1620
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,900
The bus, I thought was just like,

1621
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,540
oh, that bus isn't in Disneyland.

1622
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,500
And then there's a shot where it looks like the bus

1623
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,660
driving into like next to the Matterhorn.

1624
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,580
And I'm like, did they drive a bus through Disneyland?

1625
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,460
But the big thing for me is that Mary-Kate and Ashley

1626
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,100
still would have been young enough

1627
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,300
and Full House early enough in its run

1628
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,140
that they were not exactly at the age

1629
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,940
where they could enunciate.

1630
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,620
And I feel like on Full House,

1631
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,980
they gave them punch lines that were two to three words.

1632
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,980
And in this video, they're trying to get them to say like,

1633
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,020
I can't wait to go down to Disney after now.

1634
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,460
And it just sounds like gibberish.

1635
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,220
Is it Mary-Kate and Ashley, oh sorry,

1636
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,220
Olsen bomb afternoon avenue?

1637
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,060
Yeah, yeah.

1638
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:42,900
That's the one?

1639
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,900
I'll warn you, there's a reason I didn't pull it.

1640
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,420
It's a, you will hear hissy video

1641
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,780
of unintelligible five-year-olds.

1642
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,420
It's 45 seconds.

1643
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,780
Go to like the second half, essentially.

1644
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,620
There's a longer version.

1645
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,820
That's where you'll hear them attempt to explain,

1646
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,620
you don't know what does not happen on the avenue

1647
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,220
as in you're not really a kid.

1648
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,720
Next stop, afternoon avenue.

1649
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,720
Yeah, yeah.

1650
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,080
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1651
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,160
This is rad.

1652
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,560
What is it?

1653
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,560
What is it?

1654
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,600
You call yourself a kid?

1655
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,920
Radical.

1656
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,760
Let's take these kids in and show them.

1657
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,000
That's a big 10-4, good buddy.

1658
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,200
Let's go.

1659
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,840
Let's take these kids in.

1660
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,680
10.

1661
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,520
There is.

1662
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,000
That's a good 10-4, buddy.

1663
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,640
One of the funniest things about the Olsen twins

1664
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,800
is how bad of actors they were.

1665
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,640
Yeah.

1666
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,400
They were just really bad kid actors.

1667
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,200
They were chosen without ever thinking

1668
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,120
they would need to do lines,

1669
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,560
much less need to do many, many series of videos

1670
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,200
and their own shows and film.

1671
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,680
It's amazing where they came.

1672
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,080
An empire.

1673
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,600
It's amazing that they are billionaires, sure.

1674
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,080
Billionaires before they were 18,

1675
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,160
or at least millionaire.

1676
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,800
And the dignity that they have

1677
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,240
by not appearing on Fuller House.

1678
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,640
They deserve a lot of credit

1679
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,480
for not even being remotely tempted.

1680
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,320
We don't need it.

1681
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,160
For child actors, I think have had a pretty good,

1682
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,480
I mean, they had a little socialite age.

1683
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,200
Yeah, they had some socialite year,

1684
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,080
but I feel like they calmed down.

1685
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,920
They're not the best.

1686
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,120
There's some darkness.

1687
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,840
There's some darkness, but there's not the most darkness.

1688
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,640
You know what's the most darkness with them

1689
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,440
is when they hosted Saturday Night Live

1690
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,280
and then at the, in the good nights, and this is real,

1691
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,520
they say, all right, we had a great time hosting the show.

1692
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,520
Thanks to the cast.

1693
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,680
And hey, guess what?

1694
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,200
In 48 hours, we're legal.

1695
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,240
Yeah. Oh yeah.

1696
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,480
What a nightmare.

1697
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,080
Two weeks after the episode where Lindsay Lohan hosted

1698
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,400
and it was entirely about her, like,

1699
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,000
look how big her boobs are.

1700
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,400
And she was not 18. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1701
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,280
2004, a different time.

1702
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,280
That's dark.

1703
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,720
The Heath Ledger overdosing in the apartment

1704
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,400
is also pretty dark.

1705
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,360
One of the Olsen twins apartments, I believe.

1706
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,200
I'll double check this.

1707
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,240
I'll cut this out if that's wrong,

1708
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,200
but I'm pretty sure that's right.

1709
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,760
The version of that promo I was referencing.

1710
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,320
Patreon.

1711
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,640
The version I was referencing is three minutes, 43 seconds.

1712
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,920
Oh God, no, we don't need that.

1713
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,240
The dialogue's out the door.

1714
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,080
Is there a out the door?

1715
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,000
There is a quick, you got it, dude.

1716
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,840
Yeah.

1717
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,800
Their catchphrase.

1718
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,640
The catchphrase.

1719
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,040
Four year olds with a catchphrase.

1720
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:30,880
The catchphrase.

1721
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,720
It's pretty insane.

1722
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,040
And then there's clearly like professionally

1723
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,200
trained child dancers doing the heavy lifting.

1724
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,400
I think one of them might be one of the Maori twins, oddly.

1725
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,240
Yes, yes, yes.

1726
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,080
That does match up.

1727
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,920
Okay, yeah.

1728
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,760
I don't know which.

1729
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,080
Match up of the beloved sitcom twins of the 90s.

1730
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,320
But yeah, and they kind of stop appearing in it

1731
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,080
and there's like one shot of one of them

1732
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,640
looking really upset driving the utopia around.

1733
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,200
Like I bet it was like,

1734
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,800
we got the Olsen twins booked

1735
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,920
and they're gonna carry it and it'll be,

1736
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,680
and then as soon as the reality filming with,

1737
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,240
and both of them, there's a reason why

1738
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,000
they traded on and off.

1739
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,640
Because when one got upset, you bring in the other.

1740
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,480
Well yeah, and also you only have so many hours

1741
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,520
and then you have to do classes, you have to do schooling

1742
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,880
and then you gotta get them out of there.

1743
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,640
So it's a wonder that they were able to like

1744
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,640
turn around and act up a storm in things like

1745
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,160
something we should probably cover,

1746
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,520
the Mary Kate and Ashley mysteries

1747
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,400
where they investigate a mystery at Sea World.

1748
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,240
I know, yeah. Sure.

1749
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,080
We'll be doing that.

1750
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,640
That's fine.

1751
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,200
I thought you were gonna say every single one

1752
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,760
of their directed DHS movies.

1753
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,360
Well yeah, so you got mysteries and you got party.

1754
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,800
They had two series, both produced by

1755
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,640
Dual Star Entertainment.

1756
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,680
Is Dual Star still making anything?

1757
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,520
I'm not sure.

1758
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,520
Have you had a general at Dual Star lately?

1759
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,320
Yeah I know, I should see if I can get a general

1760
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,160
at Dual Star.

1761
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,280
You know, we're just really looking to expand

1762
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,320
beyond the twin brands, like you know,

1763
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,240
doing stuff about just single people.

1764
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,800
There's skeletons in the Dual Star archive.

1765
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,640
Oh my god.

1766
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,600
Metaphorical and literal probably.

1767
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,080
Dual Star, I only can get a general with Dual Star Digital.

1768
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,320
Their streaming platform.

1769
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,240
Their streaming platform that only plays on Fitbit.

1770
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,240
Yes, and only you can see it on Fitbit.

1771
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,440
The four by three.

1772
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,840
It's in only two colors.

1773
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,240
Yeah, but that's the way people actually

1774
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,560
wanna consume content.

1775
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,080
That's what they've actually discovered through marketing

1776
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,200
and questionnaires.

1777
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,280
We're all consuming content on our wrists, constantly.

1778
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,560
But we believe it can be more than the number of steps

1779
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,560
you've taken that day or how fast your heart's beating.

1780
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,880
We can tell a story.

1781
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,560
Honestly, just put the website up with that quote on it

1782
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,080
and people will, you'll get like inquiries probably.

1783
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,000
Now we're gonna get your heart beating

1784
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,800
with our compelling storytelling.

1785
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,600
Put it on the website and you'll probably get meetings

1786
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,840
with the writers, like you can pretend.

1787
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,120
This is simultaneously a joke and the reality we live in

1788
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,880
and this is all happening hours after I read the story

1789
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,600
of like live action Mulan stars comments spike boycott

1790
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,520
from Hong Kong protesters.

1791
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,480
And I'm like, oh god.

1792
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,240
The Disney live action remakes

1793
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,880
are affecting geopolitical events.

1794
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,360
What is going on?

1795
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,440
What a time.

1796
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,280
What a time.

1797
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,120
Oh boy.

1798
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,960
But this, see that's what I'm saying.

1799
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,800
The 90s.

1800
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,640
The 90s.

1801
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,760
The more just fun and innocent.

1802
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,480
With stuff like, I don't think, I saw a promo

1803
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,280
that explained everything you could do

1804
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,440
at Disneyland afternoon Avenue.

1805
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,880
And I think I forgot that there was a arcade

1806
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,480
that was outdoors in sort of a little like Glen,

1807
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,200
little gummy Glen area.

1808
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:52,080
And it sort of utilizes the aesthetic of Videopolis,

1809
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,960
which made me really happy to see more of that.

1810
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,480
The Videopolis stage still there.

1811
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,000
The Videopolis train station still there.

1812
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,320
Although turned into.

1813
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,480
They did a redo for this.

1814
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,680
They were calling it the Disney afternoon train station.

1815
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,000
But yeah, it was still Videopolis.

1816
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
They temporarily sadly changed the name of the little cafe

1817
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,600
from Yums with a Z to Louie's.

1818
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,880
That's fun too.

1819
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,080
But there was an outdoor arcade

1820
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,800
and look at this logo Videocade.

1821
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,200
Oh, music to my eyes.

1822
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,160
That logo, the multiple fonts.

1823
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,320
You got some neon on there.

1824
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,120
Presented by Capcom.

1825
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,840
And that was a way that Disney could feature

1826
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,680
the then new Capcom video games

1827
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,160
for Chip and Dale Duck Tales and Tailspin.

1828
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,000
Perfect.

1829
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,920
I have a quick little clip from one of those.

1830
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,880
This news report that I watched about a kid who,

1831
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,960
it was a news report from Portland, I believe.

1832
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,280
Portland native who won his local semi-finals

1833
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,200
of the Capcom Videocade contest

1834
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,640
to go play in the finals at Disneyland

1835
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,200
that he would eventually win, I believe.

1836
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,520
Wow. Impressive.

1837
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,520
But this little clip explaining the goals

1838
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,520
of these several games.

1839
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,440
In Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers,

1840
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,880
players try to collect the most flowers.

1841
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,760
In Tailspin, getting the most points is crucial.

1842
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,800
While the game Duck Tales challenges kids

1843
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,120
to collect the most money.

1844
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:18,960
Just...

1845
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,800
I said that.

1846
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,040
In Chip and Dale, it is flowers.

1847
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,960
In Chip and Dale, you would jump on top of objects

1848
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,320
and pick them up and throw them at the bad guys.

1849
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,760
You would jump on top of an apple

1850
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,920
and throw a giant apple at someone.

1851
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:33,760
It was fun.

1852
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,440
Apple's also affected into the Aladdin video game,

1853
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,280
which I was making.

1854
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,320
Oh yeah, the Genesis one.

1855
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,560
Yeah, that was kind of what,

1856
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,360
he had the little counter of apples.

1857
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,240
Yes, you kept collecting apples.

1858
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:46,480
He's so hungry, but he has to use them to protect himself.

1859
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,720
A precursor to Jar Jar Binks.

1860
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,560
Oh, sure.

1861
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,400
With the lust for apples.

1862
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,120
I just bought the Disney,

1863
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,400
there was a Disney afternoon collection.

1864
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,760
It was not the remastered Duck Tales,

1865
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,600
but for like four or five dollars on PS4,

1866
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,880
I got Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck,

1867
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,160
Tailspin and Rescue Rangers.

1868
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,000
All these games?

1869
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,840
All the original, yeah.

1870
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:04,880
Eight-bit games.

1871
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,720
Huh, huh.

1872
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,040
Well, now you know when you play it,

1873
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,040
if you're playing Tailspin, points are key.

1874
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:11,960
Points. Got it.

1875
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,320
Not, stay away from flowers.

1876
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,000
Right, no flowers.

1877
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,120
Blue doesn't care about flowers.

1878
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,560
And Duck Tales is what, money?

1879
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,120
Money. Money.

1880
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,120
Getting the most money is key.

1881
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,440
Uh-huh.

1882
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,080
Those games, I only own Darkwing Duck Game as a child.

1883
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:28,920
That was good.

1884
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,800
I think I did too.

1885
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,640
But I didn't have the other ones,

1886
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,480
and we would rent them,

1887
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,760
and we would go to like the pharmacy far more.

1888
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,600
And I would just be,

1889
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,440
because they never had the good games at like Blockbuster.

1890
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,880
They'd always be out of them.

1891
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,760
And Far More, which quickly went out of business

1892
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,360
is my recollection.

1893
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,180
And-

1894
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,020
They would rent games?

1895
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:47,960
They would rent games.

1896
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,440
It was in one Schomburg place,

1897
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,640
which is an offshoot mall of Woodfield.

1898
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,480
That only lasted for-

1899
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,520
Oh, my friend, just explain this to me

1900
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,800
that there was a second, there was an adjacent.

1901
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,560
And now it's called Streets of Woodfield, it's outdoors.

1902
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,440
It's good, it's good.

1903
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,800
There's a Game Works, a movie theater, fine.

1904
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,240
But Streets of Woodfield was where it's at.

1905
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,720
They had, was it was the child?

1906
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,560
I'm trying to think of,

1907
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,560
there's another toy store in there

1908
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,280
that was totally new to me,

1909
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,300
which is where I got several Darkwing Duck toys.

1910
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,460
And that place was fantastic.

1911
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,080
Where'd you get your videos as a kid?

1912
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,460
You were Far More-

1913
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,300
Well, not all-

1914
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,520
Video games or Far More.

1915
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,800
I could count on Far More having the games like DuckTales

1916
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,680
that I wanted to rent.

1917
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,560
But Family Video was the place we would go to,

1918
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,160
which is still there.

1919
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,440
Family Video's still open.

1920
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,280
Fantastic.

1921
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,720
Okay, First Memory is a very small,

1922
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,720
it was a chain, West Coast video.

1923
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1924
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,920
And then it was a big deal

1925
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:52,160
when the one borough in my town got a big blockbuster.

1926
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:57,160
And that was, we would stop a lot after church,

1927
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,200
because it was on the way to and from church.

1928
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,920
So we would run in afterwards

1929
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,720
and then get stuff for a few days.

1930
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:06,280
Or if we picked it up on Friday night,

1931
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,240
then we'd probably be returning it on Sunday a lot of time.

1932
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,080
Cool, cool.

1933
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
Not a lot of time too.

1934
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,200
You really had a timer to watch and play stuff

1935
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,380
for those first few years of like two day rentals

1936
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,220
at Blockbuster.

1937
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,060
Oh yeah, yeah.

1938
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:21,080
I would try to blast through a game in two days.

1939
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:21,920
Jeez.

1940
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,640
Video Take One was mine.

1941
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,960
Video Take One.

1942
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,360
A lot of fondness for that name, yeah.

1943
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,080
And much better than Blockbuster.

1944
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,640
And had weird garbage,

1945
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,360
they have an Italian sex comedy that I rented as a teen

1946
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:37,720
that I'm still really fond of called The Sex Machine.

1947
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,800
That's about a world where all energy has been depleted

1948
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,040
and a scientist uses the power of sex to,

1949
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,720
and it's the future of 1999.

1950
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,120
And it's a weird, it's like much like the 70s,

1951
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,000
except everybody just,

1952
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,920
they decided everybody wears ponchos in this future.

1953
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,600
That's actually a documentary.

1954
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,560
Italy is powered entirely by Eros, by sexual energy.

1955
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,520
Wow.

1956
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,360
Gave him the idea.

1957
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,840
I wonder if it's based on Lindsay and I watched

1958
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,960
and there's two of these,

1959
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,000
Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine,

1960
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,200
a Vincent Price movie from the 60s, I believe.

1961
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,520
Yeah, you would put that on sometimes, years ago.

1962
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,440
Yeah, so it's a weird movie where Vincent Price

1963
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,780
like makes women in a machine, I think.

1964
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,620
But there's two of them.

1965
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,640
It's like Return of Gold, I forget what the second one is.

1966
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,680
For sure what Vincent Price would want.

1967
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,520
Yes, 100%.

1968
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,480
Beautiful women.

1969
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,920
Yes, he loved the women.

1970
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:34,120
Bikinis as skimpy as possible.

1971
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,920
We had a number of video store,

1972
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,960
after Blockbuster, a few years after Blockbuster,

1973
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,160
competition showed up and it was called Movies.

1974
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,800
And then the cow,

1975
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,640
Whoa!

1976
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,320
There was a cow mascot.

1977
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,400
And then eventually something happened,

1978
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,240
I think got merged with another company

1979
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,200
and it changed to the much less interesting name,

1980
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,560
Video Update.

1981
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,720
And then that got absorbed by Hollywood Video,

1982
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,200
Blockbuster's big competitor.

1983
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,720
Right, we had Hollywood Video.

1984
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,280
Went out of business first, I think.

1985
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,120
Yeah.

1986
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,560
So we were mostly, yeah, family, I'm trying to think.

1987
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,000
We had Hollywood Video too, that for a little while,

1988
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,920
it was a short-lived, I feel like, Hollywood Video.

1989
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:13,760
I could be wrong.

1990
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,640
My mom will, this is the type of thing my mom will call

1991
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,760
and tell me about.

1992
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,600
She won't be like,

1993
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,280
you know what, that was a really funny episode or anything.

1994
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:24,120
She'll just be like, Hollywood Video lasted for 10 years.

1995
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,360
She'll say that and then she'll be like,

1996
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,160
your voice sounded good, you enunciate very well.

1997
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,360
Does she critique your performance?

1998
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,960
Only when it comes to,

1999
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,800
Yes, exclusively.

2000
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,200
Only when it, yeah, when it comes to enunciation,

2001
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,120
getting facts right.

2002
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:38,960
Whoa.

2003
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,840
And like the quality, but she will be like,

2004
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,080
you know, you have a very nice,

2005
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,400
she'll say, you all have a very nice voice,

2006
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,360
you have a very nice speaking voice,

2007
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,400
but it's never like, oh, that was funny or entertaining.

2008
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,640
She's just like listening, wanting to grade me,

2009
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,440
I think on like the basics of it,

2010
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,640
just tone quality, accuracy.

2011
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Any other like hiccups that have come up?

2012
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,280
Well, she, I'm trying to think,

2013
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,240
she will, I'm trying to think she'll correct like a word.

2014
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,080
She'll say like, you know,

2015
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,160
I don't think you use that word correctly.

2016
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,720
I'm trying to think of exactly what that, yeah.

2017
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,360
I'm trying to think, I can't think of a good example.

2018
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,840
She thinks that I,

2019
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,840
my story that I told a couple months ago

2020
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,840
was that on Snow White, I said my eyes are shut too tight.

2021
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,520
She claims it's toad that I said it on,

2022
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,520
and then we went on toad first.

2023
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,880
But my memory in my head and could be mixing stuff up

2024
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:36,600
is that I saw the witch right around the same time

2025
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,280
I said that, but I could be missing.

2026
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,600
So that's the type of thing I'm saying.

2027
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,680
She'll like, maybe she recalls

2028
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,080
that the family vacation went differently.

2029
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:45,920
And then she'll also like,

2030
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,760
and my dad will lightly complain about me acting like

2031
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,760
I ruined their child, the right,

2032
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,760
they ruined my childhood by depriving me of things.

2033
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,600
Oh, so let's get that out there.

2034
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,320
Like, I don't think they like when I, yeah.

2035
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,840
They don't think they like that when I say like,

2036
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,960
I thought I would never go to California.

2037
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,880
Like there was no way.

2038
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,960
That doesn't seem like an indictment of them.

2039
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,440
That seems like it like, oh, you were a very neurotic child.

2040
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,280
Yeah.

2041
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,680
You were already war children clearly.

2042
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,280
Yeah, I'm not trying to indict them,

2043
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,680
but I do think it was like, we go one place,

2044
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,920
we go there every three years and that's it.

2045
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,920
There's just a rigidity.

2046
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,800
Now she's going to be mad at me for saying that we're wrong.

2047
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,640
Well, there's a routine, you know.

2048
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,520
You're doing a dance between them and us and the audience.

2049
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,360
Yeah.

2050
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,800
You're in a corner now.

2051
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,640
Yeah.

2052
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,480
I just think like-

2053
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,640
Consistency, repeatability, traditions.

2054
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,480
It's comforting for them.

2055
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2056
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,240
The box wasn't opened a lot is all I was saying.

2057
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,840
And I don't, that's not a, I'm not really trying to cry.

2058
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,960
I'm just, look, I'm making fun light

2059
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,520
of my childhood for content.

2060
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,000
Sure, you're exaggerating.

2061
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,840
Yeah.

2062
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,520
Aspects of it for comedic effect.

2063
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,360
Yeah, sure I am.

2064
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,200
Got it.

2065
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,040
That's-

2066
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,880
I'm exaggerating all of it.

2067
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,760
Let me ask this, what does your mom think of Bugsy?

2068
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:01,760
Uh, my mom has never mentioned Bugsy.

2069
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,800
I'd like to get that report.

2070
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:08,280
I don't know if she's actually heard the first one.

2071
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,160
And I don't know the live,

2072
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,280
I don't know if she heard the live episode.

2073
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,720
I assume she did.

2074
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,480
My dad likes Bugsy.

2075
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,080
I know that.

2076
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,680
I know my dad likes Bugsy.

2077
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,760
Mm-hmm.

2078
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,800
I know he said he almost spit out his drink

2079
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,360
during the first one on a certain line.

2080
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,360
And you can guess which line that was.

2081
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,120
So yeah.

2082
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,960
Fill his mouth with jewels instead.

2083
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,760
This is, well, I want to avoid these kinds of pitfalls.

2084
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,400
And that's why I'll stay in the world

2085
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,800
where my parents do not get a smartphone

2086
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,120
and thus do not listen to this podcast.

2087
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,600
What a luxury.

2088
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,600
Yeah, it's a little bit,

2089
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,560
I don't know why I'm wanting them to get one.

2090
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,600
Have you been pushing for it?

2091
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,240
Other than that, I think they, you know,

2092
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,320
there's a way to get around town

2093
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,480
that isn't the Thomas Guide.

2094
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,040
Oh wow, really?

2095
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,600
When I came out here for college,

2096
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,920
for like that semester in college,

2097
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,000
they were like, very first thing you have to do,

2098
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,680
get a bank account at the Bank of America down the street

2099
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,520
and second, get a Thomas Guide.

2100
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,360
Yeah.

2101
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,440
I have it.

2102
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,640
Yeah, I got my Thomas Guide.

2103
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,320
When we moved, when we were on one,

2104
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,640
we would have moved out here,

2105
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,640
which is a decade, over a decade ago.

2106
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,560
I had a map and then like when I was doing runs

2107
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,680
for the CW network, I had to go to MapQuest

2108
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,680
and I printed out where I was going.

2109
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,480
Sure, but that was, we all did that to some extent.

2110
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,120
I just, my parents still do this.

2111
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,160
Well, no, that's wild.

2112
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,560
Yeah, and they just like drove up the coast and back

2113
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,080
that way and not with a...

2114
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,040
Well, that one I understand,

2115
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,840
coast only goes one to two ways.

2116
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,680
Hey, good point.

2117
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,760
Yeah, that's a simpler one.

2118
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,600
North or south.

2119
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,440
Up or down, yeah.

2120
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,280
Ocean left.

2121
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,040
Don't need no phone to help you with that.

2122
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,080
Yeah, interesting.

2123
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,560
Okay, we gotta get back to this thing.

2124
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,200
I don't, you know, I don't have much to say about

2125
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,080
the cruise to Gummy Glen or Rescue Rangers Raceway

2126
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,480
because these are not documented.

2127
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,320
Not documented.

2128
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,400
Yeah, I know, that's sad.

2129
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,480
Yeah, I wish they were more.

2130
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,640
I ended up finding some photos

2131
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,920
of motorboat cruise to Gummy Glen.

2132
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,320
This was a, motorboat cruise is a pretty nothing ride.

2133
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,480
So to add, that was a big plus up to have like anything.

2134
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,520
But still it was essentially, you know, wooden cutouts.

2135
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,200
But still fun little scenarios.

2136
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,680
A nothing ride but a three hour episode.

2137
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2138
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,440
Is this the picture?

2139
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,800
I don't think I've seen that one.

2140
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,760
That's a motorboat and it's just like, there's a flat.

2141
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,160
It's very flat and it's like kind of nothing.

2142
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:28,280
Yeah, but to me as a kid, not having a level

2143
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,240
that I was seeking to hit yet and being too, you know,

2144
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,400
it's six, I'm not going on the coasters or anything.

2145
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,920
Like this was super thrilling.

2146
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,760
I loved it all.

2147
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,400
And also, the motorboat cruise to Gummy Glen,

2148
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,440
a ride where you see bears make berries into products,

2149
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,080
oddly akin to Knott's Berry Tales.

2150
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:47,920
Yeah. Yeah.

2151
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,760
A while back.

2152
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,040
Kind of a cousin of that.

2153
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:53,240
Industrious creatures, business minded folk.

2154
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:58,200
I wonder if Michael Eisner ever went on Berry Tales.

2155
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,440
Maybe.

2156
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,000
Like I wonder if that was in his head with the gummy bears.

2157
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,400
Like, you know, Disney can do this better, more efficiently.

2158
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,120
With wood and not.

2159
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:07,960
Right.

2160
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,080
I'm trying to spike that hippie Raleigh Crump.

2161
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,160
Right.

2162
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,880
There's some really great,

2163
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,120
there's a blog with some like great pictures of like,

2164
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,240
dad, a dad and I don't know whose dad this is,

2165
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,920
but a dad, a child and launch pad.

2166
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,680
Like just perfect 90s photos.

2167
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,440
Do you have, Scott, do you have any photos of you

2168
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,280
as a little kid with the characters?

2169
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,120
I do.

2170
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,120
I haven't had a chance to dig around for them,

2171
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,840
but I for sure do.

2172
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,040
Yesterland had this great picture of,

2173
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,840
what are the guys from, what are these guys named?

2174
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,680
The Beagle Boys.

2175
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,520
The Beagle Boys, yes.

2176
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,360
Beagle.

2177
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,480
The Beagle Boys.

2178
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:44,720
And next to him.

2179
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,080
I'm not C.H. Jason.

2180
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:46,920
The next to him.

2181
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:47,920
Your mom's gonna be mad at you.

2182
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,680
Is a guy just a.

2183
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:50,520
Oh, that's a great picture too.

2184
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,720
There's a couple of guys, it's just a guy,

2185
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,960
but it's just, they just look like a couple of kings.

2186
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,680
They just both look like they're on top of the world.

2187
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,520
Couple of kings.

2188
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,000
Couple of kings, a Beagle Boy and then a dad.

2189
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,160
There's an inherently like visual quality to this stuff

2190
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,800
that makes it a little challenging to talk about

2191
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,400
on a podcast, but it's so, if anybody didn't get to go

2192
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,280
and you look at pictures of this,

2193
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:14,080
so you'll be instantly jealous you didn't get to go.

2194
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,920
Yeah, they.

2195
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,600
Just so bright and vibrant in the, all the 90s,

2196
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,640
it was the most 90s thing Disneyland had done,

2197
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,720
or it's still pretty new into the 90s.

2198
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,400
Yeah, the pictures do a good job.

2199
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:29,600
I do have to call out, a couple places did this.

2200
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,160
I don't know why we were talking earlier about

2201
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,480
like weird language in terms of Ballou's dressing room.

2202
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,320
Weird language again, the fandom page for this event

2203
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,360
describes it as, here's the attraction that celebrates

2204
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,400
Disney's successful entry into

2205
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,240
afternoon syndicated television,

2206
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:50,800
which is the driest way to describe it.

2207
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,800
But then on yesterland, the, for advice has the same,

2208
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,040
the park is celebrating Disney's successful entry

2209
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,080
into afternoon syndicated television.

2210
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,760
So maybe that was just the press release, but.

2211
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,080
Like kids TV, I would have just said like afternoon,

2212
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,480
kids TV, like.

2213
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,880
Resistant, resistant affiliates will be defeated.

2214
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,800
The Disney nights show no mercy.

2215
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,840
Yeah, it's very stiff.

2216
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,520
It's very formal.

2217
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,160
Yeah, I know that's not what it is.

2218
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,320
It's where the kids get to bounce with the gummies,

2219
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,960
with Zummy.

2220
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,720
You know, this is a little, this is certainly a side note.

2221
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,440
I just remembered, I should have brought this up earlier.

2222
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,280
I didn't think about this, but on tailspin,

2223
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,240
let me read the characters names to you.

2224
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,240
Yes.

2225
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,720
These are just the first five that pop up.

2226
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,400
And then no particular order,

2227
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,120
even though yes it is in an order.

2228
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,400
Ballou, Don Carnage.

2229
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,240
Yeah.

2230
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,600
Kit Cloud Kicker.

2231
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,440
Yeah.

2232
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,480
Wildcat, Rebecca Cunningham.

2233
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,120
Do you see something here?

2234
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2235
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,200
This is the Helen test.

2236
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,040
Yeah.

2237
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,880
It's back.

2238
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:00,720
It's back.

2239
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:04,160
The female character has a less fun name

2240
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,520
than the male characters.

2241
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,920
Yeah, yeah.

2242
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:11,920
You know, we just got an email that was proposing that

2243
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,360
via Claire Dearing, of course, from Jurassic World,

2244
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,240
her theory was that Claire is the new, like,

2245
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:25,160
boring name meant to be, like, apparently thoughtful.

2246
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,480
Let me find this email really quick.

2247
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,440
I saw this too, and I get the theory.

2248
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,880
Sean Urie sent it.

2249
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,160
I get the theory behind it, but the examples they gave

2250
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,640
stretched over a 30 year period.

2251
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,000
So not exactly perfect,

2252
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,600
but you might be onto something, Sean.

2253
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,400
Like, let me read the other names.

2254
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,760
I'm just going down the list.

2255
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:50,240
Ballou, Louie, Don Carnage, Kit Cloud Kicker,

2256
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:53,480
Wildcat, Mad Dog, Dump Truck,

2257
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,640
Cher Khan, Colonel Ivanod Spigot,

2258
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,760
Sergeant Dunder, Colonel Grog, Ice Cream Man,

2259
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,800
Barney O'Turrett, Buzz, and then the two female characters,

2260
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,240
Rebecca Cunningham and Molly Cunningham.

2261
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,920
Yep, I think this is a Helen Tess scenario.

2262
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,240
I think this is for sure a Helen Tess scenario.

2263
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:15,680
And those characters do not appear in Plain Crazy.

2264
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,520
Right.

2265
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,360
Yep.

2266
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,240
Yes, they're walk-around characters, though, I believe, right?

2267
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,080
Or what Rebecca is?

2268
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,880
Yeah, I believe I had a picture with Rebecca.

2269
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,600
I think I liked Rebecca a lot

2270
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,560
because she reminded me of my mom.

2271
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,160
She seems like a figure I could trust, like my mom.

2272
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,000
I get that.

2273
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,160
If I was in trouble, I would turn to Rebecca.

2274
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,000
This happened to-

2275
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,920
Rebecca Cunningham.

2276
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,480
Famously an X-Men, of course.

2277
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,800
I mean, she's had code names, but it was all, you know,

2278
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,040
in the 90s, I always thought, oh, Cyclops Beast,

2279
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,920
Wolverine, Jean Grey.

2280
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,520
They would just call her Jean Grey.

2281
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,800
I wrote something- They switched though,

2282
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,800
because it was-

2283
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,720
She was Phoenix and Marvel Girl

2284
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,080
and all of these other things.

2285
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,520
Marvel Girl, much better, obviously.

2286
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,960
But yeah, the 90s, she was Jean Grey.

2287
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,360
And then they started calling her Phoenix again.

2288
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,160
I wrote something once with superheroes,

2289
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,200
where everyone has a cool nickname,

2290
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,760
and then there's just a guy named Eric Henderson.

2291
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,520
So I gender-squat-ed him, but that was my refer,

2292
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,520
that was my nod to the weird,

2293
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,960
when there's just a weird full name person.

2294
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,560
You know who this test does not apply to

2295
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,920
is Gadget of Chip and Dale.

2296
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,760
Until researching this episode,

2297
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,360
I didn't know Gadget's last name.

2298
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,200
Do you guys know?

2299
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,200
Oh, I don't.

2300
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,800
Gadget Hackwrench.

2301
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,640
That's good.

2302
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,480
Hell yeah.

2303
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,800
That is good, yeah, thank God that works.

2304
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,120
I don't think that's even in my brain.

2305
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,320
Yeah, I don't recall that ever being said.

2306
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:43,040
Yeah, maybe I would have known on a very specific day

2307
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,880
as a seven-year-old, but not now.

2308
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,640
One odd thing about Gadget's presence

2309
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,920
in Disney Afternoon Avenue,

2310
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,840
here's a photo of regular Gadget, you know,

2311
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,280
bright, wide-eyed.

2312
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,560
Did you notice Gadget?

2313
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,040
Oh, I did notice Gadget.

2314
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,040
Her eyelids are half down.

2315
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,520
Aaron said it looks like she's on Quaaludes.

2316
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,040
She seems really sedated.

2317
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,400
I don't know what's wrong with Park Gadget.

2318
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,760
Yeah, I mean, it could be anything.

2319
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,280
But Gadget, one of the only characters

2320
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,680
from Disney Afternoon that still has a ride.

2321
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:19,640
Yeah.

2322
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,600
One of the only pieces of representation, you're right.

2323
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,520
Aside from, I mean, the goof troop occasional presence

2324
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,920
feels way more about a goofy movie.

2325
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,760
Yes, for sure.

2326
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,040
It feels separate to me.

2327
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,040
Yeah, you're right.

2328
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,600
Gadget stuck around, and you get the Gadget instructions

2329
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,160
before you take off, the great Trish MacNeil.

2330
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,400
You know, the voice actors,

2331
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,320
and there's been weirdness with Jim Cummings

2332
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,360
in the respect, but I think we can say Jim Cummings.

2333
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,960
Holy shit, he's all the voice actors.

2334
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,800
He's everybody, yeah.

2335
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,160
We're talking about, and within the Plane Crazy show,

2336
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,920
he's Don Carnage and Fat Cat and Louie.

2337
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,760
Right.

2338
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:57,680
Same.

2339
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,840
Plane Crazy and interesting, like,

2340
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,840
the name of it is a nod to the first Mickey short,

2341
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,600
but it, and it does have planes in it,

2342
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,000
but that's such like an odd postmodern,

2343
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,800
like it's called Plane Crazy.

2344
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,600
Oh yeah, like first, but it's not related

2345
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,440
to that first Mickey short at all.

2346
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,400
It's just a reference.

2347
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,960
Just a reference without any significance, besides planes.

2348
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:22,800
Yeah.

2349
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:27,800
But the show is a lot of fun.

2350
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,680
Did you guys watch our performance of Plane Crazy?

2351
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,720
Like I said, it was somewhat terrifying to me

2352
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,760
to be in that close of proximity to Fat Cat.

2353
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,200
Were you more scared of Don Carnage or Fat Cat?

2354
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,280
I think Don Carnage.

2355
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,520
I'm not sure.

2356
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,400
Fat Cat's bringing in my head more

2357
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,120
as the one to be scared of.

2358
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:47,960
Right.

2359
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,720
Don Carnage seemed like goofier to me in a way.

2360
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:54,680
He's, so he's like a, he's a Fernando,

2361
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:58,440
he's a Billy Crystal Fernando-esque character for sure.

2362
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,640
My mom tried to give me the history of Fernando.

2363
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,480
That happened once when I was like, yeah, he didn't.

2364
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:06,520
She like told me the actor she thinks that's based on.

2365
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,440
Is it Fernando Lamas?

2366
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,640
Yeah, I think.

2367
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,760
And she's like, oh, you know, that's,

2368
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,800
you were talking about that

2369
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,280
and I think you were looking for Fernando Lamas.

2370
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,480
I was like, oh, okay.

2371
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:18,080
We like, we didn't understand what Fernando was all about.

2372
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,440
Right, I think we were just like,

2373
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,440
you know, when you would say it every week,

2374
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,120
I think we were sort of just like kind of goofing on,

2375
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,000
is that actually that funny for the most part?

2376
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,320
Like, do people really like,

2377
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,480
I think they actually did really like it.

2378
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,880
But anyway, yeah, that was the gist.

2379
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,400
Anyway, that struck my memory.

2380
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:39,920
So, Playing Crazy is a tale where all of the characters

2381
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:47,480
come together to solve a US government problem.

2382
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,640
Seems that they get recruited by the Air Force

2383
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,720
or the FBI and Air Force themed attire.

2384
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:57,520
Well, and it's the whatever agency it is,

2385
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,760
they're in like the biggest shoulder padded outfit,

2386
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:01,600
seemingly possible.

2387
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,400
Yes, and there's like some original music.

2388
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,240
Yeah, I think Monkey C, Monkey D is a jam.

2389
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,880
Yeah, it's pretty good.

2390
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,080
I wish there was, that's one that's like not like

2391
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,320
saved anywhere.

2392
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,040
I mean, there's a lot of stuff from live shows

2393
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:17,880
that aren't saved, like,

2394
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,840
because there's some decent archives

2395
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,240
or there's some decent collections of park music

2396
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:25,600
and a little obscure park music, but nothing, this stuff,

2397
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,680
I wonder if there's even a good recording of this somewhere.

2398
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,760
Like did they ever film it pro?

2399
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,320
Well, that for sure, but like at least just the audio,

2400
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,640
like the demo of it, like does that stuff exist?

2401
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:40,040
Like that would be an archive collection

2402
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,480
I would be very interested in.

2403
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,320
Yeah.

2404
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,280
It's like all the different lives, live shows,

2405
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,240
the demos of the live shows.

2406
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,440
Yeah, when I hear Disney demos.

2407
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,720
Yeah, well, there's all those versions

2408
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,360
of Universe of Energy that we found

2409
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,360
and like one does sound like a demo and I don't know,

2410
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,960
maybe that was actually played in the exit queue,

2411
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,640
but like there's three different versions

2412
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,520
and I'm not sure where they all are placed

2413
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,720
in the history of the ride, but yeah, there's never.

2414
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,440
When we're digging through Disney demo bootlegs.

2415
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,680
The show's gonna get really good.

2416
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,360
Then we're gonna be very engaged.

2417
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,600
Tapiss here, you can see they haven't quite

2418
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,480
cracked the bridge yet, but.

2419
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,960
That seems like it's the inevitable transformation

2420
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,920
of this just becoming a prog rock podcast.

2421
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,080
That's where it's slowly heading.

2422
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,400
It slowly becomes.

2423
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,680
We'll lose you at some point, you just drift away.

2424
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,920
Start a far more successful tree based podcast.

2425
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:37,920
But somehow I still get my share of money.

2426
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,320
I'm like the manager.

2427
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,200
Like I've created some sort of insane contract.

2428
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,680
You've made it clear.

2429
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,680
I'm not here, but it is called Jason Sheridan's podcast.

2430
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,480
It seems odd that we would agree to that, but okay.

2431
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,480
We already signed some contract we don't know about

2432
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,800
where this is inevitable.

2433
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,400
You tricked us like Ursula.

2434
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,600
I was gonna say it's like Ursula's contract.

2435
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,320
I knew when you brought your eel friends around.

2436
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:11,000
Those guys are cool, they're just fans.

2437
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,560
They're just fans, I assure you.

2438
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,680
Super cool guys.

2439
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,400
You met them at an estate sale.

2440
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,480
You met them at Josef Kahn's estate sale.

2441
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,280
I met them at Ursula's estate sale.

2442
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,120
Show some respect.

2443
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,840
That bucket had a soul in it once.

2444
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,640
Until she dumped it out, flushed it down the toilet.

2445
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,440
You could probably buy some souls at her estate sale.

2446
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,280
Yeah.

2447
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,120
Souls that she took.

2448
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:34,940
Yeah.

2449
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:35,780
Does Ursula do that sometimes?

2450
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,340
She runs out of jars and like, fuck it.

2451
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:40,820
Whatever's around.

2452
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:42,460
A diet Pepsi bottle.

2453
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,780
Feeds them to flotsam and jetsam.

2454
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:46,260
Here you go, boys.

2455
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:52,260
The plot of the plane crazy is that Don Carnage

2456
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:55,500
and Fat Cat have stolen the X-22 spy plane.

2457
01:29:55,500 --> 01:30:00,180
It's an experimental plane and they shrunk it.

2458
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:05,180
They shrunk a jet and Baloo and Chip and Dale

2459
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,500
someone else have to get them back.

2460
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,020
Who else, who's in the show?

2461
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,100
Louie shows up at some point.

2462
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,220
There's no women in the show.

2463
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:17,620
Gummy bears, yeah, there's no female characters.

2464
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:25,020
Except the Baloo and Chip and Dale wear hula skirts

2465
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,820
and that's as close as you get to a female character.

2466
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:30,020
Which they do in the opening to the show.

2467
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:30,940
Yes.

2468
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:32,220
That's a thing, that's a setup.

2469
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:33,460
So they're using that.

2470
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,500
So you would identify that as,

2471
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:37,180
oh, I know where that's from.

2472
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:38,500
Yeah, yeah.

2473
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,100
And Don Carnage and Fat Cat are tricked by this.

2474
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:41,940
Right, yes.

2475
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:43,860
Baloo does not alter his face in any way

2476
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,060
nor did Chip and Dale.

2477
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:46,540
Cause in the opening they put like a,

2478
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:48,980
he puts like a coconut over his face to obscure it

2479
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:50,300
I think when they're in disguise

2480
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:52,420
but they don't, they didn't have the budget for that.

2481
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:55,460
No, no, no, no, to get a coconut mask.

2482
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:59,540
So the main, the heroes who the villains are obsessed

2483
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:02,260
with thwarting, they don't recognize them

2484
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:04,140
once they put on a skirt.

2485
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:05,220
Yeah. Right.

2486
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:06,780
I'm just clarifying.

2487
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,300
Just making sure I'm not getting any details.

2488
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:12,260
It's also the logic, like they're gonna take all the cookies

2489
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:13,980
in the world.

2490
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:16,740
This is a real crisis and then all the heroes come out

2491
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:18,580
and just sing about friendship.

2492
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:20,340
You think they'd be a little more pressed.

2493
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:21,180
Yeah.

2494
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:22,820
You're a little bit upset that you don't feel

2495
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:24,340
that they're urgency in that problem.

2496
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:27,460
I don't think they're treating the espionage angle

2497
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,180
with enough seriousness.

2498
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:30,020
Right.

2499
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:33,820
I was thinking how if some foreign entity,

2500
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:38,300
if Iran shrunk a US plane, that would be plenty

2501
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,660
for us to go to war with them.

2502
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:41,500
Yes, right.

2503
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,620
That's absolutely enough of a hostile act.

2504
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,460
Yeah, for sure.

2505
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:46,940
We shrunk a plane, you can unshrink it with water

2506
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:49,620
but no, who cares, bomb them, they're done, bomb them.

2507
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,300
Yes, that is probably what would happen.

2508
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:54,860
Well, until it's discovered a day later that it's like,

2509
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:57,300
oh, actually it was the CIA who shrunk,

2510
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:00,020
a bumbling CIA agent shrunk the plane.

2511
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:01,500
Who cares, close enough, come on.

2512
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,300
We haven't done a war in so long.

2513
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,460
It's time.

2514
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,980
So antsy.

2515
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,420
What would John Bolton have done

2516
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:11,260
if he was in the playing crazy show?

2517
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:14,460
John Bolton does look like a cartoon stunt show villain.

2518
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:15,860
Yeah, for sure he does.

2519
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:19,500
Yeah, he really, I'm trying to think which one,

2520
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,820
which of the Disney afternoon cartoons John Bolton

2521
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:23,100
would fit right in with.

2522
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,260
I wanna say- Come along, Chippendale.

2523
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:29,580
John Bolton's got a mission for us.

2524
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:35,540
I was gonna say, I feel like he's more of a DuckTales villain.

2525
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:36,500
Yeah.

2526
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,300
Maybe, I don't know why that is.

2527
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:41,740
Maybe just because of like the, he's not that he's wealthy

2528
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:43,060
or maybe he probably is honestly wealthy.

2529
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:46,340
His name was John Beakton, then yes.

2530
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:49,900
John Beakton, he helps get the Beagle Boys out of prison

2531
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,820
in one episode and not Mob Beagle.

2532
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:55,340
He's married to Mob Beagle?

2533
01:32:57,340 --> 01:32:59,060
That's a good way to get him in, yeah.

2534
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:01,380
Did Mob Beagle ever have a husband?

2535
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,780
One of, I'm not sure.

2536
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:03,860
So yeah, sure, yeah, why not?

2537
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:04,700
Yeah.

2538
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,860
Yeah, so it's John Bolton.

2539
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:07,380
Cause like the Beagle Boys were all supposedly

2540
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:10,540
Mob Beagle's kids, I believe.

2541
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:14,340
Or she just was the gang leader and she called them her boys

2542
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:17,460
and she'd always like put a nail, like a file into the cake

2543
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,460
to get them out of prison.

2544
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,740
Cause they were always locked up.

2545
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:20,580
Yeah.

2546
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:24,740
So they're extradited and one of them ends up in the cabinet.

2547
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:26,020
Yes.

2548
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:28,100
John Bolton may be like their stepfather.

2549
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,700
The Beagle Boys' stepfather.

2550
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,380
So yeah, then like later they all,

2551
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:35,620
they're all in a Republican administration.

2552
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:38,660
Webby is killed, Trump speaks at the funeral

2553
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:40,460
and gets her name wrong.

2554
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:41,820
Wendy, everybody loved Wendy.

2555
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:42,660
We love Wendy.

2556
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:45,500
Isabella Gray, everybody loved her.

2557
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:49,180
Very real tragedy, her inducted in the town name wrong.

2558
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:54,660
Merging the Trump-iverse with the Duck-iverse.

2559
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:57,460
Sure, no, it all, look, it also was seamless, I think,

2560
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:58,300
for our listeners.

2561
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,140
When they're fired.

2562
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:02,180
The sloppy Beagle Boys.

2563
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:04,700
Sloppy Mob Beagle and her sloppy boys.

2564
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:07,900
Pathetic.

2565
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,460
The Clintons killed Webby.

2566
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:11,780
Nothing to do with it.

2567
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:17,340
Oh, now we gotta have fan art with John Bolton

2568
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:18,380
and the Beagle Boys.

2569
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:22,340
It's really the leader they always needed.

2570
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:23,180
Yeah.

2571
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:24,620
They can get a lot more done.

2572
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:28,140
So there's, I don't know, a plane shrinks,

2573
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,060
which makes it confusing when another plane goes by.

2574
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:33,140
Is it that plane that they chase it that goes by on a wire

2575
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,180
and then, no, no, no, that's supposed to be the plane

2576
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:37,540
that our heroes are in, I think.

2577
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:39,340
And then it goes behind a wall.

2578
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:42,220
A plane on a wire flies over the audience

2579
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,180
and then crash lands, a bunch of noise,

2580
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:46,180
a bunch of smoke shoots up.

2581
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,820
To me, that was the most violent thing

2582
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,820
I'd ever seen at age six.

2583
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:51,060
Still scary to me.

2584
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,620
And then all the characters come back out

2585
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,340
and I like this, they're all bandaged up

2586
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:58,420
and they have like flies or birds, birdies on strings,

2587
01:34:58,420 --> 01:34:59,940
on their heads.

2588
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:00,780
That is great.

2589
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:04,380
That's a fun cartoon thing that they brought to the stage.

2590
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:06,420
Yeah, I think this show is a lot of fun.

2591
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:08,860
This might be one of the best shows ever performed

2592
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:10,820
at that Fantasyland stage.

2593
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:13,180
Yeah, I need to see the full history,

2594
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:15,700
but yeah, I think this seemed a lot of fun.

2595
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:18,540
Again, I was hoping there was like a soundboard recording.

2596
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:20,860
Somebody have a bootleg out there of this show?

2597
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:22,420
I mean, the full show's on YouTube.

2598
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,140
It's just, you're just saying it's a little grainy.

2599
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:25,820
Crisp audio quality.

2600
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:26,640
You want the crisp.

2601
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:27,860
I want to enjoy, yeah, the jam.

2602
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:30,420
You want the Videopolis vault to be opened.

2603
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:32,140
Yes, that is what I want.

2604
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:35,020
Let's get some remixes of Monkey C, Monkey Do.

2605
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:36,540
Oh my gosh, yes.

2606
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:39,900
Well, like on that deconstructed album

2607
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,100
that I love, hate so much,

2608
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,540
with the Pineapple Princess remix,

2609
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:48,900
I want some Monkey C, Monkey Do, like DJ remixes.

2610
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,660
Multiples, please.

2611
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,340
Who's who?

2612
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:54,300
Yeah, Marshmello.

2613
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:57,340
I was gonna say, who's my, Jason knows, he knows DJs.

2614
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:01,900
Before he passed, Avicii did finish a remix

2615
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:02,740
of Monkey C, Monkey Do.

2616
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:04,500
Okay, well that's good.

2617
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:08,460
And that's, I feel like you maybe don't know so many DJs.

2618
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:09,300
I don't know any.

2619
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,540
I was, but more than we are.

2620
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,580
Yeah.

2621
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:12,580
Dead Mouse.

2622
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:14,140
Dead Mouse, there we go.

2623
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:15,260
Zed, yes.

2624
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:16,100
Yeah.

2625
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,940
We were in Las Vegas and I'm trying to think.

2626
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:19,780
Calvin Harris.

2627
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:21,260
Calvin Harris, there you go.

2628
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,860
Oh, Steve Aoki.

2629
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:23,700
There you go.

2630
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:24,540
The Pizza Maven.

2631
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:27,260
Yeah, I feel like all of these references are still like,

2632
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:28,500
if anyone's into this, they'd be like,

2633
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,900
those are five year old references.

2634
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:30,740
They are definitely five years.

2635
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:31,580
Five to 10 years old.

2636
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:33,540
This is the situation.

2637
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:34,380
Shaq.

2638
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:35,860
Shaq.

2639
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:37,700
Shaq was DJing at Allapalooza.

2640
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,300
Yeah, yeah, they're all DJs.

2641
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:40,140
He's a DJ.

2642
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:42,540
All right, well somebody you'll find out.

2643
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:43,580
Idris Elba.

2644
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:46,140
I know I heard, was it Coachella he was DJing?

2645
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:46,980
Yeah.

2646
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:47,860
Yeah, that's real.

2647
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,420
DJ Idris Elba.

2648
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:50,900
Sick.

2649
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:51,940
I'm not sick.

2650
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:53,500
So you go to Louie's.

2651
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:56,500
There's a, you see Louie in the Louettes.

2652
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:01,060
The Louettes are Chip and Dale and Blue.

2653
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:03,500
There's a performance of Monkey See Monkey Do.

2654
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:07,940
Then there's, things come to a head and

2655
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:12,020
you've been given earlier the secret of,

2656
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:15,020
Don Carnage slips and says that the way to make

2657
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:19,340
the spy plane big again is with water.

2658
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,460
So it's clear you're supposed to retain

2659
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,220
this information for later.

2660
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,420
And Blue then asks you, well gang,

2661
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:28,660
how do we make the plane bigger?

2662
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:30,220
Everybody yells water.

2663
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:31,660
Then I can't tell what happens.

2664
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:34,300
Then confetti pours and steam.

2665
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,140
I don't see it.

2666
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:38,420
No, I don't even know if any water factors in.

2667
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:40,500
It's just to indicate action.

2668
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,340
Yeah.

2669
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:42,740
It's just to make you go, oh something happened.

2670
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:45,380
Not specifically what, but just something happened.

2671
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:46,500
Yeah, yeah.

2672
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:50,540
And then a plane inflates in front of you

2673
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:51,780
and that's the show.

2674
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:53,460
So many inflatables.

2675
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:54,300
So many inflatables.

2676
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:55,140
In the whole land.

2677
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,500
And I feel like there aren't, I'm trying to think

2678
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:59,340
what's the most modern use of inflatables in Disneyland?

2679
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:02,940
I say take it easy on the screens for a few years.

2680
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:05,340
Bring back the inflatables.

2681
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,660
I agree with that.

2682
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:07,500
Yeah.

2683
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:10,780
Is there still the balloon atop Muppet Vision 3D?

2684
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,300
Hmm.

2685
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,140
Florida.

2686
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:16,060
I don't think usually.

2687
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:16,900
I don't know.

2688
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,180
I don't think so, but maybe.

2689
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,900
But nothing in Disneyland that's inflatable.

2690
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:24,100
And there's not that, you know what's an episode some days

2691
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,580
that Mickey hot air balloon.

2692
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:28,100
At Disney Springs.

2693
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:29,900
No, I mean sure yes.

2694
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:31,900
The one from the commercials.

2695
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:34,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2696
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:36,100
You know, I think it was called,

2697
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:38,820
was it called like the Air Force One or something?

2698
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:39,660
Or was that a plane?

2699
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:41,780
I feel like that was a plane that I could totally be wrong.

2700
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:42,620
I don't know about that.

2701
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:43,460
But I know what you're talking about.

2702
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:45,940
Is it acceptable to merge all of the Mickey aircraft

2703
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:47,660
into one episode or do they have to?

2704
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:48,940
Do they have to be their own episode?

2705
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:52,260
Yes, they do I think, but maybe.

2706
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:53,660
We'll see, we'll see.

2707
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:56,180
I know it's always thin ice to propose.

2708
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:59,820
Yeah, separating any topic is thin ice.

2709
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,180
I know what the answer will be.

2710
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:04,340
Who knows who's the state sale I will go to next, Scott?

2711
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:05,780
We gotta talk about that too.

2712
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:09,100
We need monthly updates now.

2713
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:11,940
That's your solo podcast is the state sale.

2714
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:12,780
Oh, estate sale.

2715
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:13,620
Oh my gosh.

2716
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,500
Estate raiders with Jason Sheridan.

2717
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:19,700
I was out of town for Rosemarie's estate sale,

2718
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,900
which I believe Eva Anderson went to.

2719
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,580
Rosemarie from the Dick Van Dyke show

2720
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,740
who passed away two years ago maybe.

2721
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:26,940
But I would have gone to that.

2722
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:29,380
It was in the Valley, it's not far from here.

2723
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:31,620
I would have gotten a tiny little bucket

2724
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,940
for $10 if Rosemarie owned it.

2725
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:36,900
Yeah, we just are getting all the DeadStars buckets.

2726
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:40,260
Collect them all like the stamps

2727
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:41,940
at Disney afternoon avenue.

2728
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:44,820
I feel like we've been talking for seven hours.

2729
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:45,660
Very possible.

2730
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:48,140
Yeah, that's about the pace that it's at.

2731
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:50,420
What have we missed?

2732
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:51,980
Any?

2733
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:54,380
Well, Duckburg, City Hall and Scrooge's Vault,

2734
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:57,460
those were little flats you could go stand.

2735
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:59,220
You would meet Scrooge, I would assume.

2736
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:01,220
It was special to me as a child

2737
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:04,980
to be in a little tiny town, size, to my size.

2738
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:06,460
Yeah.

2739
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:07,580
It was wonderful.

2740
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:08,900
I will cherish this.

2741
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:12,980
It was to not be infantilized by adult heights.

2742
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:13,820
Sure.

2743
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:15,220
It was a wonderful feeling.

2744
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:16,260
I relate, brother.

2745
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,980
I'm still infantilized by adult heights.

2746
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:23,140
You need tiny towns this day.

2747
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:26,620
I think when, it was a couple years ago,

2748
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:28,580
were they promoting the new DuckTales cartoon

2749
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:30,220
or was it the video game remaster

2750
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:33,140
where they were bringing around Scrooge's little money bin

2751
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:36,100
to Comic-Con and I have a photo in there.

2752
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:37,300
There was, do you know what I'm talking about?

2753
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:38,340
Yeah, yeah, the money, yeah.

2754
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:39,700
Oh yeah, oh sure.

2755
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,420
I was so, it was soft money.

2756
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:43,740
I was thrilled to get in there

2757
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:45,820
and take that photo with the top hat.

2758
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:49,460
The idea of Scrooge's money bin is just as a child,

2759
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,020
my child brain was like,

2760
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:55,540
obviously being rich was something that was very important

2761
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:57,700
to make sure we knew as kids

2762
01:40:57,700 --> 01:41:00,020
that that was good to be very rich.

2763
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,580
But also just fun, looked like fun,

2764
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:02,420
he was swimming around.

2765
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:03,260
He was turning around.

2766
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:04,100
He turned all his money to coins as well.

2767
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,100
Coins and you would imagine like,

2768
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:10,140
you would be in a one piece old time bathing suit

2769
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:11,580
and swimming around in coins.

2770
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:13,780
So when I got to do a slight version,

2771
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:16,500
the lesser version of it, I was still thrilled.

2772
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:19,980
So the idea, you even go outside the money bin, ooh.

2773
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:22,380
Yeah. Like a whole money bin ride.

2774
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:25,020
That just presses all the right buttons in my brain.

2775
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:27,020
Like, I don't know what it is.

2776
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:30,900
It's a tough one to, yeah, tough to physically manufacture.

2777
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:33,060
I think I can crack it.

2778
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:37,380
Maybe not right now, but I'll get back to everyone.

2779
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:39,300
Well, I guess, I don't know.

2780
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:42,180
Is there some technology where if you add water

2781
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,860
to the coins, then it changes the physical solvency.

2782
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:48,260
Yes, there is some technology.

2783
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:50,460
All right, if we can crack that,

2784
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:52,300
we need Don Carnage on the team.

2785
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:57,580
So coin bath ride.

2786
01:41:57,580 --> 01:41:59,340
A coin bath ride, yeah.

2787
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:02,580
I'm trying to think what else?

2788
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:03,860
Did you have something you wanted to say?

2789
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:06,940
Was this whole endeavor actually called Disney Afternoon Live

2790
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:09,860
and Disney Afternoon Avenue was a segment of it?

2791
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:11,060
I'm not sure.

2792
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:12,020
Okay.

2793
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:13,540
What is my official literature?

2794
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:14,780
Tell us what the map says,

2795
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:16,620
because I kept running into different things.

2796
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:19,140
It says the Disney Afternoon Live,

2797
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:21,300
but that is the part of the place that you go

2798
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:22,140
for the Disney Afternoon Live.

2799
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:23,740
The heart and soul is Disney Afternoon Avenue.

2800
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:24,580
Yeah.

2801
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:27,740
Can we still call the episode Disney Afternoon Avenue?

2802
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:28,980
I think we can.

2803
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:31,180
Yes, well, since we're not children anymore,

2804
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:33,100
we're adults, we can do whatever we want.

2805
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:34,300
Yeah, you're right.

2806
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:35,420
Oh yeah, good point.

2807
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:37,980
Hell yeah.

2808
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:38,820
Hell yeah.

2809
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:43,020
Everything's sized to the way I want it to be now, always.

2810
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:45,180
Regular and...

2811
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:47,420
Oh yeah, we're gonna do whatever we want.

2812
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:49,060
Let's start by signing this piece of paper

2813
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:50,220
I put in front of you.

2814
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:51,060
All right.

2815
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:51,900
Hang on.

2816
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:56,180
Any prog rock related part.

2817
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:58,380
Now we know to watch out for this scheme,

2818
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,820
this Don Carnage-esque scheme.

2819
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:01,660
Sure.

2820
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:04,900
Please do not get water on this paper.

2821
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:05,740
Jason Carnage.

2822
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:06,580
Jason Carnage.

2823
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:07,860
It will also undo my plan.

2824
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:08,700
Jason Carnage.

2825
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:12,220
Harmful.

2826
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:13,780
Yeah, I mean, I know they brought,

2827
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:15,820
the last thing I had was that they brought

2828
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:17,660
a little bit of it back for an event.

2829
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:18,500
For 90s night, right?

2830
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:19,820
For 90s night, a little bit.

2831
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:20,660
It said this was gonna be,

2832
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:22,460
yeah, Disney Afternoon Avenue's returning,

2833
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:23,860
but what did that actually mean?

2834
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:27,020
It just meant, I think, some character opportunities with...

2835
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:27,900
Some flats.

2836
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:31,220
Yeah, it was not any, there was no inflatables.

2837
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:33,380
Lack of inflatables, which is a big bummer.

2838
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:36,980
But I think, yeah, I really think

2839
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:39,820
they're missing the boat on the nostalgia in a lot of ways.

2840
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:41,660
They've got certain parts of nostalgia.

2841
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:43,460
They had some coffee mugs and stuff for the characters.

2842
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:44,340
There's gotta be a better way

2843
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:47,340
that they can always have the like...

2844
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:51,740
It's, I think Disneyland nostalgia is very, you know,

2845
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:53,660
there's the 60s bucket, there's the 80s bucket,

2846
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:55,860
there's the 90s bucket, and I think they can play stronger

2847
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:58,540
at everybody's individual entry points.

2848
01:43:58,540 --> 01:43:59,780
Yes, for sure.

2849
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:01,860
And like, just to evive, we've talked about it before,

2850
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:04,340
like bringing Videopolis back in some capacity

2851
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:06,420
for six weeks.

2852
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:08,060
Like right now, there are supposed,

2853
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:11,460
like a lot of passes unblocked as we're recording this,

2854
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:14,220
and the crowds are not yet back to where they were thinking,

2855
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:15,420
because they were thinking maybe, okay,

2856
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:17,300
the problem with attendance was that

2857
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:18,380
all the passes were blocked,

2858
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:20,780
and it's gonna be a crazy thing once it's back,

2859
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:21,860
but I just saw something online,

2860
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:23,860
and it was like, Smuggler's Run was 30-minute wait,

2861
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:26,540
which is not a good indication for Disney.

2862
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,380
30 minutes?

2863
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:28,220
30 minutes, yeah.

2864
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:29,260
That's not still bad.

2865
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:31,020
They're still keeping it under an hour.

2866
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:34,220
No, I'm saying that they were expecting it to be two hours

2867
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:35,820
now that all the passes were unblocked.

2868
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:36,740
So I'm saying...

2869
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:39,620
Do Disney fans want it to be crowded or not?

2870
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:40,780
That's what I can't tell.

2871
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:42,580
Well, they want both, I think.

2872
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:44,380
Yes, because we were talking about this,

2873
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:46,580
because you want, there's two things,

2874
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:48,820
and there's a lot of, on our Anaheim episode,

2875
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:51,020
we talked about the dual-nate.

2876
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:52,540
This is, we're talking about having two thoughts

2877
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:53,820
in your head at once.

2878
01:44:54,780 --> 01:44:56,300
This is what that is, because the success,

2879
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:59,580
an unbridled success of Galaxy's Edge with two-hour waits

2880
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:01,460
and Disney making money hand over fist

2881
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:05,780
means we get more stuff quicker, Tomorrowland quicker.

2882
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:09,020
They're feeling confident and bullish on the parks,

2883
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:12,100
but yeah, that's what we want that,

2884
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:14,780
but as far as Disneyland being crowded, who wants...

2885
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:16,460
In terms of a pleasant experience, we wanted,

2886
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:18,700
we were talking about this in the car the other day.

2887
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:21,940
I brought this up to you, Scott, of like,

2888
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:24,340
I really feel like Disney was a damned if they do,

2889
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:26,700
damned if they don't situation with Galaxy's Edge,

2890
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:30,220
where if they had eight to 10-hour lines like Hagrid's,

2891
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:32,180
people would have been so fucking pissed

2892
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:33,780
and they would have gotten dragged.

2893
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:36,220
Instead, they kind of rationed it out,

2894
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,460
that reservation month, and then,

2895
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:41,540
I think they went a little crazy with the blacking out passes,

2896
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:45,380
but like, I don't, but people, we all got in,

2897
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:49,060
and we all enjoyed it, and we all got to do most of the stuff.

2898
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:51,500
So that's positive, and everyone's posting it

2899
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,300
on social media, that's free advertising.

2900
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:58,580
I also think expectations are usually set by NBA dipshits,

2901
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:02,420
and they are usually driven by their two passions,

2902
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:04,940
working a 60-hour work week in cocaine.

2903
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:05,780
So, you know.

2904
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:09,780
Harsh words for the NBA, from Jason Sheridan on the Patreon.

2905
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:10,620
The...

2906
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:12,580
Scrooge McDuck would be so offended.

2907
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:14,940
I assume Scrooge McDuck loved cocaine.

2908
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:17,380
He loved cocaine, yeah, as the earlier days.

2909
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:20,700
Whether it's Galaxy's Edge or Hobbs and Shaw,

2910
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:22,620
where it's like, this has to make a billion dollars

2911
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:25,140
immediately for me to keep my job, you know?

2912
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:29,540
For this to be successful by the insane metrics

2913
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:30,660
we hold ourselves to.

2914
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:33,380
Well, yeah, I mean, if the...

2915
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:35,940
But if they cost two billion dollars for both part,

2916
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:38,980
both Galaxy's Edge's, I'm just saying,

2917
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:43,420
I get there, I'm feeling a little antsy about,

2918
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:45,060
maybe people aren't as into it as they hope.

2919
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:45,900
I mean, I suppose,

2920
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:49,860
but it's also a 20 to 30-year endeavor, isn't it?

2921
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:52,460
Well, you know, here's a point I wanna make.

2922
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:55,580
We've been recording this episode for 19 hours.

2923
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:59,380
So, this is all nice to talk about,

2924
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:02,780
but let's maybe wrap it up.

2925
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:04,660
Yeah, I think we're done as soon as you finish this thought.

2926
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:05,980
Oh, great, oh, it's just on me now?

2927
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:07,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I'm really,

2928
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:10,300
I'm just tired of going over and doing the,

2929
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:13,180
no, hey, I don't know, Disney Avenue, fun stuff.

2930
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:14,580
Yeah.

2931
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:17,900
And, you know, this is like a big important thought

2932
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:20,300
that you have to sum up the whole episode.

2933
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:22,140
If you could call back a couple of the jokes too,

2934
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:22,980
that would be really good.

2935
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:24,380
All of it has to happen right now?

2936
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:25,380
I think it honestly,

2937
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:27,860
unfortunately, that's the way it has to happen.

2938
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:29,140
Okay.

2939
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:32,220
So, Joseph Cotton, the Gummy Bear song.

2940
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:34,060
Gummy Bears.

2941
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:34,900
Cocaine.

2942
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:37,060
Cocaine, Jason's Contracts.

2943
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:39,340
We've been recording for so long, I'm feeling tired,

2944
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:43,460
and I need a Joseph Cotton bucket full of cocaine

2945
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:46,700
to give me the energy to drive home.

2946
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:47,540
So, I'm gonna work on that.

2947
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:51,140
And Rebecca Cunningham, who reminds you of your mom,

2948
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:54,180
you'll call her later tonight.

2949
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:55,340
My Rebecca.

2950
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:56,540
Thank you.

2951
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:58,300
Thank you for listening.

2952
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:00,060
Thank you for listening to Podcast The Ride,

2953
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:00,940
The Second Gate.

2954
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:03,540
You survived it, so you still have to say that.

2955
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:04,380
We do, sorry.

2956
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:08,060
Yeah, fun trip down memory lane.

2957
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:09,140
Goodbye. Bye.
