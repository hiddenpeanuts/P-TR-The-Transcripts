00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your porch has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's all go to City Walk

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tonight, tonight

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Boys, boys, you give me strength!

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You give me strength!

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We're almost to the end, and we're pretty excited about this one.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So yeah, tell us where we're going today.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, boys, today's sector is sector 16.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Subway, Panda Express, Smash Burger, Poke Bar, Taco Bell, Pink's, KFC Express, Pizza Hut.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's a food court.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, well, that's what's interesting.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This thing was added, I think, in around 2000, they added this area called City Food,

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
which there wasn't really a lot of quick service options.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, and City Loft would be considered part of the food court area.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Or are you, sorry, sector, you're not?

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, you keep going, keep going.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Are you sure? You seem like disinterested.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, you know, it's a food court, so you guys get it, right?

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, I mean, it's like the Taco Bell stuff.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I mean, I could talk, though, about like, there's slight differences between like this Taco Bell

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and the one I, for instance, that's in Burbank here that I go to.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I did a lot, I looked up a lot about Pink's.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I have a story about where I got into like a car accident at the other, the Pink's off of Melrose.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We have like pages of material.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sure, I have a very funny picture for the Smash Burger.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hey, boys, here's the stone.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sector 16 stone is, I don't know, like a napkin or something.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, we just get the stone already?

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, you get the stone. No one wants to really hear about this.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Like, this is, you give me strength.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sure, I think the audience would be thrilled to hear about it.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No, you give me strength, you give me strength.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
OK, yeah, we give you strength.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
All right, so that's it. So we just skip the sector?

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, you skip the sector.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't think we skipped it, we talked about it.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh yeah, it's a Taco Bell. Yeah, I mean, you're right, it is a food court.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You got it. And yeah, remember what else gives me strength?
