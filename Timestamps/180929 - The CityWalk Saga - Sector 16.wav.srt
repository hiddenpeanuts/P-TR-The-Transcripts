1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,340
Foreverâ€¦

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,060
When your porch has fallen short

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,440
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,120
You need a place, a place for rock

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,080
A place for roll

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,080
A place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,060
A sublime hot topic and billabong

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,040
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
So let's go take a walk

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,260
Let's all go to City Walk

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
Tonight

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:06,120
An extremely necessary series exploring the stores, restaurants, and wonderful magic that make up Universal City Walk Hollywood.

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,180
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The City Walk Saga, Sector 16.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,220
I'm Jason Sheridan.

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,780
I'm Scott Gardner.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,940
Mike Carlson here.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,680
And we're here with Sector Keeper.

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,660
Boys, boys, you give me strength, you give me strength.

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,300
We're almost to the end.

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,820
And we're pretty excited about this one.

22
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,000
So yeah, tell us where we're going today.

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,600
Yes, boys.

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,680
Today's sector is Sector 16.

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:38,040
Subway, Panda Express, Smash Burger, Poke Bar, Taco Bell, Pink's, KFC Express, Pizza Hut.

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,740
It's a food court.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,180
Yeah, that's what's interesting.

28
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,440
This thing was added, I think, in around 2000.

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,540
They added this area called City Food.

30
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,180
Which there wasn't really a lot of quick service options.

31
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, and City Loft would be considered part of the food court area.

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,540
Sorry, Sector 16.

33
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,180
Yeah, you keep going, keep going.

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,220
Are you sure?

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,320
You seem a little disinterested.

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,100
Yeah, you know, it's a food court, so you guys get it, right?

37
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,380
Yeah, I mean, it's like the Taco Bell stuff.

38
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,980
I mean, I could talk, though, about like, there's slight differences between like this Taco Bell and the one I, for instance, that's in Burbank here that I go to.

39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,420
And I did a lot, I looked up a lot about Pink's.

40
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,960
I have a story about where I got into like a car accident at the other, the Pink's off of Melrose.

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,800
We have like pages of material.

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,840
Sure, I have a very funny picture for the Smash Burger.

43
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,280
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,900
Hey, boys, here's the stone.

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,400
Sector 16 stone is, I don't know, like a napkin or something.

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,240
Oh, we just get the stone already?

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,740
Yeah, I get the stone.

48
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
No one wants to really hear about this.

49
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,820
Like, this is, give me strength.

50
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,580
Sure, I think the audience would be thrilled to hear about it.

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,620
Give me strength, you give me strength.

52
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,140
Here's the stone.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,260
Okay, yeah, we give you strength.

54
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,140
Oh, all right.

55
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,040
So that's it.

56
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,920
So we just skip the sector?

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, you skip the sector.

58
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,720
I don't think we skipped it.

59
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,480
We talked about it.

60
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:51,920
We did this.

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,880
Oh yeah, it's a Taco Bell.

62
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,800
Yeah, I mean, you're right.

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,440
It is a food court.

64
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,080
You got it.

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,240
And yeah, remember what else gives me strength?

66
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040

Yeah, so we're linking in this description.

72
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,400
Wow, okay.

73
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,700
Well, this was a lot more efficient than the other ones.

74
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,340
Hey, sounds good to me.

76
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,120
I'll take any excuse I can get.

77
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,840
We'll see you tomorrow, I guess.

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,940
You guys good to do it tomorrow?

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,120
Yeah.

80
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,440
All right, cool.

81
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:18,920
See you tomorrow.

82
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,320
Goodbye, boys.

83
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,320
Forever.

84
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,460
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

85
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,360
Stop, stop, stop.

86
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,360
Boys, boys, boys, 2018, boys, boys, stop.

87
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,340
You 2018 motherfuckers.

88
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,720
Hey, hey.

89
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,140
You stop what you're doing right now.

90
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,820
You're about to make the biggest mistake of all of our lives.

91
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,900
Who the hell are you guys?

92
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,740
Yeah, who are you?

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,120
Why do you look like us and sound like us?

94
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,120
Who are we?

95
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,280
Who are we?

96
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,540
We're 2023 you.

97
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, it's actually 2024.

98
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,320
Oh.

99
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,440
I just wanted to know that.

100
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm still writing 2023 on my podcast episode.

101
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,300
Jason, Jason, these guys don't even know what year they're coming from.

102
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,340
This is so strange.

103
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,280
Listen up.

104
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:13,400
Are you here with your lackadaisical attitude, your 2018 carefree, easygoing ways, thinking, oh, that'd be funny if we just skipped the sector this time.

105
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,700
Surely that won't have any consequences.

106
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,560
Wrong.

107
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,040
You're dead wrong.

108
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,720
You're wrong.

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,900
And that's why we're back.

110
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,600
You, I'm looking at you little one.

111
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,200
Who?

112
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,860
Me?

113
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,340
Yeah, you.

114
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,820
What did I do?

115
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,420
You gave him a napkin and you said it was a stone.

116
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,200
Yeah.

117
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,000
So I don't know.

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,400
I was just trying to move things along.

119
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,240
No, you caused a rift.

120
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,460
Hey, hey, coma, go.

121
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,280
Let me at him.

122
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,920
Stay apart.

123
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,280
I'm going to beat you up.

124
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,620
I know our hands are just going right through him, but we have to.

125
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Okay.

126
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Okay.

127
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,100
Multiverse.

128
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,760
Hey, sorry.

129
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,100
This is 2018 Scott here.

130
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,420
First of all, are you doing another one of these?

131
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,940
Are you're doing like another daily city walk series?

132
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,960
Is that what you're telling me?

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,820
Even after this one that we're doing, you still think that's a good idea?

134
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,600
Yes.

135
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,840
Yes, we are.

136
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,460
You got a problem with that?

137
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,740
And we did another one before you got to go do the downtown Disney one.

138
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,240
Okay.

139
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,280
Spoiler alert.

140
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,720
We're still doing the podcast in 2024.

141
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,840
I thought we'd be done in like 2019.

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,360
Yeah, I know.

143
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,900
I thought we're.

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,540
Yeah, I mean, what?

145
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,000
We just got to get through like Pirates and Space Mountain and then we're done with this whole thing, right?

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,440
Well, no, listen, the media landscape is constantly shifting and like podcasting is actually one of the more stable parts of the.

147
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,440
No, that's not what we want to hear.

148
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,160
Oh my God.

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,600
2024 Jason, you're giving me the worst news I could ever get.

150
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,000
Hold on.

151
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,620
If I can just interrupt for a second.

152
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,060
Hey, 2018 Jason, what's up, playboy?

153
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,180
Okay, listen, I can't tell you what the cane is.

154
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,040
Just go to the doctor more.

155
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,840
Also, you can talk to more than one people at once on the dating.

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,760
Did you know that?

157
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,240
I get.

158
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,800
Hey, it's 2018 Jason.

159
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,660
No, I didn't.

160
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,900
I thought that'd be rude.

161
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,880
Like I don't want to be impolite.

162
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,920
You know what?

163
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,680
It's men are so terrible.

164
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,600
Like a couple of condors say, you know what?

165
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,900
This is getting complicated.

166
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,160
Now I'm confused.

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:20,480
I just really quickly want to point out that we're back here to solve some sort of rift in the multiverse and immediately Jason just tried to help get himself laid a lot more.

168
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,940
Yeah, that's interesting.

169
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,240
We have important work to do, but 2024 Jason is trying to hook up 2018.

170
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,180
Hey, 2024 Jason Jason here.

171
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,700
I'm just trying to put your mind at ease and like don't worry so much, you know.

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,860
But you are still not to spoil things for 2018.

173
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,740
Jason, you do end up in a relationship.

174
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,840
Yeah, I mean, you're not trying to stop that relationship.

175
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,280
You're just trying to get your 2018 dickwad.

176
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,320
Just have a little fun.

177
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,700
Worry less, you know.

178
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,460
Oh, hey, it's 2018 Jason.

179
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,320
Do I meet someone?

180
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,720
Hey, 2024 Jason.

181
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,220
Yeah, you meet a lovely lady and you guys actually do move in together.

182
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,980
It's really fun.

183
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,080
Oh, cool.

184
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,200
Hey, in 2018, Sector Keeper, you get to live with them for a while too.

185
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,580
Oh, that's good.

186
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,400
Yeah, this is something we really got to work out.

187
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,880
You got to find somewhere else to go.

188
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,600
This has been fun, but it's a lot of days.

189
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,820
We're up to 20 days.

190
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,920
We just added one where we had to time travel.

191
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,040
You got to find your own place at some point.

192
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,380
I'm working on it.

193
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,100
I'm working on it.

194
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,360
Hey, can I give 2018 Sector Keeper a couple of tips too?

195
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:16,960
Absolutely.

196
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
No riffs.

197
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,620
I'm not going to shake things up.

198
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,360
Sure, yeah.

199
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,960
All right, man.

200
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,500
You're going to have an opportunity.

201
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,700
Accurate wireless.

202
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,500
It's going to look good on paper.

203
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,500
You're not going to get paid.

204
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,040
They're going to call it an internship.

205
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,080
There's no health insurance, but they're going to offer you course credit.

206
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,860
You're going to get course credit at college.

207
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,420
Do not take it.

208
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,600
Okay, do not take it.

209
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,880
Also, shortly after that, sometime in 2023, you are going to play the Powerball.

210
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,940
Oh yeah, that's a big one.

211
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,140
Yeah, are you listening to this one?

212
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:55,620
2018.

213
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,040
This is what it's all about.

214
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,060
Do not play it.

215
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,140
What's the Powerball?

216
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,860
Okay, we don't have time for this shit.

217
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,700
Let's just move it along.

218
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,680
Yeah, we have to get to what we have to get.

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,340
So, all right.

220
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,320
Are you listening?

221
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,240
Are you listening?

222
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,440
Look us in the eye and say you're listening.

223
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,480
Yes, yes, we're listening.

224
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,100
Dear God.

225
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,680
Yes, yes, we're listening.

226
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,280
We're listening.

227
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,700
All right.

228
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,900
You sit back and you listen to us as we fix this.

229
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,900
We are going to force you to do the sector that you should have done a long time ago.

230
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
And give me that napkin.

231
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,820
Give me that.

232
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,980
That wasn't really the stone.

233
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,000
We didn't get the stone.

234
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,020
There's still a stone to get.

235
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,500
Wait a minute.

236
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,800
There's a little barbecue sauce on this.

237
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,420
Somebody used this?

238
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:36,920
Okay.

239
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,460
2018 Jason or was it the other?

240
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,480
We've actually been passing it back and forth.

241
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,160
Some of it's old and some of it's new barbecue sauce.

242
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,600
Well, look, a lot of things change.

243
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,120
Many things stay the same.

244
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,120
Barbecue sauce is still a tasty condiment.

245
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,180
Wait a minute.

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,180
There's a phone number on this thing too.

247
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,100
I think 2024 is trying to hook up 2018 Jason with some 2018 girl.

248
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Yeah.

249
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,900
And look on Jason's notebook, he scribbled out something.

250
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,640
He wrote city walk and wrote pussy walk.

251
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,020
Oh, that's crap.

252
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,460
That's something we don't even say on this show a lot.

253
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,200
Look, you know.

254
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,080
Hey, 2018 us are still, we're still prudes.

255
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:19,680
No, no, no.

256
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,920
2024 ones too.

257
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,180
Yes, we're all still by Jason Fager.

258
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,640
I don't like it.

259
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,360
I'm a 2024 Mike.

260
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,960
I don't like reading it off the notebook.

261
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,040
Hey, it's 2018 Jason.

262
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,800
I was just trying to take ladies to city walk like Jason Schwartzwind does at the beginning of Shop Girl.

263
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,580
Hey, it's 2024 Jason.

264
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,880
You're actually supposed to just.

265
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,200
Reach for, you know, just sportsman at the end of Shop Girl.

266
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,580
He's not, you know, a desirable character at the beginning of the movie.

267
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,740
Oh, hey, it's 2018 Jason.

268
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,380
I didn't really think about that.

269
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,900
Now that you say that it's been a been a little while since I saw it in theaters.

270
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,580
Hey, yes.

271
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,640
2024 Jason.

272
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,880
Yeah, the book was better than the movie.

273
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,000
We got stuff to get to them.

274
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,620
We can't just talk about Steve Martin's novels.

275
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,660
The Rift is now bigger than ever.

276
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,220
Oh shit, okay.

277
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,340
All right, we better start.

278
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:05,640
Yeah.

279
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,260
All that Shop Girl talk.

280
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,580
Oh, he's gonna be scared to start coughing so much.

281
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:08,880
Okay.

282
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,040
Yes, look, we've, look, all of us, no matter what year we're from, we know that Shop Girl is the most relatable reference.

283
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,400
Everyone knows the arc of Jason Schwartzman no matter what year you're in.

284
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,720
Right.

285
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,180
That maintains it's even stronger in 2024.

286
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:28,180
I just thought a tangent about Steve Martin's fiction work would help heal the Rift.

287
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:28,740
Yeah, you're right.

288
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,500
Hey, 2018 Scott, I liked it.

289
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,980
I like I think, you know, we're gonna get through this thing together.

290
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,080
We all got to be friends.

291
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,820
You can't come at us with this attitude.

292
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,060
We're rattled.

293
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,580
Okay.

294
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,540
Remember, it's 2018.

295
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,260
We're in the middle of the Trump administration.

296
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:42,940
Okay.

297
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,720
Use kid gloves on us.

298
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,120
Things are terrible right now, and I don't see how they could possibly get worse.

299
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,160
So please just be nice to let's just.

300
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,160
2020, 2020, 2020.

301
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,960
What are you guys murmuring about?

302
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,220
No, I think nothing.

303
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,220
No, nothing.

304
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,980
No, it's fine.

305
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,780
Okay, let's try for Scott.

306
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,220
We're gonna get down to business.

307
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,280
We have to handle this.

308
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:12,360
So due to what you all did, not covering this set, just doing a flippant brush off this cosmic consequences.

309
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,460
And besides the cosmic consequences, and this is real.

310
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,220
Do you realize what happened by you doing such a short episode?

311
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,820
A little four minute episode?

312
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,840
That's just a theme and then a little bit of talking and then the forever dog stuff at the end.

313
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:34,640
You left a bizarre sliced up husk of an episode that has tons of ad breaks, even though it's only four minutes long.

314
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:43,260
Do you realize that listeners have pointed this out over the years that it's a four minute episode that I think still has three entire ad shut.

315
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,820
Like it works.

316
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,060
It's insane.

317
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,860
You left a really sloppy piece and an otherwise completely tight, perfect saga.

318
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,880
I was just trying to give my good boys a break, but sometimes it feels bad to be bad.

319
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Let's let the 2024 Sector Keeper do this with force to make sure that we're all on the same page.

320
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:12,140
He was 2018 said the city food list in a really flippant way to 2024 Keepers, say it like you mean it.

321
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,360
I'm saying it like I mean it.

322
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,100
We're gonna fix this riff together.

323
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,320
All eight of us.

324
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,140
All right.

325
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,960
You guys in?

326
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,640
In, in.

327
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,380
In.

328
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,300
In.

329
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,580
In.

330
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,080
In.

331
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,140
And did everybody everybody heard eight perfect voices all at once right then.

332
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,440
Okay, so let's let's let's hear it.

333
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,320
Here we go.

334
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:56,820
Boys boys from 2018 boys boys from 2024 today's phase seven sector two, which is also City Walk saga sector 16 city food subway Panda Express smash burger poke bar Taco Bell pinks KFC Express and pizza hut.

335
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,140
Good luck double boys.

336
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,840
Very good.

337
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,640
I think now there's no mistaking what we have to do.

338
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,720
And Jason's, Jason's.

339
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,300
Give me that napkin.

340
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,820
Why?

341
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,100
Because you tucked it on.

342
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,740
You tucked it into your shirt like you're about to eat again.

343
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,160
Oh, we have to focus.

344
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,260
Okay.

345
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,200
Give me your it is.

346
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,500
All right.

347
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,840
I'm throwing that in a city walk trash can.

348
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,940
And now we commence.

349
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,480
Okay.

350
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,020
Okay.

351
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:29,320
Finally discuss the subway that everyone has been waiting for six years to hear about.

352
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,860
It's 2024 Jason.

353
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,660
There has been some changes just since we've done that.

354
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,900
Jesus Christ.

355
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,860
For me it's like.

356
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,520
I'm terrified.

357
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,740
What's it's okay.

358
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,540
It's okay.

359
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,800
Like the majority of city food remains untouched.

360
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,400
Okay.

361
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,440
But this mash burger became a habit burger.

362
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,740
That's a downgrade.

363
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,080
But the subway became a firehouse subs.

364
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,080
That's an upgrade.

365
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,120
Yes.

366
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,680
I would have to say firehouse subs.

367
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,040
Yeah, those words mean nothing to my primitive 2018 brain.

368
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,440
Right.

369
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,080
What is it?

370
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
I can't picture that brand at all.

371
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,060
Well, 2020, you want to fill them in?

372
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,580
I don't know.

373
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,460
It's like themed after.

374
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,940
Fire department.

375
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,160
There's a painting on the wall of of the universal fire station, which is something that you could you could see on the tour.

376
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,780
Yeah, I remember.

377
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,720
Yeah, I know you do.

378
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,080
And there's like, I don't know.

379
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,740
There's like a Dalmatian.

380
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,080
No, wait.

381
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,220
It's like a raccoon is like looking in a bucket.

382
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,380
Yeah.

383
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,940
Hi, this 2024 Jason.

384
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,760
I actually like learned a little about firehouse subs because I'd never been for.

385
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,200
So I went and eat there.

386
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,500
Yes.

387
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:30,940
Yes.

388
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,960
The rift is mending.

389
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:40,080
This is I can't believe any of the eight of us still have the capacity to just earnestly talk about one of the sandwich.

390
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,060
Go on, Jason.

391
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,640
Go on.

392
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:41,980
Sure.

393
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,640
I had a tuna salad sub and I got the combos.

394
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,040
I got chips and a drink.

395
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,680
I kind of fucked up.

396
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,900
I just got a small.

397
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,760
And as you can see, I basically paid for like a quarter of a sub.

398
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,420
It is smaller than a Kaiser roll.

399
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,140
It comes in.

400
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,680
You're showing us like a burger container.

401
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
That's not long.

402
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,580
So you 24, the food you eat still looks like that.

403
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,520
Well, I in 2024, I'm trying to eat less meat and I have started eating more fish.

404
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,000
The photo looks bad, man.

405
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,260
It was really good.

406
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,240
No, it was actually really tasty.

407
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,120
Jason just took a shitty photo.

408
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,620
I did take a shitty photo because it was windy up there and the wind kept catching the paper.

409
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,380
So there is still wind in your time.

410
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,760
You're saying, you know, windy is shit up on the top of that hill.

411
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,480
So we have to talk about city food is the area.

412
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,400
There is one of the windiest places on planet Earth.

413
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:48,580
It's like at the top of Mount Everest, the Himalayas and on top of the entire already you're on top of a hill and then you're even more on top of it.

414
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,400
It can be 85 degrees in Los Angeles, but on city food, it'll be like negative five degrees.

415
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,620
The wind chill is such that you are always needing a jacket up there.

416
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,360
Even in the dead heat of summer, the windy city walk.

417
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,200
Yes.

418
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,500
Yeah, that is the thing I forgot.

419
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,680
I was wearing a sweatshirt or something.

420
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,080
I was walking right through people and they didn't feel a thing.

421
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,780
Your temperature, you're like if you inhabit somewhere, that's got to be like freezing.

422
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,860
It's got to be sub zero.

423
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,580
Yeah, I'm like a hundred negative hundred Kelvin.

424
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:29,100
So we needed, I found a table up there in the sun because it's the only way you can survive.

425
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,780
Right.

426
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,820
Like it's like gutting an animal or something in the middle of the tundra.

427
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,480
That sun lasted for about 10 minutes before it was entirely in the shade.

428
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,220
Yes, the shade.

429
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,580
It moves fast up there because it's such an elevation.

430
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,140
Twenty eighteen Scott here really quick again.

431
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,280
You've okay.

432
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:54,960
I think it's weird enough that you're doing city walk Orlando, but the premise of city walk Orlando, you thought of more reasons to keep going to where we've been going every day.

433
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,200
Are you out of your goddamn 2024 mines?

434
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:10,120
The thing is, the 2018 Scott doing that saga only links all of your personas, your public personas to city walk in a stronger way.

435
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,380
And that actually will translate to you loving it even more.

436
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:13,820
Yeah.

437
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,280
So we can't avoid it anymore.

438
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:21,000
You're saying that we met me, Scott Gardner, and now synonymous with city walk on some level.

439
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,540
Well, kind of, but it also becomes even more convenient to get up there if you can imagine.

440
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,200
What do you mean?

441
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,080
We're recording closer to it, if you can believe that is true.

442
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:44,680
I'm glad to hear my life has not progressed beyond city walk Hollywood in any way in six years.

443
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,020
Twenty twenty four Scott, have you not sold a show by now?

444
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,260
Like, why aren't you busy?

445
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:59,840
Why don't you go sell something to Comedy Central or TBS or IFC or Adult Swim or any of the thriving hubs of adult animated content?

446
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,600
Hey, it's 2018 Jason.

447
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,460
What about see?

448
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,100
So, oh, let's just say fallen brother.

449
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,900
Oh, well, we all saw that coming on launch day.

450
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,900
Twenty eighteen Scott.

451
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,500
I've got a lot of bad news for you.

452
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,640
I don't want to bum anybody out with it, but I will just I will give you a chilling warning of just of one word.

453
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,680
Quibi.

454
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,260
Oh God, I don't want to begin to know what that means.

455
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:22,940
OK, OK.

456
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,280
We're twenty Michael says it sounds weird.

457
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,720
It doesn't look.

458
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,560
It doesn't mean any more to me than it did than it does to you.

459
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,140
Is that what replaces munchies?

460
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, superficial.

461
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,440
It is not.

462
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,700
It isn't weirdly.

463
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,560
It's a place where you can take quick bites, but not of frozen yogurt.

464
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,720
Oh, yeah, I'm sure we'll understand eventually.

465
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,580
Absolutely.

466
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,600
It's going to be a strange time.

467
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,980
OK, please proceed.

468
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,440
Whichever Mike was talking about.

469
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,140
Well, I'm more about firehouse up.

470
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,640
Thank God.

471
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,280
Twenty twenty four.

472
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,200
Jason is more to say about firehouse subs.

473
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,280
Yeah.

474
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,720
You know, they they give a lot of money to firehouses.

475
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,480
They've also been doing a lot of donations to natural when there's natural disasters and stuff.

476
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,840
Did you open did you open up their books?

477
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,980
Do you know how much?

478
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,220
Oh, I open up there like our rescue.

479
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,140
Open up their books.

480
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,380
Yeah.

481
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:15,980
Twenty twenty four.

482
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,660
I'm asking you.

483
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:16,860
Yeah.

484
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,760
Did you show you?

485
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,840
Did they say on the website that they're looking that they're donating money to

486
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
fire stations across the country?

487
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,300
No, I was just kind of watching.

488
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,580
There's this genre of YouTube video that's mostly stock footage with narration.

489
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,040
And they're like, but I think you know about firehouse subs produced by firehouse subs.

490
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No.

491
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,700
Twenty twenty four.

492
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,820
Jason, it seems like your viewing habits are fascinating.

493
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,400
Yeah.

494
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,620
You got quite a life awaiting you.

495
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,240
Twenty eighteen question from both sector keepers.

496
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,720
How many of those views are yours?

497
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,320
Oh, just the handful.

498
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,680
You know, you watched it more than once.

499
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,400
Sometimes I take a nap or I'm falling asleep.

500
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,020
It's pretty good.

501
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,440
You go backwards and watch these stock footage videos again.

502
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,660
Well, now I just like the I like the company man guy.

503
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,100
That's the one user.

504
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,200
Twenty teen Jason.

505
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,820
Oh, OK.

506
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,760
I'll check that out.

507
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah, I think it was still making videos back then.

508
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,200
Anyway, I got into some Jason level hijinks like, oh, did you get the big cookie?

509
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,380
Twenty twenty four, Jason.

510
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:13,800
No.

511
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,360
Twenty eighteen.

512
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,640
I opted for a drink and I got the limited time tropical cherry lime made

513
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,200
and pretty quickly realized I was mostly drinking a soda machine

514
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,720
syrup and a very large cup.

515
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,940
I actually probably had more syrup and chips than I did.

516
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,300
Tiny little sandwich.

517
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,400
You got half that you had a tiny sandwich and a side of syrup.

518
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,880
And you and you want to talk about this.

519
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,080
Like, well, let me let me make sure I do ample time about their charitable efforts.

520
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,460
I do it to say like the sandwich was delicious.

521
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,580
Like they use a lot of high quality ingredients and firehouse subs.

522
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,960
Hey, twenty teen Jason.

523
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,980
That's been a complaint I've always had about subway.

524
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,040
Hey, yeah.

525
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,540
Twenty twenty four Jason here.

526
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,080
Like, yeah, it is an upgrade.

527
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,380
You two get along so well.

528
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,280
I want to point out that this is just unusual because he was not expecting

529
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,880
to eat just syrup and chips.

530
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,740
If he was expecting it for a snack, it would have been fine.

531
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,340
Yeah, it was the surprise that was the problem.

532
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,900
Surprise.

533
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,340
It was not as normal syrup and chips snack.

534
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,960
Well, I think I was expecting a cherry lime Ricky, which usually has carbonation

535
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,200
cherry lime made is just, I guess, syrup or juice.

536
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,440
I should have tried this.

537
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,640
I should have tried your cherry lime.

538
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,180
Cherry lime Ricky's for lunch.

539
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,180
So twenty twenty four Jason still from 1924.

540
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,860
Something never changed.

541
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,400
Yeah, I will say that would knock against this firehouse subs.

542
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,080
They are known for having hot sauce bars, like different hot sauces

543
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,580
you can put on your sandwiches.

544
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,040
And this one didn't have that.

545
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,620
Hey, twenty eighteen Jason, that's kind of disappointing.

546
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,940
I like those hot sauce stores.

547
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,580
Hey, twenty twenty four Jason, I like them a lot, too.

548
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,800
But you got to watch out for your tummy troubles, you know.

549
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,640
No version of you, Jason, will ever watch out for your tummy troubles.

550
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,040
When are you going to understand that?

551
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,840
That will never be a year where your tummy is properly protected.

552
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,200
It's twenty eighteen, Jason.

553
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,720
Look, you only live once twenty four, Scott.

554
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,360
Jason volunteered to be a volunteer firefighter when he was up there,

555
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,000
as long as he still got some sub perks.

556
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,760
Do I get paid in sandwiches?

557
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,460
I have an answer for the percentage that it's donated.

558
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,880
It's point zero seven five percent of purchases in twenty

559
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,800
twenty four at firehouse subs locations to the firehouse subs

560
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,520
public safety foundation for the purchase of life saving equipment.

561
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,100
Point zero five point zero seven five point zero seven five.

562
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,080
So I guess that's OK.

563
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,960
It's that's point zero zero zero.

564
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,380
Wait, what?

565
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,360
This is not an impressive number.

566
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,440
Zero seven.

567
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,700
So like it's like I think it's like seven points of seven cents on a dollar.

568
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,260
Not bad.

569
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,860
If you point zero seven a percentage.

570
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,280
Oh, I see.

571
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,880
You're saying zero zero zero.

572
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,980
I see you're saying it is actually worse, I think.

573
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,420
Yes.

574
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,440
Well, let's try it.

575
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,360
Let's do some math here.

576
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,400
Maybe we don't know.

577
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,800
Then we'd have to know how much firehouse subs.

578
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,600
Well, no, I'm just we can point zero.

579
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,040
What did I say?

580
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,000
Seven five.

581
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,560
Look, I was mostly excited because they had a tuna salad sandwich

582
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,900
with no sour in it.

583
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,520
Oh, yeah.

584
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,220
It's twenty eighteen.

585
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,800
Jason, I don't like celery.

586
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,600
My tune is out twenty twenty four.

587
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,620
Jason, that remains the same.

588
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,100
So it's hard to find it at restaurants.

589
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,440
So you got to jump on it when they when you tell they don't have it.

590
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,500
Don't spoil your past self that there hasn't been any evolution

591
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,000
in your celery habits.

592
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,580
He's got to have some things waiting for him.

593
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,060
Yeah, I guess that's true.

594
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,200
Fun surprises.

595
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,220
I like celery.

596
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,880
This is just again, twenty eighteen.

597
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,180
Scott, are you sure people are still listening to this show?

598
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,660
You're you're looking up percentages and saying I like celery.

599
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,600
And people are.

600
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,960
Yeah, dude, Scott, people are paying for it now.

601
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
And what do you wow, that's great.

602
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,180
We're we're doing it for free.

603
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,660
Yeah.

604
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,880
Why were you doing it for you?

605
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,680
Did the entire original sidewalk saga for free?

606
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,580
Again, you guys are insane.

607
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,820
Not just not just for free, right?

608
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,840
You were you're helping me, right?

609
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,220
Oh, yeah.

610
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,980
We're all about.

611
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,900
But the thing is, just to put your mind at ease in case you think we've

612
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,160
changed both citywalks, I guess, have put us in the red.

613
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,420
Well, I didn't even know that was possible.

614
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,020
Whichever, Jason, is that true?

615
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,560
Yeah, I don't think it is.

616
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,080
Well, Collie, it definitely is that way.

617
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,700
You walk around and maybe less.

618
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,080
Maybe at this point, we're back to break.

619
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,160
When Jason says put us in the red, he means put us in the syrup

620
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,300
that he loves so much.

621
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,060
The syrup is a good thing.

622
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,500
Yeah.

623
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,700
The shade of our vomit in the toilet.

624
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,500
After we eat at some of these.

625
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,200
You can afford fancier syrup.

626
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:05,700
Yeah.

627
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,320
Red syrup.

628
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,300
We got to keep moving.

629
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,420
Can I just say that the subway got two stars on Yelp.

630
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,780
So it probably makes sense that it went away.

631
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,360
It's a bad.

632
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,820
So it was always a bad subway.

633
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,760
I think I maybe had it once or twice.

634
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,580
Subway is bad now.

635
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,040
Yeah.

636
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,800
It used to be better.

637
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,640
Just for you guys in 2018,

638
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,320
there was a big thing about like how awful the tuna is.

639
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,280
And then Mike still defended the subway tuna after that.

640
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,980
I love that subway tuna.

641
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,600
When it's good, it's good.

642
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,260
And I'm sometimes it's less good.

643
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,680
But whatever like mayonnaise they're putting in there,

644
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,200
I'd really hit the spot for me.

645
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,600
All right.

646
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,880
Am I being possessed by the spirit of Jason Sheridan again?

647
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,780
Like I was earlier?

648
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,260
Maybe I am feeling.

649
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,940
But the tuna, I can eat a foot long tuna right now,

650
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,900
especially put a little honey mustard on that thing.

651
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,400
Give it to me right now.

652
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,320
I would eat all of it.

653
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,900
I'll leave the recording and do it.

654
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,880
And I've eaten a lot of that tuna, too.

655
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,540
Hey, it's twenty twenty four days.

656
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,480
I mean, let us have the subway tuna, but I would still give it a shot.

657
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,480
For you, twenty eighteen guys, there was a here is an art, a headline.

658
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,560
Judge rules that Subway can be sued over claims that its tuna sandwiches

659
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,340
contain other fish, species or animal products, that it's not technically tuna.

660
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,060
And yet the tuna consumption continues unabated.

661
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,700
Well, that actually sounds like you're getting a deal.

662
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,500
That's what I'm saying.

663
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,080
You're getting a smorgasbord of different fish.

664
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,240
It's actually delicious.

665
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,180
Probably fancier fish than tuna is what I'm guessing.

666
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,060
Oh, yeah.

667
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,900
High quality fish.

668
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,640
And they don't want to make you feel like you're snooty for eating subway tuna.

669
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,660
Oh, it's a fisherman's catch menu.

670
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,140
I guess every all the best of a little squid, like a high level squid

671
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,820
might be in there mixed with different pieces, like hundred dollar fish, I assume.

672
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,620
A high level squid.

673
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,660
Does that miss spitball?

674
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,220
Yes.

675
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,860
Why skills wise?

676
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,160
What's how does a squid become a high level?

677
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,980
Taste level, a high, a high premium taste is really what I meant by that.

678
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,340
Of squid.

679
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:06,780
Yeah.

680
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,520
Premium squid.

681
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,540
That's what I'm talking about.

682
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,840
And that's yeah, they don't specify what it is.

683
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,840
If they're saying it's bottom feeders.

684
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,540
Here's the thing.

685
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,200
They're delicious bottom feeders.

686
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,280
If it's a flounder or.

687
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,720
Oh, maybe it's crab with a K.

688
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,320
I love imitation crab.

689
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,400
Hey, it's twenty eighteen.

690
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,380
I love imitation crab, too.

691
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,200
Yeah, that doesn't really change.

692
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,500
If anything, you get more imitation crab.

693
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,380
Oh, cool.

694
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,300
Hey, twenty eighteen.

695
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,080
Mike, you're a question for both Jason's, I guess.

696
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,600
Has any food thing changed preference wise?

697
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,220
Is there some sort of 2024?

698
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,600
Is there anything new you're really into in these last six years?

699
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,980
Oh, well, I've been eating like more vegetarian and vegan.

700
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,840
On tray.

701
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,100
Yeah, but boring.

702
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,480
What silly trying to eat less meat like I have less.

703
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,160
Not less.

704
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,140
Oh, how did you get crazy?

705
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,680
You type of super anything or soup?

706
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,520
Yeah, I got to target.

707
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,140
Pick up with some soup liquids.

708
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,040
What kind of liquids are you drinking?

709
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,160
Oh, I'm drinking more.

710
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,300
A little more soda.

711
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:04,980
Oh, really?

712
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,760
I thought you cut out soda.

713
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,240
Oh, yeah.

714
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:07,520
Yes.

715
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:07,960
Twenty twenty four.

716
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,100
My.

717
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,740
Yeah, you're saying that's right.

718
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,880
He was trying to drink more soda is what he said yesterday's episode.

719
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,880
He was doing his best to drink more.

720
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,640
You know, there's been a lot of innovation in the zero category.

721
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,280
Oh, I like that.

722
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,300
Yeah.

723
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,960
Jason's giving up giving up soda for Lent.

724
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,920
Lent will be a time of extra sodas.

725
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,300
Hey, remember how the 2018

726
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,560
sector keeper did that thing more often where he coughed and got weak

727
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,260
because we weren't moving on fast enough?

728
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,120
You still got that in your 2018.

729
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,040
Yes.

730
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,620
Sweet.

731
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,060
Oh, that's off.

732
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,040
Sounds awful.

733
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,980
But it's exacerbated by his future me smells.

734
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,960
I think that's the parliament's.

735
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,520
But parliament.

736
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,180
Yeah.

737
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,240
Like Britain's Congress.

738
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,200
Well, that is parliament.

739
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,240
But I mean, the cigarettes with the recess filter.

740
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,840
Oh, yeah.

741
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,260
Those are used to be very popular with pilots

742
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,540
because they would chew on the thing.

743
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,140
Yeah.

744
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,020
I always tell that anecdote.

745
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,760
I don't I don't.

746
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,660
Twenty eighteen Jason is not going to need these dating apps.

747
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,080
You two are going to walk off hand in hand together.

748
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,340
Look at they're holding.

749
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,260
Wow.

750
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:22,760
They are.

751
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,820
They're holding hands.

752
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,400
You can't see it just under a table.

753
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,140
At least we know it's not like a time cop situation.

754
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,880
You guys can touch each other and nothing bad.

755
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,960
As far as we know.

756
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,380
Yeah, nothing.

757
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Wow.

758
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,260
But yeah, sitting here.

759
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,640
New saga.

760
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,220
Same old Jason.

761
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,860
The sagas may change, but Jason stays the same.

762
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,160
Well, one thing that's luckily stayed the same is Panda Express.

763
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,140
There's one where we don't have to talk about a replacement.

764
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,120
It gives me strength in 2018.

765
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,720
Go, boys.

766
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,680
You guys Panda Express never left.

767
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,560
So this review counts for all of us.

768
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,520
One and a half stars on Yelp.

769
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,020
And that's current.

770
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,540
Uh, yeah.

771
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,200
And we've already done a Panda Express in this same saga.

772
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:03,780
Yeah.

773
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,920
Is there any original new thoughts about this particular Panda Express?

774
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,040
It's more expensive.

775
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,780
Windy and a little windier.

776
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,500
Well, certainly windier than the one at Alamco Blvd.

777
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Right down the road.

778
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,260
All the different establishments here have to have doors open constantly,

779
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,740
because I think if they didn't, there would just be this wind tunnel.

780
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,960
Suck every time the door was open.

781
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:29,060
And it would blow the people behind the desk like out into the fryer or something.

782
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,920
You get tornadoes of noodles.

783
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,680
Yeah.

784
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,000
I think you would have constant tornadoes of all the food.

785
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,920
They're going 300 miles an hour.

786
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,300
They're whipping my face.

787
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,400
I'm getting caught up by fast noodles.

788
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,540
I hatch into space like just like.

789
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:49,760
You open the door, the pizza employee is sucked out into the middle of the city walk

790
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,100
by the movie theater.

791
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,200
So yeah, if you're going up there, help these employees out.

792
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,720
Try to do your transactions from under the door.

793
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,680
Just yell your order, slip your card under.

794
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,220
Don't if you can do it without opening the door, you're going to save lives.

795
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,780
If you know, they a lot of them have the buzzer that vibrates when it's time to pick up your food.

796
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:13,260
I'm wondering if that's like, oh, we don't want to give you the paper receipt with a number.

797
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,580
It'll just blow away.

798
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,620
It'll be gone.

799
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,120
So they needed a buzzer is heavier.

800
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,660
Yeah, probably had multiple buzzers at one point.

801
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,620
They probably contemplated printing the receipts on heavier paper

802
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,280
so that they wouldn't blow away, but it probably wasn't cost.

803
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,960
Well, then that just cuts up people as it gets blown.

804
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,620
Yeah, they printed it on like a piece of leather or something, a heavy piece of leather.

805
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,920
That's what your receipt would be.

806
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,680
And that printer that your stores have to have that every store up there

807
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,300
has to have a leather printing receipt printer.

808
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,820
You have to brand it.

809
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,120
It'd be a craftsman.

810
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,780
There'd be some sort of old school craftsman up there.

811
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,900
Oh, the brander.

812
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,640
That's City Walk brander.

813
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,400
Why do you have this?

814
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,920
You know, because of the wind.

815
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,440
Why?

816
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,300
Because of the wind.

817
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,540
Because we use leather receipts, as you know.

818
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,880
And then and over there is the that's the City Walk cattle range.

819
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,500
That's where the cows are slaughtered to make the constant, not not the food

820
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
that the burgers don't come from there.

821
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,800
That we slaughter those cattle's just to make receipt leather.

822
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,300
Over yonder, you could ride a mechanical cattle years ago.

823
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,180
Oh, yeah.

824
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,700
Bad news.

825
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,360
Saddle Ranch goes away.

826
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,200
Yeah.

827
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,660
Yeah.

828
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,180
Oh, too bad.

829
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,400
That's that's one ride that's that's gone.

830
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,920
Fallen brother, fallen brother.

831
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,700
And there are.

832
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,320
Oh, God.

833
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,200
I don't even know where to begin with the fallen brother.

834
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,460
There's so many fallen brothers awaiting you guys.

835
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,660
You know what?

836
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,740
Actually, if I could say anything to you, you guys from 2018

837
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,060
appreciate the stores that you have.

838
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,520
Yeah.

839
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,400
You complained about going to those water coffins.

840
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,700
But what if that was the last chance you ever got?

841
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,180
Let that sit with you.

842
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,180
I mean, that seems OK.

843
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,160
That seems like something I don't want to do again.

844
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:52,980
No water.

845
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,100
You and your fucking attitude.

846
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,740
Twenty eighteen.

847
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,180
Scott, keep it in your pocket.

848
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,860
Oh, these two now.

849
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,680
This is a will.

850
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,180
Will they?

851
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,800
Well, yeah, these two are holding hands and these two have to be separated.

852
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,400
Start as a romantic comedy.

853
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,700
The late the leads often don't like each other, but then they end up

854
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,960
twenty eighteen S.

855
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,140
K.

856
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,780
here.

857
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,320
So water coffins are gone, which also means

858
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,580
employee who gives free head rubs is gone to twenty twenty four.

859
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:21,960
Mike here.

860
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,560
Yeah, I I was just remembering this, that we were touched

861
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,060
a lot by the employee at this establishment.

862
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,120
But if you want to get excited, there is like a tiny tilly is coming.

863
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,480
Oh, Tilly.

864
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:39,800
Wow.

865
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,540
The future is bright, isn't it?

866
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,640
Yep, it sure is.

867
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,060
Was that Panda Express?

868
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,720
Do we do it?

869
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,520
Yeah, I think it was.

870
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:45,940
Yes.

871
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,160
All right.

872
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,640
Can we move on to Smash Burger?

873
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,280
Two and a half stars on Yelp.

874
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,320
Anyone?

875
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,160
Wait a minute, Jason, you referred to a funny picture

876
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,040
you had from there.

877
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,260
Is that true?

878
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,820
I think that was just a lie.

879
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,660
Just like that entire episode was a lie.

880
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,660
Twenty eighteen like Jason, you know, we had a conversation

881
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,440
with the Puckett Stubbett.

882
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,100
No lies.

883
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,440
I'm sorry.

884
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,480
No lie.

885
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,900
That makes his heart hurt.

886
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,640
I know.

887
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:14,160
I just got so overwhelmed eating all those Smash Burgers.

888
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,640
Well, I.

889
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,760
That's a different type of part.

890
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,240
He's lying again.

891
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,260
He's never he's never that overwhelmed eating any of this.

892
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,240
It's kind of reasonable size.

893
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,840
Yeah, I like Smash Burger.

894
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,040
Unfortunately, he became the habit, which I don't think is good.

895
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,020
Well, if we're going mathematically on this Smash Burger,

896
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,460
two and a half stars on Yelp, the habit two and a half stars on Yelp.

897
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,160
So it's a lateral move in terms of the public's feelings.

898
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,760
I don't I can't really I've never I never had Smash Burger, so I can't say.

899
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,560
I don't like that their name was just one word all run together.

900
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,200
When I was checking the sector assignments and bothered me,

901
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,380
I thought we made a typo, but we didn't.

902
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,320
I like it.

903
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:54,980
You like it.

904
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,720
I like it, too.

905
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,900
We both like it.

906
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,380
Yeah, I think it's kind of cool.

907
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,740
That's two, actually four, because we both like it.

908
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,560
Oh, you're right.

909
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,620
2018, Jason.

910
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,140
Oh, are you?

911
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
You said we before you even chimed in.

912
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,760
Are you are you sharing?

913
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,460
Are you turning into one person?

914
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,440
Well, we both really like Smash Burger, you know.

915
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,420
Yeah, no, I know.

916
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,080
But you're using one consciousness.

917
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,480
But yeah, look, they're both holding the same firehouse sub.

918
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,100
It's like when a hive, like an avatar links with the mighty.

919
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,080
No, the hair brand or the hair band.

920
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,520
Yeah.

921
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,020
Yeah.

922
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,060
We bought a large because it's easy to share

923
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,080
and it's more cost effective than getting two individuals.

924
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,560
They're speaking in unison.

925
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,380
Oh, my God.

926
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,680
These two, they are minutes away from Lady and the Tramping.

927
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,520
Yeah, we're going to meet in the middle of the pickle that you get included

928
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,860
with your firehouse sub.

929
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,080
I'm going to do a real test of 2018, Mike, because he doesn't.

930
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,140
You don't you don't know the context of this.

931
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,100
You ever seen the movie Dinosaur?

932
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,840
Let me show you a picture.

933
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,400
Let me show you.

934
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,780
I know the character.

935
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,920
This is this is a baby, a baby named Baby Aladar.

936
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,460
What do you think about this?

937
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,140
What are the adjectives you would use to describe this dinosaur?

938
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,500
Oh, my God.

939
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,840
But that baby dinosaur from the movie Dinosaur, honestly,

940
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,700
I'm having this weird feeling all my life.

941
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,620
I never wanted to have a child.

942
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,300
But seeing Baby Aladar is kind of unlock something in me, something profound.

943
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,760
I need to have children because of how cute that dinosaur is.

944
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,240
Oh, my God.

945
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,680
That's what did it.

946
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,780
I think I need to go.

947
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
I think I need to be planning for my future.

948
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,800
I think I need to leave this.

949
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,280
No, no, stick around, at least until the end of the episode.

950
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,500
And then family plan.

951
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,820
Twenty twenty four, Mike here.

952
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,020
Yeah.

953
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,760
Also, I want to tell you about the fact that this toy company

954
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,140
makes all of the mighty mutanimals in the future.

955
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:54,880
Oh, twenty eight.

956
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,840
Holy shit.

957
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,160
Are you kidding me?

958
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,360
You're talking about Man Ray, Dreadmon and Jaguar.

959
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,940
Yeah, yeah, I'm talking about them.

960
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:02,960
Oh, my God.

961
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,380
This is I can't I'm going to have to lie down.

962
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:05,720
Twenty eight.

963
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,040
Michael's gonna have to lie down right now.

964
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,880
There's so much I'm going to have a child and I'm going to own plastic.

965
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,700
Mighty Mutanimals.

966
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,220
Oh, my God.

967
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,340
I'm lying down.

968
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,320
That's right.

969
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,740
And you're doing another city walk series.

970
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,280
Twenty twenty four is a that's good to perfect bliss.

971
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,260
Holy shit.

972
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,380
It only gets better.

973
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,340
All right.

974
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,080
Do we do we have any observation?

975
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,640
Do we have one observation about one of these burger places?

976
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,460
Twenty twenty four.

977
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,840
I Michael says I like Smash Burger in general.

978
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,860
You can like kind of fool me with a burger if it's Smash Burger.

979
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,280
I like the patties.

980
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,480
Steak and Shake has always had a smash burger, which is where I think.

981
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,580
Yeah, I prefer a thinner burger.

982
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,140
I I'm OK with the fat burger and a thin burger doesn't matter.

983
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:50,060
But I think my preference is thinner patties.

984
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,140
I you know what?

985
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,740
I I don't like the thing that's called on is people make smash burgers

986
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,700
and then give you a few patties that just makes a fat patty.

987
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,060
It's just yeah, you're just stacking them up.

988
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,780
Twenty twenty four, Jason, that defeats the purpose of their thin and smash.

989
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,440
Here's the thing, though, about it is that if you can put the ingredients

990
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,660
in between the smashed patties, then I think you're getting different

991
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,300
sort of flavor profiles or you're getting different.

992
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,340
That's OK.

993
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,820
But if you're going to see, I agree with you,

994
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,760
if you're going to stack them, what's the point?

995
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,120
You may as well just have one big thick piece of meat.

996
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Sure.

997
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,880
Twenty twenty four, Scott, you're still putting up with this.

998
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,900
Oh, you have no idea.

999
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,760
Twenty eighteen, Scott, just be just be glad they haven't started

1000
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,600
getting into the CVS coupons yet.

1001
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,340
That's what it becomes.

1002
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,520
Yeah, a lot of times, many, many times.

1003
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,960
Is this still a theme park podcast?

1004
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,080
No.

1005
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,380
You're looking at it.

1006
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,380
Or no, we would pivot to a full Mickey Rooney podcast if we could.

1007
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,820
We'd have to go back way before the city walks

1008
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,620
saga to make sure this stays a theme park podcast.

1009
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,520
Today's episode is the Space Mountain.

1010
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,120
But let's first imagine what Mickey Rooney would be like if he wrote it.

1011
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,680
Wait a minute.

1012
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,860
You guys haven't done Space Mountain.

1013
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,840
Wait, that doesn't make sense.

1014
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,100
Twenty eighteen, Scott, I just got an email from that guest

1015
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,200
you've been wanting to have on that really funny comedian.

1016
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,740
He says he wants to do Space Mountain, that, you know, Jay Johnston.

1017
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,020
Why haven't we locked that in yet?

1018
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,240
Why are we?

1019
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,120
Oh, we should.

1020
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,040
Space Mountain with Jay Johnston is going to be great.

1021
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,880
What about PokÃ©ball?

1022
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,460
Well, there's been a change with PokÃ©ball, too, I'm afraid to say.

1023
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,040
Yes.

1024
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,900
PokÃ©ball got upgraded to Uncle Sharky PokÃ©ball.

1025
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,740
Not Uncle Shark, too, like I was saying for days.

1026
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,680
And it's actually Sharky with two days.

1027
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,520
You were saying that because it's it's like it looks like Roman numeral.

1028
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,480
Yeah, I thought it was Roman numeral.

1029
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,840
Uncle Shark, Uncle Shark.

1030
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,120
You know, I thought maybe it was a second location.

1031
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,560
They actually have a lot of locations, a number of which are in Walmarts.

1032
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,180
Yeah, I don't know if I would trust.

1033
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,460
You wouldn't trust a restaurant in Walmart, but Mike over there

1034
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,980
lit up at just the sight of a new Taco Bell in a Walmart.

1035
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,060
In the Buena Park Walmart.

1036
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,280
Oh, spoiler alert for young you.

1037
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,240
Yeah, sorry.

1038
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,800
Oh, he's still lying on the ground.

1039
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,680
Yeah, he's overwhelmed.

1040
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,400
He's a mumbling characters from the Archie Ninja Turtle line

1041
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,960
and almost like a haze.

1042
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,060
He's just like in serial.

1043
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,240
Feminator X belly bomb.

1044
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,780
Uncle Sharky's poke, Uncle Bova T

1045
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,480
and dole soft serve.

1046
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,980
So don't so you can get to whip at Universal City while Hollywood now

1047
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,860
in different flavors.

1048
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,120
Now this I did go up and eat at I was like, all right,

1049
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,480
we got to go back to the food court.

1050
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,560
I'll go get something.

1051
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,880
I do really like poke and thought, well, that's you know, I'll give that a go.

1052
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:56,440
After everything that's happened for now, 20 days of the saga,

1053
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,640
I am so nervous about food.

1054
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,980
I'm so nervous about getting food at any of these locations.

1055
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:04,700
What?

1056
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,040
Why?

1057
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,520
You'll see in six years.

1058
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,280
You're actually you're probably seeing right now, but you'll forget.

1059
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,060
So I did a couple things just to like secure my

1060
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,620
just to get more confident about this entire thing.

1061
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,940
The reason I knew that there were ones in Walmart is like I was like, OK,

1062
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,180
if I'm going to get raw fish at City Walk,

1063
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,020
I need to make sure this is a real restaurant with other locations,

1064
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:32,340
because after this Orlando saga, no more of these fake restaurants

1065
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,980
that Universal invented that don't exist anywhere else.

1066
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,980
No more of these bread boxes and these toothsums.

1067
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,380
The owner of a restaurant I go to cannot be Universal Studios.

1068
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,520
They're a theme park and movie company.

1069
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,340
They make terrible restaurants.

1070
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,720
So I was relieved to find it actually was a relief to me

1071
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,040
that there are other locations inside Walmart that added to their credibility.

1072
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,020
Oh, OK.

1073
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,140
They also had a cute story of like, oh, and it started

1074
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:05,780
when a family member, an uncle, a kid I never met, gave her a stuff shark.

1075
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,980
And then they were like, oh, well, that's really cute.

1076
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,900
And hey, what if we open that restaurant that, you know, there is some myth

1077
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,580
making that's pretty charming.

1078
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,020
What a story.

1079
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,020
Yeah.

1080
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,660
And they're hey, there you got a toy there.

1081
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,260
You see?

1082
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,480
Yeah.

1083
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,380
Here you go.

1084
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,500
Take a.

1085
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,360
He's got a stuffed animal.

1086
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,880
They're trying to, you know, they're they're bringing their Hawaiian cuisine,

1087
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,260
they say, the Hawaiian, you know, food.

1088
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,580
Yeah, yeah, they sure did.

1089
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,920
Well, what they brought was, you know, the worst poke I've had in a while.

1090
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,940
But but not poke that made me specifically sick.

1091
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,160
And that is where the bar is at this point.

1092
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,420
But this but I was also like I had a I had a pitch meeting not long after.

1093
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,240
And so I'm and I didn't remember that until I had the poke bowl in front of me.

1094
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,260
And I'm just like I was like trembling with the chopsticks.

1095
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,100
I'm like, this is going to be where it happens.

1096
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,080
I'm going to get one more food poisoning on the way out the door.

1097
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,620
I was never in this infinite saga.

1098
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,040
By the way, guys, it's infinite.

1099
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:08,860
We don't know.

1100
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,600
You usually luxuriate in your only 19 series.

1101
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,760
We don't know when this one is going to end.

1102
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,920
We still don't know.

1103
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:16,760
Infinite.

1104
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,640
Infinite.

1105
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,880
That's what you told.

1106
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,840
Wait, no, not you.

1107
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,320
That's what the future you told.

1108
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,480
No, it's infinite.

1109
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,540
Well, what's happening?

1110
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,820
Have you all lost your minds in 2024?

1111
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,620
Yes, we have.

1112
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,200
And you'll see why in the next couple of years.

1113
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,480
Again, why don't you like Scott, you said you had a pitch meeting,

1114
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,360
haven't you guys in all of these years?

1115
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:42,520
Scott, Mike and Jason, haven't you all been busy doing a ton of writing and acting?

1116
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,380
Surely it's been a fruitful run for all of that stuff.

1117
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,640
Um, yeah, it's been OK.

1118
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,100
Yeah, no, not not so bad.

1119
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,840
Uh, no, no long pause.

1120
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,000
No multiple long pauses and all of multiple.

1121
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:58,460
What?

1122
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,820
Yeah, man, you're going to meet a very charming,

1123
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,920
very sexy man named Sam Bankman.

1124
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,520
Oh, well, he sounds like an interesting character.

1125
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,540
And no matter what I tell you, he's irresistible and that path can't be changed.

1126
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,320
Oh, yeah.

1127
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,180
Everybody in 2018, learn the phrase NFTs

1128
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,020
and then forget the phrase NFTs.

1129
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,640
That'll all wrap itself up nicely.

1130
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,780
You're going to be very tempted to invest heavily in crapopolis NFTs.

1131
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,040
Crapopolis, this phrase is unfamiliar to me.

1132
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,960
You'll know it.

1133
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,880
It's ubiquitous in 2024.

1134
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,740
Oh, OK.

1135
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,520
I look I didn't get sick is the point, but truly like the the terror.

1136
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,900
I like the like now I go into any of these situations,

1137
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,940
assuming and expecting the worst.

1138
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,820
Like Aaron said, you might be the only person to ever have a mental food poisoning.

1139
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,980
You had pre-asus psychosomatic food poisoning.

1140
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,240
That's why I got a tiny little sandwich.

1141
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,160
Hey, Mike got a bubble tea there, right?

1142
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,220
I did get a lemonade strawberry bubble tea with boba in it.

1143
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,120
And I've talked before on the show, I'm not a big boba guy,

1144
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,040
but I did try the boba.

1145
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,740
And this was this was much sweet.

1146
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,180
I bet this was much sweeter than whatever soda syrup you were drinking.

1147
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,840
This was so sugary.

1148
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,220
Boba can be very sweet.

1149
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,380
I could not believe it.

1150
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,480
And it was like it was almost like twice the sugar of like a normal piece of candy

1151
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,720
when I would bite into the boba.

1152
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,260
2018 Mike's looking at 2024 Mike is like too sweet.

1153
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,580
No, I wouldn't.

1154
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,400
What's the fucking problem with that?

1155
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:41,980
That's good.

1156
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,920
I'm looking forward to that.

1157
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,220
Yeah, it's just the problem with it was just I mean, the whole I did a lot.

1158
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,000
I was going for a lot as far as food is concerned.

1159
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,060
I wanted to sample different things,

1160
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,460
but it was just not what I needed at that moment.

1161
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,380
I needed something less sweet, I think.

1162
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,500
But you sound like you get fucking old and lame.

1163
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,420
Well, I mean, yeah, to some degree I can.

1164
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,140
I've said on this saga specifically, sometimes I can't deal with the sugar

1165
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,120
like I used to be.

1166
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,340
Oh, man.

1167
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,800
That's really oh, God.

1168
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,780
But the mighty new channels are still coming out.

1169
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,820
Yeah, yeah, they're they're coming out.

1170
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,340
Don't worry.

1171
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,280
All right.

1172
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,960
Well, something look forward to, I guess.

1173
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,860
Yeah, 2018 Mike's a sugar fiend.

1174
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,500
He's the one who was licking the rim of the bubble gum.

1175
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,060
Oh, yeah.

1176
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,060
You remember when you were at that.

1177
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,420
He's still got it.

1178
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:32,840
He's doing it.

1179
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,480
You kept it to it was two weeks ago, dude.

1180
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,620
You know, there's no alcohol, right?

1181
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,220
You've learned that by now.

1182
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,200
Yeah, it's better that there's no alcohol.

1183
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,280
Hey, it's 2018, Jason.

1184
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,000
Don't hog all the rim.

1185
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,900
You want to hit it, brother?

1186
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,380
Yeah, I do, brother.

1187
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,380
You know, I do.

1188
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,120
Twenty eighteen, Jason, twenty eight, eighteen, Mike and twenty

1189
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,300
twenty four, Jason are all sucking rim.

1190
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,480
They're all doing some kind of weird search.

1191
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,780
I know it's a little like they're kind of rim job happening.

1192
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,640
You might say, Jason, twenty, just scratched out pussy walking road,

1193
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,040
city rim on his notebook.

1194
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,440
I don't know.

1195
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,220
He wrote it.

1196
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,400
I'm just saying what he did.

1197
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,460
Hey, this twenty to twenty four, Jason, I would probably write rim walk.

1198
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,260
I see that saves everything.

1199
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,300
Twenty twenty four, Mike, you got to you got to step in and stop this.

1200
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,140
I think you've become more of a prude than when you started.

1201
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,320
I went back and listened to that secret.

1202
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,060
Twenty twenty one that we did during the pandemic.

1203
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,640
What was that?

1204
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,620
Don't worry about it.

1205
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,360
And the only in that episode, we talked about the weird masks

1206
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,000
we had to put on masks to worry about.

1207
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,760
And Jason said it was like weird, like it was like a vending machine,

1208
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,060
panties or something.

1209
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,660
And then Mike in twenty, he said it all her umphi.

1210
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,280
Is this the debut of the word panties on podcast the ride?

1211
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,000
Now we are saying rim job willy nilly.

1212
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,360
You got to put some order in this whole thing.

1213
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,740
It was the debut of the word panties.

1214
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,760
We're just pointing out that it was a historical moment in the show, I think.

1215
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,600
Hey, what about a lot of attitude?

1216
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,020
Well, it was the pandemic.

1217
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,280
Don't worry about what that is.

1218
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,680
Technically, now Jason here, let me just cut in.

1219
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,400
Where is this vending machine?

1220
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,360
Hey, it's twenty twenty four, Jason.

1221
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,020
Like it was a metaphor.

1222
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,900
Don't worry about it.

1223
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,980
He wrote he scratched out city room and wrote panty walk.

1224
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,820
The the dating apps that you knew Jason is talking about.

1225
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:46,460
Don't show you the location of of panty vending machines in Los Angeles.

1226
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,160
OK, dating is one thing.

1227
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,360
Those are going to have to find out.

1228
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,920
Frankly, I don't know where they are in this city.

1229
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,880
I don't either.

1230
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,040
I don't want to know.

1231
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:53,660
Good boy.

1232
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,180
Well, I was twenty twenty four keeper just to say now is

1233
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,100
technically the debut of panty.

1234
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,700
If you think about it.

1235
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,660
Oh, you're right.

1236
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,460
Oh, you're right.

1237
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:04,920
Yeah.

1238
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,000
So it wasn't you.

1239
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,640
We now said panty on the show in twenty eighteen.

1240
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,400
That's right.

1241
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,080
Wow.

1242
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:11,580
Wow.

1243
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,160
That's cool.

1244
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,980
That's cool.

1245
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,080
Hey, man, that's some Zemeckis shit, right?

1246
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,860
We can set up all sorts of things from back here, actually.

1247
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:21,700
That's a good point.

1248
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:21,980
Yeah.

1249
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,140
This is for twenty eighteen, Mike.

1250
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,140
There is a 15 year old actress in your time who's on a Disney

1251
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,120
channel show called Bazaar Vark.

1252
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:31,620
Oh, yeah.

1253
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,600
Her name is Olivia Rodrigo.

1254
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,820
She goes on to make some music that is the key to future Mike being cool.

1255
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:42,260
So whatever you do, finish the entire album.

1256
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,100
OK.

1257
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:43,980
All right.

1258
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,740
Quickly, though, can I take six months to finish it?

1259
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,400
I'm worried if you pause, it'll never get done.

1260
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,160
I'm just trying to help prevent something in the future.

1261
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,000
And don't forget to watch all of Bazaar Vark.

1262
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,180
Oh, yeah.

1263
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,600
That's one of the Paul voices in it.

1264
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:01,860
OK.

1265
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,060
And I have to watch all that.

1266
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,340
Yeah.

1267
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,920
You got to watch all that because they don't go away.

1268
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,960
Jake and Logan Paul.

1269
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,260
If anything, they become more prominent.

1270
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:09,680
All right.

1271
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,500
They were on that.

1272
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,640
Oh, wait, wait.

1273
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,660
Jake and Logan.

1274
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:14,580
Yeah.

1275
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,240
A second.

1276
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,180
He was learning about pop culture.

1277
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,460
Oh, there's so many horrors for you to learn about.

1278
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:19,960
OK.

1279
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,720
Don't tell him about whether he's in the low gang or team 10,

1280
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,280
because at some point he's going to have to choose which brother.

1281
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,520
Boys, boys, 24 Sector Keepers speaking.

1282
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1283
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,820
Take us a Taco Bell.

1284
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,420
You're slowly closing the roof.

1285
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,860
OK, what KFC pizza?

1286
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,140
OK, was it the same back then?

1287
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,700
It's that it's not a Taco Bell KFC Pizza Hut, right?

1288
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,300
There's a Taco Bell and then to separate.

1289
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,560
And then there's a KFC Pizza Hut, but it's not one of those.

1290
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,140
We're all three are in one place, right?

1291
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:54,740
Right.

1292
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,920
It feels like a missed opportunity.

1293
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,800
Not just have like a like a triple.

1294
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,500
Yeah.

1295
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,380
Triple threat.

1296
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,220
Thruple.

1297
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,200
Yeah.

1298
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,640
Oh, yeah.

1299
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,560
Start the 2018.

1300
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,120
Start learning all these words, situationship.

1301
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,900
Jason's going to be the key.

1302
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,460
He's going to know him before the rest.

1303
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:10,960
Yeah.

1304
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:11,060
Yeah.

1305
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,040
So start throw out any current slang.

1306
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:13,760
You know, the current.

1307
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,840
So you scratched down and says, Thruple Walkman.

1308
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,800
You're on your second page, man.

1309
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,640
To get a whole new binder.

1310
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,520
OK, well, you know what?

1311
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,740
Here's a good place to start.

1312
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,600
People have been listening, I assume, revisiting that fragment

1313
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,800
of an episode for many, many years and dying to know

1314
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,360
what Mike had to say about the differences between this Taco Bell

1315
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,700
and the one that he frequents in Burbank.

1316
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,720
Now is finally the time to let the cat out of the bag.

1317
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,120
What are these differences?

1318
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,100
Well, price wise.

1319
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:52,740
Yeah.

1320
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah.

1321
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:53,580
Price.

1322
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,400
What do we think is the general City Walk markup?

1323
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,660
Is it it's not 50 percent?

1324
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,040
25 to 50 percent.

1325
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,340
It could you think it can be 50?

1326
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,920
Yeah, but probably closer to 25.

1327
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,120
There's a sector tax.

1328
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:04,440
Yeah.

1329
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,660
That's why.

1330
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,920
Check their check those leather receipts.

1331
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,340
You'll see it on there.

1332
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,320
Well, they have basically everything here.

1333
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,880
I on my most recent trip to city food, I did not have Taco Bell.

1334
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,960
But in the past, I have, you know, I'm a guy, especially now as I get older.

1335
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,840
You know, a twenty eighteen, Michael, you would maybe get two chalupas,

1336
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,320
two or three chalupas.

1337
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,440
I'm now more one chalupa than regular tacos.

1338
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,260
Oh, my gosh.

1339
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,440
He's lying down.

1340
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,380
It was he fainted, but he was already lying down.

1341
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,760
I used to when we were in high school, man, we used to have like three

1342
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,440
chalupas for lunch, beef chalupas with a bunch of stuff.

1343
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,840
We got like extra sour cream.

1344
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,360
We fucking mean we've changed that.

1345
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,340
Yeah, I just like what it's, you know, it's a big sugar shell.

1346
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,960
It's like that's more of a dessert almost.

1347
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,600
It's like a dessert shell on a chalupa.

1348
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,380
Delicious still, as long as it's hot.

1349
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,340
And even if it's not hot, it's still pretty good.

1350
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,620
But yeah, I just we do one fun thing now and we do maybe like a couple soft shell

1351
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,580
tacos with we also do chicken now, not the beef generally.

1352
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,680
What the fuck do you mean?

1353
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,800
You chicken, the chicken doesn't even taste the beef tastes way better than the chicken.

1354
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:08,660
Yeah, I know.

1355
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,260
But if you look on the app, it's the calories go lower.

1356
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,240
So you can get like 30 or 40 calories off of your whole like each item

1357
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,020
if you go chicken instead of the beef.

1358
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,280
I want to tell both of you, Mike, that Taco Bell chicken started

1359
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,120
going down the hill well before 2018.

1360
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,360
Tell me they at least still have the shredded chicken and not just the chicken chunks.

1361
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,100
Yeah, Jason, I really like that shredded chicken.

1362
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,280
Well, Jason, I have something to tell you.

1363
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,640
The shredded chicken is gone.

1364
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:35,760
What?

1365
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,920
The shredded chicken is no longer an option when you go on the app.

1366
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,920
You can't have shredded chicken anymore, which is better than the chunked chicken chunks.

1367
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,500
They only have chicken chunks now.

1368
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,780
You're going to make young use all the kill themselves.

1369
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,280
Now, young Jason's lying down.

1370
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,520
Hey, young Jason, they they do.

1371
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,500
So I'm sure they do tacos.

1372
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,500
They do go away for a while, though.

1373
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,680
Oh, he's in pain now.

1374
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,320
Please tell me there's at least some iteration of Sheldon

1375
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,020
and Big Bang Theory on television in 2024.

1376
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,040
Yeah, of course there is.

1377
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:13,500
Yeah.

1378
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,520
As an eternal being, I can tell you, hundreds of years from now,

1379
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:22,520
there will be Sheldon like Shakespeare, festivals, adaptations,

1380
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,720
Sheldon in the park, Sheldon in the round, Sheldon in the round.

1381
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,780
Sheldon becomes like a Hamlet kind of character where all the great

1382
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:32,440
that's right.

1383
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,340
I'm like King Lear, all the great performers.

1384
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:39,060
It'll replace Macbeth because that's what you're cursed if you say that in the theater.

1385
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,700
But but you know, when that's replaced by Sheldon, that doesn't have that same.

1386
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,240
It went that's gone.

1387
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,460
We flushed that down the toilet.

1388
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,700
It went Macbeth, Joker, Sheldon.

1389
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,300
That's right.

1390
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,940
As far as those characters are concerned,

1391
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,960
it's the rite of passage of all great actors.

1392
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,400
Right.

1393
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:52,720
Right.

1394
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,340
OK.

1395
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,500
So there's an amazing A.

1396
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:55,720
I.

1397
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,980
simulation of Michael Caine playing Sheldon in the year 3000.

1398
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,560
And the people are going to flip over.

1399
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,700
Yeah, that does sound good.

1400
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,140
A.

1401
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:03,680
I.

1402
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:07,900
I mean, I know that movie, but you'll learn about it.

1403
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,280
Anymore Taco Bell or can we move on to Pink's?

1404
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,600
We can move on to Pink's.

1405
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,140
Wow.

1406
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,280
Boys, boys, let's hear about Pink's.

1407
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,120
That gives you strength.

1408
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:17,540
OK.

1409
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,820
So so Pink's the way this has worked out.

1410
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,720
We were talking about Pink's yesterday on the show.

1411
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,560
We did the Hot Dog Hall of Fame with Jamie Loftus.

1412
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,800
And there was agreement in the room that Pink's is not good.

1413
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,880
That was that was said definitively.

1414
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,180
This is this, you know, longtime L.

1415
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:36,360
A.

1416
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:36,740
fixture.

1417
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,940
It's really become one of those like it's a photo location

1418
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,020
and you got to go to the big line and they have the hot dogs named after celebrities.

1419
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,880
And we all agreed, like whenever it's it's one of those like you actually live in L.

1420
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,100
A.

1421
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,520
You ever try that, you start to go, it's not good.

1422
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,320
That is a big overrated.

1423
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,800
And yet not to not to dox her.

1424
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,180
Yeah.

1425
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,020
But it does.

1426
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,960
This was this was said definitively by Jamie yesterday.

1427
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:07,460
Then immediately after we saw her, you guys went up to city.

1428
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,020
And I went up to City Walk and as I was trying to figure out what to do,

1429
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,720
I look over and Jamie was there.

1430
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,580
Did not invite her.

1431
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,440
We would have been happy.

1432
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,160
We should have invited her, but we did not.

1433
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,620
Or she was just there on her own, headed for Pink's.

1434
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,440
That rules.

1435
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,300
Wow.

1436
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,180
And you know what?

1437
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,340
Continuing to go back to a place that you actively don't like

1438
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,160
is the spirit of podcast.

1439
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:30,680
The rock.

1440
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,300
Well, yeah.

1441
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,320
And despite my warnings on that recording of getting sick

1442
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,440
twice from chili dogs at Universal Hollywood,

1443
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,880
both Mike and Jamie Loftus came back to the table with chili dogs.

1444
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:49,520
Wait, Mike, you had to again, right after a long conversation

1445
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,760
where several times we said Pink's is bad.

1446
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,160
Then you had pink.

1447
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,480
Can you name everything you ordered?

1448
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,680
Do you want to stack it up so much?

1449
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,940
I mean, it was that you have one question.

1450
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,420
Yeah, go ahead.

1451
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,260
This is twenty eighteen sector, Gabor.

1452
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,820
Does something happen in the future where your minds are erased on

1453
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:11,580
on the regular, where you just keep eating this shit?

1454
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,360
Yeah, guys, we we have this movie.

1455
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,680
I don't know if you remember it.

1456
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,600
You guess you don't because your memory isn't very good.

1457
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,580
And it's not as popular as Shop Girl.

1458
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,120
But there's this movie Memento with a lot of like memory wipes.

1459
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,640
Is that what happens to you guys?

1460
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,460
Like, why else?

1461
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,560
And you have a big tattoo of spoiled food on your back.

1462
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,540
No, I said the thing is, I keep forgetting to tattoo it.

1463
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,740
You need to get the tattoo.

1464
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,300
Well, everyone knows we're in twenty twenty four.

1465
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,440
We know all of us push out of getting tattoos.

1466
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,120
That happened weeks ago.

1467
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,700
No way any of us are doing that.

1468
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,520
So I got that that tea.

1469
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,500
I got a pink's chili cheese dog with fries.

1470
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:54,660
And I got eight wings from the KFC Pizza Hut.

1471
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,960
Now, the wings were not from the KFC.

1472
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,600
They were from the Pizza Hut.

1473
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,500
From the Wing Street from the Wing Street brand in the Pizza Hut.

1474
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,680
This is part of the KFC Express.

1475
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,400
Well, this is from the they're in the same building.

1476
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,820
But I just want to make clear that these are not wings.

1477
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,780
You would get it at KFC.

1478
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,160
They're wings.

1479
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,500
You would get it at Pizza Hut.

1480
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,020
There's a way that you can walk into a establishment that says KFC

1481
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,220
and get chicken that is not Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1482
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:20,760
Exactly.

1483
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,160
Different.

1484
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,640
This is more this is Wing Street Pizza Hut chicken.

1485
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,200
And they were honey barbecue.

1486
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,560
They were honey barbecue.

1487
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,340
They were eight.

1488
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,000
They were tossed in this little kind of like a spherical container.

1489
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,660
It's not a full sphere, but it's close.

1490
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,460
I've got a picture of the TV ads flipping the wings.

1491
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,640
Flipping it up wings.

1492
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,280
Another this was a glossy barbecue sauce.

1493
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,520
So this is what we're dealing with.

1494
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,980
This is my meal yesterday.

1495
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:47,580
Sector keyboard.

1496
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,360
You about to say.

1497
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,820
I was just going to say another photo is being shown.

1498
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,020
And this food looks on.

1499
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,080
This looks inedible is what I'm trying to say.

1500
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,340
So, yeah, so I actually didn't really want the fries,

1501
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,760
but the guy said, like, oh, chili cheese dog and fries.

1502
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,640
And I go, yeah.

1503
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,160
And I just ordered it there.

1504
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,900
Please take it and shut the door before I fly away.

1505
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,740
This looks like a fryer.

1506
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:12,620
This is the top of the spherical container that the wings were in.

1507
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,320
Can you see those droplets of the honey barbecue there?

1508
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,800
It looks maybe like some like aliens blood.

1509
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:18,920
Ah, it's delicious.

1510
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,520
I just wanted to sample.

1511
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,640
I wanted to sample things.

1512
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,020
Now, I will say this.

1513
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:26,160
I did know that these wings were going to be pretty good.

1514
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,700
And they were they were pretty good.

1515
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,780
Yeah, they're pretty good.

1516
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,240
Because I've had them before.

1517
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,860
But you're having it at CityWalk.

1518
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:33,700
Different flavor.

1519
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,460
Different flavor I've had before.

1520
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,620
They know they have garlic Parmesan.

1521
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,840
It's very similar to a Buffalo Wild Wing.

1522
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,980
It's a very similar to what you get there.

1523
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:41,340
Don't.

1524
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,920
And this is more for 2018.

1525
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,360
Mike, don't become your future self.

1526
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:51,900
You learn for once that CityWalk unravels everything you think you know.

1527
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,520
Anything that you like can be bad and hurt you

1528
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,980
because the name CityWalk is next to it.

1529
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,600
Hey, this is 2018, Jason.

1530
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,980
I like a honey barbecue boneless wing and I tip it in blue cheese.

1531
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:06,060
Hey, 2024, Jason, that doesn't change.

1532
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,200
Wow.

1533
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,520
Oh, that really interesting.

1534
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,660
Yeah, pretty good.

1535
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:15,320
I'm sure you said up off the floor like you like you resurrected the Undertaker.

1536
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,180
Yeah, the eyes.

1537
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,000
2018, Mike Wade, did I get through to you at all?

1538
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,940
Well, I know what you're saying and I understand it,

1539
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,420
but it sounds like this guy can still put away eight to 12 wings in one sitting.

1540
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,880
So it sounds like we're doing OK.

1541
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,800
Yeah, I hear what you're saying, but it sounds like the wings are fine.

1542
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,540
And he's eating a chili dog like Sonic the Hedgehog.

1543
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah.

1544
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,700
So it's yeah, Sonic's cool.

1545
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,880
Right, SKs?

1546
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,620
Yeah, Sonic rules.

1547
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,320
Is this guy, even though he's acting like he's older or whatever,

1548
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,620
this guy can still fucking go.

1549
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,700
This guy can still eat whatever you put a fucking cupcake in front of him.

1550
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,120
He'll eat it.

1551
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,280
He's not going to have a weird shit.

1552
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,460
He will be fine.

1553
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,040
It's not he's not that old.

1554
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,720
He's basically the same as I am.

1555
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,120
I mean, yeah, basically, I am the same as this young guy here.

1556
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:57,540
I'm young.

1557
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,340
Michael is basically the same as me.

1558
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:04,600
A 2018 host just, you know, work on your sleep and your bowel movements

1559
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,000
are easy ways to improve your health.

1560
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,480
So keep an eye on those.

1561
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:08,980
Yeah.

1562
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:12,480
And also, this goes for all of you 2018 fuckers.

1563
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,520
It's called Mike Stans.

1564
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,540
Look into them.

1565
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,680
You've been listening back to these episodes.

1566
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,500
Russell, Russell, Rumble, Rumble.

1567
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,480
It's just by they're so cheap.

1568
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,480
Go buy them.

1569
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,480
Mike Stans.

1570
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:28,200
So I guess you guys don't know that you could put a microphone on.

1571
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:28,840
I'm sorry.

1572
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:29,340
I'm sorry.

1573
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,140
Hey, hey, hey, on this shit.

1574
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,400
In the fucking red.

1575
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,060
OK, don't tell me to spend more money on Mike Stans.

1576
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:36,440
All right.

1577
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,360
I don't need to be in the fucking poor house.

1578
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,360
I understand.

1579
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,600
I know these things are.

1580
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,160
Every one of these has been a major financial drain.

1581
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,260
We're all going to have to sell valuable items that we own.

1582
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,620
Jason's wearing the barrel with the straps lately.

1583
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:49,960
That's how bad it's got.

1584
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,300
Twenty eighteen, Jason, is the barrel with the straps.

1585
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,340
It's because that's the style he likes.

1586
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,020
Oh, right.

1587
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,220
That's beside the point.

1588
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:02,580
He's trying to bring back barrel wearing for a new century.

1589
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,720
Twenty twenty four days in here.

1590
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,960
I get a quick tangent to talk about.

1591
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:13,740
I recently had been reading about stuff that shot up at City Walk

1592
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,940
and I used the bathrooms at City Walk and it reminded me.

1593
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:18,840
Stuff that shot up.

1594
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,420
What are you saying?

1595
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,840
Like, like, shot a film.

1596
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:21,780
Sorry, shot.

1597
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:22,440
Oh, OK.

1598
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,580
Yeah, there was a couple of things that could have been.

1599
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:27,480
I truly have been racking my brain.

1600
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:31,200
Did we talk about the Enrique Iglesias video escape,

1601
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,240
which is clearly shot in a City Walk bathroom?

1602
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,680
You say clearly it is what the city.

1603
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,380
Yeah, the city while the city food bathrooms look exactly like this.

1604
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,860
And he is, of course, making out with Anna Kornikova,

1605
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,320
who he would go on to marry.

1606
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,520
They met on this video.

1607
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,520
Wait a minute.

1608
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,080
Wait a minute.

1609
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,300
Twenty eighteen, Scott, you mean I don't go on to marry her.

1610
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,400
Wait, you're married.

1611
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,840
God, are you married?

1612
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,020
Yeah, you were married.

1613
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:00,540
Of course.

1614
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:01,520
I.

1615
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,120
Yeah, sure.

1616
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:02,620
I know.

1617
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,900
But like, just as we're talking about scratch down,

1618
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,720
we're a throuble walk now.

1619
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,260
Oh, wow.

1620
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,740
Yeah, that's right.

1621
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:11,320
Me.

1622
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:15,620
Well, that can be me and current wife, Erin and Kornikova.

1623
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:19,460
But if that doesn't work out, it could be me and Kornikova and Enrique.

1624
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,960
That's I'll do whatever as long as Kornikova is in the picture.

1625
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,700
I got to say, like you calling her Kornikova.

1626
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,420
My nickname for her last name.

1627
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,600
I call her corny.

1628
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:30,940
I call her K dog.

1629
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,820
I call her Annie.

1630
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,460
I look, I'll call her whatever she wants to be called.

1631
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:43,240
Hey, I have to just say that you started that that the piece with quick tangent.

1632
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,020
And it was actually one of the only things that had anything to do with

1633
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,460
city walk that has been talked about.

1634
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:55,940
I mean, we've talked a lot over the years about stuff filmed up there.

1635
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,980
But just seeing that music video, I'm like, well, that's a rest.

1636
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,880
At some point, the welcome by the universe studio store.

1637
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:03,980
That rules.

1638
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,760
I have a request of the audience.

1639
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:07,220
Mm hmm.

1640
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:07,480
Yeah.

1641
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:10,740
Can they take that photo and put you three in it?

1642
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,600
The Kornikova Enrique photo.

1643
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,440
Yeah, like you guys are just using the restroom.

1644
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,920
Yeah, you're just that.

1645
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,660
Oh, we're just in there.

1646
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,960
We're not like all kissing each other.

1647
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,560
No, there's spots for us.

1648
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:22,820
Jason.

1649
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:23,420
Oh, there's plenty.

1650
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,060
There's open sinks.

1651
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,300
You guys can be standing.

1652
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,080
Wow.

1653
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,840
Wash in the barbecue sauce for a little Wink Street.

1654
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,040
Our little grabbers.

1655
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:33,320
Yeah.

1656
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,320
Hey, I got grabbers.

1657
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,800
Yeah, you sure do, bud.

1658
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,580
Is your young Jason getting younger?

1659
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,460
Young Jason's getting younger.

1660
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,120
Oh, he's like seven.

1661
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:46,020
He's got like a little colic in the back.

1662
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:46,620
Yeah.

1663
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,260
He's got like a slowly rising this whole time.

1664
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,360
A shot in his pocket.

1665
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,960
Oh, it's 2024 picture I have of the three of us.

1666
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,360
I just it's not like Back to the Future.

1667
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:57,380
It's not fading.

1668
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,620
Just I'm getting younger.

1669
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,500
The rift must be affecting things.

1670
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,100
Rift must be affecting it.

1671
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,580
Sector keepers, I'm just absorbing their youth.

1672
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,000
You're getting younger.

1673
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,060
The picture is becoming more vivid and Anna Kornikova

1674
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,220
and Enrique are appearing in it.

1675
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,180
Oh, wow.

1676
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,400
Wow.

1677
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,480
This is going to be the rare piece of content ever

1678
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,600
that in one fell swoop went expanded to 30 times its original length.

1679
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,680
Yeah, that's yeah.

1680
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,420
Well, a great expansions that's ever happened.

1681
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,980
Is there any of the sector keepers losing strength?

1682
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,060
One of you must be.

1683
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:37,740
I think they're gaining.

1684
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,920
Oh, this gives us so much strength.

1685
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:40,200
Oh, yeah.

1686
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:41,520
The rift is closing.

1687
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,300
Keep going.

1688
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:42,900
OK.

1689
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,260
I haven't finished even talking about the meal.

1690
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,000
OK, great.

1691
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,440
So I'm eating these wings and I go, these wings taste exactly like I know them to taste,

1692
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:53,400
except now there's a different sauce that I don't always have and I like it.

1693
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:57,580
And so I get to the pinks and the pinks is and I showed you a photo of it.

1694
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,060
It looks it doesn't look like anything special.

1695
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,060
But I said, you know what?

1696
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,320
I would love again.

1697
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,380
I love to be sort of a disruptor on the show once in a while and come in and go,

1698
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,380
you know what?

1699
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,400
Pinks was really good.

1700
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,140
I take a bite of it and it's one of the worst hot dogs I've ever been into immediately.

1701
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,580
It's not rancid or anything.

1702
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,980
It's just not good.

1703
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,460
Everything about it is not good.

1704
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:22,400
The cheese is just like maybe like stale ish again, not rancid, but not good.

1705
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:27,100
So I eat maybe a quarter of it, I would say, maybe a little more than a quarter.

1706
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:33,060
And almost immediately, I develop like a dull stomachache.

1707
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,520
Within the five to ten minutes of eating it.

1708
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,200
And it could have been from the tea.

1709
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,540
It could have been from the wings.

1710
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,460
But I don't think that's right.

1711
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,500
Do you never learn like 2024, Scott?

1712
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,380
Just don't.

1713
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,220
Clearly, it's never going to change.

1714
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,660
Don't even try.

1715
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:49,900
Save your energy.

1716
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,520
If it puts your mind at ease.

1717
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,640
Fries are pretty good.

1718
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,760
The fries were fine.

1719
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,460
Pretty good.

1720
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,680
If I was not put my mind at ease, you developed an insta polyp.

1721
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:04,220
If it no, I'm Googling polyp once a week in my old age.

1722
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,900
Don't put that evil on me.

1723
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:06,660
Yeah.

1724
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:10,620
I'm sure the more hot dogs you eat are going to help you.

1725
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,580
I didn't need all of it.

1726
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,660
I like a quarter of it.

1727
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:16,260
So but no, you probably waited for your dinner hot dog to finish one.

1728
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:21,560
And to be fair to me, also, the stomach ache went away after 20 minutes.

1729
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,080
It was just a quick, immediate.

1730
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:23,860
Oh, good.

1731
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,040
It was not a long term stomach ache.

1732
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,440
Twenty and moved on.

1733
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,260
I came home, I drank my water and everything was fine.

1734
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,080
And the bowel movement today was fine and looked normal.

1735
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,660
You know, a rich color, I think.

1736
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,700
You guys are upset about the word panties,

1737
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,700
but then you just talk openly about your hot dog bowel movements.

1738
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,040
Well, I said bowel movements.

1739
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,640
I didn't say big old shit.

1740
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,660
It looked like a normal brown.

1741
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,580
I didn't say that.

1742
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,700
We go back in time two minutes ago to stop any of this from being.

1743
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,620
Multiverse doing fucking crazy things to me.

1744
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,560
I'm being vulgar.

1745
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,460
I'm talking about my big old shits.

1746
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:56,720
This has to stop.

1747
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,480
We have to fix whatever this is.

1748
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,120
Pretty fit.

1749
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:04,260
Here, I'll chime in about this while we're talking about unnerving things.

1750
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:08,000
I brought Jane a large veggie.

1751
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,100
It was called Veggie Delight from Firehouse Subs.

1752
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,020
And it was delicious.

1753
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:17,560
Could have done without this piece of bright blue plastic in the room.

1754
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:18,640
Oh, what?

1755
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:20,920
You guys.

1756
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:21,640
Is that a tooth?

1757
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:22,320
Wait, what?

1758
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,420
It's a little nubbin.

1759
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:24,820
No, that's a bread crumb.

1760
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:25,460
Oh, OK.

1761
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,840
And it's interesting because the bread was very fresh and delicious.

1762
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,380
Otherwise, you want to go back up there after this?

1763
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,480
Oh, I could go for a little more that tuna.

1764
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:34,940
Yeah.

1765
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:35,660
OK, listen.

1766
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,000
All right.

1767
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:36,560
Here we go.

1768
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,560
This is both Scots.

1769
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,700
If this works out, you're hearing two voices at the same time.

1770
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:43,900
Of course you are.

1771
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,600
Why wouldn't it work out?

1772
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,980
Both Mike's and Jason's need to learn a lesson that sticks.

1773
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,060
Stop eating plastics.

1774
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:58,200
Stop eating hot dogs that only in quotes hurt you for 20 minutes.

1775
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,460
2024 Mike is concerned about microplastics and nanoplastics.

1776
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,620
So that is partly.

1777
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,920
I'm so it's nice that Firehouse Subs just comes out with it.

1778
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,360
And it's not microplastic.

1779
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,520
They just put macroplastic.

1780
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,240
It's a macroplastic.

1781
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,700
Can I just say on Jason's cup at Firehouse Subs,

1782
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,080
they have a picture of Battalion Chief Brady Rigdom.

1783
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,340
There's a picture of this fire chief on the cup.

1784
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,000
And then it also explains to you what thermal imaging cameras are.

1785
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,320
There's an explanation, a dry explanation.

1786
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,740
Yeah, there's a lot of thermal imaging cameras

1787
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,600
that have infrared vision that let firefighters see body heat

1788
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,160
through smoke, walls and darkness, besides pinpointing hot spots

1789
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,980
for efficient firefighting.

1790
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,640
Thermal vision cameras.

1791
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,280
The explanation is all in there.

1792
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:40,900
Yeah.

1793
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:44,560
So there's a little informative to get to get a cup from Firehouse Subs.

1794
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,720
Thank you.

1795
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:48,600
Thank God.

1796
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,280
Thank God.

1797
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,380
OK, OK.

1798
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:50,740
Thanks.

1799
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:51,820
Does that cover?

1800
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:52,180
All right.

1801
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,040
So the meal only hurt you for 20 minutes.

1802
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:54,360
Yeah.

1803
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,120
And this is I'll show you what it looks like.

1804
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,960
But this is basically when I was done with it.

1805
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,740
That's what it looks like.

1806
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,240
That's how much I ate.

1807
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,620
And it was not so much.

1808
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:05,160
Well, Jamie ate all of hers.

1809
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,020
She did.

1810
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:06,320
Yeah.

1811
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,680
She had a better time than I did.

1812
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:08,200
And I don't know.

1813
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,240
Have we checked in?

1814
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:09,740
Is she OK?

1815
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,520
We haven't checked.

1816
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:11,920
We don't know.

1817
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:12,680
We need to.

1818
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:16,580
We only need to be doing wellness checks with anyone who ever has gone.

1819
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,340
That's a good point.

1820
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:17,920
City walk.

1821
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:24,060
You know, like the real pinks, there's a bunch of celebrity photos in there.

1822
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,460
You guys probably noticed those.

1823
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:31,160
You know, one unique landmark among all of these food court locations.

1824
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,620
And there's a picture of Alec Baldwin up there.

1825
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,540
Oh, really, Alec Baldwin.

1826
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,820
You know, I read this script that I hear he's been trying to develop.

1827
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:42,740
It's this Western that's like this really like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1828
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:43,000
Watch.

1829
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,280
No, keep your circle.

1830
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,620
You'll know why later.

1831
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,880
What about KFC Express?

1832
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:51,920
Good idea.

1833
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,920
Well, we covered the wings that aren't from.

1834
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,020
Well, I ordered something from the whole establishment.

1835
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,260
So I don't I didn't need anything from this KFC.

1836
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,680
OK, two stars on Yelp for that one.

1837
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,940
Pink's three, a miraculous three.

1838
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,080
Did I say Taco Bell had one and a half?

1839
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,640
It is so hard to get this low of a score on Yelp.

1840
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,680
The shittiest restaurants have three stars.

1841
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,160
You go any like I feel like everybody like games the system on Yelp these days.

1842
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,660
And you'll have like a three star and it'll be like the worst food you've ever had.

1843
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,360
How hard it must be.

1844
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,120
The amount, the frequency of people that go in and hate their experience

1845
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,420
at City Food is just like immeasurable, innumerable.

1846
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:31,820
Like so many people are going up there mad, get mad enough to go online

1847
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:35,580
and say this sucks and get their score knocked down that low.

1848
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,260
Can I ask Jason, have you 2018 or 2024?

1849
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,800
When was the last time you dropped one of your Yelp reviews?

1850
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,880
Because you 2018, Jason used to do this more often.

1851
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:47,520
I mean, I think Jason did not do that.

1852
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,200
Yeah, that was more earlier.

1853
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,660
Oh, more earlier.

1854
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,040
So you haven't done that in a while.

1855
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,220
Yes, correct.

1856
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:58,500
Because I believe when Anthony Geo and I were on a Herald team with Jason,

1857
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,020
we found a couple of his Yelp reviews.

1858
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,300
Yeah, while I was complaining about Mattello changing their menu offering.

1859
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,340
Can we find that?

1860
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,360
Oh, I deleted it many years ago.

1861
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:10,640
No, no, no, we got to go back in time and stop that.

1862
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,460
It was so long.

1863
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,880
That would be great bonus content is Jason's old Yelp reviews

1864
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,460
about Italian restaurant menu changes.

1865
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:18,540
They were just kind of shitty about it.

1866
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,000
They were just kind of rude about it.

1867
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,900
It was a long it was long.

1868
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,880
It was like war and your war in peace.

1869
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,680
It was a epic.

1870
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:26,400
Wow.

1871
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,520
And I can't remember.

1872
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,600
New lore.

1873
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:31,560
Yeah, I forgot I even mentioned that in all these years.

1874
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,800
Sector keeper, could you access Anthony Geo's brain?

1875
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:34,820
And do you remember that?

1876
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,080
You could see if he remembers that.

1877
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:36,520
Let me see.

1878
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,260
Let me go.

1879
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,020
OK, so it was very long.

1880
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,020
Six, seven paragraphs.

1881
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,820
What was like in the middle of a paragraph?

1882
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:55,040
They removed all the other pizzas, except like the smalls,

1883
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,140
because they were trying to become like a tutorial.

1884
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,680
But it's like it's Vitello's like.

1885
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:01,840
But I don't know that.

1886
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,780
I kind of know what Vitello's is.

1887
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,900
Well, they used to just have like a regular like Red Booth Italian

1888
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:13,580
and kind of and a big menu of just like different takeout pizzas.

1889
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,900
They used to have an express location in Sherman Oaks.

1890
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,580
Sorry, 2018 Jason.

1891
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,800
All this stuff is gone.

1892
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,440
What they close at Sherman Oaks location.

1893
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,560
I liked it a lot.

1894
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,760
Yeah, times are changing.

1895
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,060
John Jason's lying back down.

1896
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,300
What was your Yelp name?

1897
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,840
Can I search that?

1898
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,280
Come on.

1899
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,520
Well, what was it?

1900
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:38,060
It's probably why I think it's just my name and it's probably just nicer

1901
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:43,140
views about old comedy theaters and that Burbank comic stores.

1902
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,040
I forget if you can on Yelp or not.

1903
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,300
Old comedy theaters.

1904
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:52,120
I just wanted to give a nod to Rodney's Rodney Dangerfield's Club.

1905
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:57,000
See, I never got to go, but Rodney seemed like a class act.

1906
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,640
Or John Lovitz's.

1907
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,380
Oh, yeah.

1908
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,640
Do we ever get to reform this podcast?

1909
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,200
John Lovitz?

1910
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,780
No, the John Lovitz Comedy Club is long gone.

1911
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:07,540
Yeah, did they ever take down the sign that says Comedy Club

1912
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:10,160
because they did they ever put in a new comedy club?

1913
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,800
No, no.

1914
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:14,620
Did they ever put in anything?

1915
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:15,920
No.

1916
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:19,480
Are we there?

1917
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,760
I like that there's a big bucket at the on top of the case.

1918
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,380
That's what this is one of the best, like kooky displays.

1919
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,960
There's one thing I will say about this food court that they're

1920
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,340
they kind of have some fun with logos that you see all the time.

1921
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,440
A digital bell on the Taco Bell swaying back and forth.

1922
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,560
Yeah, a big KFC bucket.

1923
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:39,660
Big Panda.

1924
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:41,620
The Panda Express logo.

1925
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:42,820
It's all very big.

1926
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:43,840
OK, yeah.

1927
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,360
Yes.

1928
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,180
So that's fun, right?

1929
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,220
It is fun.

1930
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:48,440
Yes.

1931
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,540
And I like I like.

1932
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:53,280
Yes, I like the idea of city food more than I like city food.

1933
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,800
I like the concept.

1934
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,200
I like that it's elevated.

1935
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,260
I like it's a little I like a mall food court where it's a little tucked away.

1936
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:02,280
So you can like kind of sit in a different area and kind of watch the mall.

1937
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:02,820
Yeah.

1938
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,760
All that is good.

1939
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,140
As a wind tumble come for free.

1940
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,060
Yeah.

1941
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:08,780
You say tumble.

1942
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:09,960
I said, tunnel.

1943
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,460
I just got a little mush now.

1944
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,520
OK, I said it.

1945
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,240
Oh, you still do that, huh?

1946
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:15,840
Yeah.

1947
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,320
Old friend that stays the same.

1948
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,100
You were thinking about tummy, the word tummy.

1949
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,060
Yeah.

1950
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,680
I think about tummies getting this tummy.

1951
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,380
Troubles can often be made worse, I feel like by cold and wind.

1952
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,820
I will hold them and I think it exacerbate a lot of conditions.

1953
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:36,200
Don't start blaming everything that's happened to you guys on the wind.

1954
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:40,520
There is a chance that the wind blew some sort of harmful chemicals into my hot dog.

1955
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,020
Yeah.

1956
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:43,100
And that's why I got a little like 20 minute stomachache.

1957
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,160
It blew my last little bite of pickle away.

1958
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,300
That's unfortunate.

1959
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,720
That's often the best part.

1960
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,760
I know my man.

1961
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,220
I know.

1962
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,360
Lose the pickle in the wind.

1963
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:50,860
Yeah.

1964
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:52,740
Wait, that's real.

1965
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:54,780
I mean, this is all real.

1966
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:55,880
But what the fuck?

1967
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,960
And then the wind blew away.

1968
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,040
It took glue under the table.

1969
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,360
I think the guy swept it up when he was sweeping.

1970
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,500
Did you see it go into the like the waste bin or whatever?

1971
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,200
No, you didn't dive onto the ground and take it out of the dust.

1972
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,320
I went pickle.

1973
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,620
You played that really cool.

1974
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,060
There's a lie.

1975
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:14,860
Yeah, I agree with him.

1976
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,640
There is a line.

1977
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,000
I think if the food court sold pickles that you knew had fallen on the ground

1978
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,840
and gotten dusty, you two would both still line up to get them.

1979
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:23,880
Pretty good.

1980
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,020
I'm not even sick.

1981
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:25,740
Probably the wind.

1982
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:29,040
Jason's much more comfortable with surface germs on his food than I am.

1983
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,180
I will say that.

1984
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,880
Hey, have you gone to Sammy McFloor pickles yet?

1985
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,120
Oh, it's we had it back at the shore, Jason would say.

1986
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,980
That's how they do it there.

1987
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:43,860
It's not weird pickles just celebrating their 100 second anniversary.

1988
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:49,440
Pickles to the second one in all the talk of like a little Jason

1989
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,480
going on little rascals type adventures.

1990
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,280
Yeah, we now have the ultimate example of it.

1991
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,680
Like the first episode would have to be called My Pickle Blew Away.

1992
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:02,940
My crystallize the perfect caper for little Jason.

1993
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,620
Hey, my napkin blew away.

1994
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:09,520
Well, if you're going city food, you're taking that in your own hands, friend.

1995
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:10,920
Yeah, I know.

1996
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,540
It's windy up there.

1997
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,640
I get it.

1998
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,800
I find him on.

1999
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,900
I keep looking for him on.

2000
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,020
Yelp, I can't do 2018.

2001
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:21,640
Us.

2002
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:25,040
Do you now see why this needed to be talked about?

2003
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:25,840
Talk about pizza.

2004
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,300
I didn't we?

2005
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,880
Yeah, we did.

2006
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:29,980
See, because I eat the wings.

2007
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:30,500
I eat the wings.

2008
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,200
Oh, that was the one on my side.

2009
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,480
So I zoned.

2010
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:38,040
Do you think that would OK, KFC has something now called Cheats?

2011
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,880
That's going to blow your mind.

2012
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,800
2018 guys, chicken and pizza have now merged.

2013
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,600
It's Cheats.

2014
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:48,660
But do you think that the cheats of pizza ingredients come from pizza

2015
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:52,060
or like the wings, is it a separate delineation?

2016
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:56,700
Like, can you use Pizza Hut cheese on KFC Cheats?

2017
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,520
I mean, can you?

2018
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:58,960
Should you?

2019
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:01,220
What is the question we're actually asking here?

2020
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,800
Uh, I pizza.

2021
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,580
I'm a big pizza guy of all the fast pizzas.

2022
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,400
That's my favorite.

2023
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:10,360
So if I would love to try the cheese on different things,

2024
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,720
I would love to experiment with the pizza cheese.

2025
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:18,220
Cheats sounds like what you eat right when you go into the bathroom with Anna and Enrique.

2026
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:23,340
And it also was sound Mike was making after he ate that pink

2027
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:24,560
sandwich in the bathroom.

2028
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,580
Oh, cheats.

2029
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,040
Sound.

2030
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,460
Oh, my tummy.

2031
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:32,780
Oh, cheats.

2032
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:34,220
Cheats.

2033
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,520
That's what.

2034
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:35,800
Yeah.

2035
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,620
I also ate some candy from Toothsums afterward.

2036
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,560
My God.

2037
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:40,900
I had to validate.

2038
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:41,800
I had to.

2039
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,260
We hated Toothsums.

2040
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:46,360
We've complained about Toothsums at length.

2041
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:49,020
Can we talk about our valet adventures?

2042
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,220
Oh, do we?

2043
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,460
We got a quick valet adventure.

2044
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,580
We got a quick valet adventure.

2045
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:53,420
Oh, that's true.

2046
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:54,400
We could save it for parking.

2047
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,080
There you go.

2048
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,660
We got to get out of here someday.

2049
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:02,000
Look, look, guys, don't you see it's a place where some of the signs are a little bit kooky.

2050
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:06,240
It's a place that made you sick in new and different ways.

2051
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:11,460
Don't you see now the value in doing an incredibly long episode

2052
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:17,020
instead of an incredibly short episode about sector 16 city food?

2053
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,520
Have you learned your lesson, boys?

2054
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:21,300
Yeah, I guess so.

2055
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:21,800
I don't.

2056
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:22,720
Yeah, I don't think I have.

2057
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,380
I think I actually liked the short one.

2058
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:25,520
Yeah.

2059
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:25,940
All right.

2060
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:26,460
Well, yeah.

2061
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,800
Let's see where that attitude gets you, little Scott.

2062
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,860
Yeah, we might just memento this whole experience.

2063
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:37,360
And they look as long as this long as we can financially recover from one of these things.

2064
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,800
And I can still for the cuddly, the cowlick toy that's going to eventually come out.

2065
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,500
It's fine.

2066
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:42,280
Like short, long.

2067
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,000
I really don't.

2068
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,260
It doesn't bother me either way.

2069
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,800
I just I just kind of now I have a vision of my first born child.

2070
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:50,000
That's just really strong in my mind.

2071
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:56,380
And maybe the name was name Aladar for a boy and Aladarina for a girl.

2072
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,100
Aladarina, that makes sense.

2073
01:19:59,720 --> 01:19:59,720
Yeah.

2074
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,620
Boys, boys.

2075
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:02,200
Yes.

2076
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,460
You've completed the sector.

2077
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:09,580
Officially after five and a half years, we have finally done it.

2078
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,120
We've sewn this all up.

2079
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:16,540
We have completed sector 16 and oh, my God, the real stone.

2080
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,120
Not your stupid napkin.

2081
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:23,800
Twenty eighteen sector keeper forming its tumbling in with a gust of wind.

2082
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:24,740
Wow.

2083
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:25,020
Yeah.

2084
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,340
Oh, nipple of a pickle.

2085
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,080
Wow.

2086
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,320
And look, it's so it's so dusty.

2087
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,920
It's hard to grab it, though.

2088
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,600
The wind is pushing its flying around.

2089
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,060
We have to.

2090
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,560
Yeah, it's not ours unless we can.

2091
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,080
There you go.

2092
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:36,700
You got it.

2093
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:37,160
Wow.

2094
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,540
OK, wait a minute.

2095
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:42,580
Both Jason's, they're holding it up to their mouths.

2096
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:42,780
Whoa.

2097
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:45,560
They're trying to eat it at the same time.

2098
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:46,380
I what?

2099
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:47,660
What's your problem?

2100
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,560
Well, you know what?

2101
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,140
It was kind of sweet to watch.

2102
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,020
I'm glad the two of you that was nice.

2103
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,440
Yeah.

2104
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,260
Found love.

2105
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,520
It is shocking to start kissing earlier.

2106
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,480
We should have all kissed each other.

2107
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:01,840
You were just missing that pickle.

2108
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:05,060
Well, you guys have a job to do.

2109
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,720
You still have more sectors to go.

2110
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,460
So I leave you to your adventure.

2111
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,060
Twenty eighteen sector keeper.

2112
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,800
Have you learned something from this?

2113
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:18,220
Will you make sure never to rush any of us through a sector ever again?

2114
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:21,200
Yes, we'll never rush through a sector ever again.

2115
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:24,340
And our adventures will continue forever.

2116
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:27,420
Well, we'll see.

2117
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:27,700
All right.

2118
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,400
Well, we'll put a pin in that.

2119
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:29,860
OK.

2120
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,280
See where we land.

2121
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,000
All right.

2122
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,760
I guess we should propel out of here back to our own time.

2123
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,960
Twenty eighteen, Scott, it was a pleasure.

2124
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,240
And I guess fuck you.

2125
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:40,700
I will fuck you then, too.

2126
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,900
Mike, you want to say goodbye to yourself?

2127
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,200
I want to say goodbye to you.

2128
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,080
Twenty eighteen, Mike.

2129
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:48,560
And I just want to say we're still we're going to do it.

2130
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,560
We're doing it still.

2131
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,120
OK.

2132
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,380
So don't worry about it.

2133
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,180
I can go eat a big package of candy tonight.

2134
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,660
Everything's fine.

2135
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:56,880
Jason.

2136
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,880
Well, there's actually maybe maybe we can leave Jason just for the night.

2137
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,660
Feels right.

2138
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,340
All right.

2139
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,500
It feels so right.

2140
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,860
I don't want to describe what he's doing.

2141
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,940
His little heart's coming over their heads.

2142
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:09,980
Twenty eighteen keeper.

2143
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:11,920
Stick around with these boys.

2144
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,520
They're going to take you places.

2145
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:18,760
He's scratched out whatever the last walk was, and he just put tongue in walk.

2146
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,360
Tonguing walk.

2147
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:21,720
All right.

2148
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,280
Well, hey, so long.

2149
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:24,360
Bye, boys.

2150
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:25,140
Yeah.

2151
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:25,600
Bye.

2152
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:26,420
Bye.

2153
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,720
Thanks for the waste of time.

2154
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:30,600
You handled this pretty well, all things considered.

2155
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:31,480
Yeah.

2156
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,440
Oh, my God.

2157
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,000
Wow.

2158
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:35,160
What a ride.

2159
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,100
Oh, jeez.

2160
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,600
We could barely get Jason out of there.

2161
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,120
Well, hey, you know, stuff happens when you have two freaks on the show.

2162
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,560
A freak like him needed company.

2163
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,820
Yeah, exactly.

2164
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,360
Well, I like to think that you can leave the door open.

2165
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,860
Maybe you keep a secret piece of whatever portal got us there.

2166
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:58,440
And then it's like Sully and Boo and Monsters Inc.

2167
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,920
Oh, that's really sweet.

2168
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,660
Like twenty twenty four, Jason.

2169
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:07,260
And you can you can still play or whatever it is you want to do.

2170
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,240
Play is actually the correct word.

2171
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:09,840
Yes.

2172
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,700
Oh, no.

2173
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,340
Just don't don't call it wet play.

2174
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,340
Oh, God.

2175
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:17,400
Well, you certainly don't want it to be dry play.

2176
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,820
Well, I want it to be as dusty as a pickle.

2177
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,640
OK, 18, Jason's really like he's wearing off.

2178
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:27,640
I like he's really rubbing off on Jason, rubbing, rubbing into him.

2179
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,240
Oh, no.

2180
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,500
Oh, there is some rubbing involved.

2181
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,360
Oh, boy.

2182
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,660
Sometimes I got to do it.

2183
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:38,420
OK, sector keeper, I am exhausted.

2184
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,640
Surely we must be somewhere.

2185
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,520
I know we keep saying infinite.

2186
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:46,620
Wasn't that solving the rift for the love of God?

2187
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,920
Yes, boys, you solve the rift.

2188
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:52,440
You closed the mini rift.

2189
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:56,860
No, there's still that wasn't the rift

2190
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:58,200
we've been talking about the whole time.

2191
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:00,720
There's still another final rift.

2192
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,460
We're on we're on quantum level, Scott.

2193
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:06,960
That was the smaller rift, but there's still the larger rift

2194
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:11,820
because boys, aren't you forgetting one very special sector

2195
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:14,660
with one very special friend?

2196
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,900
I'm talking, how do you get there?

2197
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,980
And when you get there, what do you do?

2198
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:23,000
You park your car.

2199
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:26,600
Boys, boys, the last sector parking

2200
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,180
with our friend Nick Weiger.

2201
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:30,900
Yay.
