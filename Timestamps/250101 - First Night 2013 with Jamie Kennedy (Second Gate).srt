1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Dude, are we on? Dude, what the fuck? You're dropping shit? What's that? Are we on or not?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Come on, what's this fucking shit, man?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Dude, Mike, what the fuck? I don't know, cause I'm here like, am I fucking talking to Jason or am I talking to Stu?

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What the fuck's going on?

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We're on, we're on.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Which microphone?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
All the microphones are on.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Any? Any of them?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Dude, tell me, point to the one I'm supposed to be fucking using.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The one in front of you.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, okay, hey, all right, wait, we are here, it's January 1st, 2025, let's, fuck, oh, sorry, let's go, baby.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There's a little taste of, stylistically, I think we inhabited the genre very nicely there.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
For this first episode of, hey, it's first night, second gate.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And if some people are hearing, if they have nothing else to do, if they don't have a New Year's party to go to, which would be me, what with a new baby, I won't be anywhere.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You weren't last night at Universal Studios Hollywood's New Year's celebration, Eve?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, we're recording this in the future, but I would put a lot of money at the Commerce Casino on me missing Eve.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't think I'm going to make it up to Eve.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Are you going to try to hit Eve?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You got an older kid, you could slip out to Eve.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I thought about, I think I even texted Evan Susser, I said, should we go to Eve this year?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The New Year's Eve celebration.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ooh, a double daddy bash.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I thought though, I guess my pass isn't the best pass at Universal Studios, so it's not, it's blocked out on New Year's Eve.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And I was like, am I going to spend $200 to experience Eve?

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And is Eve in the park or is Eve in City Walk?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In the park.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay. And what is Eve? Now Eve is in the past.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sorry, Eve is happening.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Do you think maybe somebody's listening to this at Eve though?

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Maybe they're at Eve, but on the way out they got us in the AirPods.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't know.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's possible, yeah.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What possibly have you and Susser already, first of all, if you're there, look for them, but then...

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I think that Eve is just that they set up a couple DJ booths at Universal Hollywood.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And then they do a countdown. I think that's it.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And how likely is it that they play the things that we always joke about them play? Do we think it's still Daddy Yankee?

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Gasolina.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh yeah, it's Gasolina.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
At this point I would hope it's Gasolina. I would go nuts for Gasolina.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They're kind of the theme songs. It's those in Hooray for Hollywood are the music of that and Happy.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I would hope they had the espresso radio at it.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Not the Baudier one, the radio at it.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why that song?

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Huh?

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why that song specifically?

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's a little current, Jason.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you think it's too current?

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
For Universal Studios? Yeah, I don't know. I think they're going to find out about espresso in about 11 years.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, okay.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's about Universal's pace.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Was that on your Spotify rap?

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, it was number one.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I think it was.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Was it number one?

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't use it a lot. I don't use Spotify a lot.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, Apple Music more?

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No, I don't have Apple Music.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I feel like my local music collection and YouTube, I feel like I just look up songs.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's still local music? You still have files?

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, I still have files. They're kind of spread out.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's kind of a rarity.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How do you listen to them then on the phone?

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Because my Apple Music will say you can search for just like the Apple Music catalog or you can go to your own files.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Are you using that on your phone if you're listening to your local file, your actual files?

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
On your computer?

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I downloaded albums, like purchased albums or files if I'm just playing it off my laptop.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Say you're trying to listen to a new pornographer's song right now on your phone.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What would you use to listen to it?

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I have the albums all local on my phone.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Program is what I'm saying.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is what we would have done in the old days when Scott wasn't here a month ago.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The Apple Music app.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think I'm not here now.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It is Apple Music app.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Who was Apple Music?

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
iTunes. What you used to call iTunes. I don't know. I still call it iMessage when referring to texting.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Here's how I think it's going to go is that I did that Club 3 where I responded to everything and then that's going to swing it all the way back to the next month becomes like Mike and Jason discuss the file structures of where all of their personal assets are on their desktops.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Do you use Apple Music?

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And you said, no, I don't have Apple Music.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And then we got to the point where you said, I am listening on Apple Music.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I thought you meant the subscriptions.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't have the subscription service.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The music app, I guess you say.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And how's your storage doing?

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
How many?

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Storage is OK.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Storage is OK.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Specific stats on that.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't want to take a lot of time, but like how many how many gigabytes could fit on your phone and how much currently is available?

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I got a problem. I got storage problem.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Me too. That's kind of why I'm wondering.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, I'm I'm I'm careful with that nowadays.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm paying for Google Storage and Apple Storage.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't like it.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I avoided it for years.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But I just kind of have to because I I'm at texting.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's like 10 or 20 gigs.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I feel like like the messages themselves.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The messages themselves.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, the messages.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Sure.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Between the messages themselves, years of messages and then photos and videos in there.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah. Well, and I assume that you guys are both sending each other like daily updates on how much movie theater candy you're buying from CBS.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Like every day there's three photos.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, 4K video of it.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Like very good.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Unboxing multiple gigabytes of the Twizzler boxes and the snow caps.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah. Don't just send me a photo of the runs.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Send me the runs coming out of the box.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I want to see that pour out, baby.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Right. A selfie.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I take the selfie stick to the Burbank movie theater.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I buy a ticket that I don't use.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I go inside.

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I buy multiple boxes of candy, giant sodas.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And then I take 4K video.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, if you're in downtown Burbank, you got to go to the bulk candy store.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, that's true.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If you have a movie ticket before or after, you get a discount.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's a good tip.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was worried that we would get 15 full minutes into the new year without you guys discussing specific Burbank area stores.

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank God we're starting 2025 right.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You have emboldened.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I guess because of Scott Free Weeks, I think we've been emboldened in a lot of ways.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm experiencing a torrent already.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
For example, there really wasn't an intro to this second gate.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We just started going.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You know, we just started that cursing at the top.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We kind of went in the club three minutes.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's the kind of thing that never would have happened but two months ago.

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Imagine starting the episode with a bit.

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We're in a whole other universe now.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The possibilities have been unlocked.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We're through the matrix.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's right.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We look at the whole new show.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's the thing I did.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Wait, you're telling me we wouldn't have done the thing I started?

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Did you get the question?

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I actually didn't get the question.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You phrased it as confusingly as possible.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Jamie Kennedy knew your style a bit at the start of the episode, but then you said...

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes, no, I got that.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We wouldn't have done the thing that I did.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I got the Jamie Kennedy bit and then I thought you were going to switch over to an actual like,

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
hey, I'm so and so and so and so and so and so.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So I missed.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I missed that.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's the crazy electric energy of you guys talking about Burbank stores and being emboldened

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that led to me not saying our names, which are Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson, and Jason Sheridan.

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's true.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You're right that I didn't say the names.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm as confused as the PA handling the Walkies on a Jamie Kennedy.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's as confused as you can be.

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That seems to be the crux of a lot of what went wrong with this broadcast,

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
is they claim they had walkie issues.

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There was a lot of blame to go around.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There was in the aftermath of what we're talking about today, there was simultaneous blame

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and excuses of no, no, no, that was the plan.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's what we wanted it to be.

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But I guess before we can dissect what happened in the aftermath, we should talk about what this is,

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
which, by the way, I mean, we had just a brief text exchange that was like,

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
is there anything New Year's oriented to do and quickly realized that's kind of a finite area.

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This episode's out on January 1st.

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You want to do something?

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And then I realized, wait a minute, what better way to kick off 2025

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
than with a horrible way to kick off 2013, which was this special, which is a very online thing.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There was a cut down that was on YouTube and then Twitter.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, remember those days.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But this went around really quickly.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This was how January 1st, 2013 started.

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And by January 4th, host Jamie Kennedy was in the New York Times explaining himself

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and saying things like, I didn't stab anybody, OK?

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What do you want?

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Why are you mad at me?

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What did I do?

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I just tried to have some fun on TV.

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Anyway, what this is, is this crazy special that aired heading into 2013

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
on Los Angeles local television called First Nights 2013 with Jamie Kennedy.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This was a Los Angeles local TV disaster.

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It was on KDOC, which is just kind of regular ass TV.

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Sort of not so much around or it's like format shifted today.

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Specifically an Orange County based religious station.

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It is today religious. It wasn't religious at the time.

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
OK, because I was watching this and I was like, this aired on a religious station?

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So I think I missed the ownership changes.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's not that crazy, yes, because that would be really insane

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
is if they went to kind of like, you know, Ma and Pa churchgoer and said,

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
we want to create a wholesome piece of entertainment that the whole family can enjoy.

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Something to keep the kids up till midnight.

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I think we'll do some Bible verses if we have time,

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
but we have already booked Bone Thugs in Harmony

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and they do not intend on self censoring.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But no, it's not that crazy.

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But anyway, just just to get out the full broad strokes of what this is.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't think a lot of people were paying attention to this as it was airing.

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But like one person was and did a cut down that was online fairly quickly

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
because this was a live special that was fraught with technical errors

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and dead air and profanities and absolutely bombed jokes

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and off key music, very sloppy musical performances.

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
One techno crane really trying to hold down the fort,

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
trying to go back and forth in the six feet of range that it has,

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
like doing a lot of heavy lifting to prove that this thing has any production value.

211
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Because otherwise I would say this is a 90 minute broadcast in which not one element worked.

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I guess I agree.

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There's not like a pleasant, oh good, they nailed that in the whole thing, in the whole 90 minutes.

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No, it's down to like the frame rates are weird.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Like they throw to like little sketches and then those don't look right and they don't start right.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There's like black and glitching before they begin.

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And then you're into the meat of the sketch and like a racist costume is being worn.

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This is an absolute like content gutter situation,

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
which hey, well, let's start the year off right.

220
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It seems like the way to begin.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We're starting the year off with a curse and not the profanity you would find in this special.

222
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Literally like an Imhotep style curse.

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes, both curses are definitely part of this.

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Death is only the beginning of the year.

225
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And we're here with Shannon Elizabeth, who you kissing at midnight.

226
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And Shannon Elizabeth who tries to deflect to the many projects she has going on.

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
She a human being with interests and they're like, OK, cool, but let's talk about your boobies though.

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Shannon Elizabeth who shows up for about 30 seconds and does not make any return appearances in this special.

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I hope she was safe at home by midnight so she could not be accosted or slobbered on.

230
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah, I hope she was safe and guarded away from the premises.

231
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Fingers crossed.

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Bridget too from the girls next door as well.

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm worried about all their safety.

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I didn't look up if everyone involved in this is still alive.

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, Bridget is.

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I hope they survive the night.

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Bridget is.

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
She's doing a podcast with Holly from Girls Next Door.

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes, a theme park enthusiast.

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Holly is a big theme park enthusiast.

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Would she do this if she's got a podcast to promote?

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't know, it's a good question.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Would she do it?

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Probably.

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Somebody told her.

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Would it help if we told her that at this point every single episode has like 25 minutes of weird creepy sex talk?

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Increasingly unhinged.

248
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah, but if we frame it in the right way that it's more about, again, it's band kid energy.

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
God, not even the confidence of theater kids.

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, not at all.

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's different.

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, that metaphor doesn't work from the high school.

253
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I went to because all the band kids were like cool and hooking up with each other.

254
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The band kids were?

255
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The tuba player and the timpani's are all.

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I think the band kids were all smoking weed and playing a hacky sack and listening to Dave Matthews.

257
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Damn.

258
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That's one of the coolest kids I've ever heard.

259
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't know that anyone in our high school band was smoking weed.

260
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Maybe they were, although I was just maybe a little bit oblivious.

261
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You were not invited to join to that.

262
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Should we ask Mike?

263
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Well, look at him.

264
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He's busy with his practicing his solo, his trumpet solo.

265
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I am assuming they were because I don't know how anyone was listening to that much DMV and playing hacky sack sober.

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't know a lot of kids.

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
High school was high school though, you know?

268
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, that's true.

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, we grew up in a time of sober DMV.

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There's a lot of sober DMV in high school.

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I like a little DMV.

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Don't get me wrong.

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What's your number one DMV?

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What's your number one song?

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Ants Marching?

276
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Huh?

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Ants Marching?

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Probably.

279
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's probably something from the Crabbit Streets album.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm suspicious of that answer.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That answer was probably.

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That makes me feel like he can't name a song.

283
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I think that's right.

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Wait, let's try.

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let's try.

286
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I was going to let it go, but Scott's here and he wants to know.

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I can't name anything except I remember one of the songs was the single of the soundtrack for Mr. Deeds.

288
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, what was this?

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Was it Crash on Mr. Deeds?

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What was the single?

291
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think it was Crash.

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It was not Crash.

294
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It was much later.

295
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I like Crash.

296
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I was going to say Crash is like the big hit.

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's funny how Jason keeps sparking to the songs when other people say the title.

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I was not a big DMV.

299
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What about the song What Would You Say?

300
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's got a John Popper harmonica solo on it.

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Pro.

302
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Blues Traveler?

303
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Were you a Blues Traveler kid?

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can't name any of it.

305
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The singles?

306
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Probably.

307
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They're probably on the radio.

308
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's a strange answer.

309
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I was probably a Blues Traveler kid.

310
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Probably.

311
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You have to be cool here.

312
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you played the singles, I'd probably go like, oh yeah, that was on the radio.

313
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Stop everything.

314
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We don't have to be cool here.

315
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You don't have to pretend to be a Blues Traveler kid.

316
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You don't have to.

317
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That would make him cool.

318
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
In my eyes, of course.

319
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No, I only know the single Blues Traveler singles.

320
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Who was the one who went a little nuts and used to tweet Benghazi is not going away?

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Was it John Popper?

322
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It might have been John Popper.

323
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I think John Popper might have gone a little crazy.

324
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It might have been Macy Gray, honestly.

325
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It could have been Macy Gray.

326
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Macy Gray had some strange opinions.

327
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Let's get to this particular area of shadiness.

328
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's a Jamie Kennedy hosted special.

329
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Jamie Kennedy was a person who I never had a ton of opinions on.

330
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Jamie Kennedy was just kind of in stuff.

331
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He was good in good stuff.

332
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The Scream movies, good.

333
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Romeo and Juliet, both finger.

334
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
This was a strong career in which he had the goods.

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I thought it was pretty great.

336
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I never really thought much about him until then he starts doing his own vehicles.

337
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He becomes a star and what does he choose to star in?

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What chooses him to star in?

339
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Things start getting a little dicey.

340
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's hard for me to not play a brief moment of this clip.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This is a real, this is a bug main classic.

342
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is something he would torture people with a lot when I met him.

343
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's the kind of thing people, I don't think a lot of people have actually watched Son of the Mask.

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Has anyone ever sat down?

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I have not tried, no.

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I was wondering, is this going to be from Malibu's most wanted or Son of the Mask?

347
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's Son of the Mask.

348
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Just before this plays, and this is not all his fault.

349
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He was a hired gun to appear in this film.

350
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
However, just remember the star making moment of Jim Carrey at the nightclub

351
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and how he made it look so easy.

352
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He's this living cartoon and just the pure charisma of that musical performance.

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And all the shapeshifting and the CGI.

354
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You've never seen anything like this in 1994.

355
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And then cut to the big music performance when Jamie is wearing the mask.

356
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Listener, you'll be missing a lot of the visuals here.

357
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He's at a nightclub watching some boring guy perform Can't Take My Eyes Off of You.

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And then he does it a little bit more masky.

359
00:18:33,000 --> 00:19:02,000
This informed a lot of bug mains.

360
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
One of the primary influences, yes.

361
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I want to say 2002.

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm not totally sure.

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Does Bug like Son of the Mask?

364
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't think so.

365
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
2005.

366
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Jesus.

367
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Wow.

368
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But he does like the second Dumb and Dumber, I recall.

369
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Does he?

370
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Not the teenage one.

371
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't think the teenage one.

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I think the Dumb and Dumber two or whatever.

373
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's interesting.

374
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think that's what he said a couple years ago.

375
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No, I think Son of the Mask is more of a like you must bear witness to this.

376
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Don't just keep your life moving without putting your eyes on this.

377
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You must know that many millions of dollars were spent to get to this.

378
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Ten years later, ten years post-mask, they decided to direct it.

379
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Was it in the theater?

380
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That was in the theater.

381
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
God.

382
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah.

383
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't really blame Jamie Kennedy for this, but I certainly noticed that as things start

384
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
to become Jamie Kennedy-driven projects that things are sort of weird.

385
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And then not long after that, this is a story I've definitely told on the podcast before,

386
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
but I had this opportunity.

387
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What an opportunity.

388
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I had a meeting with somebody who worked for Jamie Kennedy.

389
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And this is in like early YouTube days for me.

390
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So anyone wanting to talk to me at all, like that's crazy.

391
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Whoa.

392
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What could this turn into?

393
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Jamie Kennedy.

394
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I guess I'm fine with Jamie Kennedy.

395
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And then I go to like, it was like a meeting at night and it was just all very shady.

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The place was shady and the guy was shady.

397
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And then like, he's like, oh, hey, you got to meet Jamie.

398
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Dude, you got to meet Jamie.

399
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And then I'm brought back into this room.

400
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This like very like, okay, you probably all in preparation for this, you may have seen

401
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
like a bunch of like art of Jamie Kennedy projects.

402
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Just like the graphic design of like Malibu's most wanted type stuff.

403
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So I walk into this room where every bare inch is covered in Jamie Kennedy giant posters,

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
just like the worst fonts and him just mugging.

405
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And then he's in there and he stands up like, hey, dude, Jamie, this guy, Scott, he's coming up.

406
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
He's good.

407
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And then he gives me the worst handshake I've ever received.

408
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And I am not one of these people who, I'm not like our parents' generation.

409
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't judge people on their handshakes, but I do when it's this weird.

410
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It felt like three sardines just kind of slapping me.

411
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Like it was so, it was weird, wet, not committed to.

412
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
He's not looking me in the eye.

413
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
He seems fucked up.

414
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Just like, oh, what's going on?

415
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Weird laugh like that.

416
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Just like the sketchiest.

417
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And ever since that moment, I've just been like, huh, Jamie Kennedy.

418
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
There's something off about Jamie Kennedy.

419
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And that was about 2010.

420
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So this is like, this is when I've got him kind of in my mental sites.

421
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Like, okay, if you ever see him in anything, like pay attention because this might be strange.

422
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And that's not long after that encounter that this occurs.

423
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Like, oh, here it is, the full manifestation of the Jamie Kennedy shadiness.

424
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't know what it is.

425
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't want to go start making like accusations about what his deal is, but it's definitely I would put it in the Pauly Shore camp.

426
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm just about to say that.

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't want to start, I don't want to say specifics.

428
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I wouldn't even know what makes you like that, but just kind of like weird, floaty, like, oh, yeah, dude.

429
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Just messy.

430
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Permanently like that.

431
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yes.

432
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah.

433
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah.

434
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Have you checked in on his straight to camera broadcast?

435
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Like his YouTube channel?

436
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah.

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
On his social media.

438
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You know, I have weirdly because he did a reaction video to this.

439
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I actually found his analysis of what happened to some of the mask kind of interesting.

440
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But I do you got something in the pocket?

441
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Do you experienced anything good from Jamie recently?

442
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well, there's one video I just saw.

443
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's a tweet and it just says Black Swan event incoming in three, two, one.

444
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And then there was a video of him talking about it.

445
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What year?

446
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
When was this posted?

447
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh, in the last month or so.

448
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Black Swan?

449
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
About the movie Black Swan?

450
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
No, no.

451
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
A Black Swan event is like a big like the Trump assassination.

452
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's like a big.

453
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Well, like COVID would be a black swan.

454
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The markets all tank.

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It goes back to a very ancient history, I feel like, where they thought like, oh, God,

456
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
if you saw a swan, but it was black.

457
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And then eventually explorers discovered like, oh, there are black swans.

458
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Oh, it's not occur.

459
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's not a weird like Kraken creature that you have to be afraid of.

460
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But then he posted another video where he's like, if your vote is still voting for the left,

461
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
you're either brainwashed, getting paid or a deviant.

462
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And if you encounter, A is a good thing to remember going 2025.

463
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You encounter anyone in your life or in social media who's talking about a deviance

464
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
or degenerates like immediately be skeptical of anything they're saying.

465
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Because it's like the it's like some right wing madness.

466
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Like it's the groomers and pedophiles right wing kook.

467
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I didn't know these phrases were big phrases right now.

468
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What if someone I know is talking about degenerates?

469
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Ellen, is that OK?

470
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Hey, and what if I am English woman?

471
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Did I use any of those words when discussing Spencer's gifts a few weeks ago?

472
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Well, let me check my transcript.

473
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Well, they are.

474
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And they're deviance and degenerates and they're getting away with it.

475
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Because I don't know, maybe I said that.

476
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't know what I maybe I'm slipping.

477
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I don't know.

478
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Can I say one more?

479
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I left so much on the cutting room floor of the Scott Responds episode in that same episode

480
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
where there's a lot of like naughty things that Jason's naughty products he's describing.

481
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And then Mike is responding.

482
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The most pure Mike response that there ever could have been was Jason mentioned a sweater

483
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
that has a little beer koozie in it, like a little like spot where that is clearly made

484
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
for putting a little holster for like clearly beer cans or beer bottles.

485
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah.

486
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And Mike is trying to wrap his head around it.

487
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And then your response uncommented on by Jason is, oh, well, you could put figures in there.

488
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Nothing could be more.

489
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
That is perfect writing for the Mike character that you see something shaped for beer cans

490
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and you think, oh, Donatello.

491
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I didn't respond because I was like, oh, yeah, that's something Mike would say.

492
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yes.

493
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So yeah, true.

494
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Almost in a way, not remarkable.

495
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But in a way, the most remarkable pearl of that's all of that's Mike right there.

496
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't remember.

497
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I don't remember that part.

498
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's why I got to be here.

499
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I got to underline things.

500
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
We don't like things.

501
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Well, there's a brewing country.

502
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I shouldn't even say this because because it's going to derail it.

503
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But there's a brewing.

504
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
There's an episode where I recently I insisted that Jason said that he he was going to have a warm or wet walnut.

505
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And I write and on the episode, which is a Spirit Halloween episode, I do make mention of a warm walnut,

506
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
but it seemingly comes out of nowhere.

507
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And I feel that I had invented some sort of concept in my head that I was about to present.

508
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And then we got the rail talking about the barrel of nuts.

509
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And then later I said something about Jason having a warm walnut on the spirit episode.

510
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And then that is now implanted itself as a memory of Jason saying he wanted to eat a warm walnut.

511
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But Jason never came up in the first one where I was right.

512
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But I don't think Jason ever said.

513
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Wow.

514
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
In your defense, like I think it was just kind of common phrase it because it's like talking about a walnut barrel,

515
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
talking about wet walnuts, but at old fashioned ice cream parlors.

516
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Well, you have said wet walnut before.

517
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah.

518
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That is for sure happened before you have said wet walnuts.

519
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
My grandfather and my mom just like, oh, if you go to the ice, you know, we're getting ice cream to go.

520
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's like I would like sprinkles or hot fudge.

521
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They liked wet walnuts on it, which is just walnuts and syrup.

522
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
There's a whole I'm sorry, Mike.

523
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
There's an entire Wikipedia of wet walnuts.

524
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Jason's right on this one.

525
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
No, I agree.

526
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Walnuts is an area.

527
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I've heard him say what walnuts warm.

528
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Warm walnut seems to be a style of finishing of wood.

529
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So warm walnut is almost like it is a phrase, but it's more it's not a food phrase.

530
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
What walnut does seem to be a beautiful, great judge.

531
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Very.

532
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Jason.

533
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I believe that's fair.

534
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But what I believe happened, though, is that there was a series of things that happened on the Spirit Halloween episode that derailed me.

535
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Christmas.

536
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Spirit Halloween.

537
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Spirit Christmas derailed me so thoroughly.

538
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I had some sort of joke concept floating in my head, ready to go.

539
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And then you hit me with three things that I wanted to explore.

540
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And then at the end of that, I said something about you enjoying a warm walnut.

541
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And it comes out of nowhere, seemingly.

542
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't know where there wasn't a warm walnut said earlier.

543
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Also, by the way, where is this controversy brewing?

544
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
In my own head as I edit the episode.

545
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
This isn't anything that anyone's commented on or noticed.

546
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
No, no one's probably said that thing about it.

547
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Mike in his mind palace just has a fire going with multiple chestnuts roasting on an open fire become warm walnuts.

548
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I did so much investigating yesterday of going back and trying to figure out where warm walnut came from.

549
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Because by the time you presented to me, it was presented as fact.

550
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Right. It was fact.

551
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I mean, I am the episode in a similar to Marshall Gate.

552
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
At the end of the discussion, I said, maybe I'm wrong about this.

553
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But I was trying to figure out where it came from.

554
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And I think it was floating in my head.

555
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And I said it in that episode.

556
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But you never said warm walnuts.

557
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Mike just turning over his memento polaroid saying, don't trust his lies.

558
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:56,000
This is the scariest thing about Mike ageing a bit, getting a little older, which is that he like finally there are lapses in his memory of everything Jason has ever said.

559
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Well, that's what I guess I can.

560
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I forgot. Look, I forgot that he used a little flashlight on the episode about the Disneyland app when he was a kid going on the dark rides.

561
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
A very cute and daring story.

562
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Right. And I forgot that.

563
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So I'm.

564
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You just said about yourself.

565
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah.

566
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
While he's right.

567
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Everyone.

568
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Because I've told it multiple times to people in real life think, well, like, oh, that's sweet.

569
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You know.

570
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So you're just flashing the memories of being on the receiver.

571
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You tell the story and then you getting these looks like Jason, Jason.

572
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You light up my life.

573
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You warm my life up like a warm walnut.

574
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Well, a hot and wet walnut.

575
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
We're just trying.

576
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
We're patting this episode with nice stuff because the actual thing.

577
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The thing is.

578
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So I think that probably is what's happening.

579
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Pleasant.

580
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Let's hear.

581
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
We'll get we'll get back to it.

582
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The OK.

583
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You're right.

584
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That there's maybe been a bit of a right wing turn.

585
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Jamie was also embroiled in this.

586
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
He was in this situation where like he found much like the New York Times was quickly grilling him about this special.

587
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
He was also several days after a different release saying what I can't be in a conservative funded film called Roe versus Wade.

588
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That's about the evils of that that decision.

589
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I like I can't be in some.

590
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I have to believe in what the movie.

591
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It doesn't necessarily mean that that's what I think.

592
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
No, it's like I'm just in it.

593
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's me and John Voight and Robert Davi and Joey Lawrence.

594
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And so and then like but I don't get down like those guys.

595
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm just playing a doctor.

596
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Actors do roles.

597
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
OK.

598
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So he's there's just a world of Jamie Kennedy shadiness.

599
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And what I've learned is that you can enter the world of Jamie Kennedy shadiness not just through very poor quality videos and copies of this on YouTube, but also in the way in the higher quality world of to be.

600
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You can watch this special on TV where it's it's labeled as Jamie Kennedy New Year's Eve just without real reference to how it went or what it is.

601
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:07,000
This seems to be part of like an overall content deal with Jamie Kennedy Productions, who I'm sorry to say I did not have the pleasure of working with.

602
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Despite a positive meeting, I did not go forward with any projects with J.K.P.

603
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Did you meet with Robert Davi at all for like a spin off?

604
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm still dreaming of it after his after his very memorable Funny or Die encounter where he hit on two directors girlfriends.

605
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Oh, my God.

606
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah.

607
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Well, he's never going to get music videos for his Sinatra record Sinatra covers that way.

608
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No, but here you can watch like if you look up Jamie Kennedy on to be and this is why I was saying like I can if you want to see a digital wall of ugly Jamie Kennedy covers, you can look this so you can see Kennedy's court.

609
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The unprecedented idea of a show where it's like two parties enter a courtroom to make it for a decision to be made and the judge Jamie Kennedy.

610
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I feel like for there's so many garbage things like that.

611
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Yeah, that's and that's like Teagan's court on late 2000s.

612
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Have I talked I don't want to do it, but this is funny.

613
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
All right. Have I talked about when I worked in like reality and clip show TV?

614
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
But I talked about the pilot they made.

615
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm not sure about called psychic court.

616
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Not sure.

617
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Go for it.

618
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We don't know.

619
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Okay.

620
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Doesn't sound okay.

621
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
All of a sudden there was a guy hanging around.

622
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Maybe it was the guy who created slam ball and he was helping produce a bunch of these other pilot ideas for this company.

623
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I worked worked at and all of a sudden there was a thing in the like folder when I was editing called psychic court.

624
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And I was like, oh my God, what is psychic court?

625
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm so excited.

626
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And and this other producer guy I know he was like, oh, yeah, that's something we're working on.

627
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
We're not sure.

628
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Blah, blah, blah.

629
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And I go, I think I know the door wasn't closed yet.

630
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And I go, you know, what would be funny to get as the judge of psychic court?

631
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Judge Larry from the Anna Nicole Smith trial.

632
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh, yeah.

633
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Larry was like a kind of he was crying when he was doing the like he was clearly making a play to get his own like judge show at that point.

634
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Fred Armisen played him in a very like, you know, barely exaggerated.

635
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yes.

636
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Impression.

637
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And I was going on and on and I was telling him I told the producer like, you know, Judge, here's why it would be funny.

638
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Get Judge Larry because it would be a trashy, funny, bad show, whatever.

639
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
He closes the door and he goes, we've got him.

640
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That's who we hired.

641
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
We hired Judge Larry for it.

642
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And I go, what?

643
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So you're saying that you, Mike, were the psychic.

644
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yes, that is absolutely.

645
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Because why would it?

646
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That was crazy.

647
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It was one of the craziest things because why would it be Judge Larry?

648
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Other than he was in the news.

649
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
He wasn't a psychic judge or anything.

650
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Wait, where's the psychic element?

651
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
There was a panel of psychics in the court.

652
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
What Judge Larry would then go to to advise him while he was making his psychic.

653
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Psychic court really strongly implies that the judge is a psychic.

654
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But no, the judge consults multiple.

655
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yes, the judge consults multiple psychics.

656
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
They shot it.

657
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
They shot it.

658
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
There was a pilot.

659
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
There's a pilot somewhere.

660
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's not online, but it was.

661
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They did shoot it.

662
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It seemingly was.

663
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It was unwatchable.

664
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't think I watched even all of it, but.

665
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And obviously it never went anywhere.

666
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
This is 15 years ago, but.

667
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Wow.

668
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Judge Larry.

669
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But that's around the same time.

670
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I feel like of new judge shows.

671
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Was there legal bearing?

672
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
If somebody, not that it was a case this severe.

673
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I can't imagine it was.

674
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
All right.

675
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The defendant did kill, did kill a dog.

676
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Like that is the, and that is true.

677
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But the psychics get like, I'm getting an energy.

678
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
This doesn't seem right.

679
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I think we got to call mistrial.

680
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Or actually, no, we think you, the owner, killed the dog.

681
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You are sentenced to gavel gavel.

682
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The psychics have spoken goodbye.

683
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I mean, I don't know if they were like sentencing the guys behind Enron or like, I don't know how high level these crimes were.

684
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
No Supreme court level things.

685
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah, I don't know.

686
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Murder trial decided by Judge Larry.

687
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Roe v Wade was ultimately overturned by psychic court.

688
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The Supreme court ran it through psychic court.

689
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Murder trial determined by the Long Island medium.

690
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I don't think, I don't think that's what they were going for.

691
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm assuming it was small claims.

692
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I saw a clip from a couples court show and when it cut to the judges, there were two judges.

693
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, there's Hot Bench, which has a bunch of judges.

694
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, this was two and I didn't quite understand.

695
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Like, I'm like, are the judges also a couple?

696
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Did they kiss?

697
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
No, but I'm just like, oh, that's a good idea.

698
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Husband and wife or two partner, a partner.

699
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah, a judge show where they kind of like you get you learn about their relationship, but then they also sentence people.

700
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
They like go behind the wall of the courtroom and over there, there is a judge relationship counselor.

701
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Everyone's in robes for this.

702
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So most of the show is a husband and wife judge team proceeding over a trial.

703
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But then in the middle, they go work out their personal differences with a judge who's also a counselor.

704
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Right. This could be called Hot Bench too, depending, depending what the relationship like.

705
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Bench of love.

706
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Bench of love.

707
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
This is really the game.

708
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Love judges.

709
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
This is what Jamie Kennedy has figured out is the real money is in putting together bizarre shows that are sold to God knows where.

710
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Right.

711
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
That somehow make more money than this podcast, mainly because the money is pocketed by three people only.

712
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Even though unlike this podcast, which only has three people, these shows employ 200 and most of them lose money.

713
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Except for the three.

714
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Except for the two judges and judge counselor.

715
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So 2B has like the best collection of classic film outside the criterion channel.

716
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So it's total trash.

717
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And then it's like, oh, all of Fritz Lang's movies when he came to America, he made.

718
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That's why it's perfect.

719
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It like represents American culture more.

720
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It does.

721
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
More than anywhere. Yes.

722
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yes. It's the trash and the highest eyebrow.

723
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Anyway, there's a lot of Jamie Kennedy on there, including this.

724
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But I was like, even it's hard to know which version of this to watch, really, because there was there's a cleaned up version on 2B and then I watched a full hour and a half on YouTube.

725
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But even that was missing some of the more profane things that this initial cut down did.

726
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So if you aren't terribly interested in this, like in the whole thing, but you want to get a sense of it, what I would say still is look up the video.

727
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
KDOC's New Year's Eve show of fail.

728
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Jamie Kennedy is our bizarre title from, as you noted, Jason.

729
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I don't think this is who edited it, but it's from a channel called Yip Investing.

730
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I think this is a pot like this popped up on somebody else's channel because the rest of the videos are like this is like prognose twenty twenty three investments and then something about Nazis.

731
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I don't know. We're in a we're in a weird German German.

732
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You'll come in, it says, yes, it's named Yip Investing, but it's unclear.

733
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Nothing seems like investing like he certainly is not.

734
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
At least all it does is teach you not to invest in cheap New Year's Eve broadcast.

735
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So there's two German videos of questionable content and then the Jamie Kennedy, which I strongly believe was not.

736
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I believe Yip Investing is not the editor of this because the video is very funny and I could see why this it's it's spread.

737
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I think Patton Oswalt, like, you know, popularized it in the in the days following the thing.

738
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So I still feel like the best way to experience this is the cut down of like how this thing went.

739
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And I'm going to play clips from that because again, I think basically KDOC airs this as we said today.

740
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It's a religious channel at the time. I believe it was mainly known as L.A.'s home of Perry Mason.

741
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Very straight lace channel does not want a lot of funny business.

742
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's Channel 56 in L.A. and somehow they got talked to.

743
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
They must have gotten stars in their eyes. Jamie Kennedy, he's in movies, right?

744
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yes. Yes, he is. Not was is.

745
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You can get movie stars on your channel. He's promising Shannon Elizabeth.

746
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Oh, I think I've heard of that. He's promising Mina Suvari, who spoiler is someone he asked to be in it, who then was there.

747
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But the production was so confusing and she got tired of banging around.

748
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So she left. So he bailed rightfully.

749
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So anyway, they also aired the Sacramento My My Network TV affiliate KQCA.

750
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:01,000
OK, if you recall, if you read the if you remember, My Network TV was the networks when UPN and the WB merged.

751
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So the CW would end up on one channel, but then that other channel needed something.

752
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So My Network TV was a lot of syndication stuff. OK.

753
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And then eventually went away. The Wikipedia for My Network TV is so confusing because it's like and now they're just like a content production company.

754
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And it's like it's unclear what any of anything means.

755
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's unclear how anyone makes money and syndicated television nowadays.

756
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yeah, yeah. I don't know. See, it seems like a weird mess appropriately for what we're talking about.

757
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Well, let me let me start setting the scene of how.

758
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So somehow I think with like six weeks of like six weeks from soup to nuts, this thing came together.

759
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Some producer, I don't know, like I don't know.

760
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't know. It does. I guess the details of it don't matter.

761
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But we end up at Jamie Kennedy hosting and producing this thing because he went and found all the sponsors.

762
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Apparently, that's what his own money was put into this.

763
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I think that's important to note.

764
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But what it leads to is I will literally set the stage like the literal stage.

765
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So we are on Hollywood Boulevard, L.A.'s Times Square, where it all happens.

766
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
We're in the courtyard of the Chinese theater, a place where there's nary a weekend where you don't find Jason and Mike and I.

767
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That's always where we're hanging out, putting our hands in the concrete, sampling L.A.'s local wares,

768
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
enjoying the finest Hollywood has to offer.

769
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Certainly not a place that we avoid like the plague end up at once every 11 years stops.

770
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It's like such hell over there, truly.

771
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And they have set up a stage and the stage has room for, I would say, comfortably eight people.

772
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And at many points of this broadcast, it is asked to hold 35 people.

773
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And then there is a screen behind them.

774
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And what's on the screen?

775
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Well, usually pictures of the Chinese theater, which again we are at already.

776
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And then above that, the Carl's Jr. star.

777
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Somehow they convinced Carl's Jr. to give money to this and to lend the star to this.

778
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And there's something, again, I don't like hold the Chinese theater in such high esteem, but hey, it's in the parks, right?

779
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That's the landmark of Hollywood studios.

780
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So it is kind of disgusting to see the Carl's Jr. star in front of it.

781
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I don't know why, maybe not to you guys.

782
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It made me a little nauseous.

783
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And then at midnight, like instead of, because there's no ball that drops at midnight.

784
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Three, two, one.

785
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And it zooms into the Carl's Jr. star.

786
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Yeah, spoiler alert.

787
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I want to talk about that because I was like, well, surely the star will drop if it's up there in the center.

788
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It doesn't.

789
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Like I like rewind it and I look and there's just two poles holding it up.

790
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And I'm like, the star is not moving.

791
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
They just zoomed in on it.

792
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Imagine the kind of mechanical wizard they would have to contract and make work on a holiday in order to make the star drop for 10 seconds.

793
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
They couldn't even, again, we can jump around.

794
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's a confusing mishmash anyway.

795
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
They couldn't afford a clock, let alone they get the countdown wrong.

796
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
When it hits midnight, midnight has already occurred and they are 10 seconds off.

797
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And I think they say on Mike, like the clock guy left.

798
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
We couldn't hire the clock guy.

799
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
He wouldn't fix it.

800
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:36,000
The excuses on this, like the excuses of Jamie Kennedy afterwards going like, well, it's actually supposed to be an anti New Year's Eve thing.

801
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And I'm like, that.

802
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
No.

803
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Wrong, wrong.

804
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And between that and then I have to say probably the worst film sketches I've ever seen.

805
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Yes.

806
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Probably.

807
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It's got to be.

808
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
They're basically commercials for Commerce Casino, but they're not even solid commercial.

809
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
They fail in both aspects.

810
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Well, they're referred to as short films.

811
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
At some point, the co-host of this, Stu Stone, who was from a rap thing with Jamie Kennedy called Blowing Up.

812
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So he's in the.

813
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That's not who I met.

814
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I met someone else in the Jamie fold, but Stu Stone pops around.

815
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
He's at the Commerce.

816
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
That's so that's the sponsors of this.

817
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Carl's Jr.

818
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Pretty good.

819
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Commerce Casino, which if you don't know it, that's on the way to Disneyland.

820
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:32,000
That's probably where we experience it the most is that like that middle zone between where we live and Disneyland where you're on the five and you're like, oh, God, traffic's not good today.

821
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Yeah.

822
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Damn it.

823
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
You're like losing morale a little bit.

824
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And then you see this casino and you wonder what's going on over there.

825
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Is that they having fun over there?

826
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Nope.

827
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's one of those like scary, serious, joyless casinos.

828
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah.

829
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Pure bedding.

830
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That ain't the fun.

831
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You've been you've been in.

832
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I haven't been in.

833
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I've been in the bicycle casino, which is also and it's a different way down to Orange County.

834
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
But I went in there.

835
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I think I've talked about this before that I went in and just like nothing but glares as soon as I walked in the door.

836
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It felt like the birds when the birds have overtaken.

837
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
You are not wanted here.

838
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Have you been in the commerce casino?

839
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I have never.

840
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
We got out of there quickly.

841
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I remember you saying that many years ago.

842
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And it's LA County.

843
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I think it's just it's just table games and a sports book.

844
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I believe.

845
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yes.

846
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Right.

847
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Yes.

848
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And it looks temporary.

849
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
All the tables were set up temporarily in this like lobby of a hotel.

850
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And there's nothing fun and casino about it.

851
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
If you like, you know, lights color like obviously they're not doing slot machines or anything, but still we were like, oh, this is weird.

852
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's like a place like Artie Lang would go.

853
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yes.

854
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
For sure.

855
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Artie would have.

856
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The hotel is the is a is a crown.

857
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Royal.

858
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
What's the name?

859
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I don't know.

860
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And it's huge.

861
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I stayed at them before I stayed.

862
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And some are pretty nice.

863
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
North Carolina and stayed at one of Philadelphia.

864
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Did you see that the fuck hotel you were talking about is open still?

865
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
What's that?

866
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
People post that fuck hotel you talked about with the big wine with the big martini glass.

867
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Oh, was it saved?

868
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I don't know if it was saved.

869
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Somebody just posted, I think, on our Patreon that it's open still.

870
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You said it closed, but it's open, I guess.

871
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I maybe it's set to close or maybe the owners change.

872
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I don't know.

873
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Can you go home during holiday?

874
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah.

875
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
How close are you to it?

876
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
The Poconos are probably like four hours away, three or four hours away.

877
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That's not so bad.

878
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That's not so bad.

879
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah.

880
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Get over there.

881
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Prone bone in the Poconos.

882
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I would like to see my family.

883
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah, you will.

884
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You're going to be there for a half day or so.

885
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You'll be going to the big sex hotel.

886
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Go to the sex hotel.

887
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
We'll do an episode on it.

888
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Come on.

889
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
He's going to discover the exact perfect shape and type of reclining that you can do.

890
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
What his body has been needing for a long time is just one long sit in a champagne glass.

891
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It's perfectly contoured.

892
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That's perfect, yeah.

893
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It never surprises me, but my body is doing great now.

894
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
One medical professional referred to neurological condition.

895
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It's like you're in a car and you're getting to your destination,

896
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
but there's an insane wild passenger in the passenger seat that you have to calm sometimes.

897
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So no doctor is prescribed buying a giant wine glass for the house.

898
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Champagne flute on top.

899
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Sorry, sorry.

900
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yeah, because that's too severe.

901
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That's like the wildest.

902
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Yeah, you're right.

903
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Champagne flute has a more gradual angle.

904
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I don't want you to inception any more false memories of my antics.

905
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
In myself.

906
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Yeah.

907
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It's up to us to do.

908
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
We need to buy him a Pocono style champagne.

909
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,000
What he needs in his house is a big animatronic tree from China and a giant champagne flute.

910
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I didn't check in.

911
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I don't know that there's any holiday sales on the industrial.

912
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Trees.

913
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
The animatronic tree.

914
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah, Black Friday for, wow.

915
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Now it's only $32,000.

916
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I watched the whole recent Jamie Kennedy, not rebuttal, explanation of this special,

917
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
and he refers to the location of the casino as downtown commerce.

918
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Beautiful downtown commerce.

919
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Beautiful downtown commerce.

920
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I can't argue with that.

921
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I don't really know what downtown commerce, but why wouldn't it be this?

922
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Sort of an unremarkable area in my memory.

923
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
No, a bit.

924
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So anyways, they're on board and there's a bunch of sketches.

925
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
They're referred to as short films.

926
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
We've got a lot of action happening here at the Commerce Casino, but Jamie Kennedy just

927
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
shot three short films for them.

928
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So we're going to be checking in on those throughout the night.

929
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And then yes, throughout the broadcast, you're treated to the worst sketches ever made, all

930
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
the way from incompetent to offensive, because one where he's a Mayan, because the Mayans

931
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
predicted things.

932
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah, because the 2012 prophecy had not come true.

933
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And I believe also was debunked even then of like, well, that was just when the Mayans

934
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
switched to a different calendar system.

935
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
It was their Y2K.

936
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It was just a switchover situation.

937
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But they're all wearing headdresses.

938
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It's a lot of white people wearing war paint and headdresses.

939
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Yeah, and they don't look, why does Mayan culture force them to have to do that?

940
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I would say it doesn't.

941
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
They're at least aware, even though they still do it, because in the sketch, they say, one

942
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
of them has a prediction, Jamie Kennedy never works again after this sketch.

943
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So at least they know.

944
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Somebody knew.

945
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yes, one punch up guy on the...

946
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But yes, you're in these barely lit, barely decorated conference rooms at Commerce Casino.

947
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And then there's a lot of at, like you're being made aware of poker tournaments and

948
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
stuff throughout.

949
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But let me go back to the top.

950
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Let's talk about his standup set at the beginning, because there's kind of not a lot of bombast.

951
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
You know, we love our specials, our Disney specials.

952
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,000
We're like, with Alan Thicke and with, who's the, God bless thee, Lee Greenwood.

953
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Oh, yeah.

954
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It's always Lee Greenwood.

955
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
We love our long lists of celebrities.

956
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Sandy Patty.

957
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Gospel singer, Sandy Patty.

958
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Sandy Patty.

959
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Well, there might be that for this.

960
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Actually, I think there is.

961
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But basically, it just kind of kicks into like a, just a confusing, chaotic scene where

962
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
everyone's talking and like Jamie Kennedy only barely has volume over them because he

963
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
has a microphone, but an often malfunctioning microphone.

964
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
As you said, Jason, at the very beginning, apparently, it was like three, two, the walkies

965
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
aren't working.

966
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Go.

967
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
So they, like the walkies went out as soon as the special began.

968
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So there's a general lack of awareness of what to do, where to look.

969
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,000
You get 10 minutes of opening standup monologue and the amount of times just in that 10 minutes

970
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
that they don't have a shot of what they need to show.

971
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It'll just cut to someone's back or someone's feet.

972
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It's just, I know, I understand that they were like, it'll be drunk.

973
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It'll be crazy.

974
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And you know, like everybody drinks, like, cause it should be, TV should be chaos.

975
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah, but this someone, maybe the director needs to be not drunk.

976
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Someone needs to, you need to, you need to be able to see the chaos to even register

977
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
that it is chaos.

978
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
There appears to be no director, no stage manager or production manager.

979
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And it's just like, if you don't know anything about walkie talkies, you probably know they

980
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
are an idiot proof technology.

981
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It's hard to fuck up.

982
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,000
You could be on the wrong channel, maybe, but it's like the armies use them for a reason.

983
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
The armies use them.

984
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I'm sure they still use something, I think.

985
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Well, I would hope they use something.

986
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
They do need something.

987
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
They do need something.

988
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
No, the armies are all on, they're all on Slack mainly.

989
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh, okay.

990
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It's like, all right.

991
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So go into the sub group, go into the hashtag attack group.

992
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Didn't they have like World War II, like walkie talkies and a television production in 2013.

993
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
That's true.

994
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
If walkie talkies can be the basis of an invasion, then why can they not work for first night

995
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
2013?

996
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But man, this monologue is like seven or eight minutes long.

997
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And it is so rough.

998
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I'm trying to remember if I have, I wait.

999
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yeah, I do.

1000
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Okay.

1001
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So I got to, it's jokes like, hey, but good news.

1002
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Snooki gave birth to a beautiful six pound bottle of spray tan.

1003
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm just joking around.

1004
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I'm just joking around.

1005
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It's things like, like, I don't know.

1006
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I can't go throwing shit.

1007
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'm not a stand up.

1008
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I do know that probably if you're doing stand up in kind of a chaotic environment, just

1009
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
tell the joke and see if it lands before you go like, what?

1010
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
What?

1011
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Why are you mad?

1012
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
He just like undercuts every single thing he says.

1013
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And I also know that stand up, you know, like a tweet, like a good little pearl observation.

1014
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
There's an economy of words that's an important thing, I think, especially to a monologue joke

1015
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
on television.

1016
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Pay attention to the very skillful economy of words here in this joke.

1017
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And very good voices going on, too.

1018
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,000
When Kim announced that she was pregnant, Yeezy, that's her husband, Kanye, wasn't much help.

1019
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
He interrupted her and he said, I quote, Kim, hold on a second.

1020
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I want to tell you, I'm really happy for our pregnancy, but I'm going to let you know right now,

1021
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:43,000
before I let you finish, Beyonce had one of the best hip hop pregnancies of the year.

1022
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That was funnier than that.

1023
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
That was funnier.

1024
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Funnier than what?

1025
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
That was funnier than that, than itself.

1026
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You guys that know you should have laughed more because it was funnier than itself.

1027
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
There was a, that was a quantum joke.

1028
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
You'll get it in a million years.

1029
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
So that he's just talking so much.

1030
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And, and I think his, his subjects very at the top go like Snooki, Honey Boo Boo, Lindsay

1031
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Lohan, Kim Kardashian.

1032
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It really seemed like he, he was about to say we're leaving women in 2012.

1033
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Like he's just planning on women until he gets to Gangnam style, which.

1034
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Well then you perked up.

1035
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Huh?

1036
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
You perked up.

1037
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Jason's number two on his Spotify.

1038
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I love, I like it.

1039
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I think it's funny to still reference it.

1040
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
But he says it in the most insane way I've ever, like.

1041
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
The biggest song of the year.

1042
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Gangnam style?

1043
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
What is it?

1044
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Gangnam?

1045
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Grannam?

1046
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Gunly?

1047
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
It's, it's gang, it's not that complicated.

1048
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Yeah.

1049
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
No.

1050
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,640
The thing is all the topics you just mentioned, there's no doubt that Jeannie at California

1051
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,000
Adventure in that year was using, was doing better jokes about all those topics.

1052
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, a hundred percent.

1053
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Tighter.

1054
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Jokes.

1055
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,240
The ramble of like, why was it, it didn't have to be hip hop pregnancy.

1056
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,240
Take that one now.

1057
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,240
Yeah, why is that in there now?

1058
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,240
Too many.

1059
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,860
I think, I think everybody's ahead of, people know that it's going to be a joke about interrupting

1060
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,800
before it even begins.

1061
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,240
So just like get to the, get to, I'm going to let you finish as fast as humanly possible.

1062
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,080
And how is, I'm going to let you finish not about sex.

1063
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,400
It should be about the impregnation, not that, that I have a lot of notes for this joke again.

1064
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,760
He's done a lot more standup than me, however I do, it doesn't mean I don't have an outsider

1065
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,760
perspective.

1066
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,040
I'm also, I would never, I don't know if I've ever heard the phrase hip hop pregnancy.

1067
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,680
Like, I don't, I think he's trying to say like a tabloid kind of thing.

1068
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,680
It's unclear.

1069
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,680
It's all unclear.

1070
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,800
Well no, what he's trying to do is, as if, as if in the, in the Taylor Swift interruption,

1071
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,840
if it had been, Beyonce had one of the best hip hop videos of all time, but he didn't

1072
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,840
say that.

1073
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,080
It wasn't hip, because it was a general, that was like a best female artist category.

1074
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,080
Yeah.

1075
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,760
He said a lot of words that aren't in what Kanye said.

1076
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,960
There's a number of problems just within that minute.

1077
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,520
A lot of the minutes of this have five problems.

1078
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,520
Yeah.

1079
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,040
And you add it all up and we are at a million problems.

1080
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,320
He's crazy, he could have just had a career, all those movies he made, it's like, oh he

1081
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,080
could have just been like the funny character actor.

1082
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,080
I think so.

1083
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,840
I feel like he was like on the precipice of doing that.

1084
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,000
Supporting actor, you know?

1085
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,360
But there's a thing like, there's like a youthful energy and Mr. Shore is a good example

1086
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,680
of like, when you're in your twenties and you got something there and you, some people

1087
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,000
put you in things and it's the right role, that works.

1088
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,760
But as soon as the aging starts and they're like, I'm going to take some more control

1089
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,760
over my, like.

1090
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,760
But your persona is still like, Stone 17 year old.

1091
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,760
Yeah.

1092
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,200
But you're like, but the, just like the lot, and the, and also if you have like aged worse

1093
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,160
than normal people due to how you live.

1094
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,160
You're right.

1095
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,800
So if you look, if you look 70 by way of 17.

1096
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,800
Yeah.

1097
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:11,160
But like Matthew Lillard, I think as he aged, changed, you know, what he was doing, his

1098
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,160
persona.

1099
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,160
Or your favorite, DJ Qualls.

1100
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,160
DJ Qualls.

1101
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,400
I was later, I was laying awake at night like, wow, where did it, Jason's worship of DJ Qualls.

1102
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,400
I don't remember that at all.

1103
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,400
I just.

1104
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Very interesting.

1105
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,600
I just liked when he would pop up and things, but I really like Matthew Lillard as a performer.

1106
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:33,000
There's a very funny, when I worked in post production, do you remember there was a short

1107
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,960
live CIA show where Katherine Heigl was a CIA agent.

1108
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,400
This lasted one season or like half a season.

1109
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:49,360
And in one episode, like the head of the CIA get, has to resign and they have a temporary

1110
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,120
head and it's Matthew Lillard.

1111
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,920
And he just comes in and he's being such like an intense oddball.

1112
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:02,400
It's like immediately, I was like, oh, this is, I had put a couple episodes on the background

1113
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,400
as I was working.

1114
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:08,000
I was like, oh, the show immediately got better when Matthew Lillard showed up.

1115
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,400
Like he's Shaggy from now on and yeah, no, he's, yeah, you're right.

1116
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,640
That's the path, I think, is to ride out the teeth.

1117
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,720
Like you have to age your type up.

1118
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,720
Yeah.

1119
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,720
Yes.

1120
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,720
Yeah.

1121
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:27,040
But so also this, also this, you're right, is another setup I like.

1122
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,120
How many guys here like your new technology products?

1123
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:36,400
Yeah, that is really, this whole thing, this whole thing couldn't, like it does border

1124
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,520
on purposeful, how bad everything is.

1125
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,520
Yeah.

1126
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,440
Like to the point where, yeah, you start, I start to question like, oh, is this, all

1127
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,320
of this is done to be as awful as possible.

1128
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,320
Yeah.

1129
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,800
But that's what it feels like.

1130
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,280
Because that is such a funny thing to say.

1131
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,240
When you're, when you were starting to lose an audience, like what's the right, how do

1132
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,520
we broaden out here?

1133
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,280
You guys like touching things, right?

1134
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,840
Who here likes jackets?

1135
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,680
Can I say my other favorite one I wear down?

1136
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,720
Yeah, yeah.

1137
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,720
Percentages had a big year in 2012.

1138
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:20,280
Percentage, the concept of percentage is to set up a cumbersome, like we are the 99 percent

1139
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:27,360
Occupy Wall Street thing, but it's just the setup of percentages had a big year in 2012.

1140
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,360
Percentages.

1141
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:33,040
Yeah, these are some, I'm, you know what, I'm taking it best of my back.

1142
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,360
These are some excellent lead-ins.

1143
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,760
This is really good, yeah.

1144
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,160
So years had a big year, right?

1145
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,080
Like we're in one and then there's a whole other one coming up.

1146
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,680
Give it up for years, everybody.

1147
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,680
I'm just-

1148
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,680
Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

1149
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,760
I am curious now.

1150
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:53,440
There is a full 52 minutes of Jamie Kennedy's stand-up, I'm not going to listen to it now,

1151
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,720
but I am curious, is that the type of setup he does normally?

1152
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,720
I don't know.

1153
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,800
That's a, I'm curious about that.

1154
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,800
Yeah, yeah.

1155
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,560
No, just kind of like yelling general, to like-

1156
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,560
Right.

1157
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,560
Who here likes colors?

1158
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,600
Do you like the light travels from the sun?

1159
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,600
I-

1160
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,320
From the spectrum.

1161
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:21,200
One of the short films, it starts with him and I, this actually got me because it starts

1162
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:26,880
with him like on stage at the Laugh Factory and then a dramatic sit-down where he's like,

1163
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:33,280
I knew I was, when I was, I was born to be a stand-up and it is all a swerve to do a

1164
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:39,520
Commerce Casino ad, but I was like, oh my God, don't tell me there's a dramatic like

1165
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,560
the importance of the truth tellers video in this.

1166
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,480
No, not that one.

1167
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,240
The other thing about the stand-up set is that it's like non-stop, there are just very

1168
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:56,160
angry guys moving equipment around the entire time, never ceasing, just like if they ever

1169
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,400
look towards camera, they have so much hate in their hearts, it feels like they, it feels

1170
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:06,180
like they're kind of a situation where like they needed to hire like 20 grips or roadies

1171
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:10,520
or whatever, but 17 of them called out because they, like, what are they paying?

1172
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,520
And it's on New Year's Eve?

1173
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,520
No thanks, bye.

1174
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,880
So the entire thing, like changing out the sets to be ready for Macy Gray is entirely

1175
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,200
on three very pissed off guys' shoulders, sorry, can you hold, we're doing stand-up

1176
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,200
right now, no, no we cannot, we are too understaffed to hold.

1177
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,200
Can you do the, do it during the commercial break?

1178
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,800
Listen, I don't know what show, what commercial break.

1179
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,360
No one knows when those are.

1180
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:40,320
I've just heard so much about energy efficiency in California and they're saying nothing.

1181
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:45,360
Okay, well that's a good setup for my favorite guest who visits, like, so you get, we're

1182
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:51,360
talking to, you know, we talk to Shannon Elizabeth and various people and then like Playboy Babes,

1183
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:57,560
but then they talk to this woman and this is a, like, so guys, so Stu Stone is doing

1184
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:03,400
this big wind-up about energy efficiency that clearly, someone in the general notion of

1185
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,560
energy paid money to this project, so to where now they have to read all this mealy-mouthed

1186
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:14,800
stuff and the host, Stu Stone, is doing that and behind him is just a party-goer who also

1187
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:19,840
has eyes on the teleprompter who's just reading, mouthing the entire thing behind him, which

1188
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,760
is the funniest thing that happens in the entire, much funnier than anything that the

1189
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,520
so-called comedians do, so good job on that girl, but then, so he's setting up, this is

1190
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:35,480
an energy person in the crowd who's gonna talk very casually about energy.

1191
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:40,440
Foremost, how can we improve the energy efficiency in our homes?

1192
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,800
Hi, Stu, it is a pleasure to meet you, and California homeowners could do different types

1193
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:51,040
of energy-efficient type of projects to their homes, anything like changing out their windows

1194
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:56,440
from single-pane to double-pane, insulating their home, improving their heating and AC

1195
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,800
systems, and many more, and now we actually have a state-wide-

1196
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,200
Well, Stu, who should we send to represent this cause?

1197
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:08,400
How about someone who has never been on camera, who is petrified to be on camera, who needs

1198
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,840
to memorize everything like a child in a pageant?

1199
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,560
Hello, Stu, thank you for having me, it is a lovely evening, the weather is brisk but

1200
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,800
comfortable, now on to energy.

1201
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,760
It sounds like a robot.

1202
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,440
She might have been a discrete robot, yes.

1203
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:31,240
I wonder if this was, it seems like maybe a state program, they had a certain amount

1204
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:36,960
of money they had to spend on marketing or advertising-

1205
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,040
Oh, and it's the end of the year, so they can drain it all on the very last night, yeah.

1206
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:48,280
Oh good, we won't get text at that higher rate if we just funnel money to Jamie Kennedy.

1207
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,680
All right, it's New Year's Eve, the president doesn't want to do it, the vice president

1208
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,040
doesn't want to do it, head of marketing, head of advertising is out.

1209
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,040
Everyone's on vacation.

1210
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:01,840
We've gone down a dozen people and it's like-

1211
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:06,040
There's a lot of fun, there's a lot of fun folks who pop up in this, the host, there's

1212
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:11,480
a, you know, she's relatively together, like everyone in this, everybody kind of gets progressively

1213
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:16,800
drunker clearly as it goes, but you know, all together, all told she's pretty together,

1214
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:22,040
somebody named Jessie Cruikshank who is the co-host and I was like where does she come

1215
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:28,960
into the fold, cause Stu Stone's the Jamie Kennedy guy, oh, Jessie was his co-host on

1216
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:37,960
an extreme musical chairs show that he hosted on the CW called Oh Sit.

1217
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:48,720
Musical chairs, yeah, when I saw that I was just like, yeah, cause I was describing this

1218
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:54,960
and she stopped me and I went, who is Jamie Kennedy and I'm like, she didn't, she missed

1219
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,960
it and I was like-

1220
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,080
But she knows like teen comedies of that era, right, she must have been on a radar.

1221
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:06,840
I think we watched Scream and Romeo and Juliet, but I was just trying to describe like, do

1222
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:14,200
you know Jamie Kennedy experiment or Malibu's Most Wanted, I also, I didn't like these,

1223
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,600
like I didn't watch these-

1224
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,600
No.

1225
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,600
Malibu's Most Wanted?

1226
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,600
Malibu's Most-

1227
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,480
You didn't like Malibu's Most Wanted?

1228
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,480
No, no.

1229
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,480
Oh, huh.

1230
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,120
I, well, and like there was a time where ext was sort of the like go-to terminology of print,

1231
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,040
I feel like there was a brief window where like, am I getting ext right now, Jamie, where's

1232
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:36,000
Jamie and then within a year it was, am I getting punked right now, where's Ashton?

1233
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Yeah, Jamie was before punked?

1234
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,680
Think so, I could be wrong on that, but certainly within popular culture, I would say punked

1235
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:50,400
has a much greater hold as the shorthand of pranking.

1236
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,000
2002 Jamie Kennedy experiment.

1237
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,080
It was right before, it kind of got, yeah, wow, got a little wiped out by punked I think.

1238
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,080
Wow.

1239
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:05,800
Anyway, then you get into, okay, when this cut down video blew up, there was a lot made

1240
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:10,360
of the Macy Gray performance because she's very all over the map.

1241
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,680
I would say when you watch the entire thing, it's like no more than anyone else, like everyone

1242
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:20,520
is, it's just clearly the policy on this was just everyone would be drunk and it's fine.

1243
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:26,000
She's definitely like meandering, it's not the finest performance you've ever seen, and

1244
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,180
it has something that really blew me away, which is like, okay, I understand people being

1245
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:37,740
amended by background singers or like giving kind of a solo to somebody, like now somebody

1246
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:43,100
in my band is going to like carry this part, but she just is a true like pinch singer.

1247
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:46,900
Like she kind of, like somebody else comes out and does all the vamping and she just

1248
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,340
stands next to her and nods.

1249
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:52,260
A much, much better singer.

1250
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:57,300
I hope the much better singer found her way to a good career because she deserves, she

1251
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,580
just like fully does it instead.

1252
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:02,940
Doesn't have the personality though Macy Gray's voice does.

1253
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:03,940
That's true.

1254
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:04,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1255
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:09,180
Money can't buy personality.

1256
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:14,000
I am also, again, to make me like feel like kind of crazy watching this whole thing, there's

1257
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,060
not a single person who like kind of delivers in a traditional way.

1258
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,060
You know what I mean?

1259
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:22,300
Who does the entertainer task that is assigned to them?

1260
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,780
That singer does it.

1261
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,780
I guess you're right.

1262
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:25,780
That singer does it.

1263
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,460
Someone whose name we don't know.

1264
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:32,820
Performance as a whole, every element of this, that's what I'm like, well surely like one

1265
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:37,540
of the musical performers just does a good job or it seems like a normal TV performance.

1266
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:44,420
I don't know that any of the ones or like Jessie or Bridget from Girls Next Door, they

1267
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:45,980
just seem like they are.

1268
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:46,980
They seem scared.

1269
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,620
Well, because the vibe just seems awful.

1270
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:53,740
I don't think they were particularly set up for success, especially when the one has to

1271
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,100
hold the Carl's Jr Turkey Burger, which looks nasty.

1272
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:03,820
Oh yeah, and she's asked on, she's like, it's kind of a like scary little like shady audition,

1273
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:04,820
but on camera.

1274
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,260
We're like, no, eat it sexy though.

1275
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,260
No, come on.

1276
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:10,060
Can you like drip something?

1277
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,060
Get something on your face though.

1278
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:12,060
It's like, oh, okay.

1279
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:16,220
That's a woman telling her to do this, by the way.

1280
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:18,980
I forgot all about the Carl's Jr ads of the time.

1281
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:19,980
That's what they're imitating.

1282
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,380
They are so intense.

1283
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:26,380
Mike, you might want to see if they still have this turkey, albino turkey burger.

1284
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:31,220
It says only 400 calories, and I know you like to hack fast food.

1285
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:35,940
I was thinking, the whole time that I'm watching people refer to this turkey jalapeno burger

1286
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:40,740
as being healthy and low calorie, I'm like, I'm thinking about the two of you.

1287
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:45,020
You floated into my brain like ghosts, because it's exactly the kind of thing they would

1288
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,020
say.

1289
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,020
Yeah, yeah.

1290
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:49,780
The jalapenos actually can't go bad due to the hydrolyzation process.

1291
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:52,140
Do they say that?

1292
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,140
No, no.

1293
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:57,340
The Carl's Jr app is the worst, at least the last time I checked, it was the worst app

1294
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,340
in all of fast food.

1295
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,780
Yeah, you know it's even worse, the food there.

1296
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:05,060
Yeah, I don't really ever eat there.

1297
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,220
Even I have my lines.

1298
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:12,380
The one time that old Scott got a little chubs was due entirely to Carl's Jr. and Jack and

1299
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,380
the Bucks.

1300
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,220
I had a lot of ultimate cheeseburgers right when college started.

1301
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,220
Oh, really?

1302
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,220
That was your go-to?

1303
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,500
I did a full freshman 15 for sure.

1304
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,260
Wow, with Carl's Jr. specifically?

1305
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:22,260
Yeah.

1306
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:29,180
I don't know, you're free, you got a car for the first time so I can just go to the drive-thru

1307
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:34,220
myself, but I'm not really drinking yet, so I'm not having a lot of like, what am I going

1308
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,620
to use this freedom on?

1309
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,100
Cheeseburgers I guess.

1310
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,100
Sure.

1311
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,460
But then that's how you guys eat today.

1312
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:46,500
Well, it's funny to say that because I always remember my dad when I would talk to him on

1313
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,500
Sundays.

1314
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:55,900
I'd be like, yeah, I went to the dining hall, I got a slice of pizza, a pasta dish, tried

1315
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,900
the cheesecake.

1316
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,900
A tray of garlic bread.

1317
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,180
And he's like, did you eat all that?

1318
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:04,060
It's always the most insane combination, like oh, tomato soup and chicken figure.

1319
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:08,980
I was like, oh no, I just kind of nibbled on everything, I wanted to try it.

1320
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:12,420
So I want to try all this food, I'm going to be here for a few years.

1321
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,940
You would just nibble on the different items?

1322
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:16,340
I would try everything.

1323
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,340
Wait, wait, wait.

1324
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,340
But I wouldn't finish it.

1325
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,340
What?

1326
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,340
What a waste.

1327
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,340
That's weird.

1328
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,340
I don't know.

1329
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,340
You're talking to Mr. Food Waste over here.

1330
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:27,540
You've got to be crawling out of your skin, leaving just little nibbles like a pigeon

1331
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,540
would do.

1332
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:34,820
I mean, I would eat a good amount, first off, I was 17 or 18, okay, I didn't do this every

1333
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:35,820
year.

1334
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:38,500
Okay, but you just presented it as your dad would always question you.

1335
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:46,140
He would always be like, that is a wide variety of food, like he's like, what are these combinations?

1336
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,020
I have a question though within this.

1337
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,780
Pizza and pasta, though, goes together?

1338
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,940
Yes, yes, wild combination.

1339
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:58,780
Well French fries and burger, and then oh, the vegan, I think I had a vegan station.

1340
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:02,700
But this is, the thing that I really, what is the payment situation on this?

1341
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:06,820
Because I can't imagine any age of you spending $35 on food.

1342
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:07,820
What is the payment?

1343
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:08,820
Just to nibble, yeah.

1344
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:11,020
You swiped your student ID card.

1345
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:12,020
That's what I was going to say.

1346
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:16,700
Because in no other situation are you just buying six meals and not saving them for the

1347
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,100
rest of the next two weeks.

1348
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:23,500
No, I had like the 14 meal a week plan or whatever it was.

1349
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:29,620
So like two meals a day and then I'd eat cereal in my dorm room or something.

1350
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:36,660
But I put, I think I did put on some weight, but then I avoided it because Ithaca was all

1351
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,660
hills.

1352
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:42,420
So just walk into class, you're going up and down, and the campus is built into hills and

1353
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,900
stairs and stuff.

1354
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:44,900
Yeah.

1355
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,900
Okay.

1356
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:51,940
Do you think there's a record of, I mean there's not, but I would love to see a record of purchases

1357
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:52,940
from your college days.

1358
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:56,420
Do you think there's a, I mean that had to have been electronically.

1359
01:11:56,420 --> 01:12:00,900
As we head into year eight, this will turn into all of us reading our old receipts.

1360
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,900
Yeah, right.

1361
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,700
And I, because I had a similar system and I'm wondering now if I could log on to the

1362
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:10,660
portal of ISU of Illinois State University and see what I was eating.

1363
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:15,940
I think there's a subway in our lobby of the dorm, so maybe I ate a lot of subway.

1364
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:19,660
I found all of Mike's purchase records from 2007 to 2008.

1365
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:22,220
He bought hundreds of cock rings.

1366
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,940
Here he is playing dumb about cock rings.

1367
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:29,220
He knew this is, I knew that was, you doth protest too much.

1368
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:33,140
Normal, the biggest cock ring store in normal Illinois.

1369
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,660
I was always frequenting there.

1370
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,660
Yes.

1371
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:39,980
Normals normal shop, they call it.

1372
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,820
Normals normal shop, that's right.

1373
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,860
Ben Folds way to normal about normal Illinois.

1374
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:45,860
How about that?

1375
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:46,860
I guess that didn't occur to me.

1376
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:47,860
That's about the place.

1377
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:48,860
You kind of, I didn't catch that.

1378
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,340
It was a little mush mouth.

1379
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,340
What did you say?

1380
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:56,220
Oh, a way, there's an album called way to normal, but Ben Folds, which I saw Ben Folds

1381
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,220
perform.

1382
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,220
Oh, a full album?

1383
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:00,940
No, no, but he saw him perform in normal.

1384
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:01,940
Oh, okay.

1385
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,580
I don't know if it was the time.

1386
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,580
Well, that must have been special.

1387
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,100
I don't know if it was the time he thought of the album.

1388
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,100
I'm not sure.

1389
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,100
Wow.

1390
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,100
I think he performed there a few times.

1391
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,100
You might have watched the gears turn.

1392
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,100
But it's possible.

1393
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,100
About a neat title.

1394
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:17,780
Let me, talking about great music performances, here you are saying, you might be taking

1395
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:22,100
that back, what you just said about no entertainers delivering, because I'd like to play a little

1396
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,900
bit of this performance by a band called DTK.

1397
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,900
Oh God, DTK.

1398
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,860
Come on, I want to see you guys dance.

1399
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:33,860
Watch this in every move I make.

1400
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:37,860
You don't want to make any mistakes.

1401
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:41,860
Keep your words until they cause you to break.

1402
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:45,860
You can keep on talking till you fall on your face.

1403
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:49,860
Me, I'm just trying to survive.

1404
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,860
This just fully sounds improvised.

1405
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,860
It fully just sounds made up, off the top.

1406
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:55,860
Just pretend you have a song.

1407
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:58,820
I'm a guy and I'm living my life.

1408
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:01,820
Like, just whatever the first thought is in his head.

1409
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:02,820
Okay, we'll book you.

1410
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:06,820
You do have songs, though, with lyrics and a plan, right?

1411
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:07,820
Yeah, sure.

1412
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,540
No, I got you, Jamie.

1413
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,540
Of course.

1414
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,540
Four albums worth.

1415
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:13,540
Wait until you hear my great lyrics.

1416
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:14,540
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1417
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:15,540
What am I going to do?

1418
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,540
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1419
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:21,540
Your eyes are beautiful and I want to look into them tonight.

1420
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:27,540
Look into my world of truth, but the truth hurts sometimes.

1421
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:31,540
Look into my eyes.

1422
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,540
What is that band?

1423
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,540
I don't know.

1424
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,540
There's enough bands called DTK that it's impossible to...

1425
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,540
I know.

1426
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,540
It's impossible to find it.

1427
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,540
I really wanted to know what that...

1428
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:44,540
I bet there's something interesting there if there was any record of them existing.

1429
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:45,540
But there's not.

1430
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:50,540
Stu Stone's nephew, he did some work on his patio, so he let him...

1431
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:55,540
I was going to say they just started asking crew members who could play instruments that

1432
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,540
they cobbled together with bands from that.

1433
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:00,540
Does anyone have any vaguely attractive sons?

1434
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:03,540
I need all the crews vaguely attractive sons.

1435
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,540
We got one hair straight in there.

1436
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,540
We'll bring their hair down in their face.

1437
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:10,540
It'll look like hot bangs.

1438
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:15,540
In the way that Jamie Kenney's stand-up goes on for too long, I feel like they do a number

1439
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,540
of songs.

1440
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,540
They get so many.

1441
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,540
Technically, they start and stop and go into...

1442
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,540
But it all feels like one song to me.

1443
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,540
It all feels like a big song.

1444
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,540
Oh, like a big jam sash?

1445
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,540
Yeah.

1446
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,540
Just one multi-part suite.

1447
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:27,540
Yeah, yeah.

1448
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:31,540
It's easier to delineate between the Bone Thugs and Harmony song.

1449
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:34,540
Have we said that, that Bone Thugs and Harmony are on this?

1450
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:35,540
Yes.

1451
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:36,540
And that...

1452
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:39,540
Because there's one that...

1453
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,540
This song also to me, I certainly...

1454
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:45,540
I like a lot of Bone Thugs and Harmony songs, but I guess I didn't care for the one where

1455
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:48,540
they just keep saying, it's the first of the month.

1456
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:51,540
It's the first of the month.

1457
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:55,540
Maybe the recording of first of the month I might be fine with, but this is where...

1458
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,540
It might be important to say that...

1459
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,540
Because they were asked a lot of times, like, so did you guys rehearse this?

1460
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,540
Did you plan it?

1461
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:04,540
And they're like, no, because we wanted to be crazy psycho shit.

1462
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,540
Did you sound check?

1463
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:08,540
No, there was no sound check.

1464
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,540
I don't think...

1465
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:11,540
I think in any other setting...

1466
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:15,540
Look, you can still be chaotic with a sound check, for God's sake.

1467
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:19,540
I think that's something that you need for music to be performed on amplifiers.

1468
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,540
I think that's right.

1469
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:21,540
I think, yeah.

1470
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:22,540
I know he...

1471
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:27,540
Look, Jamie Kennedy embodies the punk rock spirit, but it's television and you have to...

1472
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,540
People have to hear things and...

1473
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:36,540
But people definitely did hear a lot of things, especially the viewers at home, in the performance

1474
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:40,540
of the more well-known and a song I'd certainly like, which is Notorious Thugs.

1475
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,540
Yeah.

1476
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,540
And here now is...

1477
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:47,540
Just keep an ear out for some words that you shouldn't be hearing here in Notorious Thugs.

1478
01:16:47,540 --> 01:17:02,540
Notorious Thugs.

1479
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:03,540
So many.

1480
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,540
That's really...

1481
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:05,540
So many cursing.

1482
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,540
That's nailed nicely in the cut down.

1483
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:07,540
Yeah.

1484
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,540
So many profanities.

1485
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,540
And they're sort of aware.

1486
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:10,540
They're like, oh, shoot.

1487
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:14,540
There's a little energy there of like, oh, wait.

1488
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:15,540
Okay.

1489
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,540
Oh, there's also a guy...

1490
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:22,540
This has to be narrated because the listener can't see it, but there's a guy who like, all

1491
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,540
he's asked is, what's your name?

1492
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,540
And then he says something you're not supposed to say.

1493
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:30,540
And then he immediately makes a face like, oh, like he knew.

1494
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,540
And Stu Stone has to go away from him very quickly.

1495
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,540
Here's that.

1496
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,540
I believe that's me.

1497
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:37,540
Macy.

1498
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:38,540
Here we go.

1499
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,540
What's your name, sir?

1500
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,540
Talon, motherfucking fool.

1501
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,540
Hey, it is New Year's Eve 2013.

1502
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,540
What is your name?

1503
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,540
His mother.

1504
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,540
Then what is your name?

1505
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,540
His mother.

1506
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,540
It's Talon, motherfucker.

1507
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:57,540
Check it in with Talon and his mom.

1508
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,540
Mrs.

1509
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,540
We're in with Talon and his motherfucking mom.

1510
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:02,540
Mrs. Talon.

1511
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:06,540
Yo, who'd you have to fuck to make Talon here?

1512
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:12,540
I actually think, I think I will have the thought, again, it's in the past for listeners,

1513
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:16,540
I think I will think as it hits midnight if I'm awake.

1514
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,540
And the answer is I won't be.

1515
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:22,540
But if I am, I will try to conjure the phrase heading into the year.

1516
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:26,540
It's motherfucking Talon.

1517
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:30,540
Talon is my, he's my patron saint of 2025.

1518
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,540
So that happens.

1519
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,540
Let me, in terms of, let me just play.

1520
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:37,540
This is what I was alluding to with the opening bit here.

1521
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:40,540
At some point it comes back from an ad and you get this.

1522
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:45,540
Come on, man, don't fucking give me shit, dude.

1523
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,540
I gotta have a camera.

1524
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:49,540
There's no camera to work on the show.

1525
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,540
He should be right here, roaming around here.

1526
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:52,540
Where's our camera guy?

1527
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:53,540
It's called Fairly Odd Christmas.

1528
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:54,540
Okay.

1529
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:55,540
That's a live action.

1530
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:57,540
Where's our, where's our stage manager?

1531
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,540
Amy, don't fuck into the mic.

1532
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:05,540
There we go.

1533
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:09,540
Alright, welcome back to 2013.

1534
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,540
I was trying, I was like, do I cut this off?

1535
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:14,540
I think we have to make the listener hear this as long as it played out.

1536
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:17,540
That was just like 30 seconds of nothing and swing.

1537
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:18,540
Yeah.

1538
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:19,540
Boy.

1539
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:20,540
Where's the stage manager?

1540
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,540
Where is the sound guy?

1541
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,540
Why is this going out live on the podcast?

1542
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,540
Like, mute the mics, you know?

1543
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:28,540
A lot of questions.

1544
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:29,540
I don't know.

1545
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:33,540
The guy who put this, the guy who was the director, like maybe, I don't know if you caught this, that Jamie,

1546
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,540
because you watched his like excuse video recently.

1547
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,540
Yes, yeah.

1548
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:41,540
The director, he seemed to feel a little betrayed by what the director presented as his capabilities

1549
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:46,540
because, and the director is a like wrestling league owner.

1550
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,540
Is that a name you've ever heard?

1551
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:49,540
Oh yeah, what was that name again?

1552
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:51,540
I don't, I have to look it up.

1553
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,540
David something.

1554
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,540
Does that narrow it down?

1555
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,540
He owns wrestling and he's a David.

1556
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:58,540
Oh shoot, maybe I missed when he actually said, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

1557
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,540
Is it, you said he was an owner?

1558
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:04,540
Yeah, he owns a league and still to this day, but I don't, I don't have this,

1559
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,540
it'll be forever of me Googling if I don't.

1560
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:12,540
But anyway, I think he, Jamie seemed to imply that the director did not have his shit together as much.

1561
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:17,540
There was some blame to go around, but then there was also this notion that like it's going to be crazy.

1562
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:21,540
Like, you know what was in my head when I was, I was like, you know what I, you know what this like

1563
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:26,540
common talking point is that I bet he will say is like the Dean Martin show,

1564
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:30,540
Dean, you know, would just get drunk and he wouldn't even go into rehearsals.

1565
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:33,540
And then, so then anything could happen.

1566
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,540
And then once I heard his soundbites, it was close.

1567
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,540
It wasn't that it was Jerry Lewis.

1568
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:38,540
Oh wow.

1569
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:43,540
He's like, I want it to be like Jerry Lewis Telethon where he's on the air for 24 hours.

1570
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:47,540
And I'm like, the clips I've seen of the Jerry Lewis Telethon are a lot more buttoned up than this.

1571
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,540
Yeah, of course.

1572
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:54,540
And there's a lot of children around so you don't have bone thugs in harmony saying fucking shit over and over.

1573
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:55,540
David Marquez.

1574
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:56,540
That's it. There it is.

1575
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:57,540
Yeah.

1576
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,540
You ever come across this name or this league before?

1577
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:00,540
Pro wrestling.

1578
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:03,540
Oh yes, yes, I do know that.

1579
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,540
I think that's like a really was like a really hardcore one.

1580
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:11,540
He might have been the guy who there was a weird wrestling show on MTV for a very brief amount of time.

1581
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:12,540
Oh, OK.

1582
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,540
That he did.

1583
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:18,540
David WXW maybe is known for championship wrestling.

1584
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,540
Hmm. I'll look into it more.

1585
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:23,540
The wrestling game clearly is to get all the letters as close as they can be to each other.

1586
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:26,540
So maybe you get confused which one you're going to.

1587
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:27,540
Right.

1588
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:30,540
He's involved in MLW now.

1589
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:33,540
So he's been involved in wrestling for a long time.

1590
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:34,540
OK, OK.

1591
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,540
So he betrayed Jamie Kennedy.

1592
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:39,540
This is a smaller promotion with a television deal.

1593
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,540
OK, yeah, yeah.

1594
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,540
I guess that's what it.

1595
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:49,540
But anyway, I think there was a feeling of like this guy doesn't have because we don't have the sound is bad and the walkies went out and then they didn't.

1596
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:52,540
They say where's our clock so many times.

1597
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:58,540
I would say this is how New Year's Eve viewing usually works for me.

1598
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,540
Again, if I'm awake, I won't be.

1599
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,540
I have a very new baby.

1600
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:05,540
But usually it is like, OK, I'll put on whatever show just for the countdown.

1601
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:10,540
So really, you know, we got all these bits with Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin and all that.

1602
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,540
Who cares?

1603
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:12,540
I don't watch any of that.

1604
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:18,540
The only thing any of these places really owe is what countdown they only have to have their shit together for 60 seconds.

1605
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:19,540
And this does not.

1606
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:20,540
It's nowhere close.

1607
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:21,540
The countdown is late.

1608
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:25,540
The one thing they have to do, they don't do.

1609
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,540
It's so wild.

1610
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:30,540
I'm trying to think what else to hit.

1611
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:40,540
I don't think I have to play the clip of him telling the heart disease people that he's made that they're making his heart do crazy things right now.

1612
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,540
I think I could skip that.

1613
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,540
You can imagine what that is.

1614
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:48,540
There's a part where he says, is it weird being on stage with 14 year olds and champagne?

1615
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:53,540
Yeah, if you have the question, it might be might be weird.

1616
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:54,540
What else?

1617
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:55,540
What else?

1618
01:22:55,540 --> 01:23:00,540
Oh, well, OK, where it culminates, obviously, because things are already chaotic.

1619
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:03,540
We've already heard from Motherfucking Talon.

1620
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:04,540
Yeah.

1621
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:10,540
Phone Thugs and Harmony have sworn a lot like it's it's really going off the rails in that last half hour.

1622
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:13,540
There's oh, oh, boy.

1623
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,540
OK, here.

1624
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:15,540
All right.

1625
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:20,540
So then some kind of like, you know, non entertainers start making their way to the stage.

1626
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:26,540
Just people who are around because they're trying to make this a Hollywood Boulevard block party and whatever.

1627
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:28,540
And let's just the chaos is part of it.

1628
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:31,540
So then Jamie ends up talking to this person.

1629
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:35,540
Jamie Kennedy is with two of the biggest freaks in Hollywood right now.

1630
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:38,540
OK, hold on.

1631
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,540
I'm with my two lovely ladies girls.

1632
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:43,540
What's your resolution for 20 years?

1633
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:46,540
What's your resolution for 2013?

1634
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:49,540
I'm just get rid of all my haters.

1635
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:50,540
All your haters.

1636
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:52,540
Can I ask you something?

1637
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,540
Do you like white boys?

1638
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,540
I love the hell out of some white people.

1639
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:57,540
You love the hell.

1640
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,540
You know what they say?

1641
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:02,540
Is it true what they say?

1642
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:05,540
You know, they say once you go black, you never go back.

1643
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,540
Yeah.

1644
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:12,540
Well, I'm saying you should try white because it'll keep your vagina very tight.

1645
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,540
Bleep that, bleep that.

1646
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,540
Give it up for the first night of the wedding.

1647
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,540
He's been live on the air.

1648
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,540
He's been planning this for six weeks.

1649
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:22,540
He's live on the air.

1650
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:27,540
I think you don't have regular audio, let alone bleep audio.

1651
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,540
There's not a seven second.

1652
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:32,540
Maybe there was, but no one's manning the seven second delay at that point.

1653
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,540
Yes.

1654
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:41,540
I think the person who was on the seven second delay button is the woman going, I want to get rid of my haters.

1655
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:46,540
She was the bleeper.

1656
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,540
There wasn't one live bleep.

1657
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,540
No.

1658
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:54,540
Which is part of why as soon as this aired, KDOC just ran.

1659
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,540
They were like, no, we didn't know.

1660
01:24:56,540 --> 01:25:02,540
I think somebody hijacked our airwaves when that Max Headroom took over TV that one time.

1661
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:03,540
You know that story?

1662
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,540
That was pirate radio, I think.

1663
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,540
We have never met Jamie Kennedy.

1664
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,540
We don't know who that is.

1665
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:14,540
They disavowed the entire thing, and in part of that, they used to really stay on it, deleting copies of this.

1666
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:18,540
But now it's gotten away from them, and Jamie posted it on 2B.

1667
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:26,540
But still, I think this one cut down is the only way that you see all of the fucks and all of how it actually, all of the worst of the errors.

1668
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:30,540
I watched the full 90 minute broadcast that's on YouTube.

1669
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:33,540
I don't know, don't.

1670
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,540
It's really boring.

1671
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:37,540
It isn't terminable.

1672
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:40,540
It didn't add a lot to my, that's what I'm saying, just do the cut down.

1673
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:47,540
This felt like a cousin of Six Flags Live to me in terms of content gutter, and where I had to keep, we had the idea.

1674
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:48,540
That'll be fun.

1675
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,540
And then I had to do it in four sittings.

1676
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:53,540
Really, I had to like, come on, Scott, you could do this.

1677
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:54,540
You're a man.

1678
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:55,540
You've got two children.

1679
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:58,540
You can make it to the end of Jamie Kennedy's first night.

1680
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:00,540
Sit down and do it, motherfucker.

1681
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:06,540
Last night, I was doing something, and then it was like 11 p.m., and my body shut itself down.

1682
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:10,540
I was trying to finish this last night, and it would not allow it.

1683
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,540
My eyes just were like, you are going to bed.

1684
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:15,540
You cannot stay up to watch this.

1685
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:22,540
I actually did feel, it's funny you say that, because coincidentally, I was feeling ill after watching it.

1686
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:25,540
Like I just didn't sleep great.

1687
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:27,540
Like every participant in the show.

1688
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:34,540
Yeah, I wonder if the vibes were just leaking from the screen.

1689
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:38,540
Maybe everyone, if anyone intends on watching this, they should do it at like 9 a.m.

1690
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,540
They should have like a lot of time before bed is even in the picture.

1691
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:45,540
There's a couple notes from Jamie I found interesting.

1692
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:49,540
He believes that multiple parties owe him money still from this.

1693
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:54,540
He believes $36,000 is owed to him from Carl's Jr.

1694
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:59,540
Because he went to Carl's Jr. himself, he says, and got this deal, and then they never paid up.

1695
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:04,540
He didn't even get a turkey jalapeno burger out of the deal.

1696
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:09,540
He certainly believes a lot of things nowadays, it seems like.

1697
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:12,540
He believes the Chinese theater owes him $15,000.

1698
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,540
The theater itself?

1699
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:16,540
I think they've changed owners so many times.

1700
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:17,540
It's going to be hard to get that money, Jamie.

1701
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,540
Just to get away from me.

1702
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:21,540
Those were fake deals, just to not pay Jamie.

1703
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:25,540
TCL, that's the name on your TV, and it's the name of the Chinese theater.

1704
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,540
Can I at least get a TV now?

1705
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:30,540
He praised the Commerce Casino as good people, though.

1706
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,540
He said, I guess they paid up.

1707
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:33,540
They're on the level.

1708
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,540
They paid up, and he didn't have a beef with them.

1709
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:37,540
And then I lost it all before I left the building.

1710
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:40,540
He did not have a beef with them like he had with Carl's.

1711
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:49,540
It feels like a real California split, like David Milch's luck kind of gambling, like hardcore gambling stuff.

1712
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:51,540
Spending many hours.

1713
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,540
Yeah.

1714
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:55,540
Well, there's a part where they do a little skit there.

1715
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:56,540
That's with a wrestler, too.

1716
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,540
Is that a guy you guys have heard of?

1717
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:02,540
I think the bit is that he's mad, but he does it so scary.

1718
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:08,540
He's pounding on the table in a way that's extremely unsettling to the female card dealer.

1719
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:09,540
Who is that?

1720
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,540
Yeah, who was that?

1721
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:16,540
Why, that's Scrap Iron Adam Pearce.

1722
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:18,540
Where were we with Scrap Iron?

1723
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,540
He's getting scrappy at the Commerce Casino?

1724
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:21,540
Yeah, we know Adam Pearce.

1725
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:27,540
He's the onscreen general manager of Monday Night Raw and WWE.

1726
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:30,540
I haven't watched WWE in a long time. Is he smacking SmackDown?

1727
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:31,540
Okay.

1728
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:32,540
But maybe I'm wrong.

1729
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,540
Nick Caldys is SmackDown, isn't he?

1730
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:37,540
Oh, maybe I'm wrong. Yeah, maybe he's right. You're right. You're right.

1731
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:38,540
I haven't watched Raw in a while.

1732
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:39,540
He was in this.

1733
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:40,540
Adam Pearce is in this.

1734
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,540
Adam Pearce is in this.

1735
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:44,540
Being pounding on a table to the point where it alarms the other people on camera.

1736
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,540
Yeah.

1737
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:54,540
Also, a very odd moment in one of the sketches where he approaches a table of Asian people and yells,

1738
01:28:54,540 --> 01:29:00,540
I don't speak Asian, and one of them responds, we're from Sherman Oaks.

1739
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:09,540
That is the closest thing to comedy I get, the closest thing to a joke structure in this.

1740
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:15,540
Well, also in the aftermath, the other guy, Stu, was on K-Rock after, and the guy's trying to get,

1741
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:22,540
the K-Rock DJ is doing a good job holding him to the fire where he gives the same stock answer three times,

1742
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:26,540
but like, look, we're trying to, you know, Jamie loves to go buck wild, okay?

1743
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:31,540
And the DJ is like, did you memorize that answer? What are you doing? Answer my question.

1744
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:33,540
There's no way you planned all this stuff.

1745
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:39,540
And one of his sputterings in there is like, look, Jamie loves Andy Kaufman.

1746
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,540
No.

1747
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:45,540
He loves Monty Python. Oh, yeah. Oh, Monty Python.

1748
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:50,540
It's because of a deep abiding love of Monty Python that you didn't have a clock.

1749
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:54,540
That's very Python-esque. That's the sort of thing Terry Gilliam would do.

1750
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:57,540
Surreal, you see. Anyway.

1751
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:00,540
It is crazy this is 2013, though.

1752
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,540
You mean it feels like it'll be older.

1753
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:04,540
It feels like it'll be older, yeah.

1754
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:09,540
I double-checked when Jamie Kennedy was dating Jennifer Love Hewitt, and it was a few years before this,

1755
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:13,540
just because that's one of the main things I know about Jamie Kennedy, that he dated briefly Jennifer Love Hewitt.

1756
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:17,540
And you put him on some sort of, you put him on a dart board, you got a Jamie.

1757
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:19,540
Yeah, and I've hated him ever since.

1758
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,540
He drew Xs over his eyes.

1759
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:25,540
That's right.

1760
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:31,540
Well, you're getting your revenge now with this long criticism of his work.

1761
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:32,540
Finally.

1762
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:37,540
Yeah, how dare you have your time with, what did people, did she have a nickname, was she like Love?

1763
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,540
Was she J Love?

1764
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:40,540
Oh, they called her Love.

1765
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:41,540
Love.

1766
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:42,540
I know that.

1767
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:48,540
Anyway, the thing it really culminates in, which I guess our description of it should as well,

1768
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:52,540
so that last clip gave you a taste of the kind of people who are on stage,

1769
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:57,540
or at least their condition in this moment, and then things start getting a little while behind them.

1770
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:00,540
It's been an unbelievable night.

1771
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,540
We want to thank everyone who came out.

1772
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:06,540
DTK, Macy Gray, Bulldogs, and ArgaMini.

1773
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:09,540
Bulldogs and ArgaMini.

1774
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:12,540
YingYum style.

1775
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:15,540
Bulldogs and ArgaMini performing GongGong style.

1776
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,540
Gongler's Casino.

1777
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:24,540
And then, like, there's a lot of people who start to tell what's happening,

1778
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,540
but you can start to see that people are getting shoved, and then it gets to this.

1779
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:32,540
It's getting crazy here.

1780
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:35,540
We also want to thank Carl's Jr.

1781
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:39,540
God bless you, and we'll see you in 2024.

1782
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,540
I don't like that.

1783
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,540
That's too weird.

1784
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,540
There's a fight.

1785
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:44,540
It's ending with a fight.

1786
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:45,540
It's ending with a fight.

1787
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,540
You can't see the fight.

1788
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:48,540
You can't really see that.

1789
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:52,540
You really got to see through some people to see that there's a lot of shove,

1790
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:56,540
and maybe even the people who we just saw laughing and talking into the microphone,

1791
01:31:56,540 --> 01:32:00,540
I think one of them is now just severe eyebrow.

1792
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,540
Fuck you, motherfucker.

1793
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:07,540
There is a very serious, angry fight going on on the air,

1794
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:10,540
and then they cut the mics and just roll the credits over silence,

1795
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:13,540
and that is the end of First Night.

1796
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:18,540
When you said that Jamie Kennedy experiment was 2002 and this is 2013,

1797
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:24,540
I'm like, I would have thought this was like, oh, he's on TV or he has a movie out,

1798
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,540
so he's hosting this New Year's.

1799
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:27,540
No.

1800
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:28,540
Yeah, he is on TV.

1801
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:29,540
This.

1802
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:33,540
He's doing this, and a lot of things that won't be seen by humans

1803
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:36,540
until they end up on 2B 12 years later.

1804
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:38,540
2B paid for this.

1805
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:40,540
Yeah, money was exchanged.

1806
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:41,540
I would love to know how much.

1807
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,540
Yeah, really.

1808
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:43,540
What is that worth to them?

1809
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:44,540
Right.

1810
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:49,540
And how many people, and do they base their views on do you make it to the end?

1811
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,540
Because if so, no one has.

1812
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:52,540
Yeah.

1813
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:55,540
I'm trying to think of anything else in his aftermath worth mentioning.

1814
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:58,540
Again, he says to the New York Times, I didn't stab nobody.

1815
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:00,540
I didn't shoot nobody.

1816
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,540
I just made a New Year's Eve special.

1817
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,540
Is that so bad?

1818
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:06,540
Yeah, look, the answer is no.

1819
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:10,540
He also said that why things are in a very defiant,

1820
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:14,540
yes, we're doing Fire Festival again next year kind of move.

1821
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:16,540
He says we're already doing it.

1822
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:19,540
Commerce Casino is signed up for next year.

1823
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:24,540
And I got a text from Marilyn Manson and says he wants to do it next year.

1824
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:27,540
And I want to get Wu-Tang Clan.

1825
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:30,540
I want to put people in that I like.

1826
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:34,540
And Stu Stone in the K-Rock appearance reiterates the same.

1827
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:37,540
It's exactly the same status.

1828
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,540
Marilyn Manson in.

1829
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:41,540
I would not help with a special today.

1830
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:43,540
Wu-Tang Clan desired.

1831
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:47,540
How do we feel on Wu-Tang Clan?

1832
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:49,540
Are they in enough to get well?

1833
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:50,540
I don't know.

1834
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:51,540
We want them.

1835
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:52,540
That's something.

1836
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:54,540
We've announced a guest that we want.

1837
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:55,540
That's like us.

1838
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:56,540
All right.

1839
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:58,540
Big 2025 for our Guest the Ride.

1840
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:01,540
We got Marilyn Manson joining us as a guest.

1841
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,540
And Michael Eisner.

1842
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:03,540
And we want Michael Eisner.

1843
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:06,540
OK, so a Big 2025 to come.

1844
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:15,540
A Commerce Casino episode with Marilyn Manson coming up.

1845
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:18,540
Yeah, well, that gets us there, I suppose.

1846
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:21,540
You know, hey, starting the year with a little bit of chaos.

1847
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:22,540
Yeah, it is.

1848
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,540
Yeah, I watched the cut down for sure.

1849
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:27,540
And then, yeah, no, don't do the 90 minutes.

1850
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:29,540
No, no, it didn't add anything.

1851
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:31,540
The cut down is the way to go.

1852
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,540
Have energy efficiency in Carl's Jr.

1853
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:38,540
and Commerce Casino if you want to lose it all.

1854
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:43,540
And be aware of hearts needing to be healthy in general.

1855
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:44,540
Yeah, maybe we should.

1856
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:49,540
I mean, Eve, Universal's Eve, their Universal New Year's.

1857
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:52,540
Every year I get those promo emails and I'm like.

1858
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:53,540
But maybe they should have.

1859
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:54,540
Check out Eve.

1860
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:57,540
Maybe they should have Jamie Kennedy host one of the areas,

1861
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:59,540
just for old time's sake.

1862
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:02,540
You know, just for if you know, you know, really.

1863
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:05,540
Well, my my pitch to that would be yes.

1864
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:11,540
But don't tell him that he's doing it until, let's say, 1110 p.m.

1865
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:12,540
Right.

1866
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,540
Just shake him out of wherever he is.

1867
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:17,540
I would say sleeping.

1868
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,540
There's no way.

1869
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:21,540
Yeah, I was just going to say, though,

1870
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:23,540
I think you're giving him too much credit for being prepared,

1871
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,540
even in this day and age.

1872
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:25,540
Yes.

1873
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:26,540
Yeah.

1874
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,540
Oh, like you'd be fine.

1875
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:28,540
Like actually.

1876
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:29,540
What am I saying?

1877
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:31,540
Give him four months notice.

1878
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:32,540
Right.

1879
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:33,540
He'll still end up the same.

1880
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:34,540
I think so.

1881
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:35,540
All right.

1882
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:36,540
Hey, we're here with Shrek.

1883
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,540
Hey, let me suck your green dick.

1884
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:39,540
Oh, shit.

1885
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:40,540
Don't do it.

1886
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:41,540
I can't say that.

1887
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:42,540
Blip that.

1888
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:43,540
Blip that.

1889
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,540
Jamie, this isn't being broadcast.

1890
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:46,540
There's no way to bleep it.

1891
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:48,540
Blip it from reality.

1892
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:50,540
Blip it from having happened.

1893
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:53,540
It's like climbing down the hill by the roller coaster construction.

1894
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,540
Hey, I'm lost.

1895
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:58,540
Somebody tell me how to get back up there.

1896
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:00,540
We're here with a coyote.

1897
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:02,540
Oh, shit.

1898
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:04,540
It's ending with a fight.

1899
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:07,540
It's ending with me getting chewed by a coyote.

1900
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:12,540
He's in the club scene in the Fast and Furious studio tour area.

1901
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:15,540
There's a hologram of the rock here.

1902
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:18,540
I'm going to hook up with a fucking hologram.

1903
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,540
I'm in my hologram ho phase.

1904
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:24,540
I'm going to get me HPV as a hologram.

1905
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:27,540
I'm going to stand here, but not here.

1906
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:31,540
Everyone's got to be in one little square.

1907
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:34,540
Tidal safe square.

1908
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:35,540
Oh, no.

1909
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,540
I got hologram genital warts.

1910
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:41,540
I need a hologram doctor to scrub them off.

1911
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:44,540
He drowns in the flood area.

1912
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:48,540
He's sitting there hosting, and then the flood comes and hits him.

1913
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:52,540
And he has like two full minutes to watch the rain come down.

1914
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:54,540
What's this?

1915
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:56,540
Some kind of fucking flood?

1916
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:58,540
I'm going to walk to high ground.

1917
01:36:58,540 --> 01:36:59,540
That shit saved me.

1918
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,540
Oh, what the fuck?

1919
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:02,540
Oh, no.

1920
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:05,540
And I never even got to meet Wu-Tang Clan.

1921
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:08,540
That's no context for War of the Worlds.

1922
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:09,540
And he's like, what happened?

1923
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:11,540
Is the world ending?

1924
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,540
Oh, no.

1925
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:13,540
For the Lord, the humanity.

1926
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:17,540
This plane must have crashed into Kim Kardashian's butt.

1927
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:21,540
That sounds good, honestly.

1928
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,540
Yeah, I know.

1929
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:23,540
I do want to say.

1930
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,540
That's what I'm saying.

1931
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,540
I think, look, this thing is like hateful and horrible, right?

1932
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:27,540
However, who cares?

1933
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:30,540
Do it every year.

1934
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:35,540
If we had like lots of years of like, I want to see him do it as long as Jerry.

1935
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:37,540
Get as crazy as Jerry.

1936
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:39,540
But except for no good cause.

1937
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:40,540
Helping no one.

1938
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:43,540
Other than making you generally aware that you shouldn't hurt your heart.

1939
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:46,540
But also turkey jalapeno burger.

1940
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:50,540
Constant back and forth between gigantic sloppy burgers.

1941
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:52,540
But mind your heart, though.

1942
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:58,540
Did you guys, did you enjoy all your new technology products this year?

1943
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,540
Yeah, very happy.

1944
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:04,540
I had a very good Christmas in terms of new technology products.

1945
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:08,540
Well, and hey, check out percentages did have a big 2024.

1946
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:11,540
Yeah, I'm excited for percentages this year, too.

1947
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:19,540
Hey, I hope that you subscribe to 100 percent of the great content that we have coming out here on this on the second gate.

1948
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:21,540
I'm still in the mode.

1949
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:24,540
I still want to wrap it up like that and go over to go over to club.

1950
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:25,540
What?

1951
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:26,540
I can't read that.

1952
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:27,540
Three.

1953
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:28,540
What the fuck is that?

1954
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:30,540
I've never seen that before.

1955
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:31,540
Club three.

1956
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:35,540
Our VIP Patriot until we get one more bonus episode every month and our regular episodes out free.

1957
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:36,540
This is chaotic.

1958
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:37,540
I didn't say you survived.

1959
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:38,540
Oh, yeah.

1960
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:39,540
I guess the ride.

1961
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:40,540
You slur.

1962
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,540
You slur.

1963
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:44,540
I guess the fuck is the rub.
