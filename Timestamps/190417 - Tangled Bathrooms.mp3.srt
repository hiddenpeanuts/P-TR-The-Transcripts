1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,160
Today on the show, folks, it's toilet time.

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,840
That's right, we're talking the tangled toilets.

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,880
Splash.

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,640
At Walt Disney's Magic Kingdom,

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,880
I'm Jason Sheridan here with Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,760
You've been waiting, what, a year and a half,

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,880
as long as we've been doing the show,

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,320
to yell, it's toilet time.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,160
It's toilet time.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,160
And now you finally get to your dream realized.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,040
My dream realized, Scott Gerrider.

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,440
That was exciting, I agree.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,800
What a great way to start.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
What a delight, yeah.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
The tangled bathrooms, and this is one of those

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,360
sunny eclipse where I'd be curious to do the general poll

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,360
of do you know what we're talking about already?

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,160
Because I didn't.

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,880
Here's what happened.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,600
My friend Dennis McNicholas, who's deep with this stuff,

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,680
texted me out of the blue,

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,280
hey, I have a great idea for a C ticket.

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,040
Although I guess in this case, it's kind of a P ticket.

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,040
That's my, I said that, not him.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,280
Let's not put that on him.

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,880
It's certainly a number two ticket.

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,640
It's good it's on the second gate.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,000
Hey, that's right, that's the number two gate today.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,440
Sure.

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,440
So out of nowhere, a text and a couple of pictures

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,320
of this beautiful looking area in Fantasyland,

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,360
and I'm like, what is this?

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,400
And he says, the mini tangled land at Walt Disney World,

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,520
a richly themed area whose sole attraction is bathrooms.

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,880
Is bathrooms and phone chargers to benches,

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,600
like barrel shaped benches with phone charging stations.

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,680
Yes, there is also that.

40
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,240
There's tables that look like logs,

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,280
and then some of the logs have little doors

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
and you could charge your phone.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,480
Now that's a good thing right off the bat.

44
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,580
This is a thing that Disney needs to account for more.

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,360
They're involving mobile experiences in the lines,

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,040
but there's not a lot of plugs,

47
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,040
except for plenty in my beloved Napa wine zone

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,280
in California Adventure.

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,240
Although even then you see people like huddling

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,040
in a bathroom hallway on the ground.

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,760
You know, like one wire's going one way,

52
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,600
the other's going the other.

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,320
People are trying to stay as far apart from each other

54
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,200
as they can, even though they're both huddling

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
around the same outlet.

56
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,040
So to in 2013 when they put this in,

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,800
have a good mobile setup is cool.

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,660
Good for them.

59
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,080
But yeah, I didn't know about this before.

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,040
I feel like you had, Jason.

61
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,760
Yeah, so I knew about it because I remembered.

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,080
So this is technically part of the Fantasyland expansion

63
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,080
announced at D23 2009, I think,

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,920
and then opened in phases between 2012 and 2014.

65
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,840
And I think a couple things happened.

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,480
One, they stretched out the opening

67
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,660
of the new Fantasyland for so long.

68
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,600
People were like, well wait, when is this gonna be done?

69
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,920
So at the time I remember like news sites

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,120
just seemingly just hungry for anything to talk about,

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,480
any new thing to come out of this.

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,520
And then two, reading different blogs from that time period,

73
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,420
it seemed like the snake eating its own tail,

74
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,880
places announcing the tangled bathrooms had opened,

75
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,440
but then more posts coming or tweets coming going like,

76
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,280
why are we all talking about these toilets?

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,040
So it's like a self-fulfilling nightmare.

78
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,160
This is internet discourse in general,

79
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,200
the pro and the anti go back and forth in a maddening way.

80
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Yeah, and I truly like it.

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,960
I found it a little befuddling.

82
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,160
I still kind of find it a little befuddling

83
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,080
because it's like, well, here's the thing.

84
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,720
They needed bathrooms in new fantasy.

85
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,040
You gotta have bathrooms.

86
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
You sure do.

87
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,280
And if they had not themed them,

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,040
they would have gotten dragged for that.

89
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,380
So they did theme them a lot

90
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,420
and then they get made fun of for that.

91
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,640
So I don't know, it seems like a damned if you do,

92
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,620
damned if you don't kind of scenario.

93
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,460
I think it's just funny.

94
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,940
I think like it makes sense.

95
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,980
I think, okay, the way it was presented to me in that text,

96
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,620
hearing that they took the time to develop an entire area

97
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,820
and that it's only bathrooms, that sounds very silly.

98
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
You go, what?

99
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,180
This is like, it's like a weird like zoning mishap.

100
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,620
Like what hap, like was there supposed to be more here?

101
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,380
Was this a mistake on a form?

102
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,540
How did this happen?

103
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,900
But then you start looking into the reality of it

104
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,400
and it seems like this is pretty great.

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,380
It seems like this is a nice chill zone in the park.

106
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,340
If this were my home park, which it is,

107
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,860
and I would probably be talking up

108
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,500
the tangled restroom area as a place to like,

109
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,340
catch a breather.

110
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,820
The bathrooms themselves sound very nice.

111
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,620
People like it theming wise.

112
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,640
I think like it's silly conceptually,

113
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,680
but it seems very pleasant in execution.

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,120
The loop, have you listened to the loop?

115
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,880
There's like a tangled bathroom loop online.

116
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,720
Oh, no I didn't.

117
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,280
Of music, very pleasant.

118
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,700
Not unlike a Napa Rose or something,

119
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,840
but then also with a little tangled, you know.

120
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,560
Just some like acoustic guitar noodling.

121
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
A lot of noodling.

122
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,880
Great, love noodling.

123
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,760
So yeah, it sounds great, honestly.

124
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,960
I don't think, I'm trying to remember when I was there

125
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,400
if I actually used the facilities.

126
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,920
I don't think I used these bathrooms,

127
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,760
but they blended so nicely into the new fantasy land.

128
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,600
I think I just was like,

129
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,320
oh, look at that's a nice little something.

130
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,760
I just didn't even think about it.

131
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,600
Yeah, I think when I was there in 2014,

132
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,440
I did use them, but it didn't occur to me

133
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
until I was leaving.

134
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,480
I was like, oh, this is that thing everyone was roasting.

135
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,400
Like, because I think I was just tired from a long day

136
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,660
or in the middle of a long day,

137
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,640
and I wasn't really like processing at the time.

138
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,880
Well, it sounds like they're just immediately part

139
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,200
of the fabric of the park.

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,280
It seems like they don't stick out at all.

141
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,920
They blend wonderfully with the new fantasy land stuff

142
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,880
in general.

143
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,680
Well, I think, I mean, there's also like a tiny waterfall

144
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,280
and a little stream.

145
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,560
Like, so there's a nice water feature.

146
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,380
There is like-

147
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,360
Which gets you in the mood.

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,200
Gets you in the mood.

149
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,040
To use the facilities.

150
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,420
You know?

151
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,360
But there is Rapunzel's tower too.

152
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,600
And I think that and the castle at Be Our Guest,

153
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,160
the forest perspectives don't work 100% for me.

154
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,120
I would agree with that.

155
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,160
They just look small.

156
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
They look like tiny little things.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
Yeah, so I think that was one of the things

158
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,840
people were kind of like, this is what you,

159
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,960
this is Tangled, this is this tiny little tower.

160
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,760
I think people or fans of Tangled,

161
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,940
I think they were just disappointed

162
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,640
that there wasn't anything.

163
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,960
Cause like Gaston has a tavern,

164
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,640
and if it was Gaston's bathroom

165
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,040
and they were really lovely or like manly, you know,

166
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,160
like Gaston would have.

167
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
Oh, you get cologne and stuff.

168
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,520
Yeah, right.

169
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,880
There's a tendon in there.

170
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,640
Here's what I-

171
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Dressed as like LeFou.

172
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,160
Here's what I know about Tangled.

173
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Tangled is a 2010 American 3D computer animated

174
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,320
musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney

175
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,680
Animation Studio.

176
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,600
I'm just reading the Wikipedia.

177
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
So I-

178
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,280
It sounded very natural.

179
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,320
Yeah, I know that was off the top of your head.

180
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,960
I tend to refer to films by their year in the country

181
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,560
in which they were produced.

182
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,040
Featuring the voice talents of Mandy Moore

183
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,240
and Zachary Levi.

184
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,360
Shazam himself.

185
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,240
Shazam himself.

186
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,520
Everyone's favorite.

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,840
We like him.

188
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,320
The commercials tell us we like him.

189
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,800
Shazam seems like a front.

190
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,960
Like something's wrong.

191
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,920
It seems too cheap to be a movie.

192
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,480
But the critics say they love it.

193
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,320
Really?

194
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,160
That's what's going on now.

195
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,240
Neat, we'll see.

196
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,800
Oh, yeah, wait, if the critics like it,

197
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,640
they've never been wrong.

198
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,360
And also, there can't be anything nefarious

199
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,280
to critics all liking something in mass.

200
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm waiting for a supporting Shazam character,

201
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,160
Talking Tawny, the tiger who walks on two legs

202
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
and wears a three piece suit.

203
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,720
I love Talking Tawny.

204
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,080
I feel like we're not gonna get that anytime soon.

205
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,160
Maybe, eventually.

206
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Maybe.

207
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,080
We don't have the technology.

208
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,720
You need the life of Pi people to do it right.

209
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,840
I like Tangled 5.

210
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,600
I remember watching it years ago when it was on Netflix.

211
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,320
Some people say Tangled superior to Frozen.

212
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,160
Maybe.

213
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,440
I think that's the opinion I've seen a lot of.

214
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,720
Maybe even a Tony Baxter I've heard say that.

215
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,560
Does that make sense?

216
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,520
Interesting.

217
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,360
I think I kind of, as I watched it,

218
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,920
was making fun of it a little

219
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,200
because all the marketing materials of it,

220
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,720
all the characters are kind of doing DreamWorks face,

221
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,600
that sort of smug smirk.

222
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,920
Oh, that little like to the side folded arm.

223
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Yeah, that was a real disease for a while.

224
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,040
Yeah.

225
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,600
It infected all the companies.

226
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,440
Right.

227
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,080
But I think, I do, I think what we were saying

228
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,720
was just like that I think that's the reason

229
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,960
that it was controversial, not because it's bad,

230
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,560
because people wanted like a real experience out of Tangled,

231
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,480
not just to be able to shit in the Tangled universe.

232
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,520
Like that's really what we're getting at here is that

233
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,640
they didn't get on a dark ride,

234
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,200
but they do get to shit in universe,

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,440
which is not as fun.

236
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,000
If it was a property that nobody cared about,

237
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,560
if it was the fox and the hound bathrooms,

238
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,760
you wouldn't have a problem with it.

239
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,720
Or there's little bathrooms up by the Fantasyland Theater,

240
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,520
the former Videopolis,

241
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,080
which are just themes to general storybook, right?

242
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,240
And nobody's making fun of like, what is this?

243
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
It doesn't even have a theme.

244
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,760
Right.

245
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,000
I think it's to make the decision

246
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,800
to specifically build this new little hut

247
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,760
for a property that people are excited about

248
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,360
and probably would like a more, you know,

249
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,160
ornate experience for.

250
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,440
That being said, there is the little like hunt for kids.

251
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,280
That seems fun.

252
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,120
Oh, Pascal.

253
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,960
Oh yeah, yes.

254
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,680
You find little Pascals,

255
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,960
who is like a little lizard guy from the movies.

256
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,600
He's a fun, he is cute.

257
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
He's a fun little lizard.

258
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,200
I did not, as I watched the movie,

259
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,760
I remember not learning his name.

260
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,080
So I just kept calling him Roy Lizard

261
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,360
because I was like, I don't,

262
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,240
what is this fucking character's name?

263
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,840
I was like driving me crazy.

264
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,160
I like Roy Lizard.

265
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Yeah, I like it.

266
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,000
I like it too.

267
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,520
And I like the little Roy Lizard,

268
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,560
I find the hidden Roy Lizard or his friends, you know,

269
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,760
in the stream and around the toilet building.

270
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,520
There's gonna, he'll be replaced by Rango soon.

271
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,720
Oh no, is that Fox?

272
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,560
Am I wrong?

273
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,400
Is Rango Fox or is it a different studio?

274
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,600
I think Rango might be Fox.

275
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,440
Good question.

276
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,960
Was Rango gonna be part of Fox Studios Malaysia

277
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,640
run by the Mercurial chairman?

278
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,280
Yeah, it was a Rango land.

279
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,120
Yeah, which is now just sitting vacant.

280
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,120
And now they'll have to make it a ride for a generic lizard.

281
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
And that's where Roy Lizard might fit the bill perfectly.

282
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,240
No one owns the IP Roy Lizard except for us.

283
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,280
So we better like get a copyright on that right now

284
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,400
before that Mercurial chairman tries to yank it from us.

285
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,720
Bad news, Rango was released by Paramount.

286
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
Shit, damn, there's never gonna be Rango.

287
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,000
There is no empty space waiting for a Roy Lizard ride.

288
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
Fuck.

289
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,660
Too bad, sorry.

290
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,800
We blew the whole thing.

291
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,640
Can I ask a quick question?

292
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,400
What Disney movie universe would you guys

293
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,040
wanna take a shit in?

294
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,000
Is there one off the top of your head?

295
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,840
Cause I was thinking, I mean,

296
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,960
Beauty and the Beast seems too horrifying, the reality.

297
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,360
Cause the toilets would have to talk to you.

298
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,800
Even the castle, but back in town.

299
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay, fine, yeah, you're right, fine.

300
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,720
In that town, they're not alive.

301
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Yeah, and I bet whoever like operates the bath,

302
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,880
whoever like owns and operates the bathroom

303
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,360
in the town square is very nice.

304
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,160
And would like give a hearty hello.

305
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,720
Hello, Belle, nice and clean for you.

306
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,520
Go ahead, take a load off.

307
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,400
I'm going to go ahead and say Big Hero 6.

308
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,880
Oh, San Francisco.

309
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,760
San Francisco is a combination of San Francisco and Tokyo.

310
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,080
So they may very well have nice Japanese future toilets.

311
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,200
And there'll be Toto toilets.

312
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,040
What's that?

313
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,880
There'll be Toto toilets.

314
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,720
Is that the brand?

315
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,280
That's the brand, they make the style here,

316
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,680
but they're bidet.

317
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,000
Scott, you're going to Tokyo soon and you will learn

318
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,560
that most of the toilets will shoot water in your ass.

319
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,400
Really?

320
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,240
Yep.

321
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,080
Do they do it whether I want it to or not?

322
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,640
No, I think you have to hit the button.

323
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,960
I think there's a remote on the floor.

324
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,080
Request for that?

325
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,520
For sure, I'm just trying to remember

326
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,440
if any of them did it involuntarily.

327
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,920
You know, I've never bidet,

328
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,480
so maybe now's the time to start.

329
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,080
Well, you're going to have a hotel room

330
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,200
and that would be the time,

331
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,240
the privacy of that is the time to try it.

332
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
I will say that.

333
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,680
In case I go, yeah, ouch.

334
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,400
I don't, nobody else hears me.

335
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,440
I don't like make everyone stop eating in the restaurant.

336
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,000
You don't bring disgrace to yourself in the country.

337
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,320
I will be removed from the,

338
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,400
there is nothing polite about yelling, ouch.

339
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,240
Yeah.

340
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,880
I would say seven dwarves.

341
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,000
I want to see what they were doing in the hut and stuff.

342
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I want to see like, I like the old timey,

343
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,800
like artisan woodwork.

344
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,240
And I think you could have a fun little bathroom

345
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,320
and then you could have all the dwarves names on the stall.

346
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,720
I guess now that I'm thinking about it,

347
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,760
the dwarves are tiny and they'd have to be scaled properly,

348
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,920
but it'd still be fun to go into the dopey stall

349
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,760
is what I'm saying.

350
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,960
Maybe, but life in the past was hell.

351
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,280
And I can only assume going to the bathroom back then

352
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,400
was a nightmare.

353
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,760
So you're saying it might've been,

354
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
if they were being accurate,

355
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,440
it would be a hole in the ground in the bathroom.

356
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,080
Probably, maybe a little bench or something.

357
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,720
Yeah, that's eliminating a lot for me.

358
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,840
Like, yeah, Aladdin, I don't want to do,

359
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
that's probably not.

360
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,560
But what if anything were in the cave of wonders?

361
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,960
Cause he's got, there's gotta be a crazy type bathroom

362
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,800
in there.

363
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,080
Yeah, and you take a shit and it just like,

364
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,360
kind of swirls into like blue magic.

365
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,200
Right.

366
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,280
And just kind of dissipates into the air.

367
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
Yeah.

368
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,920
Who dares shit in the cave of wonders?

369
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,920
It wasn't explicitly a rule that I was aware of.

370
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,120
I mean, I got to shit somewhere.

371
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,920
Where's that?

372
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,800
The diamond in the rough may shit in my mouth.

373
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,120
Take anything you want,

374
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,520
as long as you give me a little something.

375
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,960
Take the lamp, go for it, I don't care.

376
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,880
What's one that I want to, well, I, you know,

377
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,360
probably this isn't unpleasant.

378
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,480
This is not a place that I've ever wanted to be.

379
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
The Wally ship, because it's, you know,

380
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,600
it's portrayed as an unpleasant place

381
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,040
and like the ultimate cruise ship.

382
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,560
And cruise ships, as we know,

383
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,400
can have tremendous sewage problems.

384
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,160
So I don't really, and not that I don't really

385
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,760
want to be there, but I have to assume

386
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,080
for the lack of mobility of all of those people

387
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,040
on the floating chairs, the floating chairs

388
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,640
are probably toilets, correct?

389
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,480
Oh, 100%.

390
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,160
I think I said it on Screen Junkies movie fights once

391
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,360
that they're shitting in those chairs.

392
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,400
Oh, okay, you've made this observation before.

393
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,080
Yeah, they have to be.

394
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,720
And then probably some little like,

395
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,800
little sweep up robot comes and cleans you off

396
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,120
when all's said and done.

397
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,800
The problem is it's possible that the chair technology

398
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,160
in Wally is that you're like constantly catheterized.

399
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,000
Ooh.

400
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,760
That's probably what it's like.

401
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,200
It's probably, and I don't know if there's a,

402
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,520
what you would call, I guess it's a colostomy bag

403
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,080
on the other side, right?

404
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,880
Like how would, what's the catheter version of number two?

405
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,960
No, I don't want to be too gross here.

406
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,240
We're thankfully, we're all healthy enough

407
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,440
to not have to know this, thank God.

408
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,040
I'm just saying it might just be tubes, two tubes.

409
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,920
Unless they just, they're just on bedpans at all times.

410
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,440
Like none of, we don't know what's going on on those seats.

411
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,280
Yeah.

412
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,640
They might just be like open and naked kind of.

413
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,480
Yeah.

414
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,160
So everyone's pants have a hole in the bottom.

415
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,400
That's basically what's going on in those chairs.

416
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,400
All of those Wally people are just,

417
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,560
those onesies just have a little,

418
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,760
well, like the onesies that, you know,

419
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,280
like the kids in Peter Pan were like

420
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,200
with a little like flap, you know.

421
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,040
Yeah.

422
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,760
It's that kind of, and probably maybe when,

423
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,440
maybe like the chair senses that you're getting ready

424
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,560
and then comes and like unbuckles,

425
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,600
like a little robot unbuckles the little buttons.

426
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,480
Okay.

427
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,560
That's a really adorable way to do it.

428
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,080
I was thinking of the true, I think,

429
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,520
future nightmare scenario where you're just hooked up

430
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,400
to two tubes and everything just comes out

431
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,160
whether you realize it or not.

432
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,120
But you have like a little whimsical robot being like,

433
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,160
it's time to go.

434
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,120
I think it's in keeping with the rest of Wally.

435
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,960
Yeah.

436
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,880
It's one of those little misfits who ends up, you know,

437
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,760
rebelling when Wally shows up.

438
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,600
Yeah.

439
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,000
And understandably, because if your job is to unbutton

440
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,800
people's onesie flaps.

441
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,480
I mean, we are led to believe people have been on that ship

442
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,720
for generations.

443
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,840
So the full circle of life, you know, birth, death,

444
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,200
lovemaking, shitting, everything's happening on that ship.

445
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,040
In those chairs.

446
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,320
In those chairs, yeah.

447
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,160
Right.

448
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
I think they've all gotten accustomed

449
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,160
to whatever the system is.

450
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,560
So, whereas we might think a bunch of bizarre tubes

451
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,440
hooked up to us at all times,

452
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,480
as we like are out in the world and talking to people.

453
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,320
Right.

454
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,200
That's bad for us, but these are like,

455
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,400
there's been 300 years of this by the time we see Wally.

456
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,080
So to use those Wally bathrooms in a theme park,

457
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,080
you would have to be wearing child one piece underwear,

458
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,680
or a one piece going to bed with the butt flap.

459
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,520
You'd have to.

460
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,360
I guess so.

461
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,200
That's a problem, I think.

462
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,040
Yeah.

463
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,880
Logistical problem.

464
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,240
Way too much potential for sick fucks

465
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
to take advantage of that option.

466
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,080
Yeah.

467
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Indulgence, it's in their general weird perversion.

468
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,600
So maybe the technology isn't just not there yet.

469
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,440
I guess not.

470
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,880
In theme park land.

471
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,240
Though that, maybe, okay,

472
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,640
I'll subtract the, or it's an option.

473
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,720
They can do this or not.

474
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,560
They can, it can be,

475
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,840
the ride can have waste options or not.

476
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,040
But if the Wally chairs were what went

477
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,680
on the people mover track,

478
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,600
if that's how they ended up using it,

479
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,800
if you just were like, and then like, you know,

480
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,240
Wally breaks you out of it,

481
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,720
and then you get freed at the end.

482
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,560
Sure.

483
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,080
But it would really be the full experience,

484
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,080
if it was that ride and you could take a dump on it too.

485
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,880
When will we have a ride that we can take a dump on?

486
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,800
Well, I'm gonna propose just the house from inside out

487
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,880
that the family lives in

488
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,280
because it was present day and regular.

489
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,640
So the bathrooms are just bathrooms.

490
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
And there's probably only one in there.

491
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,480
Yeah, they moved to San Francisco.

492
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,160
If it's like a townhouse, maybe they might have to share one.

493
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah.

494
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,120
I think you go to San Francisco,

495
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,680
you're lucky to have a bathroom in your house.

496
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,520
Sure.

497
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,360
I think it's the one.

498
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't remember what they had, presumably the one.

499
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,720
The only other thing is, cause I like old timey stuff,

500
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,440
you know, let's get an Apple dumpling gang bathroom.

501
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,200
Which I guess is now I think that I'm thinking about it,

502
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,640
another hole in the ground.

503
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,880
I'm assuming. Yeah.

504
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,440
I just want to shit in a hole in the ground

505
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,280
is what I'm saying.

506
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,120
I guess if I think.

507
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,640
I mean, you don't have to go to a theme park to do that.

508
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,440
Yeah, you might just want to go to a national park.

509
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,880
You might want to go backpacking.

510
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
All right.

511
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,720
You dig a hole, you have a shovel, you dig a hole.

512
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,480
Are there rides there at a national park?

513
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,000
Just the majestic splendor of nature.

514
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
I say as they make that jerk off.

515
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,920
I saw it on the Disneyland railroad.

516
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,360
I don't need to go there.

517
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,200
Yeah.

518
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,040
I saw the

519
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,320
condensed version of the,

520
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,720
and if you go to the green Kenyan,

521
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,120
you don't get to see it in the past.

522
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,960
Right.

523
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
No dinosaurs.

524
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,640
No fucking dinosaurs there.

525
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,480
Yep. Yep.

526
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,440
Boring.

527
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,920
So to bring us back to the Tangle Toilets

528
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,440
and just to contextualize it for people

529
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
who have not been to the magic kingdom recently.

530
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,640
So when this Tomorrowland, not Tomorrowland,

531
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Fantasyland expansion was happening,

532
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,480
so Mickey's Toontown Fair closes,

533
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,360
Snow White Scary Adventure closes,

534
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,720
and what you get out of it is the Little Mermaid ride,

535
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,480
the very detailed robust queue,

536
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,640
Be Our Guest restaurant, and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train.

537
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,320
So kind of big attractions and a big restaurant and all.

538
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,240
So in that context,

539
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,440
yeah, it is funny that Tangled got the bathrooms.

540
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,760
Yeah, the ball, the famous ballroom from Beauty and the Beast

541
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,520
is now a place that you can go.

542
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,360
Yes.

543
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,000
You can go under the sea with Ariel.

544
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,520
You can go into the Seven Dwarfs Mine

545
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,520
and you could go into where the Tangled characters live and pee.

546
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,560
Yeah, but Tangled was only a few years old at that point, so.

547
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,080
Maybe they didn't know that the love was gonna grow

548
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,040
and that they maybe owe something more.

549
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,880
Yeah.

550
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,720
Is there a seek,

551
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,880
I know there's like a series, a TV series,

552
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,520
but I feel like there's a Tangled sequel in the works,

553
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,040
but the Frozen sequel will probably be out before it.

554
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,080
For sure, yeah.

555
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,360
That's like next year or the end of this year, perhaps?

556
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,320
Is it the end of this year?

557
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
It might be, I think.

558
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
What do you think they could have done,

559
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,000
what could they have done besides bathrooms

560
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,360
to make Tangled fans happy in the lack of a ride,

561
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,840
since that's a high bar?

562
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,920
Is there a meet and greet right there?

563
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,760
Doesn't that seem like it?

564
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,600
Yeah, I don't think so.

565
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,440
Like that seems like an easy one,

566
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,360
like just put the meet and greet there,

567
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,880
and at least it's like, oh, you can meet them,

568
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,120
and also there's a nice bathroom next to it.

569
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,600
I think the meet and greets have all been shifted to the,

570
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,080
because they doubled the princess fairy tale.

571
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,360
So those are all over there.

572
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,200
Yeah.

573
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,520
But then Gaston's thing is by his tavern,

574
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,320
his meet and greet, because he's not a princess, I guess.

575
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,600
Is there something, why isn't there hair hanging down,

576
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,360
and you can like tug on the hair?

577
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,800
I guess that's not good to do to Rapunzel.

578
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,760
Well, because the other thing is like,

579
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,760
where does this exist in the context of the movie?

580
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,800
Because spoiler alert, she gets out of the tower

581
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,480
pretty quick into the movie.

582
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,440
It actually ends the movie with a very short pixie cut.

583
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,080
But she does like the lanterns from,

584
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,240
there's a big lantern sequence in the movie,

585
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,480
and like the paint, and she paints,

586
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,600
and everything's like very lushly painted,

587
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,320
the pink and orange accents on every,

588
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,040
or pink and purple kind of, everything looks very nice.

589
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,640
It is aesthetically pleasing.

590
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,680
It's very much like the, what is it called?

591
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,280
The fantasy fair out here in Anaheim next to the castle.

592
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,720
It's kind of a cousin to that.

593
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,400
And there are the same like wanted posters

594
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,040
for the characters at Flynn.

595
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,880
Flynn Rider.

596
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,560
Flynn Rider.

597
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,400
And there's a lot of goons.

598
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,800
There's not a lot of characters in this movie.

599
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,040
Although, Paul F. Tompkins is one of the voices

600
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,920
of one of the characters.

601
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,760
Is he really?

602
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,600
He's entangled?

603
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,440
Yeah.

604
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,280
He's entangled a little bit.

605
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,120
Yeah.

606
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,280
Oh, that's fun.

607
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,560
Not represented on one of these posters?

608
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,240
Oh, I can't remember.

609
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,520
I saw some of the posters.

610
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,120
I don't, he's kind of like a little goofy,

611
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,640
drunk kind of goon.

612
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,480
That's fun.

613
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,320
Yeah.

614
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,520
They just needed to make like a drink,

615
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,360
like a drink and pretzel stand next to it.

616
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,320
It just needed some little thing, I think, to not.

617
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,200
Pretzels that are in a braid, like.

618
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,040
Oh.

619
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,880
Oh yeah.

620
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,720
Wow.

621
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,400
Really good food and beverage opportunity for them.

622
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,280
And you can only get them right there.

623
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,120
That's an acceptable way for pretzels to be.

624
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,560
It can just be the more Reese's treats like we have,

625
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,880
but you stick the.

626
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,840
I was gonna say also, other than pretzels,

627
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,920
it could just be a bunch of pasta, long pasta,

628
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,000
like her hair.

629
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,840
Oh, you know what I mean?

630
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,440
A braided pasta, and you just eat like loose pasta maybe.

631
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,720
That's the next trend.

632
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,560
Sure.

633
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,440
If it's okay, well, they've established with the cone zone

634
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,840
in radiator springs.

635
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,680
Yeah, right.

636
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,560
A district devoted to a shape of food.

637
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,760
So just anything long and braided goes into this zone.

638
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,040
Angel hair.

639
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,320
Angel hair pasta.

640
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,160
Yeah. Perfect.

641
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,000
Yeah.

642
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,320
Yeah, they like wrap it up for you in a little,

643
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,960
do you eat it long?

644
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Do they give you like a big long tray that you,

645
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,960
like a big hot dog container, like a paper plate, but.

646
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah.

647
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,680
They would have to, I don't know,

648
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,600
that would be too hard if it's a quick service.

649
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,440
Yeah.

650
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,280
Just stick it in the bread cone.

651
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,000
You just stick a bunch of pasta in the bread cone.

652
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,640
I think maybe it's just you hand them a loo,

653
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,360
it just dangles, and that's the fun thing.

654
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,200
And you like, there's a bunch of photo ops of like,

655
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,440
you trying to eat the thing, like the hair from the bottom.

656
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Or like the long candy, like the thin rope.

657
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,320
Like nerd's rope.

658
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,160
Yeah.

659
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,720
Oh yeah, for sure.

660
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,440
This is all, I think that's all it,

661
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,800
you make it, it's a food area and also restrooms.

662
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,640
Yeah.

663
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,360
The fact that all it is is that it was begging

664
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,120
to be made fun of.

665
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,120
However, this place also celebrated seemingly.

666
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,120
Mom blogs love the tangled bathrooms.

667
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,760
There's a lot of lists of the best bathrooms

668
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,680
in Disney World or in the Disney parks,

669
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,520
which I imagine as an area we'll get into at some point,

670
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,120
but the tangled bathrooms immediately on there.

671
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,120
And when I looked up tangled bathrooms on Twitter,

672
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,480
there was a tweet from two months ago as we record this,

673
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,560
from Rachel Zegler, who is the actress who is playing Maria

674
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,440
in Spielberg's West Side Story coming up.

675
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,760
A like soon to be very prominent star

676
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,240
with a lot of followers in anticipation of that.

677
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,600
And she tweeted, thinking about the tangled bathrooms

678
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,360
in fantasy land and then five emojis with kind of that,

679
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,680
like warm and cozy smile and hearts all over the face.

680
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,520
Wow.

681
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,320
And that has 1300 likes.

682
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,960
So like a lot of love.

683
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,800
Yeah.

684
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
From an up and coming star on the tangled bathroom.

685
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,640
Wow.

686
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,960
Somebody right under that, like somebody said,

687
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,720
I'd like to get married in the tangled restrooms.

688
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,560
That was a tweet from like yesterday.

689
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,400
Lot of love.

690
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,440
Yeah, I think this actually is an oddly beloved little area.

691
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,640
They do look very nice in the actual,

692
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,120
the stall doors are very,

693
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,920
they're like, look like a castle doors and stuff.

694
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,560
And the ceilings are painted.

695
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,920
They look like wood and they have hinges.

696
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,280
And like all good Orlando restrooms,

697
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,240
from what I remember blasting cold air at you,

698
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,520
a brief respite from the heat.

699
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,600
Great, good.

700
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
It sounds awesome.

701
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,720
There's pans all over the wall,

702
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,080
which is, I haven't seen the movie.

703
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,920
There's a thing with pan, she hits people with pans.

704
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,600
Cast iron pans are like a weapon in the movie.

705
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,440
Okay.

706
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,280
That she's constantly hitting.

707
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
People are constantly getting hit with.

708
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,120
I see, okay.

709
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,360
So that's a nod.

710
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,120
There's a lot of nods to the,

711
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,200
like if you know the movie,

712
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,560
there is a lot of like weird little, here's his armor.

713
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,840
Maximus the horse has like a horseshoe imprint

714
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,680
in the ground.

715
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,520
Oh.

716
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,240
He's the sassy, kind of like,

717
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,360
were there two silly animals in Frozen or just the moose?

718
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,200
I forget.

719
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,960
There's two silly, Maximus and Pascal

720
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,360
get into a lot of mischief in this movie.

721
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,640
Okay, okay.

722
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,480
And they mug a lot.

723
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,000
He sort of feel their presence.

724
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,840
I think that's, it's getting,

725
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,040
when the hidden Pascals are getting close to something,

726
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,360
but it's not as robust as the Sleeping Beauty dioramas.

727
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,560
If they had something like that too,

728
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,400
like in the windows.

729
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,240
Oh yeah, yeah.

730
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,080
Oh yeah.

731
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,240
To read the story of Tangle.

732
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,080
That's a little more something.

733
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,960
Or like Figaro the Cat,

734
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,440
like squatting at the birdcage at Fantasy Fair.

735
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,280
That's great.

736
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,560
I make a point of taking people through there

737
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,000
because they might've missed that.

738
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,880
It's an outdoor animatronic.

739
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,080
That's pretty neat.

740
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,920
Yeah, yeah.

741
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,320
Easy to overlook.

742
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,160
Yeah, it's not as good as that,

743
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,680
but it does seem like it might be slightly better

744
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,760
than the theming of Pizzeria Rizzo.

745
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,600
Just slightly.

746
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,420
Wow.

747
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,260
Just slightly.

748
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,400
You're just stirring up the pot.

749
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,920
No, I'm just saying, I'm not stirring anything up.

750
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,000
I think we gotta keep it warm

751
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,040
until we all can go make a judgment call.

752
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,880
Yeah.

753
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,040
I'm just saying it seems like it's like slightly,

754
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,200
like there's a few more touches

755
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,480
and it feels like more money went into it.

756
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
That's all I'm saying.

757
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,240
I'm wondering if I could just combine

758
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,920
that if I can just get a to-go order from Mama Melrose,

759
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,520
a restaurant I like a lot, and eat it in Pizzeria Rizzo.

760
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,240
I think that upstairs Pizzeria Rizzo room.

761
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,080
Sure.

762
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,000
Oh, kinda combine, then you get the theming.

763
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,260
Combine, yeah, I can get like a wood-fired pizza

764
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,480
as opposed to just like a Red Baron pizza at Pizzeria Rizzo.

765
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,320
What a bizarre scenario that Disney created

766
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,900
their own Burger King McDonald's feud.

767
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,600
Like the same type of food.

768
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,160
Oh, yeah, and also.

769
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,320
One little, in the same little district of a theme park.

770
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,000
And at a time when one of the emerging

771
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,160
fast casual trends is fast fire, flash fire,

772
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,400
whatever you wanna call it, pizza,

773
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,720
like you know, like Chipotle, go down the line,

774
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,400
design your own pizza, cooks in a minute and a half.

775
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,880
How do you not just do that?

776
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,600
How do you not just make that?

777
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,520
Maybe they think it takes too long or something or.

778
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,360
Mm-hmm.

779
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,640
I guess that's not how the rats would do it.

780
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,480
I guess.

781
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,140
They like old-fashioned.

782
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,120
Yeah.

783
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,240
New York pizza, except not nearly as good

784
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
as New York pizza.

785
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,080
That's what I've been told.

786
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,320
Already, but then.

787
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,160
You didn't eat.

788
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,000
Very pretty.

789
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,820
I hadn't eaten there, yeah.

790
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,660
This one's looming.

791
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,440
We have to go actually experience it.

792
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,920
So the other, when Dennis texted me about this,

793
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,840
he gave a little background as to why

794
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,600
he believes that it happened.

795
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,820
Which is that the tangled restrooms were built

796
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,760
in the site of the Skyway terminal in Fantasyland.

797
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,600
Yes.

798
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,880
Which in both the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland,

799
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,280
those Skyway situations have not been solved.

800
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
Isn't it just still there in Disneyland?

801
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,320
Didn't they remove it in Disneyland finally?

802
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,160
Maybe they have.

803
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,000
I think they finally did.

804
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,840
Yeah, like in the last year or two.

805
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,160
And I think, was it this that finally destroyed?

806
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,920
They finally bulldozed to build this?

807
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,760
I mean, yeah.

808
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,600
Yeah, for sure.

809
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,440
Yeah, it's gone because of Magic Kingdom.

810
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,540
Yeah, in Magic Kingdom, it's gone because of this.

811
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,080
That was a little more like,

812
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,520
I think the Disneyland ones up in the hills

813
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,960
and it's easy to miss.

814
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,920
So it wasn't really bothering everybody, anybody,

815
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,200
but this was kind of a bigger station

816
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,640
that was just sitting unoccupied for over a decade,

817
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,240
waiting for something to happen to it.

818
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,800
Meanwhile, there were restrooms

819
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,980
in this area of Fantasyland,

820
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,120
but they got rid of the bathrooms

821
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,920
because they were right next to Peter Pan's flight

822
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,800
and they got rid of those bathrooms

823
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,000
so that they could build a longer interactive queue

824
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,080
for Peter Pan.

825
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,920
Yeah.

826
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Which I didn't know about and I've watched some video of.

827
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,440
I don't know if you guys have experienced it in person.

828
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,440
It seems great.

829
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,200
It's like, because the Peter Pan line in Disneyland

830
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,240
is very boring.

831
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,180
You just go back and forth and nothing happens.

832
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,980
Now there's this whole indoor room.

833
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,980
It's like the nursery and your shadow interacts with,

834
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,200
with Tinkerbell and you end up with Captain Hook's hat on

835
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,560
and magic is happening to your shadow.

836
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,840
I did this in Florida

837
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,800
and I don't know what you're talking about.

838
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,720
Wait, what?

839
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,120
I did that line in Florida or maybe I had a FastPass.

840
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,640
Maybe I skipped it.

841
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,640
That's what must have happened.

842
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

843
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,320
Well that was probably what happened.

844
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,160
That's probably what happened.

845
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm not making up some lines.

846
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,840
No, no, I wasn't accusing you of making it up.

847
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,880
They could have also like yanked some of that stuff

848
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,320
because the Haunted Mansion had interactive stuff in it

849
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,440
in that queue in Florida and they started yanking it.

850
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,580
I think now that I'm thinking about it,

851
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,040
I must have had a FastPass and skipped that fun stuff.

852
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,760
Dennis said that it is very easy to miss.

853
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,920
Like it's barely labeled and if you had a FastPass,

854
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,220
you wouldn't even go anywhere near it.

855
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,060
Interesting.

856
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,900
You go down a big hallway

857
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,440
before you even get to the cool stuff

858
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,080
and apparently it's made it such that it might be worthwhile

859
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,120
to even just sit through the Peter Pan line.

860
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,960
We had to do that too.

861
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,520
That stuff was very cool.

862
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,820
So this whole rearranging of bathrooms

863
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,600
did lead to immersive theming in several ways.

864
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,280
This new line is part of it.

865
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,440
They got rid of just an alpine lodge

866
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,280
that was sitting empty for over a decade

867
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,720
and now there's hidden pascals and lanterns and all that.

868
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,080
So I think this beautification project has been good.

869
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,200
Just it kind of hinges on some inherent silliness

870
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,520
of a property that people like only having bathrooms.

871
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,840
But I'm sure nowadays, back in the day,

872
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,920
they couldn't have done a much smaller scale version of this

873
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,360
but they focused tests, everything.

874
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,600
Do people like this?

875
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,080
Do they like it buy on DVD level?

876
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,160
Do they like it want a ride level?

877
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,360
Do they like it want a sequel level?

878
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,200
Oh sure.

879
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,720
And so it could have been that

880
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,920
they want tangled but we don't have enough fanfare

881
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,000
to immediately fast track a ride

882
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,160
in the way that they fast track the Frozen in Epcot.

883
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh sure.

884
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,720
The results haven't been strong enough to justify

885
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
let's get something in ASAP.

886
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,520
I think it also takes time for something

887
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,880
to set in as a fan favorite.

888
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,560
They turn the Aladdin show into Frozen so quickly

889
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,720
in California Adventure and I feel like

890
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,440
it's less positively received than Aladdin

891
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,440
which is a couple decades old at this point

892
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,040
but that means there's a couple generations of people

893
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,880
who like Aladdin.

894
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,120
Yeah I think that Frozen was just such a smash

895
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,240
that they were like we need stuff in the park now.

896
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,400
We have to fast track everything.

897
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,640
You caught them off guard.

898
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,440
Maybe the biggest way since under doing

899
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Toy Story merchandise in the 90s.

900
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,240
They were not prepared for the insane popularity

901
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,840
of the movie and song.

902
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,480
I like that now they're getting into

903
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,240
all right there will be like committed Frozen experiences

904
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
instead of just like jamming every corner

905
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,080
with some sing along or whatever.

906
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,440
Right and then eventually we'll get

907
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,400
Arendelle in Disneyland maybe.

908
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,240
Maybe.

909
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,080
That's the rumor still.

910
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,920
Oh no.

911
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,760
And then we'll have to rerun the fake rock.

912
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,200
Oh yeah that's true.

913
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,680
Yeah that's potentially a strong

914
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,840
or maybe when we get into Star Wars land

915
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,600
those rocks are gonna blow us away

916
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,360
and we'll realize we were wrong all along.

917
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,720
Yeah.

918
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,480
That may have to be revisited.

919
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Tangled bathrooms strong contender in bathroom final four.

920
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,680
Tangled may also have been like the bridge movie

921
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,960
from like the chicken little era of like Disney

922
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,440
trying to do 3D animated movies

923
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,720
but not quite succeeding in the way that Pixar

924
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,560
even Dreamworks was.

925
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,280
And then when they started.

926
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,520
Bolt.

927
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,960
Yeah Bolt another one.

928
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,400
And then you see like Frozen and Big Hero 6

929
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,200
and like what are the other Disney.

930
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,040
Oh Zootopia.

931
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,800
Oh Zootopia yeah like much more.

932
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,640
And of course.

933
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,280
Like clear phenomena like I never heard a bad thing

934
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,000
about Bolt's Chicken Little maybe more so

935
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,720
but they were not phenomenons.

936
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,200
They've only in the last decade have started to have

937
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,080
truly mega popular CGI.

938
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,160
They point to like oh they started running Disney animation

939
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,040
a little more like Pixar is run

940
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,240
which ironically was a little more like

941
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,200
the original Disney animation was run.

942
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,040
So I mean that could be affecting.

943
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,280
Tangled may have been the early adopter almost

944
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,320
in this trend.

945
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,160
Yeah.

946
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,280
Well you know since we've I wanna keep up the pattern

947
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,240
of that we do some game or bullshit

948
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,680
in these C ticket episodes.

949
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,680
So I'd like to find out more about your guys preferences

950
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,200
when it comes to restroom experiences

951
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,560
in a segment that I call everybody has a crappen place.

952
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,280
Whoa.

953
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,880
Here's what I'm gonna drive out here.

954
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,040
I do think at some point we need to cover

955
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,360
Disneyland bathrooms.

956
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,160
I think that's a whole big area.

957
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,080
We have a lot to say about it.

958
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,600
So I don't wanna do any of that yet even though like

959
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,480
there's I'm sure we could all talk about quality

960
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,440
restroom experiences in the parks.

961
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,720
Well and bathroom breaking bathroom news for the other day

962
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,120
as we were talking about this episode.

963
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,280
Oh right what was that?

964
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,880
So in the news story on the Inside Universal website

965
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,280
Islands of Adventure is now going to have like

966
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,000
themed scents sprayed in the bathrooms

967
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,240
which I'm sure the air freshener spritzing things

968
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,480
were already there.

969
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,440
They're just making an effort to like

970
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,400
we're gonna more thoughtfully order from the catalog.

971
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,440
It's not just gonna be generic.

972
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,760
Will you smell like in the Kong Skull Island

973
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,040
will be banana breath in the restroom.

974
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,880
It could be.

975
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,200
And this is of course a park that also has

976
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,720
a much maligned bathrooms.

977
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,200
The Namor the Sub Mariner bathrooms in Marvel.

978
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,520
You call them Namor?

979
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,360
Did I say Namor?

980
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,760
Yeah.

981
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,480
Yeah Namor and Amor I've heard both.

982
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,440
He's like swimming through water

983
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,120
and under it says restrooms.

984
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,960
What character is this?

985
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,840
This is Namor the Sub Mariner

986
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,640
sort of Marvel's version of Aquaman.

987
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,480
Okay.

988
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,320
King of the deep.

989
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,140
He's like angrier though.

990
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,980
He's angry.

991
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,440
And they theme bathrooms after him?

992
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,280
Yeah.

993
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,080
So like is there are you when you dispose of your waste

994
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,920
does it end up is he in your waste?

995
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,760
Is he swimming through it?

996
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,600
Is he under the bath?

997
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,280
He points at it as it goes by.

998
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Look.

999
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,120
There it goes.

1000
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,960
He's angry too.

1001
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,480
He's like really mad.

1002
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,320
That's one of his character things.

1003
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,140
The surface dwellers.

1004
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,980
He's a real dick.

1005
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,820
Yeah.

1006
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,280
He's one of the first Marvel superheroes.

1007
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,720
Anyway, keep a nose out for those islands

1008
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,000
who adventure toilets.

1009
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,860
Well maybe senses would be something in this category

1010
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,720
that would make you like a bathroom.

1011
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,320
And here's what I'm gonna do.

1012
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,240
I'm gonna eliminate theme park restrooms

1013
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,440
and I'm gonna eliminate where you live.

1014
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,860
Your own personal dwelling bathrooms.

1015
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,860
Do you guys offhand have a bathroom or type of bathroom

1016
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,360
of which you are the most fond?

1017
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,820
You mean in this not here

1018
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,380
or you mean when I'm out in the world?

1019
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,220
Yes.

1020
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,140
Whether it be from your hometown or from your childhood

1021
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,140
or here in your adult life in Los Angeles

1022
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,580
or even if it's just like this type of place

1023
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,260
I like the bathrooms.

1024
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,900
Yeah. I got number one with a bullet hotel lobbies.

1025
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,740
Yeah.

1026
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,340
That's exactly where I'm going.

1027
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,420
We may have talked about this before.

1028
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,620
Yeah.

1029
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,620
Yeah because you get the like the cleanliness

1030
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,260
that you would get in the rooms

1031
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,860
without having to pay for a room.

1032
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,900
It's like they are sparkling, they are spacious

1033
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,860
and they're never mobbed.

1034
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,540
And I like to get writing done in hotels and hotel lobbies.

1035
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:37,540
And should the task come up while you're in a hotel

1036
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,460
Yeah. Great place to do it.

1037
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,300
You can take your time.

1038
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,900
You're in no rush to get out of there.

1039
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,780
I have another very specific one.

1040
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,260
So like upscale non-chain cafes

1041
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,780
or it can be a chain, but not like a Starbucks.

1042
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,660
So like here in LA, there's,

1043
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,320
I guess they're technically a chain, but they're different.

1044
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,640
There's the Aroma Cafe in one part of town.

1045
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,020
Then there's the Alcove.

1046
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,420
That's sort of like a place where you're gonna pay

1047
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,820
for an $18 sandwich tends to have very nice restrooms.

1048
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,460
Yes, I know the Aroma one.

1049
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1050
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,340
That's very spacious.

1051
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,540
The Alcove is just like a one toilet bathroom.

1052
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,340
They're just two big rooms.

1053
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,180
Yeah.

1054
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
They're like, but they're cozy.

1055
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,020
I like the cozy.

1056
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,060
Yeah, yeah.

1057
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,300
Yeah, they're especially Alcove, very cozy bathroom.

1058
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,580
Very cozy.

1059
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,900
But sometimes like really nice restaurants

1060
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,580
like Mike and I experienced this the other day.

1061
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,500
Some of them were like kind of almost railroad

1062
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,180
apartment style little restaurants in LA.

1063
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,600
You're going through the kitchen.

1064
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,300
Like I walked through the kitchen of a sushi

1065
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,860
and like Poke bowl place the other day to use the bathroom

1066
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,780
and like little asterias, little places sometimes.

1067
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,500
You go, there's only one bathroom.

1068
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,940
It's in the kitchen.

1069
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,380
Although getting a little, getting to pass by the kitchen.

1070
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,580
I mean, we love behind the scenes peeks.

1071
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,020
So that's kind of a different,

1072
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,860
but that's a different.

1073
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,420
Keep your food being made.

1074
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,260
That's fun.

1075
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,080
Yeah, sure.

1076
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,300
Yeah.

1077
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,300
With you on hotel lobbies and I'd specifically

1078
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,940
like to shout out the Glendale neck of the woods

1079
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,820
is a Hilton and a embassy suites

1080
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,380
that both have fantastic quality.

1081
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,620
Universal Hilton, the Sheraton Hilton,

1082
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,900
Universal Hollywood.

1083
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,740
Yeah.

1084
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,560
Very nice lobby bathrooms.

1085
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,400
Fantastic.

1086
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,220
Agreed.

1087
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,700
Mike, anything?

1088
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,380
Almost anywhere in Japan.

1089
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,380
Okay.

1090
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,740
Oh, I'm so excited.

1091
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,620
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's plenty of places

1092
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,380
where that's not the case, but everywhere we went,

1093
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,580
we were just, first of all,

1094
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,700
there's like very little litter anywhere on the streets,

1095
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,460
but all the, almost all the bathrooms are like just kept up

1096
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,480
so nicely.

1097
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,500
Like in, and that goes for hotels,

1098
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,060
that goes for in just a restaurant bathroom.

1099
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,740
Obviously that goes in Disney.

1100
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,420
And then all the toilets.

1101
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,960
Tragic train stations, like still nice.

1102
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,460
I'm trying to think if we did a train station,

1103
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,940
I'm sure something like that.

1104
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,940
I mean, maybe not nice, but very clean and well kept up.

1105
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,860
Like it might not look nice.

1106
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,240
It might look like it's 30 years old,

1107
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,500
but that's the thing with a lot of things in Japan.

1108
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,260
It's like they haven't renovated it

1109
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,860
to make it look like it's in this century,

1110
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,580
but it's been kept up very well,

1111
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,180
which I think I was describing the Tokyo Dome City Hotel.

1112
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,020
Oh, okay.

1113
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,660
I'll make a point of it.

1114
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,460
So yeah, that almost anywhere in Japan,

1115
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,700
we, Lindsay and I long for the bathrooms of Japan,

1116
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,300
the public restrooms of Japan.

1117
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,300
Wow, wow.

1118
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,140
So.

1119
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,420
Yeah, you can't expect in America.

1120
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,260
We've come to.

1121
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,080
I don't think.

1122
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,920
No.

1123
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,820
I think, you know, places do their best

1124
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,080
to keep things in order,

1125
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,900
but I think you end up understaffed

1126
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,820
and there's too many people.

1127
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,180
I love taking a train,

1128
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,580
but the real redheaded stepchild of transportation.

1129
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,260
I mean, airports can be pretty gnarly,

1130
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,620
but especially train places.

1131
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,280
That said, I would like to finally,

1132
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,380
maybe this year or next, get a sleeper car,

1133
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,900
take the train back to the East Coast instead of flying.

1134
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,660
It takes like four or five days still.

1135
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,500
It's crazy.

1136
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,900
You have to change a few times,

1137
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,080
but it's like, it's not insanely expensive.

1138
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,580
And those in the best case scenario,

1139
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,580
hopefully someday those have the Wally seats.

1140
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,420
Sure.

1141
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,460
You're on the go.

1142
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,460
Don't even have to leave your little booth.

1143
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,300
Yeah.

1144
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Recline and unwind and.

1145
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,140
Great.

1146
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,740
Plug in.

1147
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,780
Good pooping time.

1148
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,900
Just plug in and you're good.

1149
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,340
Just plug in and occasionally go to the dining car

1150
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,660
to listen to maniacs talk about why they don't fly,

1151
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,220
which seems to be most of the conversations I've heard

1152
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,180
of people who've done some multi-day train travel

1153
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,820
in America, you meet some real interesting characters

1154
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,660
on those trains.

1155
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,060
Who are like adamant about and spending the whole time

1156
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,460
on there talking about why they're not flying.

1157
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,840
Or yes, or the positive or like why they love

1158
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,100
being on the train.

1159
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,940
Hmm.

1160
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,380
Joe Biden.

1161
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,220
Joe Biden.

1162
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,040
Yeah, he loves.

1163
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,540
Future president.

1164
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,380
Sure to be.

1165
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,220
All right.

1166
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,060
Let's see.

1167
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:06,460
I'm making the call right now.

1168
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,840
Well, it's good to know about your y'all's habits.

1169
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,680
Oh wait, how about this?

1170
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,780
Do you guys, do you ever take advantage of some

1171
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,520
of the other, you know, if there's a guy handing out stuff,

1172
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,100
candy bars, cologne, do you ever do that?

1173
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,300
Or is that a nuisance?

1174
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,060
It's only a nuisance because sometimes I don't have cash

1175
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,900
on me.

1176
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,620
I feel like I gotta give a tip and I try to do that.

1177
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,620
So sometimes I don't have cash and then I'm stressed out

1178
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,020
cause he's handed me a thing.

1179
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,580
And I feel like that just that makes me have to give him

1180
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,060
a dollar.

1181
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:39,020
I don't think I've ever taken candy.

1182
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,860
Mm hmm.

1183
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,220
I think maybe I did.

1184
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,100
Oh, Jason's smiling from ear to ear.

1185
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,340
Well, I actually have a stranger one.

1186
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,860
I did not take candy, but was offered the chance

1187
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,700
to buy candy.

1188
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,580
We were at the Echoplex music venue.

1189
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,420
Yeah.

1190
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,380
A year ago.

1191
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,660
I think for Lindsay's birthday.

1192
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,300
Oh yeah, there's a dance party.

1193
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,380
They had a guy in the bathroom selling candy.

1194
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,940
And I don't know if you're supposed to,

1195
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,500
he was selling Lucy's like single cigarette.

1196
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,140
So I like bought a single cigarette

1197
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,300
to go smoke on the patio.

1198
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,540
You bought one cigarette?

1199
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,860
I bought one cigarette, yeah.

1200
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,340
Neat.

1201
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,180
Wow.

1202
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,420
Oh, so you did, but that's a very specific partake.

1203
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,340
You never did it again?

1204
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,340
Just a special occasion?

1205
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,660
No, that one I remember.

1206
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,980
I feel like I've taken mints or stuff before.

1207
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,940
Maybe a mint.

1208
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,820
But I feel like at nice places that have that,

1209
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,220
they don't usually charge you for candy.

1210
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,020
That felt like, you know.

1211
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,740
Did you try to take candy and he was like,

1212
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,140
no, no, no, no, this is money.

1213
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,660
I stopped.

1214
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,980
You had put half of the stock in a garbage bag

1215
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,180
by the time he said, no, those aren't free.

1216
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,620
There wasn't a sign.

1217
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,500
Like I was like, so what, how much do I take?

1218
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,460
Like I did that sort of like, and he's like,

1219
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,900
oh yeah, it's like a dollar.

1220
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,420
And you were like, I've never paid that much.

1221
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,940
I mean, I socially, I believe if you ask someone

1222
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,140
for a cigarette, a quarter or 50 cents

1223
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,980
is the polite exchange.

1224
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,060
But yeah, it's a venue.

1225
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,100
It's, you know, there's a little bit of an extra charge.

1226
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,700
So it was understandable.

1227
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,180
Right.

1228
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,700
I think you've smoked cigarettes here and there.

1229
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,180
And I just, I'd be, I really wish and hope,

1230
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,020
and I don't think it's true,

1231
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,860
but I wish that you like always smoked them

1232
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,660
with a penguin style long cigarette holder.

1233
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,100
Well, he did not have those for sale for a dollar.

1234
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,460
You gotta bring that to the venue yourself.

1235
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:31,060
Less any listeners worry that was my one cigarette

1236
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,340
of 2018 or maybe two.

1237
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,300
So like, yeah, I don't indulge very much.

1238
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,220
You just do it for the look.

1239
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,700
I mean, kids, it is very cool.

1240
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,420
We're allowed to say whatever we want

1241
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,260
behind the second date.

1242
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,540
Oh, you're behind the paywall.

1243
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,380
We're unregulated.

1244
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,020
How weird, they endorse cigarettes on this episode.

1245
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,260
No, don't smoke.

1246
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,140
No way, man.

1247
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:53,980
Where'd you think?

1248
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,820
Vapor.

1249
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,180
This episode brought to you by Jewel.

00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,180
Currently under investigation by the federal government.

00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,820
Don't smoke, but always Jewel.

1253
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,700
Jewel's rule.

1254
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,620
We gotta get.

1255
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,460
You gotta indulge in something kids.

1256
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,980
May as well be Jewel.

1257
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,980
I mean, we gotta get McGruff to record a new single

1258
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,340
about like, don't vape.

1259
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,180
You know?

1260
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,940
I mean, whoever McGruff,

1261
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,140
I don't know if there's an official McGruff yet.

1262
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:25,980
Yeah.

1263
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,820
I just saw somebody post.

1264
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,860
If our episode was not an audition for,

1265
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,500
I mean, all of us, but especially you, Mike.

1266
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,380
Yeah, sure.

1267
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,660
To be the new McGruff, official voice of them.

1268
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,020
I would happily, I'd throw, I'd put a reel in,

1269
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,420
but if it came down to the two of us, it's yours.

1270
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,180
Thank you, I appreciate that.

1271
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,260
I think though, if you were to listen to all hour

1272
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,660
and 50 minutes of that episode,

1273
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,660
you'd be like, all those voices are all over the place.

1274
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,020
I don't know if he can do the voice consistently for.

1275
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:52,940
We weren't at work.

1276
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,300
We weren't getting paid to be McGruff.

1277
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,220
That's true.

1278
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,860
You start to take it seriously

1279
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,100
when you're handed that mantle.

1280
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:58,940
Yeah.

1281
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,940
But like it started out strong

1282
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,100
and then it's like at the end it was like.

1283
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,500
Like I was trying to keep it going, but it was harder.

1284
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,340
Sure.

1285
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,180
But yeah, you're right.

1286
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,380
If I was practicing, which of course I would.

1287
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,100
Yeah, I could do it.

1288
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,620
As long as I got to make a McGruff album once a year.

1289
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,380
If that's part of the, if you just volunteered that also,

1290
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,540
and you know what is the best way

1291
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,380
that you could end up sounding the most like McGruff,

1292
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,980
smoke a lot of cigarettes.

1293
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,460
Yeah.

1294
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,820
Start smoking.

1295
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,660
Get a cool voice like me.

1296
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,100
Carton a day.

1297
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,020
The American tobacco industry contributes jobs

1298
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,420
for lots of people.

1299
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,180
We don't want those jobs going to other countries, do you?

1300
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,380
Start smoking kids.

1301
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,060
So let me ask you guys in terms of,

1302
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,220
cause we talked about like Disney movies

1303
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,940
you'd like to go to the restroom in.

1304
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,300
Any other intellectual properties

1305
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,060
that you wish you could see a bathroom, like non Disney?

1306
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,300
Other films and stuff.

1307
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,660
Oh, interesting.

1308
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,740
I spun out something in preparation for this.

1309
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,460
That's not Disney, although it is now.

1310
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:08,300
I was thinking about the recently acquired property,

1311
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,780
Fox property of Alien.

1312
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,340
And how about this?

1313
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,300
Why can't going to the bathroom in a theme park

1314
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,020
have a story?

1315
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,820
So what if when you enter the bathroom

1316
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,340
and then enter the stall,

1317
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,780
you are in the worlds of the Nostromo

1318
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,180
and you lock the door and you are not just going

1319
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,460
to the bathroom, although I mean, feel free,

1320
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,300
but you're hiding from the xenomorph

1321
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,780
and there's a screen on the door and you can see

1322
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,780
the dot or the square representing it coming after you.

1323
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,420
So you're kind of, you know,

1324
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,220
they got to keep the traffic flowing in those places anyway.

1325
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:53,220
So that sort of hopefully helps speed up the process

1326
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,060
and gets those bowels moving,

1327
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,620
knowing that it's like getting closer and closer and closer.

1328
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,620
And maybe as it's getting closer,

1329
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,820
you start involving some of those old Alien

1330
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,380
encounter effects and it sounds like in the stalls

1331
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,420
next to you, there's a tax going on.

1332
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,700
So you got to wrap it up.

1333
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,660
Suddenly it's not just going to the bathroom.

1334
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,380
It's a flight of fear.

1335
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,580
Oh, see, I don't know.

1336
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,620
I might have the opposite.

1337
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,780
I might be too scared to go, but you just don't.

1338
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,620
Oh yeah.

1339
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,700
Oh yeah.

1340
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,060
I do like the opportunity for like a Weyland

1341
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,780
Yutani branded toilet.

1342
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,700
The fake corporation that runs everything in those movies.

1343
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,100
Oh, that's a good little bit of world building.

1344
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:38,940
Absolutely.

1345
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,060
Yeah.

1346
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,740
I think it's tough because like that's a great idea,

1347
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,140
but I do think you're going to have a lot of people

1348
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,220
getting backed up because they're so scared.

1349
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,340
Yeah, I'm assuming that people have the opposite problem

1350
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,500
and just go.

1351
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,340
Uh-huh.

1352
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,380
That's one way to get scared and have it relate to your...

1353
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,980
There's going to be a lot of like people like with bowel

1354
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,500
problems by the end of the first day, I think,

1355
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,740
where people are like stuck.

1356
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,820
They're back to there.

1357
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:06,700
They'll have to, there'll be like a run on laxative

1358
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,060
later that day.

1359
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:11,220
So it's just now become not, not actually the opposite

1360
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,380
of why it was built.

1361
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,980
It actually, you're guaranteed to not go to the bathroom

1362
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,820
in this bathroom.

1363
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,660
Cause your fight or flight response would be like,

1364
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,700
we got to get out of here.

1365
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,140
We don't have time for this.

1366
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:21,980
So that's a problem.

1367
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,500
I was thinking about it and this was my concern.

1368
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,980
Any like, you know, intense or action movie,

1369
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,260
I don't want to be startled in the bathroom.

1370
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,660
I want no conflicts in the bathroom.

1371
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,540
I want something relaxing.

1372
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,180
And so I would like a bathroom based on the 2015 movie,

1373
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,540
The Intern starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.

1374
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,140
A very pleasant movie with seemingly no conflicts in it

1375
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:45,980
at all.

1376
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,500
And I guess really any Nancy Meyer movie would do.

1377
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,740
Later Nancy Meyer.

1378
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,940
It seems like there's a lot more going on

1379
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,620
in like Private Benjamin, but like it's complicated.

1380
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,620
The Intern, you know, big kitchens and big bathrooms,

1381
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,220
nice furnishings.

1382
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,860
Like up to date equipment.

1383
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,180
Up to date, yeah.

1384
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,100
Yeah.

1385
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,020
I think, look, we were talking about, that's good.

1386
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,100
I would like those.

1387
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,420
Nancy Meyer's great kitchens, great bathrooms.

1388
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,180
Do you have the same problem with Tangled

1389
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:20,140
where Intern fans are furious that that's all

1390
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,260
that it's being represented as, is a bathroom?

1391
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,300
Cause they've been demanding an Intern presence

1392
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,420
in the parks for a while.

1393
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,380
Maybe, but I think it is, you know,

1394
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,780
I think it's kind of been eclipsed by Book Club,

1395
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,260
which is not a Nancy Meyer's movie,

1396
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,580
but it kind of exists in the same sort of genre

1397
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,460
of like very pleasant movie with minimal conflicts.

1398
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,100
Which Book Club bathroom also where you get a copy of,

1399
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,260
there's a stack of all of the 50 Shades of Grey books

1400
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,620
that you can peruse.

1401
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,540
Yeah.

1402
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,020
That's what they watch in the, yeah.

1403
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,700
So you can read along with them.

1404
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,700
Then you just might be too scandalized to go to the bathroom.

1405
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,220
Yeah, that's true.

1406
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,220
Oh my.

1407
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,180
Or it makes you get your groove back

1408
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,700
and you march out of the bathroom,

1409
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,620
forgetting why you even got there in the first place.

1410
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,140
Similar issue with the alien thing then.

1411
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:12,980
Yeah.

1412
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,220
Just marching out with not having gone.

1413
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,060
We're talking about bathrooms

1414
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,620
that are transformative experiences.

1415
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,780
I think. It's pretty cool.

1416
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,780
I think like there's a upcoming,

1417
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,740
we talked about it on the show, the Play Pavilion,

1418
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,140
upcoming Epcot thing where they're gonna be

1419
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,380
maybe cycling in different.

1420
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,780
Now I'm not going where you think I'm going with this.

1421
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,340
Gameify shit.

1422
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,300
Although I guess we could come up with a couple,

1423
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,300
there's nine toilets and they're all shaped like bowling pins

1424
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,860
and you have to like shit in the right ones to knock over.

1425
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,740
There is that, but that's not what I'm going with that.

1426
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,740
I'm not gonna go with that gross.

1427
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,180
That's not who I am as a performer.

1428
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,820
You're rated PG.

1429
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,220
I'm PG, otherwise cursed a little too much on this episode.

1430
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,060
We all have.

1431
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,140
You could put in different experiences.

1432
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,700
I think that's what they're talking about with play.

1433
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,540
You can sub in.

1434
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,380
Jim Hill was talking about the potential for moving in

1435
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,980
like an old attraction and you could kind of experience it

1436
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,020
in VR or in a big screen,

1437
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,860
like the way that the Imagineers test out new rides.

1438
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,020
So I wanna make sort of maybe a generic bathroom,

1439
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,540
but you would move with maybe a group of whatever,

1440
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,500
say the bathroom as 12 people could use the bathroom at once,

1441
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,540
20 people at once.

1442
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,980
So there's a line for this bathroom

1443
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,740
because it's highly themed.

1444
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,940
Well, there's a show really.

1445
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,380
And you would cycle in and out

1446
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,420
famous bathroom scenes in films.

1447
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,780
So 20 people would be taken out of the line.

1448
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,820
You'd walk in and stand in the bathroom.

1449
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,020
And then all of a sudden a famous bathroom scene

1450
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,580
from a movie would happen,

1451
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,260
but it wouldn't necessarily be the same one every time.

1452
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,100
So maybe you get the cable guy scene

1453
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:51,100
where Jim Carrey comes in and beats up Owen Wilson.

1454
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,620
Maybe you get Mission Impossible Fallout

1455
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,820
where there's a Cavill-Tom Cruise pipe battle

1456
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,780
with a crazy ninja guy who goes through a mirror.

1457
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,940
Maybe it's a...

1458
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,860
Maybe it's the Godfather when Michael Corleone goes in

1459
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,260
to get the gun hidden in the toilet tank.

1460
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,300
Very good point.

1461
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,460
It could be that scene too.

1462
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,100
So you basically are sort of watching a little show

1463
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,100
that happens before you actually use the restroom.

1464
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,060
So the little flash mobby show or something happens.

1465
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,260
Oh, wasn't that fun?

1466
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,220
You just use the bathroom like regular.

1467
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,020
So there's no problem.

1468
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,860
You're not gonna be backed up.

1469
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,700
You're not gonna be scared.

1470
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,460
The show is over and then you get to use the bathroom

1471
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,860
after a fun show.

1472
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,700
Wow.

1473
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,380
And you're right that the theme park bathroom

1474
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,780
of the future should have themes that you could trade

1475
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,500
in and out and keep up to date

1476
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,660
with what today's audiences wanna see.

1477
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,500
Right.

1478
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,540
Maybe the cable guy.

1479
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,620
The cable guy or the scene where Seabass comes back in

1480
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,660
and dumb and dumber.

1481
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,460
When is it Harry's or Lloyd is waiting for...

1482
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,180
Oh, cause he's waiting cause he thinks there's gonna be

1483
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,660
like a sexual encounter in the stall

1484
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,060
and then it's Seabass again.

1485
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,740
Also in Liar Liar, Jim Carrey beats himself up

1486
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,300
in the bathroom.

1487
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,300
Oh yeah.

1488
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,780
He did a lot of bathroom.

1489
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,260
Maybe it's just Jim Carrey movie bathroom stuff.

1490
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,300
Sure.

1491
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,540
The Jim Carrey, there's like very little Jim Carrey

1492
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,260
presence in theme parks in general.

1493
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,180
And maybe the bathrooms is the way in.

1494
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,060
Yeah, for sure.

1495
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,020
All right, well then there's a Jim Carrey bathroom.

1496
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,420
That's my pitch.

1497
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,260
That's interactive and changes out and it's perfect.

1498
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,180
Like the Play Pavilion.

1499
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,020
Boy.

1500
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,860
Same thing.

1501
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,700
Great.

1502
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:29,140
You know, we came in prepared to make fun of this area,

1503
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,780
but now it's inspired us to dream of bigger

1504
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,940
and greater bathrooms in theme parks.

1505
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,340
And legitimately with those Harry Potter weird smells

1506
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,820
and giggles and whatever they're planning in the future.

1507
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,860
Yeah.

1508
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,300
Bathrooms are becoming part of the experience

1509
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,460
and let's keep it that way.

1510
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,500
I have a little cliffhanger here.

1511
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,900
I was on a blog called the DisneylandDad.com

1512
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,740
and he was ranking Disneyland bathrooms.

1513
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:01,620
And he listed all the ones you think flows

1514
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,100
and Pacific Wharf, whatever.

1515
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,980
And then he said the best bathroom at Disneyland Resort?

1516
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,820
I'm not telling.

1517
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,740
They are the best because they are the most hidden.

1518
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:15,540
Aren't included on any of the maps nor on the new app.

1519
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,140
Then he says like, subscribe to his email

1520
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,820
and then he'll let you know.

1521
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,100
So maybe that's the way to find it.

1522
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,820
But I'm wondering, other than the only one

1523
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,380
I can think of off the top of my head,

1524
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,060
the Tiki Room bathroom.

1525
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:26,900
Uh-huh.

1526
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,100
Could be that. Yeah.

1527
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,140
But other than that,

1528
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,820
do we know what Disneyland Dad is talking about?

1529
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,020
I have a guess.

1530
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:38,020
The restrooms in the lobby

1531
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,580
are kind of adjacent to the lobby.

1532
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,860
In the Disneyland Hotel,

1533
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:44,100
Disneyland Hotel kind of built many decades ago.

1534
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,260
You have to go like down these stairs.

1535
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,620
They're built underneath.

1536
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,100
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

1537
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,780
I think it might maybe those sort of off the beaten path

1538
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,980
Disneyland Hotel ones.

1539
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,100
Okay. Well, I'm just saying,

1540
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,020
we're going to have to find out what Disneyland Dad

1541
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,380
is talking about when we talk toilets next on the net.

1542
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,860
We'll make sure we have the answer.

1543
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,900
We'll try to outsmart Disneyland Dad once and for all.

1544
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,100
Yeah. I just, yeah.

1545
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,420
He frustrated me with that article.

1546
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,260
So.

1547
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,820
Yeah. What a tease.

1548
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,620
You couldn't just subscribe to his email?

1549
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,220
I'm just money, I think, isn't it?

1550
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,260
Oh. Or maybe it's not.

1551
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,100
Maybe you're right.

1552
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,500
Maybe it's just signing up for an email

1553
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,220
which Disneyland Dad will tell me.

1554
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:23,220
Well, if it does cost money

1555
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,900
then you know a way to outsmart Disneyland Dad.

1556
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,220
Email us at podcasts.

1557
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,420
Write a Gmail.

1558
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,100
Otherwise follow us on Twitter and Instagram

1559
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,660
and keep subscribing to the second gate

1560
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,780
for more talking number two.

1561
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,900
It's been a blast.

1562
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,820
All right.

1563
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,660
Yep.

1564
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,480
Catch you later.

1565
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,320
Bye. Bye.
