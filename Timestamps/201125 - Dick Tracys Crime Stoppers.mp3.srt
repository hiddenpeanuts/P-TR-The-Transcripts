1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Calling Dick Tracy, calling Dick Tracy.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You're needed on a podcast.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Specifically, Podcast the Ride, The Second Gate.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's Jason Sheridan calling you.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Here with Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, come in, Dick Tracy. I'm here, Mike Carlson's my name.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Dick Tracy, it's the year 2020 and everyone has demanded a super long episode about Dick Tracy.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Scott Garner, also here.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, that's right. I'm on the case, but that doesn't matter until Dick Tracy is, more importantly, Dick calling you.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Dick, please. We know there's a very old man who still has the rights to your likeness.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We must break into his fortress and get them back.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We must procure the rights from this very old man.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And joining us, of course, one of our favorite Crimestoppers is back. It's Eva Anderson.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yay!

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Welcome. Thanks for being here.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thanks for doing this one with us, especially. I realized this, I was trying to do the count in my head.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is your sixth appearance on Podcast The Ride and your third on The Second Gate.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So you're undoubtedly ruling The Second Gate stats.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I love that.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I like that division. You're welcome anytime for anything.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I'm really glad it's this one, especially. Dick Tracy's Crimestoppers, this kind of notorious, never built attraction.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That being said, from our text exchanges, it seems like, much like the Kevin Spacey episode where we broke up things into majors and minors,

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
it seems like there's some rules afoot, I feel, in what we're going to do today.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I think there's, I mean, there's, I don't know if it's maybe rules as much as there's good.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is maybe like a long orchestral piece, you know, there's some sort of an intro that might not be.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's a variation on the theme, but it's not exactly the theme of Dick Tracy's Crimestoppers ride.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Like a short kind of that relates to the primary feature.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But right, right, I forgot about that.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, something that's, and then something that you would say, oh, this doesn't have anything to do with Dick Tracy.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why are they talking about this on this episode?

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So it's a whole piece.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Should we get into that first? I'm pretty curious.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You want to jump right in?

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, I think so.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We have to, yeah.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh my God. Okay.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All right. So this is something I've asked you guys if I could come on the podcast and talk about.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then once you gave me permission, I did a lot of research because I love doing research for this podcast.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So this is the story of this very weird thing that happened in the Dick Tracy universe.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So I'm trying to see what year did Dick Tracy the comics start?

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
30s, right? 1930s.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
1931. So Chester Gould started writing the Dick Tracy comic strip in 1931.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And he continued until 1977.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But there's this period in the 60s.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So basically the Dick Tracy's comic strip was really straightforward.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Dick Tracy was a cop.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He had a son named Junior and he just like he had a two way wrist radio.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And he would just go around and like catch these very grotesque criminals that were drawn in like a really creepy way.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Sometimes there'd be like little side stories.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But for the most part, that was like it was a crime of the week, crime of the season sort of thing.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Big, big criminals.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And so then this thing happened in 1964.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, actually, from starting in 1962, for reasons that nobody really understood, 30 years, 31 years into the strip, Dick Tracy got a moon spaceship.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
A moon spaceship.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So basically inventor Diet Smith like shows up and presents Dick Tracy with this this this space or like this kind of this new kind of vehicle.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Wait, sorry, the name first things first.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Diet Smith.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I think that's how you say it.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's how it's spelled D-I-E-T.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I mean, that's diet.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So basically it's a it's a magnet powered like kind of airship.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And very quickly, like Diet Smith says, like, there are no rockets in this.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We do not use rockets, magnets.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We use the Earth's magnetism to propel us.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's silent.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It can go, it can move really fast.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And so for like a couple, it's really weird when you're reading these big books.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've been buying these big books at the Dick Tracy comic strip.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
They look like this.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, spoiler.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, my God.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I which that's like I mean, how many years are we talking?

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is one of your span.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wow.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is volume.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What I have right here is volume crap.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's been going for for many.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is volume 21.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Geez.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
62 to 64.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So basically for the first two years of this having this thing, basically, Tracy just uses it to fight crimes on Earth because he can just use the magnetic pull of the planets to like fly over to Brazil and catch a bad guy who's like hiding in Brazil.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But anyway, so that happens.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And then around 1964, this stowaway gets on the ship.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They say they go to the moon for some reason.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And a stowaway gets on the ship and it's this woman and you kind of see her picture here.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Her name is Moon Maid.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, my.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
With.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Her eyes are like pinwheels like hypnotizing you a little bit.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But like but bright yellow like a bumblebee.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Like she has two bumblebees for eyes.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Very alluring.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So Moon Maid is basically like super sexy.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
She's like Betty Boop with horns.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There's some like Moon Maid right there.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She's kind of like she's real sexy and she can't speak, but she can control the temperature of her own body.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And she can also like send out a ray that paralyzes people.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So for a while, people are trying to figure out what to do with her.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I think Tracy doesn't like her because she just changes temperatures too much.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But at one point, she touches Junior's ears, who's now an adult.

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He touches her ears and makes his ears warm and he falls in love with her.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So then Dick Tracy wants to send Moon Maid back to the moon and Junior's like, I'm in love with her.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And he stows away onto the ship and he returns to the moon with Moon Maid.

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So that's like end of 1964.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So that's volume 21.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And I don't know what happens from 1964 to 1966 because the volume 22 of this cost two thousand dollars.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's a thing because these companies, I think IDW is publishing these archives or like, you know,

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Fana Graphics and Drawn and Quarterly, these publishers publish these massive collections of like years and years of these comic strips.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Every now and then one volume will slip out of print.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And if you try to buy it used online, you will find it costs hundreds or in this case thousands of dollars.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Two thousand dollars was the only version I could find.

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It was so crazy.

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I even emailed the guy from Dick Tracy dot info to see if I could get an answer for like, why is this so expensive?

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But he didn't respond.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I probably should have emailed IDW.

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This came out in 2017.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So anyway, I don't I but I did find on Dick Tracy dot info basically what happened in this volume.

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So what I can tell Dick Tracy, who does not like Moon Maid, chases Junior back to the moon

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
where the governor of Moon Valley, whose moon maids dad puts them in a space cage.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, by the way, this thing is called a space coop.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Like that's what the spaceship is called.

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The magnet thing is a space coop.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So they the governor's mad.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But then eventually he decides that he like he likes Earth and he and I think by the end of this this two year period,

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I think everyone's resolved their differences and the moon and Earth are now just everything's fine.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So one would assume that at this point, like the story is resolved.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Moon Maid returns to Earth with Junior and marries her, him, and they have a baby named Honeymoon.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And I think you could like button this whole thing up if you wanted to go back to solving Earth crimes.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But then you get to the next volume, 1966, which you guys can see is just full of like little notes.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So basically, yes, just to explain, because you texted us this too.

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is a book that all right, it's another two years of Dick Tracy.

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And you put a yellow sticky or something in each page where something weird is happening.

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And there's like from from what you just held up to the zoom, like forty five yellow notes.

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah, so I'll get to it.

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So basically, so basically, it sounds like the publishing company was like coming to Chester Gold to be like, hey, can we stop this moon nonsense?

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We just go back to Dick Tracy and he went insane and used he doubled down.

141
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So basically, it starts like 1966 starts with just constant declarations of the characters screaming that no, like no army, no Navy, no billions, just magnetism, just pages and pages of screaming about how great the magnetic space coup is.

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And what comes comes through really quickly is that not only does like Chester Gold love the moon, he hates NASA and believes that rockets are bullshit.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So there's pages and pages and pages of just people screaming that like NASA shit that the moon is like the future.

144
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And yeah, hold on.

145
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So this is so insane that like there would be, you know, there's some TV shows of that one season where things are kind of weird.

146
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't really like that arc and then they kind of correct and get you out of it.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Dick Tracy's been on the moon for four years now for a full presidential term.

148
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And now like he's doubling down.

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And he keeps screaming things like moon age.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's here to stay better get aboard.

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If you're not moon minded, you're sleeping.

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like just Dick Tracy screams things like that in like a really weird just yeah.

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And then and then Diet Smith will talk about just how NASA is like they have to goof around with one way rockets.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And so basically there's a crime that's like kind of happening between Earth and the moon.

155
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So they have to use the coop to go pick up like a dead body that's flying.

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But but they just keep spending time just screaming about like how great this thing is.

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, oh, yeah.

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,000
At one point, they're retrieving this dead body and Diet Smith saying computer controls take us backwards over the orbiting path.

159
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So he treats the same speed in reverse, making a zero speed at Earth's surface.

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Thus, there is no quote burnout.

161
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes, with a magnetic space coop burnout is the silly word of the squares.

162
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So you're really yelling at it's just like they're just constantly just like kind of screaming at each other.

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Also around this time, even weirder, be on the scoop base coop, Diet Smith has also invented magnetic instead of cars.

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
They just fly around.

165
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You can kind of see this in these like these kind of buckets that look like trash cans.

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And they don't just do that on the moon.

167
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They do that on Earth, too.

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So anytime Dick Tracy is like answering a call, he gets like basically stands in a trash can.

169
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Can you can you read the quote that's above the trash can?

170
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That looks like some real jargon.

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah.

172
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes.

173
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why is it propagandists cater to ignore and supersede cater to ignorance and superstition in their moon discussions?

174
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Politics. Nothing else.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This is about like a guy Dick Tracy has a Tommy gun and he fires bullets at bad guys.

176
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
How did we get here?

177
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
At like flat top and little face or whatever.

178
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, not anymore.

179
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This is the thing with these guys.

180
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This happened with the dog patch episode.

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You just learn about like Al Cap, the guy who made a little Abner.

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's there were just some of the most famous entertainers in America.

183
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
They had no oversight and so much money.

184
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And they're just these oddball eccentric.

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And if Al Cap also made a Dick Tracy parody called Fearless Fosdick.

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, yeah, I know.

187
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I've read that.

188
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's really it's actually kind of the funniest little Abner stuff is Fearless Fosdick.

189
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But it's like, yeah, because he's an idiot.

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes.

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So, OK, so I'll just get to the point.

192
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But basically, well, actually, I won't because there's like a lot of really weird stuff.

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So basically some bad guys steal the rocket cars.

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But then as they fly around in the rocket cars, they just talk about how great they are as well.

195
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
One of the bad guys yells comparing the magnetic air car to the rocket is like comparing the jet age to the horse age.

196
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And then you get to this really weird section where basically they're just talking about just how great everything is.

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And Junior keeps screaming Earth will never be the same.

198
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And they're just talking about the magnets and like the moon and how we're all working it out.

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And then we get to a really weird part where some guys show up to steal.

200
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So some guys show up to steal the moon coop and they are dressed literally I'll show you.

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
They're literally dressed in like shitty NASA outfits that say NASA on them like hats, like fedoras that say NASA.

202
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They want to see the rocket, the moon coop.

203
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And they're like, oh, because they're forced to, quote, goof around with one way rockets, they allow these guys to see the moon coop and then they steal it.

204
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And then they go, the scientists go, but NASA deals only in rockets.

205
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And the other scientist says, I know, but magnetism must be their secret love.

206
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And then they steal it and go to the moon.

207
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And then they introduce crime to the moon, because as you learn later in this book, crime didn't exist on the moon until the until man arrived.

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Of course, did Junior bring it?

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, Junior, I guess.

210
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Or they know they say later that like some other guys came before.

211
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay, then you find out that on the moon, the main thing that people do is eat giant escargot.

212
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So this Christmas, this Christmas thing is like the funniest two pages.

213
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm just going to pull some quotes from it.

214
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So basically, Junior and Moon made go back to the moon for Christmas and they say, we'll be the first Earth family to spend Christmas on the moon.

215
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They celebrate the birth.

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Has he not already done that in all these years?

217
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The birth of the Christ child happens on the moon.

218
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
They say we're now in the pleasant zone.

219
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's an area designated two or three days after sunrise.

220
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So that's where you can just like hang out because it's warm.

221
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Existence is where you find it.

222
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The moon is Earth's man's new world.

223
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And now to Moon Valley and a Christmas Eve dinner of giant escargot.

224
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
How giant?

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
How giant?

226
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Just like twice as big as a snail or like 400 times.

227
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They're pretty big.

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You can kind of see them here like there's one on the table.

229
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh yeah, pretty big.

230
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Very big.

231
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And then, of course, of course, the governor of the moon claps.

232
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Everyone on the back and said magnetism made it all possible.

233
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay, I feel like Chester Goulding was like, all right, I think a way to make this comic

234
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
trip current is if I get on this space age thing, but either read a book or knew a crank

235
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
who was like, well, you have the magnets and just got obsessed with the magnet stuff.

236
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Right.

237
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Like that's got to be.

238
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I mean, something happened because what's really interesting is that the end of the

239
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Dick Tracy moon phase actually coincided with the Apollo 11.

240
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Apollo 11 moonwalk.

241
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's actually going.

242
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah.

243
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Without magnets.

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah.

245
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And he was like, damn it.

246
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Because he was really just like going all in on the magnet thing was going to work and

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
also just being like, fuck NASA.

248
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
They are wrong.

249
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And I, a cartoon artist who does a detective comic, are way ahead of it.

250
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So, okay.

251
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So in 1977.

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
New book now.

253
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

254
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So basically, no, I'm going back to the, back to the original book.

255
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Basically, the guy who wrote the, so basically in 1977, Chester Gould retires.

256
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He's about to, he's about to die.

257
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And another guy takes over.

258
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Sorry, pardon me.

259
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm trying to find all my stuff.

260
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Is this Max Allen Collins?

261
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes.

262
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Takes over and who would go on to write the graphic novel Road to Perdition?

263
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Eventually made it to the Tom Hanks and Robert Newman film.

264
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Well, basically, Max Allen Collins says, as soon as, as soon as he got the job, they

265
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
were like, please, you got to get him off the moon.

266
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Quote, when I was hired to take over the writing of Dick Cheney's in 1977, I was told by the

267
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Trinium powers that be, that note in certain terms that the science fiction elements, the

268
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
quote moon stuff had to go.

269
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And so he, so at this point, like the only thing that's left is that Moon Maid and Junior

270
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
are still married and they have a baby honeymoon.

271
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So in 1977, they blew her up with a car bomb while her daughter watched.

272
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And it's, it's so horrible.

273
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It spans like several strips, like for a full week, Moon Maid exploded.

274
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's so mean.

275
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And they did it while Chester Gould was still alive.

276
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
They made him watch.

277
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You watched too.

278
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You and Honeymoon.

279
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Look at this.

280
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Do you think he was in love with Moon Maid?

281
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Chester?

282
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Maybe.

283
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I mean, he drives her in a very, very saucy way.

284
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Like she's very, and also like, kind of like blue 32.

285
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I mean, he drives her in a very, very saucy way.

286
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Like she's very, and also like, kind of like blue 32.

287
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Characters just keep pointing out like, she's hot.

288
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Like people just look at her and that'll just be like a single panel of like curvy Moon Maid

289
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and be like, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, la, la.

290
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
They keep calling her hot because she can change her temperature.

291
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But at that point, she's just a wife.

292
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Like literally the panel is that she says, I mean, I have it right here.

293
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I actually happen to own from when I was a kid, the comic where Moon Maid dies.

294
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But she just, she forgot to get some whipped cream and she's like, I'll go back and get some whipped cream.

295
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And she's like, I'll go back to the store and Dickie's like, oh, I use my car.

296
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And she gets in the car and then she just fucking on the bottom there.

297
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You can see her just fucking explode.

298
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Boom.

299
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Wow.

300
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And she's just like, she's just hanging out.

301
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And then like, this is, this is the week of her exploding.

302
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's a full, it happens again in a smaller panel.

303
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The fire keeps going.

304
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So anyway, that was my thing I wanted to present.

305
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Just the weird obsession with magnets.

306
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The complete just fuck you to everything that people liked about Dick Tracy for almost a decade.

307
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh my God.

308
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Wow.

309
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
A decade on the moon.

310
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Wait, I have some questions here.

311
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
How can you get to the moon just using a magnet?

312
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He says it just uses the magnets, the planet.

313
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Also, he calls them, okay, this is part of the problem with Chester Gould.

314
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He says that the moon coop uses, the space coop uses the pull of the magnetism of the earth of the planet to move.

315
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But then he also calls the moon a planet, which it isn't.

316
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Right.

317
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's a moon.

318
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
NASA's wrong about that too.

319
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Shut up.

320
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I just get a picture of Chester Gould going like, shut up.

321
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Can you imagine Chester Gould with his wife watching the Apollo 11 moon landing on his little TV?

322
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Just furious.

323
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Just praying for them to die.

324
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Just, oh, they gotta die.

325
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He's the only one who's like, they gotta die.

326
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And then people will listen to my magnet idea.

327
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's weird too because I guess he was just like, there's also a part in that book where Diet Smith invents a giant fire truck that people live inside.

328
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I feel like he was also pivoting to what if I just invent some shit in case people don't like my Dick Tracy anymore.

329
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But the guy who did Wonder Woman invented the lie detector.

330
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Some of these guys were real weirdos.

331
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
William Marston, yeah.

332
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah, he was in a polyamorous relationship and he invented the lie detector.

333
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
He and his wife's 18-year-old lover was the basis for Wonder Woman.

334
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And hopefully 18.

335
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I don't know if they've retconned that story to make it better.

336
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Can I ask if, I'm going to screen share really quick and I'm going to ask for a little dramatic reading of the, because now I'm curious.

337
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I might be on the Dick Tracy Wiki for a while.

338
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I ended up clicking on the Diet Smith page and I just, I'm going to cast a part here.

339
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You're going to see two parts, the left and the right.

340
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The left and the right.

341
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The left is Diet Smith and I'm just going to cast Jason as Diet Smith and Eva as whoever the other person is.

342
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's only two lines.

343
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So if now hear a cold dramatic reading of a Diet Smith panel.

344
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Okay.

345
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You guys seeing it?

346
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes.

347
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm on the left, right?

348
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes.

349
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah.

350
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Okay.

351
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
All right.

352
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Action.

353
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
My ulcers.

354
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm going to get myself some milk.

355
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Diet Smith.

356
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Don't leave this room.

357
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Very good.

358
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
America is just wrapped.

359
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Every morning you wake up and you're like, Oh, what?

360
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, how did the ulcers play out?

361
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Why does it say that he's related to Honeymoon Tracy?

362
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's Moon Maid and Junior's daughter.

363
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay, good.

364
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I was worried that they like, they did a paternity test and like Diet Smith fucked Moon Maid.

365
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
No, his son is Brilliant Smith who is dead.

366
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah.

367
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Wow.

368
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh, he looks very sad.

369
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He's in.

370
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Okay, wait.

371
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
He's in very dark sunglasses and is very sad.

372
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Mike, do you want to take the part of Brilliant Smith?

373
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Okay.

374
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Action.

375
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'll take it standing up.

376
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Where are my parents?

377
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I don't know if he's going to like the news.

378
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's awesome.

379
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Like in the middle of the Moon Maid book, there's a part where a guy, like a mobster comes in

380
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
to rob a lady and she's got a little dog.

381
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And in order to make the dog not bite him, he mixes a martini and pours it down the dog's throat.

382
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And the dog likes it.

383
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And then the dog just goes with the mobster.

384
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And then throughout the next month of comics, the mobster is taking the dog to bars.

385
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And giving the dog martinis.

386
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And it's like his dog now.

387
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Like, that's so funny.

388
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh, man.

389
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Dick Tracy rules.

390
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah.

391
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That strips.

392
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That wiki said that Brilliant Smith is the one who invented the wristwatch radio and

393
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
then was blinded while trying to create something called the Atomlight.

394
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I feel like you guys would like Dick Tracy, like comics.

395
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Really weird.

396
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I realize that, yes, the weirdness from just a little research.

397
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
This all is right up my alley.

398
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I guess I never really thought it was so strange.

399
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I guess I thought it was kind of boring.

400
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And even as a kid, I didn't realize how nuts it was.

401
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah.

402
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Now I'm on the Honeymoon Tracy Woods wiki page.

403
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And there's a section about how she's a fan of the pop singer theme song.

404
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
One word.

405
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
There's who is.

406
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I also think somebody named a character named Fish Face one word.

407
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But Fish is spelled like the band Fish very confusingly.

408
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Like they got to it first.

409
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What I think is interesting is like in 2013, I totally missed this.

410
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But like basically, so they have new comic strips of Dick Tracy, I guess.

411
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And whoever is like Moon Maid came back in 2013, like against all odds.

412
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Like people were like, fuck you.

413
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Like Moon Maid will never die.

414
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
We will never stop taking Dick Tracy into space.

415
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Or he can't do his job.

416
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I am on this page too on the Wikipedia.

417
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And it also says in 2015, there was a story that featured a crossover with Honeymoon Tracy and Little Orphan Annie.

418
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
What?

419
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Which is.

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Whoa, all the old timies.

421
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The old timey verse merging.

422
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh, yeah.

423
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
This is all great.

424
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Jason and I are big fans of this comic book writer, Grant Morrison.

425
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And he wrote a whole like eight years on Batman.

426
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And his whole premise was Batman.

427
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Everything happened.

428
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Because like Batman had everything counts for his like 60, 70 year history.

429
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So he was going to put it all into this eight year run.

430
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And Batman has a lot of the same stuff where Batman's on the moon.

431
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And there's a whole there's there's the rainbow Batman where there's like multiple Batman and they're all different colors.

432
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And then of course, Batmite, which was a little like great gazoo style like character.

433
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So Grant. So his whole premise was like, I'm going to use like, OK, the 40s was like whenever Batman started.

434
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The 40s is his first year fighting crime.

435
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The 50s is like maybe when it's like like that's his second year.

436
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The 60s is fun.

437
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That's his third year. So he like compressed all of it.

438
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And it feels like whoever's doing Dick Tracy now is doing a similar thing where it's like there's some great stuff in the in the dumber stuff.

439
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Like the dumbest stuff is all it counts.

440
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And it's fun. Yeah.

441
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And it was still very popular, apparently in the 70s.

442
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And that's why the postal service reached out to Charles Gould.

443
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I sent I sent you guys this the other day.

444
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And it's a poster that says Dick Tracy says, protect your mail.

445
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Use zip codes.

446
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I didn't realize zip codes were so new.

447
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But the poster is Dick Tracy looking at his watch and he's communicating with Mr. Zip, the old service mascot.

448
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Mr. Zip is in the the picture window on the on the watch.

449
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Another great merger. Oh, my God. Yeah.

450
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I think there's a big change of pace when you had to like switch from like your letter like, hey, you're not just sending a letter.

451
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I put this number code after the the city and state.

452
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And that's also yeah, every son.

453
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I saw that in one of these because every Sunday comic had a thing at the top right corner called Crime Stoppers Textbook.

454
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And it would usually be a like a tip just for people to like not get crimed.

455
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So one is like, have your expensive jewelry photographed to aid police in its recovery should it.

456
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But then this one is just says Crime Stoppers Textbook, terrifying statistics.

457
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Children killed in bicycle accidents in U.S. last year.

458
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Four hundred and fifty.

459
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Signed Dick Tracy.

460
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Boat for thought.

461
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Terrifying statistics.

462
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Was Dick Tracy like the original McGruff?

463
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yes. Yes, he was.

464
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yeah, that ties it together.

465
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And if only they communicated via the two way wristwatch.

466
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And everything would really grow up.

467
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If I can just put it out to your listeners, especially your Patreon listeners, because that's where we are right now.

468
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:26,000
If anyone knows what happened in volume 22 of the Dick Tracy collection and can tell me I'll pay you fifty dollars, not I will pay you two thousand dollars,

469
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
but I will pay you the cost of a normal Dick Tracy book, which is forty dollars.

470
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Because I want to know so bad.

471
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It must be crazier than the magnets to span.

472
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Like it must be even crazier than the one that I filled with notes if it's that much.

473
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Well, there's also I think some of your answers might be in this Wikipedia, which is very dense.

474
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You might want to poke around here and there might be some some little like trim downs of the story and also information like that in 1964.

475
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
There was a nationwide contest to find a real life moon maid.

476
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
They tried to find a real woman the most similar to moon maid.

477
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And then wait and then look, here's the way there's the winner.

478
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
She's from Mississippi and she got to wear a sash that says Moon Maid One on it.

479
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, man.

480
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
She was Chester Gould and his wife's third.

481
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The fucking Tribune editors being like, oh, we got to do some sort of contest.

482
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Same time as the Beatles.

483
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
This is happening.

484
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't I'm jumping all around here.

485
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I found the Wikipedia page of all the names of characters.

486
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, yeah.

487
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Have you seen this?

488
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Can I just share this real quick?

489
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And I was like, oh, I'm going to write down I'm going to write down some of my favorite.

490
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
They're all my favorites.

491
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
There's like, like here, just take your pick.

492
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Trusty hubbub.

493
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, everybody just certain they say and stuff you like.

494
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Mr. Bribery.

495
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Spready Spencer.

496
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Eric Von Rhino.

497
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
George Chinchiller and not a chinchiller.

498
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The human hair bandits.

499
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The apparatus.

500
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Rug head.

501
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Corpuscle.

502
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
George Ozone.

503
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
TV Wiggles.

504
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Tonsils, comma, dude.

505
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Mr. Crime.

506
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Mr. Crime one colon George Alpha.

507
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Or parenthetical George Alpha.

508
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Shaky Trembly.

509
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Mrs. Valtz.

510
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Deffy Sweetfellow.

511
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You guys thought Dick Tracy was boring and it's not.

512
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No, it's not.

513
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The movie is boring.

514
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh, well now hold on a second.

515
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Maybe we have to move over.

516
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I mean, we can call out names forever.

517
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We could do one more run of this at the end.

518
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Maybe.

519
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
One more stud bronzer.

520
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, wait a minute.

521
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You know what?

522
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Let me say, let me say my, actually my favorite one.

523
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh, yeah.

524
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Where is it?

525
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Sorry.

526
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I just want to make, oh, vitamin Flint heart.

527
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I feel like we only saw like a small fraction of the names also.

528
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
He knows Diet Smith.

529
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Diet Smith and vitamin Flint heart.

530
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Vitamin Flint heart is an actor that Dick Tracy knows.

531
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Oh, great.

532
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm not sure.

533
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
He seems like Dr.

534
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Smith from Lost in Space to me.

535
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
No notes.

536
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Okay.

537
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
In case it was now, if you're really not with us,

538
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I mean, we're, we're pretty far into outer space.

539
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We're, we're heading to the moon via magnets.

540
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But the reason any of this is happening,

541
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
the reason we're discussing any of this is that there was maybe going to be a

542
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Disneyland ride based on Dick Tracy,

543
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
but probably not based on any of that stuff,

544
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
but more based on the 1990s Disney movie.

545
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I mean,

546
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I think that's the only movie that's going to be a Disney movie.

547
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And I figured we would discuss this very point.

548
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
What do we think of this movie?

549
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
We've already got some strong opinions.

550
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Jason, do you want to, there's some shots were fired with boring.

551
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'll clarify as well.

552
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't, I love it.

553
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah.

554
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yeah.

555
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So I'm really glad it exists.

556
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
This whole.

557
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
This really holds a special place in my heart because it was one of the

558
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
most important movies in my life.

559
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I went back and checked the Disney release dates because I think my family,

560
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I think the thinking was like, all right, he's over.

561
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Let's try a movie.

562
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And Disney was starting to get better in the mid to late eighties.

563
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So the first movie I remember seeing in theaters for sure was Oliver and

564
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
company.

565
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And then after that would have been a little mermaid.

566
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And then after that would have been Dick Tracy, Dick Tracy.

567
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I remember sticking with the movie.

568
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I remember watching it.

569
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I remember watching it.

570
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I remember watching it.

571
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And then after that would have been Dick Tracy, Dick Tracy.

572
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I remember sticking out in my head because I loved it so much.

573
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
We went over to the toys for us across the street and I got the toy

574
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
wristwatch communicator.

575
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And then the re that was like,

576
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I think in between like preschool and kindergarten,

577
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and I think the rest of the summer at the beach,

578
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I would just remember playing with like wet sand and going like,

579
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
this is like the cement.

580
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
This is like filling up the bay.

581
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Like I thought Dick Tracy was great.

582
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I had a few of the, I don't think I went all in on the toys,

583
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
but I remember thinking the movie.

584
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I just thought it was, it was great.

585
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It probably just planet stuff subconsciously in my mind to just prep me for

586
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
like crime stuff.

587
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You're going to like crime stuff.

588
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You're going to like the music of Steven Sondheim.

589
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You're going to like big fluorescent backgrounds.

590
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And, and you're going to like all this stuff.

591
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I went back and rewatched it this week and I,

592
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I just was shocked how odd it was.

593
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But as I'm watching it, I was like, man,

594
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Al Pacino is really good in this.

595
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah.

596
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
He should have, I think he should have won an Oscar.

597
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And then I went and looked at the nominees and I forgot he was nominated

598
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
for an Oscar.

599
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
He's not being for big boy Caprice.

600
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
What?

601
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
The Oscars are so shitty now.

602
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Nothing that interesting would ever happen today.

603
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Why did we all agree?

604
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We all know we nominate costume dramas is what we do.

605
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Those are the rules.

606
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
That's amazing.

607
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah. He does kick ass in this though.

608
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
He's my favorite part by far.

609
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I think so much fun.

610
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
He's like hunched over.

611
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
He's dancing with like Madonna and chorus girls.

612
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Like when he's giving notes to the song,

613
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
that's the highlight for me.

614
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And he like slams the piano on Mandy Patinkin's hands.

615
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah.

616
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
That's Mandy Patinkin and the plays playing the piano.

617
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Unrecognizable.

618
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Yeah.

619
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And he is, the girls are very bad.

620
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They do a good job having them beat,

621
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
like they do a job conveying that they're doing a very lazy performance.

622
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
More, more.

623
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And then he is better.

624
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
This little like prosthetic butt little freak guy.

625
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And then when they finish and it's very half-assed,

626
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
he goes, no, no, that's not good.

627
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It was not good.

628
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It's so funny.

629
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's not good.

630
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's so much fun.

631
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's so, it's so, and there's, it's such a stacked cast.

632
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Like it's great.

633
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
James Kahn and Al Pacito, Michael and Sonny are back together again in this movie.

634
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Dick Van Dyke.

635
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Dustin Hoffman.

636
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Dustin Hoffman is mumbles.

637
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And he's funny.

638
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
William Forsythe is flat top.

639
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
This is, and this is years before,

640
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
like right around when William Forsythe is like doing the universal studio

641
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
souvenir VHS recordings.

642
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Wait, no, that's not who that is.

643
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That's John Forsythe.

644
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh, wait, is that a different, that is a different guy.

645
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh man, there's two Forsythe?

646
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Because I couldn't remember, what's William Forsythe famous from?

647
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Does anybody know?

648
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Oh, I forget.

649
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It's, it's pretty big.

650
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's something that you can find on antenna TV, I'm sure.

651
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Sure, sure.

652
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I have a question though for you, Jason, which is like, I'm watching this.

653
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I did not really grow up with this movie.

654
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And I, as I'm watching it in the last couple of years, my biggest thought is like,

655
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
how could a kid like this?

656
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's very slow.

657
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It is large portions that are just like quiet.

658
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I liked it as a kid as well.

659
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I loved it as a kid.

660
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah.

661
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So we watched, it was a huge, like my brother and I watched it hundreds of times.

662
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
We had all the toys.

663
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
My brother had a Dick Tracy hat.

664
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I got a breathless Mahoney perm.

665
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Whoa.

666
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah.

667
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You did your hair like breathless Mahoney.

668
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I did.

669
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I did like perm so I could look like breathless Mahoney.

670
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I have a question for everyone.

671
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Is breathless Mahoney a terrible character name or a great character name?

672
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I mean, you have to check it against the list.

673
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It doesn't stack up against anything we heard.

674
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah.

675
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
My problem is the Dick Tracy, Warren Beatty, the Warren Beatty Madonna relationship in

676
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
the movie does not, it's boring and stupid and I don't care about it.

677
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't want him to like decide which girl to fuck.

678
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Like get back to big boy.

679
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Like I feel like that's what, watching it this summer, I was like, why is this, this

680
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
is stupid.

681
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Is this, this is cause like, was Warren Beatty like sleeping with Madonna before or after

682
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the movie?

683
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I think maybe during and that's why.

684
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So it all had to be in there so they could have their fun.

685
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's just weird.

686
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It's like weird and tense and it's like, this is not good.

687
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
This is not what the kids are here for.

688
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The chemistry, the chemistry is certainly palpable, but like someone threw a bucket

689
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
at you, not a bucket of water, just the bucket and it just like nails you.

690
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Al Pacino is like the one in the movie, I feel like who like gets exactly what it should

691
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
be doing.

692
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah.

693
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It's the most like Green Goblin-y.

694
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's like so for us.

695
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Like we always love, like with Ivan Ooze, we love a great actor doing something many,

696
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,000
many levels beneath him and bringing all of his acting nuance to just shouting and stomping.

697
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It is so fun when he flips the table.

698
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
He could say, I want, they're trying to say, dad, like in every scene I wouldn't get tied.

699
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I think he does maybe.

700
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I think it's said multiple times.

701
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Oh yeah.

702
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And this is years before Dunk a Chino.

703
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Like, like, I mean, Dunk a Chino is amazing, but like, I mean, this is so, he's so fun.

704
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
This hints at the comedy shops maybe.

705
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah.

706
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Are you guys fans of Danny Collins?

707
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
This movie where he plays like a pop star?

708
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Do you know about this movie?

709
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's like, it's pretty sleepy.

710
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Like it's not a lot to write home about, except that the point is he's like kind of a sellout-y pop star who's kind of a mix of Rod Stewart and Neil Diamond.

711
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And he there was this other path he could have taken if he knew that there was a letter written to him in his folk days from John Lennon that would have taken him on the path to like credibility and great songwriting and artistry.

712
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But instead, he's like an unbelievably successful.

713
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
He's sort of a Neil Diamond stand-in, which just Al Pacino being Neil Diamond is the strangest thing.

714
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And the only reason I like the movie is because they filmed the scene where Al Pacino performed at the Greek theater.

715
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Like there was a Chicago concert, the band Chicago, and he came out in the encore and they said, guess what?

716
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Surprise everyone.

717
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
We're going to shoot Al Pacino singing at you for 30 minutes before you can leave.

718
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah, so I know Joe Wenger told me this story that two other like two of two other UCB guys, I forgot who it was, were like just like, oh, Chicago's playing at the Greek theater.

719
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Let's just like sit on the hill outside and listen, like just listen through.

720
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Oh, yeah, because you can sneak up there kind of.

721
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yeah.

722
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So they're just like sitting there stoned and then they hear like, ladies and gentlemen, Danny Collins.

723
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And then like they hear this song get played.

724
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And they're like, I don't recognize that song.

725
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And then the voice goes, ladies and gentlemen, Danny Collins.

726
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And then the same song is played again exactly because they had to film it a couple of times, but they were just like, are we dead?

727
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Like what's happening?

728
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And then when Danny Collins came out, they were like, oh, that's what happened.

729
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But they had to wait like a year and a half to know what the fuck it was.

730
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Someone told them, but they were totally freaked out.

731
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That's so insane.

732
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Wow.

733
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Like you're caught in a loop.

734
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And what is this song?

735
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And the song itself, I would just encourage anybody to look up because it's clearly meant to be sweet Caroline.

736
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But the song is called Hey Baby Doll.

737
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And hearing Al Pacino try to be, hey, baby doll, what's going on?

738
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And there's a I've watched I'm so obsessed with this.

739
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I've watched the filming of the scene where there's like this lead up to the scene.

740
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:11,000
This lead up to like he's basically trying to say, and here's one I think you know, but with all his Pacino nuance, he ends up saying, and I think I think I think you know.

741
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Like if you were watching this as a genuine concert, like no pop star is as insane as this.

742
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Not even close.

743
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But I guess what I'm saying is I want him to do the full Danny Collins tour very badly.

744
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
We're all we all need it after Covid.

745
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
This didn't come out in theaters, right?

746
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
This is a big movie.

747
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I don't remember this.

748
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It was easy to forget.

749
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I don't know why I know it.

750
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Do a second date about Danny Collins.

751
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Yeah, hell yeah.

752
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
All right, guys, what is the Danny Collins theme park ride look like?

753
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
No, I think it's a coaster.

754
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You can honestly skip 85% of the movie.

755
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Only the music part is all you need to concern yourself with.

756
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So anyway, I was so delighted to see him singing with Madonna and the girls as a Danny Collins fan.

757
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It's so great.

758
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But the right.

759
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:14,000
OK, so the whole thing here is it's, you know, clearly that movie was they were going for an 89 Batman vibe there.

760
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
They're trying to make that their Disney strike back to Tim Burton Batman.

761
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And while it did pretty well and they did merch it out and did the tie ins and McDonald's and everything, it was not quite.

762
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It was like one hundred and ten million dollar movie, not a four hundred million, which is what they wanted it to be.

763
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And that's the money that would have justified doing a theme park ride of it.

764
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And it didn't get there.

765
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So it's like a weird like I guess people are fond of it, but it's not like it was.

766
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It just wasn't like a mega blockbuster, which is a hard, hard standard to hit.

767
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Yeah, it's it was.

768
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah, it was.

769
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
They thought it was they for sure were like, this is this is it.

770
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
We're going to make like so many of these.

771
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Mm hmm.

772
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But can we talk about Warren Beatty and like the special?

773
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Yeah.

774
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Oh, yeah.

775
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah.

776
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Well, so yeah, I think I think you're right that the the the the the romance is tough.

777
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Warren Beatty's I feel like he's just not he's slum in the movie.

778
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah.

779
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Well, you guys feel like let me admit my like not being the most film knowledgeable person.

780
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I think I am lacking in the education as to why Warren Beatty is good.

781
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I don't think that I've seen the movie that like what is what's the big one where I should like and respect him.

782
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah.

783
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah.

784
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Okay.

785
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Bonnie and Clyde.

786
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yeah, I like Bonnie and Clyde.

787
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Is it in the Teralax view?

788
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I think he's in Teralax view.

789
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I think that's super good.

790
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Mm hmm.

791
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'll tell you 70s stuff.

792
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
He was just like really charismatic.

793
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
He produced all them all himself.

794
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Like he was really, really fun.

795
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I know.

796
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Yeah.

797
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Yeah.

798
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:03,000
He when he was a little older, I feel like he was still like I can do it's feel like I feel like he could get away with like this much energy in the 70s.

799
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And then he was still using that much energy when he was older and Dick Tracy and it didn't work anymore.

800
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Bullworth.

801
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Great movie.

802
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Great movie.

803
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Bullworth.

804
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Boy, I've always wondered.

805
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I've never tried.

806
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Town and country seems like a weird cost 90 million dollars and no one saw it.

807
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Like he just keeps occupying this odd spaces.

808
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
This tour who will never stop getting chances despite being so strange.

809
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
The my go ahead.

810
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I was going to he hasn't I think he said it like he hasn't made that many movies also.

811
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yeah.

812
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Mm hmm.

813
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
He's he's in like a lot less than you would think for being like a person everyone considers like a legend.

814
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Nikon.

815
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah.

816
00:45:48,000 --> 00:46:02,000
But so the rumor has been at some point is there a Dick Tracy sequel and he has tried to ensure that this could happen via squatting on the rights.

817
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And a lot of people might know this and it was recently discussed actually between Blank Check and the Doughboys on a recent episode.

818
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:16,000
But if you don't know at some point the film rights were going to expire and Warren Beatty was going to have to give them up.

819
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And instead of giving them up he realized that if he did something if he just put out any filmed media that would indicate that he could still continue to have the rights.

820
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:37,000
So he quickly jammed out a weird half hour special that aired once is the laziest thing you've ever seen is not a narrative film with Dick Tracy.

821
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It's Dick Tracy going to be interviewed by Leonard Malton at a table.

822
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And we all watch this it seems like.

823
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah.

824
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I mean it's the length of time it takes to eat like a club sandwich.

825
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It's like barely 30 minutes.

826
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's not very long.

827
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
There's some very odd.

828
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
A lot of it is just a history of Dick Tracy.

829
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The sit down the Warren Beatty stuff is very quick.

830
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
There's some very odd Mindy Sterling.

831
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Frau Farbissina herself is in it.

832
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Wendy McLendon Covey.

833
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah doing like improv.

834
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It was clear they were like all right we need people who can improv because we have no plan for what they're doing and why.

835
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So they do this kind of meandering scene on the Disney lot where they're waiting for an important person to come.

836
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And if you didn't see the title of the video you'd be really wondering what is this scene and why and we're on the Disney's.

837
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I would like to show this to somebody who didn't know what it was.

838
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's like I can't tell you to sit down enjoy this movie.

839
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Because then when full Dick Tracy in a 40s car and his yellow trench coat showed up to like 2006 Disney lot.

840
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
How confused would you be.

841
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I feel like he didn't plan anything he was going to say.

842
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
He also seems to be like off the cuff pretty much the entire time.

843
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:14,000
He's very it's a much more whimsical take on Dick Tracy that he's playing I would say he's a lot more jokey than Dick Tracy is in the movie.

844
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
He's having more fun you know.

845
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah kind of sloppily talking about how he stayed looking young because he eats a lot of pomegranates.

846
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So yeah so there so in the narrative of the show he is Dick Tracy.

847
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
He is not Warren Beatty they make a little fun references to it.

848
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But he is they're treating Dick Tracy I believe as if he's a hundred and six year old man or something.

849
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
103.

850
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
103 year old man.

851
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I think.

852
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Yeah.

853
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So it's played for it's played for some laughs but they're they're acting as if Dick Tracy is a real life.

854
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
103 year old man who has had multiple media made about him.

855
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Oh yes and he's frequently referred to as like the most famous law enforcement officer.

856
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Like he was a cop of such renown that they had to make a comic and multiple movies and serials in a 1990 film.

857
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Yes and there's winks to Warren Beatty.

858
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,000
They're talking about Warren Beatty playing Dick Tracy and he says he says like oh he did an OK job but that Warren Beatty is more of a knee jerk liberal.

859
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm a conservative.

860
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yes he gives a lot more credit to the actors who played him in old movies and movie serials.

861
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And he's like oh Warren Beatty was all right.

862
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Like he's trying to be self effacing.

863
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:51,000
But then there's a weird part where like he's talking about J. Edgar Hoover wanting to do an FBI Dick Tracy and he goes J. Edgar Hoover he was a great man.

864
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
He was a he was a conservative.

865
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So it's like OK so he's like doing like a in game liking J. Edgar Hoover.

866
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
So Dick Tracy likes J. Edgar Hoover.

867
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Warren Beatty made reds.

868
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Like what are you why are you putting why are you giving so much like shine to J. Edgar Hoover Beatty.

869
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I think it's funny though that Warren Beatty sees Dick Tracy as like a conservative monster.

870
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I kind of think that's funny.

871
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I think that I actually like that about the special like oh that's good.

872
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Well and then he keeps going and he says yeah J. Edgar Hoover good conservative.

873
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Another good conservative Al Cap who is also a comic writer and any good any I think he references this whole dog patch world that we talked about and the parody that you guys just referred to.

874
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Right.

875
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Do they go into that.

876
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
The the.

877
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Yes.

878
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yeah.

879
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah.

880
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And there was a William Randolph Hearst Dick Tracy parody as well.

881
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Secret Agent X 9.

882
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Yes.

883
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Trying to retain the rights to a character the best thing you could do is kind of like slit like treat him like shit in this special and like be like yeah he's like a idiot who likes these dumb political things.

884
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I don't like him.

885
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
This is my case for why there should be more of this.

886
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yes.

887
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Is a fascist.

888
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Let me make another Dick Tracy.

889
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Is there another like something from 1990 that this same thing could have applied to like if I can't remember a lot of 1990 movies but like if if Bill Cosby was going to lose the rights to Ghost Dad and then he suddenly suddenly there was Ghost Dad special and we're going to update everybody on what Ghost Dad's been up to.

890
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Joining us today Hudson Hawk himself.

891
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:01,000
My favorite line was when Leonard Bolton asked him if he would like a drink and he says I don't drink Mr. Bolton it might confuse me.

892
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
The lines aren't all bad.

893
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
They're not all bad.

894
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
They're not all bad.

895
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
No okay jokes I feel like.

896
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But he's also got that weird sleepy.

897
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Blue.

898
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Some sometimes a blueberry.

899
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Like he like gargles a lot and kind of coughs.

900
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I mean like he makes Harrison Ford on talk shows seem like a real dynamo.

901
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Also, they set up a lot of plot lines with all the various like groundlings who are on the Disney lot and I don't think they pay off any of them.

902
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah, they're worried that a famous person's coming and then a lot of reference to their history like you always do this you always freak out you always lose your mind when the star comes and you can't do that again.

903
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And someone's flirting with Junior.

904
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Wait what?

905
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Junior the driver?

906
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Whoever the driver is one of the groundlings is flirting with him.

907
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Oh okay.

908
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:17,000
There's a all of the females are weird in it like the women are so just like enraptured by even being near Dick Tracy and then besides the two groundlings ones there's one actress I don't know but she's just in the sound stage right before Dick Tracy turns the corner and her business before Warren walks on frame is she's just like adjusting her breasts.

909
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Like very full-handedly.

910
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And so you're like so I guess this is what Warren Beatty thinks women do all the time.

911
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
If I'm not around women are just juggling their own boobs.

912
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Or thinking about how hot I am.

913
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:44,000
It feels very poochy this whole special is like you know Dick Tracy should always be on screen and when he's not everyone should be asking where's Dick Tracy.

914
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Did anyone catch this in the credits the director of photography of this?

915
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes.

916
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Did you see this Mike?

917
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yes of course.

918
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Do you know how to pronounce his name correctly because you have worked with him.

919
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I have worked with this director of photography Emanuel Lubezki.

920
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Chivo.

921
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Chivo who is you know the cinematographer of Children of Man and Gravity.

922
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
He's the guy who won three years in a row right?

923
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
He won the battle of White House for three years.

924
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
He's some kind of he's a genius.

925
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I have worked with him on a DirecTV commercial.

926
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Which one?

927
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
What are you doing in it?

928
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I am hang gliding.

929
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Oh it's the hang gliding one.

930
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I hit power lines and get electrocuted.

931
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And we've discussed you being imperiled and like what if you catch wind and end up flying around on it.

932
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So that was being shot by the person who also shot Sandra Bullock hung up for days in a big space setting.

933
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
And it was very clear that he was so much more skilled than the director.

934
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
The director was.

935
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Boring baby.

936
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Maybe I'll cut this out but I won't.

937
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,000
The director was like a burned out weirdo who like was very lazy and strange.

938
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And then like Chivo would be like does this shot look good to him and I'm like you're a genius.

939
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
What does this guy know?

940
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
He doesn't know anything.

941
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And he would like always ask like is this does he like the look of it.

942
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Obviously that's his job but still I was like this man is this man should direct this commercial.

943
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Boy this along with Janusz Kaminski Spielberg's DP shooting cool as ice right before Jurassic Park and Schindler's List.

944
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
These I think are the two best bizarre credits.

945
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So yeah so look there's a star power behind the camera too on the Sticker C special.

946
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Even though then you see a shot where like they're behind a sound stage and there's just like a big sun angle.

947
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Like it's sunny here and shady here.

948
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It's like specifically not well shot.

949
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And then the bulk of it is just a Charlie Rose interview where it's two cameras and a table.

950
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So why did they need the greatest DP of modern times to do this?

951
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
That's a good question.

952
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Very strange.

953
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:10,000
You know with the with Dick Tracy not doing so great there was sort of a reckoning at the studio.

954
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Because this is still like Eisner hasn't been there for that long.

955
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And this happens kind of right before the animation Renaissance and where they'd like you know they've never had their act more together than in that era.

956
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
But you know being that they spent all this money they assumed this is going to be a mega hit and then it wasn't.

957
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It required a lot of like discussion and you know how do we make sure this doesn't happen again.

958
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And that is why Michael Eisner tasked the executive in charge of the production Jeffrey Katzenberg to analyze why this didn't go so well.

959
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And this is in Michael Eisner's biography.

960
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Let me just run through this quickly.

961
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Dick Tracy was used as an example of how we violated our basic tenants by Katzenberg's reckoning.

962
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:03,000
We'd been drawn to a huge talent Warren Beatty paid a very high price to sign him and then devoted enormous time and energy to the project in part to justify our investment.

963
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:11,000
What we overlooked Jeffrey argued was the fact that the movie lacked an emotionally compelling story and characters that the audience could care about.

964
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
They spent all this money on a big star and didn't care about the story.

965
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And that's a lesson that Jeffrey Katzenberg never forgot.

966
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:34,000
That's that's why Chrissy's Court is the compelling streamers saving program that we know and love to this day.

967
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I feel it should be mentioned if you haven't seen Dick Tracy.

968
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And one thing that the 2014 special is kind of a softball on Leonard Maltin's part.

969
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:58,000
If he was really interviewing this guy for real, I feel like he probably should have mentioned that Dick Tracy spends a lot of his police work just blowing horrifying looking mobsters away with Tommy guns.

970
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It's like a very prolonged shootout at the end of this movie.

971
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And they extended that sort of setup into the Disney parks.

972
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:26,000
As you can see from this picture with Dick Tracy holding a Tommy gun at Big Boy and Mumbles and Flat Top in front of the replica of the Chinese theater right at Disney MGM studios.

973
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Those are great costumes.

974
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
They are great.

975
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Awesome.

976
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
They're so bright.

977
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The suits are so vibrant and they I don't think this technique has been deployed much in the Disney parks.

978
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Like latex character masks that are sort of they're pretty accurate.

979
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's kind of like the mask and drive.

980
00:58:49,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Okay, so there was a Dick Tracy presence at the parks despite this ride that we're talking about not getting built via this street scene, which is so much fun.

981
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I wish I could have seen those characters.

982
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Did anybody do you remember?

983
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Did anybody see them at Disney MGM studios or would have been Disneyland for me?

984
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I think I might have actually.

985
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I think I don't know if we have pictures with them, but I remember I have a vague memory of those guys.

986
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Hmm.

987
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I also have now I have a vague memory.

988
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:44,000
We might just have to do a Dick Tracy too because once we've all read more of the moon era, but also I think they did a thing where you know one of those the kid is in the movie kind of shows where like you're put on a costume and and and what we'll film it and watch it back after.

989
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I think there was a thing like that or like a little kid could dress up like Dick Tracy and his little sister would be the bad guy and they'd make a little scene, which I feel like I've seen that on YouTube and the sisters hamming it up.

990
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:05,000
But the boy decides halfway through he is too scared to be doing it and they have to like just keep nudging him to do all the things.

991
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So you're watching him really like limply hold up a Tommy gun that he does not believe in firing.

992
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
He just wants to go to the bathroom or something.

993
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So there's that whatever that was.

994
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And then there was a show which was at both par both American parks called Dick Tracy's diamond double cross, which I'm not prepared with a lot of info about the only thing I'm like super aware of is that there was a point in the show maybe the finale of the show.

995
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:45,000
This children's theme park show is Dick Tracy walking out with a Tommy gun and firing his own name into the sky with bullets.

996
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
It's pretty wild and hearing the like typically cheesy Disney singers like calling Dick Tracy.

997
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
His name is Dick. He's Dick Tracy.

998
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It's so I don't know how they like the tone of how they presented it in the parks versus what the tone of the film is so shocking that this is like it is like an art film that's full of violence.

999
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Yeah, it's a song time and then the score is Danny Elfman.

1000
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Oh, that's right. Right. Right. Right. And it sounds exactly like Batman.

1001
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Yeah, it's like score. You would think it's Batman. Yeah, it's crazy.

1002
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:36,000
How much how much it sounds like it. Yeah, he was definitely Warren Beatty was definitely like I saw what Robert Altman did with Popeye and I'm gonna do a similar thing.

1003
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Like we're gonna try the same thing for more of that. Another thing like that. Yeah, I think I was thinking how I feel the same way.

1004
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I like I wish I liked both Altman Popeye and Beatty Dick Tracy more.

1005
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I feel like that's the more interesting way to go. But don't you I just watched them both and like fall asleep literally.

1006
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Am I crazy? No, you're not crazy. It's I had never seen it. I was too afraid of this movie as a child. I was afraid of the bad guys.

1007
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
They were in McDonald's. They haunted me every turn. I didn't like it.

1008
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I didn't like it. I didn't like there was a Crime Stoppers game in McDonald's. I like the idea of winning something.

1009
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
But I didn't see it till this summer. I didn't watch it till this summer.

1010
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And I think we talked about it before in a show like there's some cool stuff in it.

1011
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
There's that like far away shot that's like a painted background and he beats up the guy in the little shack and the shack is bouncing back and forth.

1012
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
That's cool. It looks like a comic strip. There's stuff like that.

1013
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And then a lot then all of a sudden it'll just be like three scenes in a row of like a back like a diner painted red sleepy dialogue.

1014
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Not much going on. And you're like, OK, well, but isn't there like some scenes are like, oh, they really tried hard here.

1015
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And then some of them you're like, this isn't anything. There's nothing going on in this.

1016
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I also have one of those, you know, nerdy little wiener confessions, which is that at this age, you know, five to seven or so, whenever this was all happening,

1017
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:27,000
because I liked Disney and was so like allegiance to the corporate brand, I was as a little wiener, I was upset that Disney would do something with Madonna.

1018
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I frankly didn't approve, you know, not just the sexuality, but the imagery with the crosses.

1019
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Very not appropriate. And just that they would align themselves with this this deviant pop star.

1020
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Whoa. So I was upset from that from that angle as well.

1021
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
You know, you were hearing that in the house or somewhere else.

1022
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I hope so. I hope this was a parented mother opinion, because why?

1023
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,000
How did I come to this as a six year old boy?

1024
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
It would be very funny.

1025
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Huff and puff. Your mom never said anything and you just yeah, you were just like putting the pieces together.

1026
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Well, that's that's certainly my unfortunate suspicion.

1027
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'm staring at this baby wondering how I can make this baby not be a little wiener like I was.

1028
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Wow. I don't need these Madonna songs. My favorite song is give me that old time religion.

1029
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Pretty much. No, I like to raise you up on eagles wings.

1030
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
That was that was my jam.

1031
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Wow. Thinking about the Madonna aspect now, I didn't realize that I was I was looking up, you know, now I can handle it.

1032
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Now I'm OK with Madonna.

1033
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Don't mean to brag, but and I like I was I just I usually put in Madonna Dick Tracy.

1034
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
She was doing some of these songs on her tour.

1035
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Like when she had the ponytail and the cone bra and all that like blonde ambition,

1036
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:05,000
she would still have a segment of the show where a very theme parky Dick Tracy came out and they danced together and stuff.

1037
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It's it's it really delighted me.

1038
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
It's like the to a song called Hanky Panky.

1039
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Oh, yeah. Well, all of this is on the album.

1040
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I'm breathless, which is like got the Steven Sondheim songs got other kind of songs that would kind of fit in the breathless universe.

1041
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And then it ends with Vogue like Vogue is on.

1042
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I'm breathless.

1043
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I am aghast of that. That's insane.

1044
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
That's the album that Vogue is a single from.

1045
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I had the tape.

1046
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It's it's a pretty good album.

1047
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
But yeah, Hanky Panky got Hanky Panky.

1048
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
If I'm being bad, just spank me.

1049
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I know all the songs.

1050
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I can say you know what?

1051
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I was right as a seven year old.

1052
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
This is wow.

1053
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Scott, were you upset?

1054
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Were you upset when Madonna did Beautiful Stranger and Austin Powers 2?

1055
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
No, by that point I was fine.

1056
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
And also she was pretty modest, I feel, in around that time.

1057
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
You know, she's wearing denim jackets.

1058
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
She's covered.

1059
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
You know, she's showing a little midriff and that's OK.

1060
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
She's in good shape and she deserves to show it off.

1061
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
But it wasn't as many of those Dick Tracy performances are unsleeved.

1062
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
She's showing her bare shoulders.

1063
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Yeah.

1064
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Well, I can get behind that.

1065
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I can get behind that feeling.

1066
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Those Austin Powers 2 people did cast this roller girl, Heather Graham.

1067
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I don't know about that.

1068
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Don't pursue the rest of her body of work.

1069
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Wow.

1070
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
That is a really like grade A wiener revelation.

1071
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Yeah, pretty bad, right?

1072
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Really good stuff.

1073
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
That's full.

1074
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
That's like three years into this podcast.

1075
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
A podcast that's full of grade A wiener revelations.

1076
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
From three giant wieners.

1077
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I'm imagining that you, your mom was trying to take you to Dick Tracy and you're like,

1078
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I shan't.

1079
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I shan't, mother.

1080
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
But mother, her pillowy bosom is too visible.

1081
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I am not of age to see such ribaldry.

1082
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Was it Truth or Dare, that movie?

1083
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I think that during, I've never seen Truth or Dare, but I've heard that like the weirdest parts of it are like that her boyfriend is Warren Beatty.

1084
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
During Truth or Dare and like, and they have this weird relationship.

1085
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I have seen those clips now that you bring that up.

1086
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I don't have anything specific other than to say I remember that it's weird.

1087
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Cause he's like 53 and how old is she?

1088
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Like 20s, late 20s?

1089
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
20s, late 30s?

1090
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Yeah.

1091
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah.

1092
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah.

1093
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Didn't she also, I believe that she, did a Dick Tracy song,

1094
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
did a Dick Tracy song win Best Original Song at the Oscars this year?

1095
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Yeah, it's the only Sondheim Oscar.

1096
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Whoa!

1097
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I'm kidding.

1098
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Yeah, possibly.

1099
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I think, I'm pretty sure, but it's sooner or later one.

1100
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And she performed it and I believe that her date to this particular Oscars was one Michael Jackson.

1101
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:17,000
So in addition to all the Warren Beatty weirdness, and I think there was some vanilla ice stuff going on as well,

1102
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
and there's Rodman in there.

1103
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Am I making that up?

1104
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And then, and a date with Michael.

1105
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Very strange.

1106
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Wow.

1107
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
That Madonna, she gets around, doesn't she?

1108
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Scott is getting, his blood is boiling just talking about it.

1109
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You can't, multiple boyfriends in a couple of years span.

1110
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Pick one.

1111
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
If you're going to wear a cross, you should prove your fidelity to the man you love.

1112
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
You're running out of ringer, fingers to put that ring on.

1113
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You got so many rings and not enough fingers.

1114
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
He, like in 2016, did a round of interviews about dating Madonna that I'm just seeing right now.

1115
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
He's in People Magazine, opening up about the relationship.

1116
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Her doing like this massive, like biggest pop star in the world, doing Dick Tracy is like if tomorrow it came out like Lady Gaga to star in Prince Valiant, the movie.

1117
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So weird.

1118
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Wow, Prince Valiant.

1119
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
How, Dick Tracy was, we rolled passes.

1120
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
When was Dick Tracy created?

1121
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
When did it start?

1122
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
31.

1123
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
31.

1124
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
So how far, we're close to it being public domain.

1125
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Oh wow.

1126
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
We're like 10 years away from public domain.

1127
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Now I assume Warren Beatty will be alive still and clinging to the rights.

1128
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Still making media about how women are in love with him.

1129
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Like make up a little scene where like 22 year olds are like, oh, be still my heart, Warren.

1130
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Howard Hughes, my, my.

1131
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
He has time to make another Dick Tracy.

1132
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Yes, he absolutely has time.

1133
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I mean, he has it.

1134
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
He's only made what that Howard Hughes movie in the last 15 years.

1135
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Yeah.

1136
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Come on, Warren.

1137
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
We were trying to figure out the like Dark Knight Returns angle.

1138
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I think there's a Watchmen angle where like Junior investigates the murder of Dick Tracy.

1139
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Sort of thing.

1140
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
But only if Warren Beatty plays Junior.

1141
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
He plays Junior now.

1142
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
So Junior's old.

1143
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Oh, okay.

1144
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
No, he puts a wig on.

1145
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
He like, he, they do like reverse aging on him, like the Irishman.

1146
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Oh, good.

1147
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Wait a minute.

1148
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:41,000
The rumor, to bring it back to something Jason referenced, the rumor is that he was asked to play the Burt Reynolds part in Boogie Nights.

1149
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
But he said, no, I want to play Dirk Diggler.

1150
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
He wanted to be Mark Wahlberg.

1151
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Is that true?

1152
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I think so.

1153
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
In 1997.

1154
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Yeah.

1155
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
This is what he thought he could pull off.

1156
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
That's a funny meeting for Paul Thomas Anderson to have to take.

1157
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Being like, I think it's like Christopher Lee trying to be Gandalf, but, but weirder.

1158
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yeah.

1159
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Yeah, I'm trying to think that's probably the best version of it.

1160
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I know De Niro wanted to be Robert Forster's role in Jackie Brown.

1161
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Oh.

1162
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And he was like, no, it's gotta be Robert Forster.

1163
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
That's cool.

1164
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah.

1165
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Mike, you had a pitch of how this new Dick Tracy would play out that I liked a lot.

1166
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I did.

1167
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I'm trying to remember what it was.

1168
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I know the name that I pitched.

1169
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
All I remember is the name.

1170
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
That Junior is bad.

1171
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Yes.

1172
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Junior is bad and he turns into a villain named Kid Face.

1173
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And his face never, he's the man whose face never grew up.

1174
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
He's young Charlie Cosmos face on a man.

1175
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Adult man's body.

1176
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah.

1177
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
So.

1178
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
He has to license his childhood image to be made into a prosthetic.

1179
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Right.

1180
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
They would have to do it with masks and prosthetics and stuff.

1181
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I mean, that's like the core of.

1182
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Oh, sorry.

1183
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Did you guys know that Charlie Cosmos is like a very high ranking Republican?

1184
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Yes.

1185
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Oh, geez.

1186
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
A conservative law professor.

1187
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:15,000
His Wikipedia states that he is in the Federalist Society, which is that psycho secret society

1188
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
that tells you like, here's all the conservative psychos.

1189
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
You got to make judges, guys.

1190
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
The kid from Dick Tracy and Hook, by the way, is who we're talking about.

1191
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And what about Bob?

1192
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Oh, right, right.

1193
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Was he involved in like recently Sam Alito did a whole speech.

1194
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Was that to that group?

1195
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1196
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Yes.

1197
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:42,000
So Dick Tracy's kid was involved in Supreme Court Justice Alito's very aggressive speech

1198
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,000
that he just gave that, you know, he put down the Supreme Court case on gay marriage

1199
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:54,000
and a variety of other positive changes that have been made in America in the last few decades.

1200
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Do you think he was...

1201
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Junior's a good conservative.

1202
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Exactly.

1203
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Do you think he was pilled by this thinking that Dick Tracy like was conservative and cool

1204
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and like being like, oh, this is what I want to be like.

1205
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
And then after they finished shooting Warren Beatty was like, no, no, it was an act.

1206
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It was just an act, Junior.

1207
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Charlie, don't be a conservative.

1208
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
He's like, too late, pops.

1209
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:30,000
You know, Q is going to need a new like hero now that somehow logic defying Lee, Donald Trump may be leaving office.

1210
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
So can we can we like do a drop?

1211
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Can we be do a Q drop?

1212
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Because like anybody could just go in and do it.

1213
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Right. So can we convince people that those people that the Dick Tracy mythology is real?

1214
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And then so then before long, they're all shouting about the moon is the way magnets got us there.

1215
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
A big boy is clearly predicting the Joe Biden victory going around.

1216
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I didn't kidnap this girl, Dick Tracy.

1217
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Vitamin Flint Heart is going to run in 2024 and beat Joe Biden.

1218
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yeah, that would be.

1219
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
I mean, that's not let's let's talk about this ride.

1220
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
This is probably the deepest into an episode that the ride has not been.

1221
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
By the way, the rules that we were I was referring to obliquely at the beginning,

1222
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,000
the rules I felt were that Eva, you were not going to learn about the ride at all.

1223
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And we were not going to learn about Dick Tracy on the moon.

1224
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And then we would have a an idea exchange.

1225
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I love that. Yes, I have not Googled once.

1226
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Great. Great.

1227
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Well, perfect.

1228
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And you know, it's well, it's a crazy thing about this, actually, is that a lot of I think the awareness of this attraction is that it was referenced

1229
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,000
in a special that said, here's all the things that are going to be coming to Disneyland soon, almost none of which happened.

1230
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And that special was that special was hosted by your dad.

1231
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I know. And it was the first time I ever heard about this ride was when you guys played me that clip.

1232
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But then I learned more about it.

1233
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But yeah, the only reason you guys know about it is because of that special.

1234
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Right. It's a it's a very odd thing.

1235
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,000
We need to probably hit everything in that list because I don't think a one of them happened.

1236
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Like maybe in general, they say he says like the Little Mermaids come in in 1993.

1237
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
It was like a couple of decades early.

1238
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
A lot of it sounds cool, especially this.

1239
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And this would have been part of something that was like a bigger plan.

1240
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:38,000
They say this ride was going to come in 96 and that that would be the first part of a Disneyland expansion that would have happened in 99 called Hollywood Land.

1241
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And I tried to learn a little more about what would have been up with Hollywood Land.

1242
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Because like where do you put things at regular Disneyland?

1243
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Apparently you would have come into the park.

1244
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
You're in town square over on your right is the Lincoln Theater.

1245
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:03,000
And like that backstage opening basically where the parade exits and enters that they would have taken that over and you would have crossed over there into Hollywood Land.

1246
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Basically in the backstage area behind Space Mountain.

1247
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
So that's weird, right? Space Mountain is huge.

1248
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
What do you do with that?

1249
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:18,000
They would have painted the back half of it to look like the Hollywood Hills with the Hollywood sign on it.

1250
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
This will all be a Jim Hill, by the way.

1251
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Credit to him for the for the rumors.

1252
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Wow.

1253
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Hollywood Land. Do we like Hollywood Land?

1254
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Yeah.

1255
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I don't know that I like the painted Space Mountain.

1256
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Pretty weird.

1257
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
That sounds bad.

1258
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Everything else I'm fine with.

1259
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That little piece of real estate has been earmarked a little bit before for other things.

1260
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So I feel like there is some room there to maybe do something like this.

1261
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
But I.

1262
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Yeah.

1263
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
When did California Adventure open?

1264
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
2001.

1265
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So it made this irrelevant immediately, right?

1266
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Like having the Hollywood section of California Adventure.

1267
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
You don't need a Hollywood Land across in Disneyland, right?

1268
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Oh, right.

1269
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Well, it was also earmarked the Dick Tracy ride and some of the other stuff that was never built was eyed for like the second phase of Disney MGM Studios in Florida.

1270
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Oh, cool.

1271
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Oh, yeah.

1272
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
That would. Yeah.

1273
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Maybe in that same zone, there maybe would have been a little miniature Chicago as part of it, I suppose.

1274
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And I don't know.

1275
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,000
There's like not the most information about this ride, I will say, which is why it's good.

1276
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Well, you know, I'm glad we had other stuff to flesh it out because we don't know a lot because the thing never got built.

1277
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:48,000
But the main details of Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers is you would you would have raced through the streets of Chicago in a 1920s car being chased by gangsters.

1278
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:57,000
And you would have been swerving all around and banking turns in a just, you know, huge scale set and attraction.

1279
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And how do you fight back against the gangsters against flat top?

1280
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Big point, everybody.

1281
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Your car is equipped with a Tommy gun.

1282
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
This would have been a ride like an Indiana Jones like vehicle.

1283
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
But also you have a gun.

1284
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Yes.

1285
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
A real gun.

1286
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
A real gun.

1287
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yes.

1288
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Not a laser.

1289
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
They would have zoned that area for firing.

1290
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
They would say like you have a gun.

1291
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
It shoots bullets.

1292
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Here you go.

1293
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Like in the narrative of the ride, you're firing bullets.

1294
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Yes.

1295
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
You're not shooting ray gun.

1296
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
No, no, just actual.

1297
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Now you can get more information about this thing from a book that we referenced recently by Imagineer Kevin Rafferty called Magic Journey.

1298
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
We consulted this because he was working on Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.

1299
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
He's working on the Creatures Choice Awards, this bizarre attraction that we did at Second Gate about.

1300
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
And this all at the same time.

1301
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,000
The amount of strange potential attractions he was keeping in his head are pretty amazing.

1302
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,000
And he goes out of his way in the book to say, yeah, it's a gun, but you don't shoot people.

1303
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:12,000
We never would have had a point in the ride where you aim the gun at a person and blow their brains out.

1304
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
It's like a shooting gallery.

1305
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
You shoot crates and potted plants and all that sort of stuff.

1306
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Yeah.

1307
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Or is he saying that flat top is not human?

1308
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Yeah. So like, would you like hit like a pot and then it would fall on someone's head?

1309
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Maybe. Or they just would have been like hiding behind stuff and like you would have like made them jump behind something.

1310
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
There he is.

1311
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:50,000
So you were like, you were just like on a car and you were trying to intimidate everyone in the city that you were driving by.

1312
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Yeah.

1313
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Just warning shots.

1314
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:00,000
The crazy thing that Rafferty says in his book was everyone was warning him Michael Eisner hates guns,

1315
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
which is bizarre because Dick Tracy blows away a lot of people in that movie.

1316
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:15,000
The other thing that's bizarre is in the moment when he's pitching it to Michael Eisner and his famous...

1317
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Frank Wells.

1318
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Frank Wells, is he describes it as like, oh, but it's not just a, it's a fun gun.

1319
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Like he uses the term fun gun.

1320
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
A fun gun. It's not shooting confetti.

1321
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yeah.

1322
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Which that to me is a fun gun.

1323
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
For sure.

1324
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I mean, let's think about, look at the Disney guns of all the guns that exist in the theme parks.

1325
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:52,000
There's Buzz Lightyear, there's Toy Story Midway Mania and that shoots rings, that shoots confetti, it shoots balls.

1326
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
What else? What other?

1327
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Jungle Cruise.

1328
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Jungle Cruise. That is a real gun in the context of the ride.

1329
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
It is a real gun, but they've changed a lot over the years.

1330
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
You can't shoot the hippos anymore.

1331
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
You fire in the air to scare them away.

1332
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Right.

1333
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I feel like at some point, because I remember as a kid going to Disneyland and coming back with some guns,

1334
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:21,000
going to Disney World because you would go play on the Ford on Tom Sawyer Island and the shops would have like guns for sale.

1335
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
They stopped selling those.

1336
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
They don't sell bubble guns even anymore.

1337
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Right.

1338
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,000
There's guns in the Haunted Mansion when there's like a draw, a duel.

1339
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Yeah.

1340
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Lots of guns in Pirates.

1341
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Of course.

1342
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Oh yeah.

1343
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
That's got the most guns.

1344
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And that's like, that's pirates shooting guns at the guest's head.

1345
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Yeah.

1346
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:46,000
That is like at the end, the guy on the cannon is just like, got a gun and he's shooting at you.

1347
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Which is pretty crazy if you think about it now.

1348
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
But I will be upset if they take that away.

1349
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Brer Rabbit's gun.

1350
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Yeah.

1351
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
He's playing Russian roulette.

1352
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
That's why they had to close the, change the ride.

1353
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Yeah.

1354
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
The Russian roulette scene.

1355
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Yeah.

1356
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
You should try this too, kid.

1357
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
So yeah, I guess.

1358
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
There are a lot when you add it up.

1359
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I guess, yeah.

1360
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
But never is the guest in control.

1361
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Right.

1362
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Of a real gun like that.

1363
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
That is still pretty crazy.

1364
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I mean, if it's, these were going to be real Tommy gun, like it would have been a two-hander.

1365
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I think so.

1366
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I mean, which is crazy to me to think about like on the Indiana Jones ride every now and

1367
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
then of like, like white knuckled holding onto a backpack, let alone trying to like

1368
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
angle a gun.

1369
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Yeah.

1370
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It's like, you have to have a ride vehicle, I would think that's pretty like stationary

1371
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
in its movement.

1372
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
It wouldn't be so like such a tumultuous ride.

1373
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Sure.

1374
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,720
But that's not what it would have been.

1375
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,000
It would have been an Indiana Jones style.

1376
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,360
It's rumored that they developed that technology for this because there is no vehicle preexisting

1377
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,840
that could give you the feeling of whipping around, like suddenly changing your mind and

1378
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,560
going a different way.

1379
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,280
And a regular vehicle couldn't really do that.

1380
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:15,080
So they needed that like extra boost so that it's a vehicle on top of a vehicle.

1381
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:21,720
I get it, but yeah, imagine going in Indiana Jones, yes, as Jason's saying, and like trying

1382
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,720
to aim.

1383
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,720
How?

1384
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,720
Shooting the snake.

1385
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:31,560
I'm picturing like the gunner also is like facing out the back of the car, which I think

1386
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,840
would be super fun actually, if you could have like two perspectives, like front and

1387
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,640
back, but then you'd be just shooting at the vehicle behind you, which is not good.

1388
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,480
Yeah and you get like, people would get hit in the face with the guns.

1389
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,320
The gun would slip out of their hand and hit them in the head.

1390
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:50,640
Unless they were mounted down.

1391
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,480
Yeah like Buzz Lightyear mounts.

1392
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:56,960
But even then, then how many, your perspective is kind of straight, like you can only shoot

1393
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,600
at things in front of you.

1394
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,600
Right.

1395
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:05,660
Yeah, I just feel like they would have run into some problems if they really did follow

1396
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:10,500
through on a car that was that dynamic and exciting on a ride vehicle.

1397
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:15,220
But they got far enough that they bought an old car and mocked up sets in a warehouse

1398
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:21,260
in North Hollywood and got the craziest detail to me was they got Michael Eisner to sit in

1399
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:27,420
the car with the Imagineers and whip around these sets and like slam on the brakes and

1400
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:31,780
stuff and Eisner and the Imagineers are all crashing into each other.

1401
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,420
And that is so funny.

1402
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:38,300
I mean, I can't imagine Michael like Bob Iger wearing a t-shirt, let alone whipping around

1403
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,300
in a Studebaker.

1404
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:47,860
Yeah, they bought an old car and the driver wore a pinstripe suit in a fedora.

1405
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:51,860
Like you just got out of Sing Sing.

1406
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:53,340
And they like, yeah, and they painted this.

1407
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,420
I mean, like this is where you just lose your mind.

1408
01:24:55,420 --> 01:25:00,020
Like how cool would it have been to try this at this, this ride that never got built pseudo

1409
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:04,860
existed in a warehouse, like up by the Burbank airport.

1410
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:05,860
That is so cool.

1411
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,980
I don't think I knew about the secret warehouse either.

1412
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:12,380
We know where Imagineering is, but now I've looked up like, oh, now I know where the Imagineering

1413
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:17,100
warehouse is, which is I think maybe really where the cool stuff happens.

1414
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,220
It's unmarked.

1415
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,220
That's where we got to go.

1416
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:22,340
Can anyone help us get in there?

1417
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,540
Maybe, maybe nobody's there.

1418
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:27,340
If nobody's working there right now because of COVID.

1419
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:29,940
Let's just break in.

1420
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:32,100
With Tommy guns.

1421
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:39,020
I don't think we're just researching a potential ride.

1422
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:40,540
And then they'll put us in cement.

1423
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:44,820
They'll give us the bath, like Paul Sorvino, where you actually see, you can actually get

1424
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:51,060
to see the wet cement go in his little wet lips, his gross big lips, because he's a lips

1425
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,060
manless.

1426
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:53,060
That's such a creep.

1427
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,580
That's a scary scene for a kid.

1428
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:55,580
Oh yeah.

1429
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:56,580
Yeah, yeah.

1430
01:25:56,580 --> 01:26:01,320
Did you, Jason, think that that might, like, if you didn't behave that somebody might do

1431
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,160
that to you?

1432
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:08,680
I think, yeah, I texted you guys that like, yeah, the cement stuff and then just running

1433
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:14,640
around the beach that summer going like, you're a flat top and I'm going to shoot you.

1434
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:21,680
Jason, did you have a favorite villain as a child?

1435
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,000
I'm trying to think.

1436
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,960
I think it would have been like the more like a prune.

1437
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,000
I think prune face.

1438
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,480
I think I liked prune face.

1439
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,480
Did prune face eat it in that like second scene?

1440
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,000
Like when the kid finds a warehouse?

1441
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
I think so.

1442
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I forget.

1443
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
He think he dies pretty early.

1444
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yeah.

1445
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Yeah.

1446
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,200
They really, they, yeah, they really kill a lot of his villains off.

1447
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:48,280
I think I was more scared of like the Batman trailers and commercials and stuff because

1448
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,520
that is so dark.

1449
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:56,280
But Dick Tracy, the bad guys get their comeuppance, everything's brightly colored and like I like

1450
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,400
the music.

1451
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,560
Maybe it was the yellow trench coat probably helped too.

1452
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,480
Like oh, the good guys, you can see him.

1453
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,480
He won't be in a bicycle accident.

1454
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,480
That's for sure.

1455
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,440
I'll show you guys my favorite.

1456
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,440
It's this guy.

1457
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:14,240
I'll share my screen real quick.

1458
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,240
Little face.

1459
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,240
Yes.

1460
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,240
Little face rocks.

1461
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,240
He's so scary looking.

1462
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,640
I love little face.

1463
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:28,640
Little face looks so much like a thing from another thing your dad is in, Mother Goose

1464
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:29,640
Rock and Rhyme.

1465
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,640
Oh, yes.

1466
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,000
Where he is, what's your dad in?

1467
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I don't remember.

1468
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
He's Peter Piper.

1469
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Peter Piper.

1470
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Oh yeah.

1471
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,680
He's got a big nose, right?

1472
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:44,440
And I think it's Howie Mandel who is Humpty Dumpty and looks exactly like, wait, Little

1473
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,240
Face was the name there.

1474
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,040
Big head, Little Face.

1475
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,040
Yeah.

1476
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,400
I forgot about Humpty Dumpty.

1477
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:56,600
Man, remember when ZZ Top just shows up for like one, they just wave and they go by.

1478
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,080
That was another one of those things.

1479
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:02,840
Because of that and Back to the Future 3, I just thought, well, ZZ Top is the biggest

1480
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:06,400
band in the world.

1481
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,680
By how much they're in kid things.

1482
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:11,920
What else about this thing?

1483
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,960
I mean, well, here, let's do something.

1484
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:18,120
I mean, that's sort of all that we know about it, unfortunately.

1485
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:22,640
I mean, I think the scale of it would have been incredible.

1486
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,320
So they're talking about 96, this opening.

1487
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,320
Indiana Jones Adventure opens in 95.

1488
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,840
I can't picture a world where both of these happen.

1489
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,720
They seem like they would have been the same scale.

1490
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:37,040
Like massive show buildings, really complicated ride vehicles.

1491
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,440
I think you're only getting one.

1492
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:44,760
And it makes me think, is there an alternate universe where this ride opens, it keeps the

1493
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:51,920
interest in Dick Tracy alive such that Warren doesn't have to do the special.

1494
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:57,200
There's like demand from children that he do another one around 1998 instead of

1495
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,560
Bulworth.

1496
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,520
And we live in a more Dick Tracy centric world.

1497
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,480
Is there a mutt?

1498
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,200
Is there a Dick Tracy mutt?

1499
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:09,640
Like Dick Tracy and the crystal skull?

1500
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:14,240
It's like a heavily CGI Dick Tracy suddenly.

1501
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,560
And yeah, there's like a sass.

1502
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,160
Junior's like a teen and he's like.

1503
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,440
He's on the moon.

1504
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,560
Beatty Tracy on the moon.

1505
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:26,120
That's the puzzle piece that has it.

1506
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:30,680
Like what does Warren Beatty think of the Dick Tracy moon years?

1507
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:34,480
Yeah, I think the problem, I mean, I think this is all good.

1508
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,440
And I think that would be for sure should have had a crystal skull.

1509
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:46,640
I feel like Warren in the first Dick Tracy has the energy of Harrison in crystal skull.

1510
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,640
He's starting with that.

1511
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:55,440
So yeah, where would it be now by the fourth or fifth one?

1512
01:29:55,440 --> 01:30:01,280
The CGI would be to like put a false face over his face that is acting and doing the

1513
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,080
lines.

1514
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,400
Can I real quick go back to the movie?

1515
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,360
I forgot to bring this up and I, you probably know what I'm talking about.

1516
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,440
There's a scene in the movie with a stunt.

1517
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:12,320
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1518
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,320
Not a fan.

1519
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,320
The light pole?

1520
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,320
Yes.

1521
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:16,960
So here, here you go.

1522
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,120
This is the scene I'm referring to and Dick Tracy is going to jump from like a ledge of

1523
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:26,800
a building and hit like a grab a pole.

1524
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:33,280
And it's pretty clear that the stunt goes wrong and he hits his face.

1525
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,280
I'll show you again.

1526
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,680
Oh yeah.

1527
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:39,680
Wow.

1528
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:46,280
And according to like IMDB, that is Warren Beatty doing that.

1529
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:49,440
I don't know if that's true.

1530
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,600
I don't know if he's being funny.

1531
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,320
I'll show this one more time.

1532
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,880
It's such a jarring thing.

1533
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:58,840
Let's do a gif of this.

1534
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:05,320
He jumps, he drops a grab a light pole and his head snaps back in such a way that you

1535
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,600
can tell it went wrong.

1536
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,600
He looks injured.

1537
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:13,040
You kind of expect the guys in the car to be like, he hit his nose.

1538
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,040
Yeah.

1539
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,040
Oh no.

1540
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,720
Oh like, yeah, he broke, he broke his orbital bone or something.

1541
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,760
His perfect chin.

1542
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,440
Well now that, and that would go in Crime Stoppers.

1543
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:29,520
That would be the equivalent of like Dick Tracy holding the gates of like hell open

1544
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:35,040
in Mara's temple would be Dick Tracy making the jump and going like, ah, my head.

1545
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:39,080
With audio animatronics, you could perfect that angle.

1546
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:42,640
The head just whipping him possibly back over and over again.

1547
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,640
Yeah.

1548
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,360
But you imagine like Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones.

1549
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:50,760
He's doing all his stunts in those first three movies and he's what is in his forties?

1550
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:55,560
He's not super young, but you can, you can, it's believable that this man is like beating

1551
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,760
people up to some degree.

1552
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,000
And then Warren Beatty just does like, and you can see jumps too.

1553
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,680
That's why I do think it's Warren is like, it's a very like scared jump.

1554
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,960
Yeah, it doesn't feel like a stunt man.

1555
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,400
That definitely occurred to me watching it.

1556
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,400
Like what's up with this guy?

1557
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,840
It's like a 50 year old man going, ah, fuck, I agreed to do this.

1558
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,840
Okay.

1559
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,840
All right, here we go.

1560
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,160
And then just fucking his chin right up.

1561
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,160
He should have had prosthetics.

1562
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:30,200
I also read in the movie, they tried putting prosthetics on him to look like the cartoon.

1563
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,080
And then Warren said, no way.

1564
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,080
That would have been grotesque.

1565
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:39,280
Just like an extra Warren Beatty face, like more face on face.

1566
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,280
Yes.

1567
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:46,080
There's a funny thing in this movie where the, if you're good, you don't have prosthetics

1568
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,720
and if you're bad, you do.

1569
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:54,220
And maybe it answers the question of Madonna, Breathless Mahoney, who's like kind of towing

1570
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:58,720
the line throughout the movie, but you know, I think maybe good at heart in some way.

1571
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:02,520
And your tell for that is that she doesn't have prosthetics.

1572
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:08,920
But I'm wondering about the other version where she got a big bizarre Betty Boop face.

1573
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:15,400
You hire Madonna and then force her to like, to like puff up for three hours every morning.

1574
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:21,160
It makes it easy to be a cop in Dick Tracy if you just have to be like, hmm, well, he's

1575
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,160
good.

1576
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,160
He's bad.

1577
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:25,920
Like, I could trust, I was like, Mandy Patinkin doesn't have prosthetics.

1578
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,840
There's no reason for him to not have prosthetics.

1579
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:32,040
Does that mean all the dancing girls in the Moore scene are good?

1580
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:33,040
They're all good.

1581
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:38,640
Once you turn to evil, your face puffs up like you got stung by a lot of bees.

1582
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:41,600
Does Dick Van Dyke have prosthetics though?

1583
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,880
Or that's, that's a surprise that he turns out to be on the take.

1584
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:45,880
Oh, maybe.

1585
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,920
He's got a little something, I feel like.

1586
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,120
I guess a little something.

1587
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:56,000
But I mean, this does follow with, I hate to do a hacky reference to how all of everyone

1588
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,280
in the outgoing Trump administration are like Dick Tracy villains.

1589
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:05,480
However, almost all of them do look like they have bizarre prosthetics.

1590
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:06,480
That's fair.

1591
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,480
Yeah.

1592
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,960
And I would consider many of them evil if you can believe it.

1593
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:16,240
Rudy Giuliani looks like a grotesque caricatures guy.

1594
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:19,120
That handsome man.

1595
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:22,120
Cigar mouth.

1596
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,120
Pilgrim shoes.

1597
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:31,280
I was thinking about like the most recent like, like guy, the lawyers that showed up

1598
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:35,080
right when the election got called, like, have you guys been following Harlan Hill?

1599
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,080
Oh yeah, yeah.

1600
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,480
Oh, he's like a, he's a kid face.

1601
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,480
He's kid face.

1602
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,480
He is kid face.

1603
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:46,400
And then there's like a cowboy, but they all are really like Dick, they're Dick Tracy guys.

1604
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,480
Like they just a bunch of like a bunch of fucking Dick Tracy guys showed up just at

1605
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,440
the last second to be like, Hey, what about us?

1606
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:55,440
The cowboy.

1607
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,440
Yeah.

1608
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,440
Oh, wait, I'm sorry, Jason.

1609
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:03,640
Oh, I was going to say the cowboy lawyer looks like the Kingsman alter egos.

1610
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:08,160
Like in the second Kingsman movie when like they go to America and all the like spies

1611
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,160
are cowboys.

1612
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,160
Like Shannick Tato.

1613
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:16,160
I, I'm trying to think who else looks weird and do they have a Dick Tracy name?

1614
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,640
Like like Steve Bannon?

1615
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,640
Oh yeah.

1616
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,640
What's it?

1617
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,120
What's his Dick Tracy?

1618
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,120
Two shirts, two collars.

1619
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:27,400
He wears the two collared shirts on top of each other.

1620
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:31,440
Call up, call up pilgrim shoes, two collars.

1621
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,920
I want Biden dead.

1622
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:34,880
You hear me?

1623
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,880
Dead.

1624
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:36,880
Roger Stone?

1625
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,880
Don jr's like cry eyes.

1626
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:45,720
Hey, get bloodshot over here.

1627
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:46,920
Roger Stone is, yeah.

1628
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:47,920
What's he?

1629
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:48,920
He's a Riddler.

1630
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:54,200
Nixon neck because he's got that Nixon tattoo on his back.

1631
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,200
Oh yeah.

1632
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,200
Oh yeah.

1633
01:35:56,200 --> 01:36:00,040
He did have Dick Tracy style amending of his actual body.

1634
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,280
He wears clothes that are Dick.

1635
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:06,560
He like wears those clothes we saw in the picture from MGM studios.

1636
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,560
Like a big.

1637
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,560
Yeah.

1638
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,120
He bought them all from Orlando wholesale store.

1639
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:18,280
He bought them all from that kid that stole, that stole what's Patrick Spikes, the one

1640
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:22,080
who stole the kid animatronic.

1641
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,080
What was the one that went missing?

1642
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,080
Oh, Buzzy.

1643
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,080
Buzzy.

1644
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:31,600
Patrick Spikes who stole Buzzy sold all the Dick Tracy clothes to Roger Stone in Florida.

1645
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:35,320
He fits in Buzzy's clothes.

1646
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:39,480
How do you like my little aviator hat?

1647
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,480
Yeah, I guess.

1648
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:47,160
Could we just keep maybe maybe Trump you just keep calling big boy.

1649
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,160
Oh yeah.

1650
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,160
I think that one works fine.

1651
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,160
Yeah.

1652
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:54,480
He doesn't have Pacino's energy, at least not anymore.

1653
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,920
No, not anymore.

1654
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:56,920
The rest works.

1655
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:57,920
What?

1656
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,920
Oh wait, that's a question I had.

1657
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:02,960
We can start winding it down, but like again, all right, our favorite characters, Al Pacino,

1658
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,840
where does Al Pacino factor into this ride?

1659
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:10,640
What can we do with him that would satisfy one of our this Oscar caliber performance?

1660
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:13,640
He's got to do like the intro video.

1661
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:18,240
He has to like at least if he's shouting introduction like or shouting instructions at the dancers,

1662
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:22,320
he's got to do that to us before the ride at the very least.

1663
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:27,600
And if you stand up, if you put your arms and legs outside of the vehicle, I'm going

1664
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,040
to take this gun and shove it down your throat.

1665
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:34,560
Do you think we could do like a really advanced though, like animatronic, like you get in

1666
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:38,760
other rides like Hanauanaka in Star Wars.

1667
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,480
But oh man, that'd be so great.

1668
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:46,320
Like yeah, like going through the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster's line where the big buzz is

1669
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,320
there.

1670
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:51,800
You get right up close to him and he's telling you what's going to happen.

1671
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,520
And he's really realistic, except that his eyes are like Cookie Monster.

1672
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,440
They're like ping pong balls with just little pupils that dart around.

1673
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,440
He just flaps at you.

1674
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:02,840
You hear me?

1675
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:06,120
No flash photography.

1676
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:09,720
I think you have to have him like the xenomorph in the great movie ride.

1677
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:13,720
He's got to you got to see him from a couple angles from the side, from above.

1678
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,360
Like I'm getting at ya.

1679
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,640
I'm in the ceiling.

1680
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,400
I'm in the ceiling.

1681
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,720
We got the cement ready.

1682
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,200
Like he's working the cement chute.

1683
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:30,520
Oh man, it'd be fun if you were like headed towards the crate of cement and then like

1684
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,520
veers the last second.

1685
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,080
But it's like the crate and it's like the cement's coming down and you're like, turn,

1686
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,480
turn, turn.

1687
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,720
Oh man.

1688
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:38,720
The bath.

1689
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,720
Cool.

1690
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,000
That's good.

1691
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,200
That's just really good.

1692
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:47,920
The cement as a kid, I was scared of like cement and the dip.

1693
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,640
Right. That's what it's called in Roger Rabbit.

1694
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:50,640
Oh, yeah.

1695
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:51,640
Very similar.

1696
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:54,760
It's called the bath and the dip.

1697
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,040
Not the bath, big boy.

1698
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,080
Not the bath.

1699
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:58,840
Oh man.

1700
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:04,760
I will say I was excited to learn that when Madonna is doing the blank, right, the faceless

1701
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:10,920
character, she is doing, I am apparently doing an impression of the blank when I do the stitch

1702
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:11,920
voice.

1703
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,920
It does sound like that.

1704
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,440
Was it Madonna's actual voice?

1705
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,400
I don't, I was trying to figure it out.

1706
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:23,760
You want to stay alive, you do what big boy says.

1707
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,760
Yeah.

1708
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:29,520
It does sound like she's doing an 80 year old Ziegfeld folly girl.

1709
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:34,680
It's before she got more handy with accents, like when she became British for 20 years.

1710
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,680
Yeah.

1711
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:36,680
Oh man.

1712
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:40,600
If you were around at a corner and just giant little face was there.

1713
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,600
Oh man.

1714
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,600
I mean, I'm afraid of big things in small rooms, but I think it'd be worth it to have,

1715
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,600
I mean, I'm just picturing like, this is very Rise of the Resistance.

1716
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,520
I think this thing would have been like Rise of the Resistance.

1717
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:58,960
I don't know, if that ever gets tired for any reason in 30 years, maybe it's, maybe

1718
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,240
you finally do Crime Stoppers.

1719
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:08,060
Just put big boy where Kylo is, splash it all with like red and yellow and blue and

1720
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,000
you got your Dick Tracy ride.

1721
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,880
And Crime Stoppers is the name of the crime tips on every Sunday comic.

1722
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,680
I just connected that.

1723
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:16,680
What?

1724
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,680
Oh wow.

1725
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:18,680
Wow.

1726
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:19,680
And the McDonald's game.

1727
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,680
Yeah.

1728
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,680
Geez.

1729
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,960
I wish this was there now.

1730
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:29,280
I'm sort of, at least with our, wait, how does Dick factor in?

1731
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,280
Well, all right.

1732
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:35,840
So he slams, then is he, is there some equivalent to hanging on the rope at the end like Indy?

1733
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,800
How do you leave Dick Tracy in the ride?

1734
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:41,720
Well, he's got, I mean, he's got a, as you were saying, the telephone pole maybe is the

1735
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:43,400
moment at the end.

1736
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:46,600
Or the light post I say.

1737
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,600
He sacrifices himself.

1738
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,600
Yeah.

1739
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:53,120
Hey, you go on, you go on ahead.

1740
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,120
I got this.

1741
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:55,120
And then he does it.

1742
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,120
He does the jump.

1743
01:40:56,120 --> 01:41:01,640
Which they can use, they can use like the new Spider-Man technology, that flipping robot.

1744
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:02,640
Oh yeah.

1745
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:08,920
So we could jump from the ledge to the light, to the street light.

1746
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:14,120
What if, what if that's him jumping off of a, of a car.

1747
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:18,400
Like he's trapped on top of a car where he was trying to get bad guys.

1748
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:22,840
And then he, but he jumps off in time, hits his head on a pole, gets a concussion to save

1749
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:27,520
you and then you just hear an explosion or kind of like see a little of it as you narrowly

1750
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,520
escape the room.

1751
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:31,440
Then you round the corner and he's there in the rubble like Indy.

1752
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,360
But he says, I blew up the wrong car.

1753
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,960
It was actually Moon Maid.

1754
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:42,440
My daughter-in-law is dead.

1755
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,440
Finally.

1756
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:46,440
Never respected magnets.

1757
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:53,960
Well, but then if there's a delay at the loading and the car stops in front of it, he just

1758
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:58,160
starts, you know, you know, putting on the charms for any women in the car.

1759
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:00,160
The animatronics weren't baited.

1760
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:04,160
It's just like, so how long have you been in the academy?

1761
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,840
What brought you here?

1762
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:08,840
Is that why the ride didn't ever get made?

1763
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:14,960
Is it because they used magnet technology or they relied on magnets?

1764
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:15,960
No rockets?

1765
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:19,120
The state will not approve.

1766
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:23,120
They had to pitch it to his widow and it's actually going to do with magnets.

1767
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:25,120
Does she just gets up and leaves?

1768
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,120
Spits in the imagineers faces.

1769
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,120
Cause of divorce.

1770
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:33,120
Magnets.

1771
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,120
Wow.

1772
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:39,120
Chester Goldman would have been a fan of that ICP song.

1773
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,120
I know.

1774
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:52,280
I'm tempted at this point to say, Eva Anderson, you survived podcast the ride.

1775
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:56,280
However, is there a miniature version of this that we could do?

1776
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,280
Because there was another thing that we wanted to bring to the table.

1777
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:03,640
If you can imagine adding any more to this jam packed episode, do we want to do a truncated

1778
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:07,240
version of what we've been texting about for a little while?

1779
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:10,200
I could talk about it very quickly.

1780
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:15,200
After you guys did the Popeye Malta Village episode, I got very interested in Robert Evans

1781
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,360
as well.

1782
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:22,680
And then about a month ago they announced, I'm a very big fan of like celebrity auctions.

1783
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,680
Which has come up before.

1784
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,360
Jason, who did you go to the auction of?

1785
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:26,360
Oh, yes.

1786
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:31,360
Well, Anthony at GGO thankfully told me about there was an estate sale at an old church

1787
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,000
in Silver Lake.

1788
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,600
It was half an antique store that had gone under and half the Joseph Cotton estate sale.

1789
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:43,880
And I bought a tiny little glass bucket that turned out to be an ashtray.

1790
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:50,080
Eagle-eyed listeners noticed there was a lip for like a cigarette to rest on.

1791
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,720
And I keep pens in it on my desk now.

1792
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:53,720
Wow.

1793
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:54,720
Wow.

1794
01:43:54,720 --> 01:44:01,200
I went to a Walter Becker auction last year.

1795
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,200
What?

1796
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:03,200
That was pretty cool.

1797
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,200
The estate of Walter Becker.

1798
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,200
Holy shit!

1799
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:08,200
I'm paying attention.

1800
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,520
What kind of shit did he have?

1801
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,480
It was like all of his guitar pedals and stuff.

1802
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:19,240
Steely Dan for the listener in case you're ignorant.

1803
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:26,520
And Joshua Gabor, I bought her dad's cigarette case that has baby photos of the three sisters

1804
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:27,520
on it.

1805
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,320
It's a very cursive item.

1806
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:35,760
But anyway, the best thing about a celebrity auction is that there's a museum kind of,

1807
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:39,080
they show all the stuff before the auction happens in a sort of free museum that you

1808
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,680
can go to and check out.

1809
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:44,640
So Robert Evans' estate went on auction.

1810
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:49,280
For one week there was like a free museum at Julian's in Beverly Hills.

1811
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,600
And I went there twice to look at everything.

1812
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:58,080
And it just was crazy stuff like helmet Newton photos of Robert Evans around like naked women,

1813
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,280
like a lot of weird leather couches.

1814
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,840
There was like a lot of very strange.

1815
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:07,080
One thing that was really funny was like a series of really rude telegrams between him

1816
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:11,480
and Coppola while they made Godfather where they're like calling each other psychopaths.

1817
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:14,200
Those were framed.

1818
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:19,840
A lot of like dressing gowns that were very, and like pajamas and stuff.

1819
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:20,840
Oh man.

1820
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:26,680
Wasn't there a, there was a letter about the potential Michael Jackson biopic?

1821
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:28,400
A contract, Scott.

1822
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,400
Whoa!

1823
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:36,280
It was a contract signed saying that Michael Jackson would make a like a bio pic about

1824
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:38,960
his life with Robert Evans.

1825
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:41,960
But only up until 1984.

1826
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:45,960
You have to cut it off.

1827
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:46,960
We all went through the auction.

1828
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:47,960
What happened after that?

1829
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:48,960
Nothing, nothing.

1830
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:49,960
It's all been great.

1831
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:50,960
Don't worry about it.

1832
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:58,600
So anyway, long story short, I did make a bid and I do have to present to you guys.

1833
01:45:58,800 --> 01:45:59,800
Oh boy.

1834
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:00,800
I don't know.

1835
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:01,800
We don't know what this is.

1836
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:02,800
I didn't tell you what I got?

1837
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:03,800
Or maybe you did.

1838
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,240
Maybe I got confused what you bid on versus what you actually got.

1839
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:08,240
Wow.

1840
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:15,720
A photo of Robert Evans, Francis Ford Coppola, and P. Diddy.

1841
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:16,720
I didn't know this.

1842
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:18,400
I don't think I saw it.

1843
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:19,400
I own this now.

1844
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,400
Whoa.

1845
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:24,360
It's kind of a, like a fake like stone frame.

1846
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:25,360
Yeah.

1847
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,200
It's very Santa Fe.

1848
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,200
Yeah.

1849
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:29,800
It's nice.

1850
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:30,800
So I own that.

1851
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,640
I had earmarked this as one of the best ones.

1852
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:35,840
I have it on my phone here as a picture.

1853
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:42,520
There was also a photo of Robert talking to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Jackson

1854
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,520
in a similar frame.

1855
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:47,000
It is very strange looking.

1856
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,360
And then of course the picture of Robert and Sumner Redstone.

1857
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:54,680
Oh yeah, Robert Evans kissing Sumner Redstone.

1858
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:55,880
Yes.

1859
01:46:55,880 --> 01:47:01,080
And of course we think the rumor is that the transcript of Sumner Redstone arranging a

1860
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:06,040
threesome a couple years ago was for him and Robert Evans.

1861
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:07,680
Geez.

1862
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:09,280
Is that photo of that kiss?

1863
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,240
Well, I guess Evans has been gone for a while.

1864
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:16,520
I was just going to say is that how COVID started in America?

1865
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,520
Wow.

1866
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,320
Congratulations, Eva.

1867
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,320
Thank you.

1868
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:22,320
That's quite a purchase.

1869
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:27,880
Is there something you were trying to bid on that eluded you that you wanted?

1870
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:32,640
The little weird Popeye that was like an award he got for making Popeye that was like a pipe

1871
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:35,560
in glass and it had little leaves coming out of it.

1872
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:36,980
You guys all liked that too.

1873
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:39,000
That went for like so much money.

1874
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,760
Like there are some things where I'd be like, oh, this is fun.

1875
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:45,320
And then it would go for like a beyond ironic amount of stupid.

1876
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:48,560
And you'd be like, oh God, no, what are you doing?

1877
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,240
Whoever's doing this?

1878
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:53,280
Nobody really wants this, right?

1879
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,640
And then it would go for like thousands, thousands, thousands of dollars.

1880
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:57,640
Yeah.

1881
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:58,640
I got outbid.

1882
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:05,640
I bid on several lots of photos, like like a hundred plus photos in a lot of like there

1883
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:10,240
would be a picture of like Robert Evans sitting looking like he's a corpse and then Scarlett

1884
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:16,540
Johansson like forced into frame with him looking like she was being held hostage.

1885
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:20,460
And there were just like so like they couldn't even show you all the photos that were in

1886
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:21,460
the lot.

1887
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:24,980
But that like those they went for over a thousand dollars.

1888
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:29,100
Too much out of joke territory, unfortunately.

1889
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:34,880
Maybe a good way to tie it all together is for you guys to look eyes on this this photograph

1890
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:39,060
with many of the parties involved in today's episode.

1891
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:48,500
Why there's Warren Beatty, Robert Evans in a Mets hat and a weird turtleneck and the

1892
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:54,820
King of Pop Michael Jackson looking furious and a woman I don't recognize.

1893
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:59,380
I just I was like, there's got to be a photo of the two of them and then Michael was in

1894
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:01,740
it as well.

1895
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:02,740
What a treat.

1896
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:06,660
I believe late Michael Jackson.

1897
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:11,740
Oh, and look clearly based on the clothes, the same must be from the same event.

1898
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:12,780
Look who's sneaking in there.

1899
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,260
It's all Brett Ratner.

1900
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:21,060
Like, oh, she's the guy who most wanted to be like these 70s disease rats.

1901
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:24,260
Wait, who's the guy below that in the white shirt?

1902
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:25,260
He looks very.

1903
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:26,260
Oh, yeah.

1904
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:27,260
Who is that?

1905
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:29,260
He looks like a pizza shop owner.

1906
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:31,660
That bald mustachioed man.

1907
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:33,860
I'm not sure offhand.

1908
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:34,860
Wow.

1909
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:43,940
Mark, I guess if anyone, maybe we should post this and say, if you can tell us which attendee

1910
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:52,860
of Bryan Singer's Encino pool parties, there is not a good man.

1911
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:59,020
And now I'm there is for sure a paddy wagon parked around the corner just just waiting

1912
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:00,020
for the word go.

1913
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:04,540
Like they need they need to have their eyes on it and tease gross.

1914
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:08,380
Dick Tracy did not make an arrest that day.

1915
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:13,420
I'm remembering an anecdote from the Robert Evans book where he was like, like, what about

1916
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:17,220
being my old lady broke up with Ellie Wood girl and I broke up.

1917
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:19,540
He's like, I got two phone calls.

1918
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:22,060
Both wanted to know if they could take her out.

1919
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:24,940
One was from the Irishman Jack Nicholson.

1920
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:26,500
The other word baby.

1921
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:32,660
And he was like, and he's like, I told him both, like, screw off, buddy.

1922
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:34,100
Like, don't you think about it?

1923
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:37,740
And he goes, it only would listen to me.

1924
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:38,740
And it was Jack.

1925
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:39,740
Listen to him.

1926
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:42,860
Jack did not go out with Ali Mcgraw after they broke up.

1927
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:43,860
Warren did.

1928
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:44,860
Wow.

1929
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:45,860
Wow.

1930
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:46,860
Yeah.

1931
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:47,860
Yeah.

1932
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:50,100
One of the best things in the auction was just Ali Mcgraw's Golden Globe.

1933
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:51,100
Yeah.

1934
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:52,100
I don't know.

1935
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:54,100
There's a child.

1936
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:56,540
Surely the child would like that item.

1937
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:59,540
Ali Mcgraw is alive.

1938
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:00,540
Yeah.

1939
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:01,540
Wait.

1940
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:02,540
Hold on a second.

1941
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:03,540
Yeah.

1942
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:07,700
I don't know.

1943
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:12,740
We need to make this maybe a recurring element of the show is celebrity auctions.

1944
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:17,380
I mean, it's not celebrity auctions, but like right now, and Chester Gold would hate this.

1945
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:22,180
There's a very interesting NASA, like there's hundreds of original NASA photos on auction

1946
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:24,660
that I've been looking at auction ends in a few days.

1947
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:25,660
Wow.

1948
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:26,660
And then, yeah.

1949
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:27,660
Who's selling that?

1950
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:28,660
The Kubrick estate?

1951
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:32,180
No, it's a guy.

1952
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:35,980
It's a guy who collected them, but it's like, there's a lot of photos of like the point

1953
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:40,540
of view of the first space chimp, like just what the space chimp was seeing.

1954
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:41,540
Yeah.

1955
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:42,540
Stuff like that.

1956
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:43,540
We were like, damn.

1957
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:44,540
That's a lot of real.

1958
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:45,540
Yeah.

1959
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:46,540
It's fun.

1960
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:47,540
All the space chimps' belongings.

1961
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:48,540
Let's close his awards.

1962
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:49,540
Space chimp.

1963
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:54,300
There's an Olivia Newton John auction coming up.

1964
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,660
Oh, wow.

1965
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:56,660
Really?

1966
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:57,660
Yeah.

1967
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:58,660
I'll keep an eye on it.

1968
01:51:58,660 --> 01:51:59,660
I'll send it to you guys.

1969
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:00,660
Oh, yeah.

1970
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:01,660
Please.

1971
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:03,180
You can cut this out because it won't be right.

1972
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:09,140
But tomorrow, right now and tomorrow, they're doing a state sale, Jason, at the house from

1973
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:11,220
whatever happened to baby Jane.

1974
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:12,220
Oh, wow.

1975
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:13,220
In Hollywood.

1976
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:14,220
Whoa.

1977
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:15,220
And it looks really cool.

1978
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:18,820
And a lot of stuff, there's stuff like from the movie that's being sold in the house,

1979
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:21,060
but you can get to go in that house if you like that movie.

1980
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:22,060
Wow.

1981
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:23,060
I do.

1982
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:24,060
That's cool.

1983
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:30,220
I wish that the Evans stuff was in his house at Woodland, Woodland, up in the Hollywood

1984
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:31,220
Hills.

1985
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:32,780
Me too.

1986
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:38,380
But you also got to wish that at least an impersonator or if they could pull together

1987
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:45,540
an old sound bite so that when you won, he would say, it's yours, baby.

1988
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:48,060
You got it, baby.

1989
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:51,060
Julia Deadbed's object.

1990
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:53,900
All right.

1991
01:52:53,900 --> 01:53:00,260
And with that bonus epilogue, now Eva Anderson, you survived podcast, The Ride, for the sixth

1992
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:01,260
time.

1993
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:05,980
Let's make it 10 and 20 as many times as you want, please.

1994
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:06,980
Please.

1995
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:07,980
I love you guys.

1996
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:08,980
This has been so fun.

1997
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:09,980
Oh, thanks.

1998
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:10,980
As long as stars are dying.

1999
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,980
Do the gift shop, anything you'd like to plug?

2000
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:13,980
No.

2001
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:14,980
Cool.

2002
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:17,500
Well, that saves us time then.

2003
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:18,780
Wait, Michael, what were you saying?

2004
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:23,900
Oh, I said as long as movie stars keep dying, Eva will still come back.

2005
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:24,900
Eva will be there.

2006
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:25,900
Yeah.

2007
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:30,020
I have a way to play.

2008
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:34,900
I want to play us out with a song that is used in the Dick Tracy special.

2009
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:35,900
OK.

2010
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:36,900
OK.

2011
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:37,900
You know what I'm talking about?

2012
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:40,020
Oh, I think I remember what you're talking about.

2013
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:41,020
Not Hanky Panky.

2014
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:43,500
Not from that Trollope Madonna.

2015
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:44,500
Of course.

2016
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:50,260
It's by a band called The Chance and it is a song called Dick Tracy and it is, I like

2017
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:51,260
it a lot.

2018
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:52,260
It's really good.

2019
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:55,820
It seems maybe not sincere in the way that they're using it.

2020
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:56,820
Like it seems like it's a.

2021
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:57,820
Yeah.

2022
01:53:57,820 --> 01:53:58,820
Yeah, I don't.

2023
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:04,980
It seems like a surf rock freak out song about how much they love Dick Tracy.

2024
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:09,900
There's a lot of this stuff that's floating around like this that you don't like.

2025
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:14,980
I was sent by Jeff Garland texted me a song about lurch that I didn't know existed.

2026
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:17,660
Oh, I love the lurch.

2027
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:18,940
It's his dance craze.

2028
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:20,340
Yeah, I never heard that before.

2029
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:21,700
We've not talked about the lurch before.

2030
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:23,820
I don't think we've talked about the lurch before.

2031
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:25,860
All right, everyone.

2032
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:26,860
Lurch.

2033
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:30,220
And then he dances and it's scared.

2034
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:32,420
That's that big things in small rooms thing I have.

2035
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:34,820
It happens to me when lurch dances.

2036
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:36,140
It scares me so much.

2037
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:37,620
Have you seen the video, Mike?

2038
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:38,620
I have not seen the video.

2039
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:39,620
I just heard.

2040
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:41,820
He performed it on like Shindig or something.

2041
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:44,420
I did not know anything about this.

2042
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:45,420
But that's why.

2043
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:50,780
Yeah, my point is just I'm still discovering weird novelty songs based on characters from

2044
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:51,780
this era.

2045
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:55,660
Well, we'll pull that up.

2046
01:54:55,660 --> 01:55:01,140
And and then thank you to Danny Collins for bringing it into the this century.

2047
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:04,060
Everyone, everyone check out Hey Baby Doll.

2048
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:10,140
But for now, the chance will take us out with Dick Tracy.

2049
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:12,060
Thanks all you Crimestoppers for listening.

2050
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:35,740
It's Mike D.
