1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,160
Club 3

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,880
Breaking the Magician's Code is today breaking the Club 3 curse.

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,760
I'm excited about it, Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan.

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,760
Yes, I'm here.

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm very excited.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,760
For this historic moment.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,720
Yes, I'm also very excited.

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,400
Let me just, you know, keep recording, yeah, keep recording.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Oh my god.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
No way.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
What?

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Whoa, what's happening?

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I just, I wanted to prepare for this and also like the Academy of Magical Arts is like

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,520
right down the road and I'm scared of them and you know, so.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,960
We have a hood going on, Jason's face, my god, what is this, with the famous Masked

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,400
Magician streaks?

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
This is wild.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
What's happening?

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Oh my god.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
You know.

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
It's like he's here in the room with us.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Yes, or today it might be more perceived as a very low budget Black Panther costume.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,120
You know, today I'm not Jason Sheridan on the Masked Podcaster.

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,120
As we're breaking the podcasters code, of course, a visual gag for an audio medium,

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,720
you know, everyone loves it.

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,720
Yeah, yeah, sometimes we record with a video.

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Not today.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Yeah, yeah, not this one.

29
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
Yep, no.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,600
So secretive was Jason's plan that he didn't even let his fellow podcasters in on it.

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,120
I appreciate the secrecy.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Wow.

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Why do you have this?

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,800
Oh, I bought it and Jane made it like you did this for this.

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Yeah.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
A Masked Magician mask.

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,880
I made a Masked Magician mask because Scott, look, you can't buy a Masked Magician mask.

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,200
OK, so you got to buy a mask on Amazon.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,160
And I bought paint markers and I was like, oh, no, I have to breathe this in if I'm going

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,640
to try this.

41
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
So then I bought.

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,680
Do you know what China markers are?

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
No, no.

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
It's clay.

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
It's like a clay pencil.

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,040
I have ones for you guys because they unfortunately only come in packs of 12.

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Wow.

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Clay pencils for us?

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,360
So if we want to make our own masks at home.

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
We have a head start.

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
You can make your own masks.

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Wow.

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,480
Because I was like, oh, they'll smear a little.

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,680
When I worked in post-production, we would write work order numbers on the tape, like

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,160
the Digi-Beta boxes, because you can mark up like China in ceramic.

56
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,920
Revealing the post-production guys' secrets.

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
Yeah, revealing.

58
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Yeah.

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
How do they do it?

60
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
How do they make those marks?

61
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,600
Well, there's a special kind of marker.

62
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,160
It's called China markers.

63
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Wow.

64
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,040
Well, this is very exciting for us and no one else.

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Well, until we take a picture.

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Until we post a photo.

67
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
We take a picture.

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Oh, you're right.

69
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
You're right.

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,080
I can do the like hands on the microphone or the hands on the zoo.

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Yes, please.

72
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Are you going to give it that attitude?

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,800
Are you going to reveal any of the secrets to doing this podcast today?

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,640
Is that kind of part of your plan?

75
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Ooh.

76
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,760
Because like, you know, the internet is sort of changing entertainment and it's

77
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,520
really like we don't want podcasters to sort of rely on the old tricks of podcasting.

78
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
So that's why.

79
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Absolutely.

80
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,480
Everybody's so into the internet now that we're forgetting when we first fell in love

81
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
with podcasting.

82
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
Right.

83
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
Exactly.

84
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,400
So yeah, today we will, I'll say I will reveal some secrets about podcasting today.

85
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Whoa.

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Whoa.

87
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Geez.

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,520
Well, this is, thank God this is behind the double paywall because we could end up with

89
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,120
all the other podcasters after us.

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Yeah.

91
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,320
We're kicked out of the podcasters alliance.

92
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,520
I know.

93
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,480
And yeah, and if a fictional television show is to believe somebody might be after our

94
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,760
lives, if you know what I'm getting at, and I hope you do.

95
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,480
That's why we're recording this one in an undisclosed location.

96
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Exactly.

97
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,480
It is not the place where we usually do it.

98
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,760
In fact, if you see pictures and it looks like places where we've previously posted

99
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,320
pictures of episodes in mid record, it's not.

100
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,440
We recreated our usual forever dog recording studio in an undisclosed location bunker.

101
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Yeah.

102
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,760
An abandoned warehouse that is perfectly lit, kind of.

103
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Yeah, I know.

104
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,600
It's funny how that works out that despite it being off the grid, they did manage to

105
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,880
light it perfectly for broadcast television.

106
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,360
Well, there's so many magician contraptions and stuff.

107
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,960
You might as well just load it up with lights.

108
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,560
They had to put a bag over all the lighting people's heads, all the assistants, everybody

109
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,400
who came to this place, they don't know where they went.

110
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,040
They might as well have been doing a drug deal.

111
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Exactly.

112
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Yeah.

113
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm worried now.

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,640
I'm just stressed.

115
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,600
We might not even make it to the end of the episode.

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,800
That is how if you just suddenly hear a sniper's bullet and we go silent, and then they left

117
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,280
it recording for like an hour and then picked it up, posted it, which would be nice for

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
them to do.

119
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
That would be nice.

120
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,720
To still give us an episode to fulfill our obligation this month.

121
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Maybe parts redacted.

122
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Certain parts redacted.

123
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Oh, yeah.

124
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Yes.

125
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,760
If you've heard even already just a two minute long beep, then that's what happened.

126
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,240
Jason, now I have the question of are you actually going to commit to this the whole

127
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
time?

128
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,800
I feel like you're going to get hot so quick.

129
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,360
Yeah, Scott, it's coming soon because I also can't wear glasses with this on Insane

130
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Time.

131
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,840
So everything's just kind of a blur.

132
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,520
My laptop's in my bag and I'm like, well, that's I'm not going to be able to see the

133
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
screen.

134
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
So.

135
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
All right.

136
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,440
So we better get cooking with the info because it's either going to be foggy for you or inaccessible.

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,920
Hey, there it goes.

138
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
All right.

139
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,120
Hey, we'll put it back on for some pictures.

140
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,840
I was fully like, and I'll just put my glasses on over it, not thinking will cover my ears

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,300
and they will just slide off my head like they did in my apartment when I was testing

142
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,300
it out.

143
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:12,920
So the man, one of the mass podcasters secrets is his secret kryptonite is fog.

144
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,600
OK, fog, ear coverings, they get in the way.

145
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,880
OK, so we have arrived at breaking the magician's code and we have to acknowledge here at the

146
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,360
top that this was this is maybe the most fascinating thing that has happened in the

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,520
poll the entire time we've been doing the Club 3 poll.

148
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,000
This became the Susan Lucci of the poll, many, many runner ups, runners up.

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,560
It had to wait for six months, all told, in second place, lost to Macy's Thanksgiving

150
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,720
Parade Disasters, Jimmy Buffett's Christmas Island, towed ins, trounced by Griffin Newman,

151
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,920
does whatever he wants, despite Griffin himself voting for this topic.

152
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,720
And then it had to wait till the saga was done.

153
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,520
But finally, we've arrived here.

154
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,000
It held firm and, you know, quite a victory, almost, you know, sort of a magician-esque

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,720
build, reveal, a build of tension finally resulting in the prestige.

156
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,000
We have to make this episode.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I know.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's a lot of pressure.

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It really is, yes.

160
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,120
It has to be as good as the film The Prestige.

161
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,400
I think we're, well, with Jason's dramatic start, I think we're in good shape now, but

162
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,600
we've got to keep it up.

163
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:37,400
Second place in this particular poll, the American Girl Cafe, presumably the idea here

164
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,440
would be that the three of us would go to one, which we can do because there's one in

165
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,800
Century City.

166
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,840
I've poked my head in there before.

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,120
Then, you know, when you're in Burbank, Century City might as well be another state, but we

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,120
are willing to cross state lines to the other side of Los Angeles.

169
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,440
Going to 405, yeah.

170
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
Oh, boy.

171
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,120
Is this, this is not the Americana one?

172
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,440
Is that closed?

173
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,960
There has never been one at Americana.

174
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,040
There was one at The Grove that is no longer.

175
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,520
The Grove, sorry.

176
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,440
And it's, yeah, Century City Mall, I believe, is the final location in Los Angeles.

177
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Okay.

178
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
So it is there.

179
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
We can do this.

180
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,400
I might hold this for a month because I have another idea and I'll pitch it at the end

181
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
of the episode.

182
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,360
My final reveal.

183
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,880
But for now, we arrive at Breaking the Magician's Code slash The Masked Magician.

184
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,520
I can't believe that I don't have to type those words into the poll the next time that

185
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
we do a poll.

186
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Yeah.

187
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
I'm so used to it.

188
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,640
It might end up in there just due to force of habit.

189
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,040
But no, it is out and I can finally read, I had to go way back to look up the thing

190
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,880
that was written about it by the submitter of the topic, Michael Darling.

191
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
We know Michael.

192
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,900
We've participated in some fun articles with him.

193
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,760
Thank you for this, Michael, and thank you for your patience.

194
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,400
So here we are.

195
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,760
Let me read his quote.

196
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,680
These 90s Fox specials are classic PTR.

197
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,700
It's mostly forgotten bullshit that felt like a big deal at the time.

198
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,200
The mysterious masked magician was going to reveal magic's biggest secrets at great personal

199
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,440
risk to his reputation in the magic community and perhaps his life.

200
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,640
Of course, when his face was eventually revealed, it turned out to be some guy most folks had

201
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,480
never heard of.

202
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,240
It's magic and 90s nonsense, two of PTR's favorite things in one masked package.

203
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Quite a pitch.

204
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Thanks, Michael.

205
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Sorry it takes so long.

206
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:34,400
And Michael, you know, you could not have been more right in terms of like highly anticipated

207
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,240
because any time one of these specials was coming, I got so excited.

208
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,760
I watched, I believe I watched all of these.

209
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Yeah, I think I did too.

210
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,920
And it felt very much like the excitement of like, we're going to a theme park in a

211
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
few days.

212
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,040
Like, we're going to learn magic's biggest secrets.

213
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,880
And I also felt very anxious, like, he's breaking the magician's code.

214
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,240
I'm not supposed to know this stuff.

215
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,640
Yeah, it's really brazen that they would do this.

216
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,120
Like something that should be done, you know, hundreds of years of secrets just suddenly

217
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,120
spoiled in front of millions of people on primetime television.

218
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,760
The edginess of you're watching something coming from an undisclosed location.

219
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,800
Like is this, do they know, does Fox realize this is on?

220
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,540
Is this a pirate broadcast?

221
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,540
What happened here?

222
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,680
Yeah, I mean, it's in, we've said a million times in the genre of Fox doing bad, like

223
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
alien autopsy.

224
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,440
These are some shows that have a little edge to them.

225
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,240
And as kids, especially, you were like, well, Fox is the renegade network.

226
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,400
They show the Simpsons and they show real aliens that are dead.

227
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,200
They're willing to show a child saying, I, Carumba.

228
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,640
And then on top of it, yeah, they will just expose government secrets, break important

229
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,640
codes, and get a little bit sexy.

230
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Yeah.

231
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Oh yeah, Models, Inc.

232
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Get out of town.

233
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
You kidding me?

234
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:12,400
The more modern theme park thing is the amount of punctuation in these, because it's alien

235
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:20,400
autopsy colon factor fiction, breaking the magician's code, colon maggots, magics, magics.

236
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,360
Well, this guy's a maggot breaking the code.

237
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,760
Magics biggest secrets finally revealed.

238
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,400
Did they use factor fiction though, the same with the Jonathan Frakes show?

239
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,120
I think it's just a phrase.

240
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
But I'm saying, did they use that twice?

241
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,440
Oh, I guess they kind of did.

242
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Oh, possibly.

243
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Yeah.

244
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Yeah.

245
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,600
I mean, that's the title I'm seeing.

246
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,680
Can I quickly derail the episode real quick?

247
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Of course.

248
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
I met Jonathan Frakes.

249
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
What?

250
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Last week.

251
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
What?

252
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Whoa, Mike.

253
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Wow.

254
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
By complete happenstance.

255
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,200
I won't say where, just because I'm like, I don't want to dox him.

256
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,520
You're heading into this thinking like, I hope that I can dovetail this into mentioning

257
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,320
those specialists so that I can mention that I met Jonathan Frakes.

258
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,640
I would have told you guys, but I was like, I got to save it for the show.

259
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Yeah.

260
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Yeah.

261
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
I met Jonathan Frakes.

262
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Whoa, why?

263
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,360
Just by normal, undisclosed place, just that normal people go to.

264
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Really?

265
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,860
Just me and him sitting on a bench.

266
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,860
At the American Girl Cafe.

267
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,040
It was not the American Girl Cafe.

268
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,200
At the toilet store?

269
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Is that why you don't want to talk about it?

270
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
We were not at the toilet store.

271
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Because it's a little private.

272
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
It was a little private.

273
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Yeah.

274
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Yeah.

275
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
But I was like, oh shit.

276
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
How do I do this?

277
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Do I just play it cool?

278
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,480
Do I just go, excuse me, big fan or whatever, and let it go, or do I just give it up to

279
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
this guy?

280
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,480
And I gave it right up to him.

281
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,800
I go, excuse me, I'm a huge, huge fan of yours.

282
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,680
And I was like, book hard season three, you're acting, so I'm just like, I started rolling.

283
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,720
I was like, let's give it to Jonathan Frakes.

284
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Sure.

285
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,480
There's other people I would have been a little bit playing it cool, but I was like, really

286
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,640
just, I just gave it all to him.

287
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,200
And I was like, there should be more of these, you guys were in such good shape, I didn't

288
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
say good shape.

289
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
But you guys, you were like in such top form, I go, I want to see more seasons of all of

290
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
you together.

291
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It was so fun.

292
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,720
Sometimes these were, I'm just, I'm like, I lost control.

293
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,200
Did you give him a chance to say anything?

294
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Yes.

295
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
And he said, he was so, he was, he knew exactly how to do it.

296
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,800
Like I've seen him in interviews before where he was like talking to Shatner and he's like,

297
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,880
well, how do you think like when somebody wants to approach you to say something nice,

298
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,040
how should they approach you, Bill?

299
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,720
And he's like, well, with money, maybe, like you can tell Bill hates it.

300
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,440
And Frakes is like, Frakes said like, I'm easy people, like say something nice to me.

301
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Okay.

302
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
I assumed he would be receptive.

303
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,400
You knew a vibe, because you've like prepared yourself for the possibility of this moment.

304
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,900
This is something I have trained for my whole life, is to gush to Jonathan Frakes' face.

305
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
And I did it.

306
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,080
And I think I did a pretty, like 80% of what I wanted to gush.

307
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Wow.

308
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,440
That's tough to suddenly summon, to like not be prepared.

309
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,920
This is not a, you know, this isn't like a story I forget if we've told where you guys

310
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,280
met Bruce Springsteen and you had hours in line.

311
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Right.

312
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
And that was too quick.

313
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,920
I was not prepared for this.

314
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,960
So I was like 80%, like I felt good about it.

315
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Can you give us any specifics he?

316
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,040
Well, he started asking me, like he was like asking me about, there's a room, like not

317
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,520
rumor, but like the guy who show ran Picard season three wants to do more Star Trek and

318
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,200
he's been pushing for it online.

319
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,600
And Frakes like, well, do you want to see the Star Trek legacy that they've been talking

320
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
about?

321
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,140
I go, well, of course I want to, like he started asking me questions.

322
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,860
He started talking about the Picard season one and two and then other stuff he's directing

323
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
within Star Trek.

324
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,860
Okay.

325
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,860
And so he was, he was very, he was a pro as far as like handling a lunatic.

326
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,820
What are you, what are you getting today, Mike, Kohler, American standard, like what's

327
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
your toilet choice?

328
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,820
We were both testing out toilets.

329
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,420
And you just happened, you ended up next to each other.

330
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
So you're stuck in one plea.

331
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
He has to talk to you.

332
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
Yeah, exactly.

333
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,260
So yeah, anyway, no, I just, I didn't get to the factor.

334
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,620
I didn't get to be on the belief or anything.

335
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,580
I just basically was Star Trek all the way.

336
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Sure.

337
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
And I, uh, you got to prioritize.

338
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,380
I got, yeah, I, yes.

339
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
And then, yeah.

340
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,220
So anyway, it's just a quick, quick story there.

341
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,220
There's not too much more.

342
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,220
I don't want to say.

343
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,220
Geez.

344
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,220
Has it been hard to keep that inside?

345
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,220
Yes.

346
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,540
I've told every single person that knows who that is.

347
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,460
I haven't told anyone who doesn't know who that is.

348
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,540
So it's me and Daniel Roebuck to not tell you guys immediately, then you need the gratificate.

349
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,180
I got to tell everyone else.

350
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,180
Yes.

351
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
I told every, yes.

352
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
I texted Andrew Grissom.

353
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
I said, holy shit.

354
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
I just met Jonathan Franks.

355
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Texted Lindsay.

356
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,820
You texted with, through handshaking.

357
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,260
I sent multiple voice memos to people too, like explaining the whole situation.

358
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,780
You described it all out loud.

359
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,780
Uh huh.

360
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
Yeah.

361
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,780
This is an interesting.

362
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,780
Yeah.

363
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
Did you just feel like that was going to be more efficient?

364
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,780
Yeah.

365
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
Yeah.

366
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
Then typing it out or just voice.

367
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,940
Cause it, cause it would also be easier than just doing the talk to text, which sometimes

368
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
screws up.

369
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
Oh, sure.

370
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
So anyway, I thought this Fox.

371
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Who's Jonathan Flakes?

372
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,860
Oh, the cereal man, the inventor of flakes.

373
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
The idea of flakes.

374
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,860
He's still around.

375
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,860
Yeah.

376
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,860
Uh, congratulations.

377
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,860
Thank you.

378
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Wow.

379
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Big day.

380
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,860
Oh my God.

381
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
You're very excited.

382
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,100
Well, I hope you get a second round so that that one can be the major of that one can

383
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
be alien autopsy.

384
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Wait, no, I'm sorry.

385
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,300
Alien autopsy is the Fox one, uh, it mentioned in Jason's list.

386
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,620
What was his show again?

387
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,860
Beyond belief factor fiction.

388
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,780
That was not Fox that aired.

389
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,780
No, that was Fox.

390
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,780
That was Fox.

391
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,780
Oh, okay.

392
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,980
Cause I think I consider that all in the same genre of these shows where like it's a little

393
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,980
bit out there, like a little bit dangerous.

394
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,780
Like these are true fucked up stories and then some of them are fake.

395
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,780
Yes.

396
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,780
Yeah.

397
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Yeah.

398
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,780
How did they get away with it?

399
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,780
Well, some of it is entirely made up.

400
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,780
Maybe most of it was.

401
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:44,180
Let me bring up a, uh, I'll immediately take us into a, uh, a guy a little bit because

402
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,900
the background of this, I mean, we have perfectly painted the picture of the era that results

403
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,020
in this mass magician special series of specials that, uh, it probably is its biggest victory.

404
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,220
But like, yeah, late nineties Fox is getting edgy.

405
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,500
There's a big like specials budget.

406
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,620
Uh, I think they start calling it like alternative programming.

407
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,060
They, you know, even that has its own like air of mystery.

408
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
No, no, no.

409
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
Not specials.

410
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,060
That's not special enough.

411
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
Yeah.

412
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Alternative programming.

413
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,460
And so this whole, there's, yeah, there's alien autopsy factor fiction.

414
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:18,500
World's wildest police chases, celebrity boxing, the very, very sad affair where Tanya Harding

415
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,060
beat the shit out of Paula Jones.

416
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:28,460
What is that pairing an athlete versus a woman who had bad things after, uh, anyway, this

417
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,100
all grew out of the reign of a guy who I can't believe I've never brought up on the show

418
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,140
before a guy named Mike Darnell.

419
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,260
I'm going to ask both of you and the listeners at home to please Google image Mike Darnell

420
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,540
and just give me an auditory reaction to what you find because he was really the czar of

421
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,900
all this and modern reality television in general.

422
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,660
American Idol is this guy.

423
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,820
Uh, I'm sure I'm forgetting.

424
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,020
I think like almost every major reality show, have you seen this gentleman before?

425
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,700
I have seen this guy.

426
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,140
Any, uh, anything you want to say to describe him and he was anything you want to call out

427
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,540
about his style.

428
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,380
He's got hair like Howard Stern hair.

429
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
Yes.

430
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,380
Absolutely.

431
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,020
Which a lot of scarves, leather jacket.

432
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
Yeah.

433
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,460
Uh, I'm trying to think.

434
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,460
Yeah.

435
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,420
What are some Steven Tyler, little Steven influence.

436
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,420
Very.

437
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
Yes.

438
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
Yes.

439
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
Both that.

440
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
Yeah.

441
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
These are all in his vision board.

442
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,420
Absolutely.

443
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,420
Yeah.

444
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,420
And it's like, I can't tell if that's a, I guess it's not a wig, but it could be a wig.

445
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,460
It looks so wiggy.

446
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,700
It's not the, it's kind of Jeff Lin also, and it's not like a natural hair color for

447
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,140
a man his age to have.

448
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,700
You can tell if he's the guy responsible for American Idol, then maybe he, his whole

449
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,180
style is in some ways a tribute to, uh, season one's Justin Guarini.

450
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,780
Oh, he does look like Justin Guarini.

451
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,500
He's a little bit Justin Guarini.

452
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Yeah.

453
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,540
Um, he also, he's got this beard in some of these photos that makes no sense.

454
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,820
It looks drawn on.

455
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,340
Well, that happens sometimes with some of these gentlemen who draw a beard on.

456
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,300
That is so real.

457
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
Or just die.

458
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,540
The reason why it looks drawn on is because they drew it on.

459
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,540
Yeah.

460
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,860
I, I don't want to get into like celebrity plastic surgery and celebrities.

461
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,860
Don't lie.

462
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,860
You want to get into it.

463
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,860
I do.

464
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,860
I would love to.

465
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
Okay.

466
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
You're right.

467
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,140
I would love to get into it, but we can't do it for many reasons.

468
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,780
Um, but I'll say this.

469
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:29,060
There are some older male celebrities who I do think do some, like, there's like a technique

470
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,860
that some of them employ that is to like color in, uh, probably a gray beard.

471
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Sure.

472
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,940
And perhaps just by doing sort of stubble and dyeing it versus the full beard that's big

473
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,460
and dyed, which would stand out more.

474
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,420
This is the choice they've made to try to reduce the like appearance of, of, uh, oh,

475
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,420
old, oldness.

476
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
No, nothing weird.

477
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,540
Cause then, then you just look like a living Homer Simpson.

478
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:00,060
You just look like you have an animated five o'clock shadow on your face at all times.

479
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,180
And that's much better than just then having some gray hair.

480
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,900
So much of, especially male plastics, I mean, I guess plastics in general, so much of it

481
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:14,580
is just to, when somebody's on TV or in a photo is just to make, uh, like have the person

482
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,900
who's watching be a little bit fooled about the age and see, and the longer you can fool

483
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,300
the brain into forgetting how old this person is, the better the situation is, the better

484
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,940
whatever you're doing to your face or head is.

485
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,140
Cause sometimes I go, Oh, that person looks really good.

486
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,700
And then I go, Oh, they're 70 years old.

487
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
That's, that's fantastic.

488
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,220
And sometimes you go, Oh, it's like they painted on a young person's face and hair.

489
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
Well, yeah.

490
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,820
What it starts to lead to is where like all of the, the eerie effects that you see in

491
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,640
current shark tank, where all of the age defying plastic surgery has started to come off the

492
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,500
rails in the last one to two years, all at the same time.

493
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,740
And it's like, wait, how can it be all of them?

494
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,740
Well, cause they probably all like, we're making the big shark tank money at the same

495
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,220
time and it only lasted for 10 years.

496
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,100
And now it's all synced up as the, as their faces start to make no sense.

497
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
And I'm not knocking it.

498
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,820
Cause in 10, 15 years, I'm going to have this drawn on a parent.

499
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,580
I'm going to have, I was wondering if you had looked into it because you want to do

500
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
it.

501
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
Yes.

502
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
I know all about it.

503
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,580
I know it all about it.

504
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
And I know what my options are.

505
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,220
So you're, so listener again, if you didn't already, please Google image Mike Darnell.

506
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,980
If you want to see a future vision of Mike Carlson, it makes sense because you, you have

507
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,740
previously said that you think that Steven Tyler, it looks good.

508
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,380
I do think he looks good for what his, he's never, he's always looked like kind of an

509
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,900
interesting odd guy and he looks pretty good in his seventies.

510
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
All things considered.

511
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
I think.

512
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
Okay.

513
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
Yeah.

514
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
Now I did.

515
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,220
I, you say that I had a late night comedy job that involved almost weekly writing jokes

516
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,540
about how Steven Tyler looks absolutely batshit insane, but you're entitled to your own opinion.

517
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,540
But he always has looked insane.

518
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
Yes, that is true.

519
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
It's a different situation.

520
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,460
He's keeping up the insanity.

521
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,260
Anyway, I just had to mention Mike Darnell and this guy genuinely for the insanity of

522
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,900
the look, he boy, did he transform, uh, reality television.

523
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,420
I think he, he took specials into a place that's not like, unfortunately for you, Mike,

524
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,140
that is no longer like with Ruth Buzzi.

525
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
I know.

526
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,020
Uh, but Paul and I, like he updated it.

527
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,320
He made it scary.

528
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,640
And I think that the big thing that these specials do, the mass magician specials is

529
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,200
they extract the scariness, the moodiness, the building of tension that essentially there's

530
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,140
like 20 minutes of stuff happening over the course of an hour.

531
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,120
And we stretch it out with just like music and music and dramatic pauses.

532
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:48,120
I feel like what these specials are trying to do is take the David Copperfield style

533
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,680
and do it without David Copperfield.

534
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,480
How do we build like an hour of mysterious magic without name recognition?

535
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:06,120
Well, we get some obscure guy, we make him a superstar with the mystery of the mask.

536
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,480
And I feel like it like brought magic back, you know, in a way, like in a way what the

537
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,440
guy ultimately declared he was trying to do isn't wrong because this, this kind of bridges

538
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,480
the gap between the early nineties Copperfield specials and the later, uh, Chris angel mind

539
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
free.

540
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
That's true.

541
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Yeah.

542
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,880
It kind of like, it keeps magic momentum going during that lag.

543
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:36,480
Well, I read, I, I searching mass magician, I ended up on a couple of magicians web pages

544
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,920
and one guy, I broke the code.

545
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:47,080
One guy still seemed pretty pissed and little angry.

546
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,200
Another guy was like, yeah, it's whatever.

547
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,720
A lot of these solutions are the, can you say names of these magicians?

548
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,600
I don't have the names in front of me.

549
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,080
I don't want to put them on blast, but the casual guy was like, yeah, some of these solutions

550
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,320
are how it was done like a hundred years ago, but there's different techniques now.

551
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Yes.

552
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,360
In the aftermath that like, okay, yes, he exposed one way to do it, but it's not like

553
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,080
you could just like use this as a, a cliff notes guide and just become a magician yourself.

554
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,120
And he was like, yeah, magic's always had a lot of competition, but like the year these

555
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,240
specials came out, the first Harry Potter book came out and that kind of, you know,

556
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,040
got people thinking about magic more.

557
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:37,240
And then the next year or two, like the David Blaine special started and that got people

558
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,160
a little more interested in magic.

559
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
That's a funny thing though.

560
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,240
And maybe that's true, but nothing I'd ever considered that Harry Potter, which is fantastical

561
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,160
made people want to do practical, like practical, like real world magic.

562
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,480
I guess, I guess this seems funny to me, like why, like there's, they're, they're real tricks

563
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
in the book.

564
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Like they do.

565
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
They're real wizards.

566
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,360
So yeah, but it does wizard, wizardry inspire people to be magicians.

567
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
I don't know.

568
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,880
If you start fiddling around with it and then you discover, what if you're, you're the one

569
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,360
who actually discovers that magic is real, nobody ever, nobody ever tried enough.

570
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,080
No one tried Harry Potter tactics in the real world.

571
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,400
And I guess, look, wizards was magic and fantastical magic.

572
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
You mean the club?

573
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
The club, of course.

574
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Wizards.

575
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
The City Wall Club.

576
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Wizards.

577
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,760
Which I can't, you know, of course that kept magic in the air, the time before this special,

578
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
these specials happened.

579
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:41,840
So the initial run was four specials, which aired between November, 1997, October, 1998.

580
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,400
As you said, Jason, a formative time, I had nothing better in my life going on than these.

581
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,760
I feel like I would buzz about them for a week before and think about them for days

582
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,080
after real events.

583
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,520
And just, and that first one, you got to go back to like, they're doing what?

584
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,400
What are they going to do on TV?

585
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,560
They're going to destroy an industry forever.

586
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
This, I must see.

587
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,120
And boy, it came out of the gate, huge, 28 million people, I think, that first one.

588
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
That's unbelievable.

589
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
Wow.

590
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:20,400
24, 24.2, at the time, the highest rated special ever on Fox.

591
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,520
And they kind of diminished as they went, and then thus they had to do the unmasking

592
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,840
for the fourth one to kind of like dredge up the interest again.

593
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,960
You know, we've definitely talked before about, you know, the context, there's no need again

594
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,200
to go over like, hey, nobody actually watches anything now the way they watch these things.

595
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,520
But it still is astounding.

596
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
24 million viewers.

597
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,560
And it still wasn't the top viewed thing of the week.

598
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:47,680
That went to CBS TV movie Borrowed Hearts with Roma Downey, Eric McCormick and Hector

599
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
Elizondo.

600
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Wow.

601
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,080
What is going, what is this world where, and again, a stat that's always staggering is

602
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,200
how I think the succession finale got three million viewers, 24 million for Mesmagician

603
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,000
and it still wasn't enough to dethrone Hector Elizondo.

604
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Gosh.

605
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
What a time.

606
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What a different time.

607
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,360
Yeah, really.

608
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,480
Which it feels like it's 300 years ago.

609
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Yeah.

610
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Yeah.

611
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,320
I mean, it's certainly been enough that there's been like several media shifts, you know,

612
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,600
obviously everything splintered and now we all know all the best stuff is AI and you know,

613
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,200
there's been that shift in the last month or so.

614
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,640
I want to, I want to look up more about alien autopsy because as soon as I was like wrapping

615
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,080
up last night, I was like, oh, this is kind of like alien autopsy, which I think was too

616
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,880
spooky for me.

617
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
Yeah.

618
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,280
I don't think I ever went into it yet.

619
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,640
The whole, the notion of like, I think I was scared to look up whatever they were going

620
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,400
to do about Bigfoot.

621
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,480
Like what if that, what if that is so scary?

622
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Like the thing in signs, like when the, when the alien walks by in signs and all the kids

623
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
scream.

624
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
I was like, whatever.

625
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,880
I don't even want to begin to know what alien autopsy is.

626
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Yeah.

627
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,360
But I want to know what the readings were for that.

628
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
Yeah.

629
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
I'm sure they were good.

630
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Yeah.

631
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,320
This kind of bullshit, I think could be on the table in general, especially, you know,

632
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,240
again, we'll see how this goes, how people like it.

633
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,840
You know, I want to talk about aliens.

634
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
So.

635
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
Oh, great.

636
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,840
So this will be the, so this will be the end for the genuine Mike alien.

637
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Okay.

638
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Yeah.

639
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Great.

640
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,680
Um, so, uh, this speaking of, of aliens, we, we are in a location that can't be revealed,

641
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,280
which is wonderfully lit, a big, a very dark blue warehouse.

642
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:42,960
And the first image you see is, uh, an actor in a black leather jacket and, uh, uh, with,

643
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,420
you know, an imposing vibe and kind of a gritty voice.

644
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,200
And I never thought about this guy before.

645
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,760
I didn't know who he was.

646
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,960
He is Mitch Pileggi, who is, uh, you know what, actually, I'll just read, let me go

647
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,080
back to, I cut something from Michael's quote, uh, the tone of the specials can be best described

648
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,680
as self-serious cheese featuring sometimes jokey narration from a sleepwalking Mitch

649
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,480
Pileggi, the X-Files own director Skinner.

650
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,960
Are you guys X-Files fan?

651
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
Oh yeah.

652
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Okay.

653
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
So, you know, you know all about this guy.

654
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Yeah.

655
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,720
Every Sunday, I, speaking of being freaked out, but like, I didn't make the connection

656
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
by the X-Files.

657
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
You mean?

658
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Oh yeah.

659
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Yeah.

660
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,160
It was an appropriate level of spooky.

661
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Yeah.

662
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,240
You know, um, made you fear the future.

663
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
It made me fear the future for sure.

664
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Uh, uh, Scully's.

665
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
Was it fear the future?

666
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Was it fight the future?

667
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Fight the future.

668
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Okay.

669
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
Okay.

670
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
Nevermind.

671
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
I was trying to fight it because I was scared of it.

672
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
There you go.

673
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Yes.

674
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,480
Um, uh, Scully's skepticism kept us all grounded so we didn't get too scared.

675
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Uh.

676
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Dana Scully.

677
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Yeah.

678
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Dana Scully.

679
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,280
And she was, she was a hottie with a body, just like the assistants in this thing.

680
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
What?

681
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,600
Well, some of the narration, that was the thing I was going to bring up.

682
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,520
Some of this narration is not each particularly well.

683
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,320
But you're also letting your feelings be known about Agent Dana Scully.

684
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,320
A hottie with a body.

685
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:13,920
I don't, I, I don't think I, uh, am the first person to like comment on Gillian Anderson

686
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
or Dana Scully.

687
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,040
I also wanted my hair to look like David Duchovny at the time.

688
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
I know.

689
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Yeah.

690
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
When you were in sideburns era.

691
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
We talked about it.

692
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Exactly.

693
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Yeah.

694
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
So I'm like in eighth grade or freshman, whatever it was.

695
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,760
And I was like, this is the coolest guy I've ever seen.

696
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Cool hair.

697
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,760
This is before a Californ occasion.

698
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
That's right.

699
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,480
He was, if you imagine he was cool before that.

700
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
Imagine after.

701
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
Oh, of course.

702
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Hank Moody.

703
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Right?

704
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
That's the name of the character.

705
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Yeah, Hank Moody.

706
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
I've never seen it.

707
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
But, and I don't, yeah.

708
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,440
I'm not that I don't like Duchovny anymore.

709
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,960
I just, that was peak Duchovny in that for so many seasons.

710
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,360
Kind of a briefly on a Jay Pharoah show on Showtime that I just mentioned to somebody

711
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,640
and they said, you know, that's in the California Keisha verse.

712
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
Really?

713
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,880
That's in the same world as, I never cared about what that show was.

714
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,000
Now I care, even though I don't know California Keisha.

715
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I didn't know that.

716
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,920
I love that there would be, yes, there's universe building in Showtime.

717
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Wow.

718
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Uh huh.

719
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
I mean, I guess California Keisha was a hit.

720
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Mm hmm.

721
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
I think.

722
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Yeah.

723
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,120
And the whole, you know, the whole thing now is cinematic universes.

724
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,440
I don't know if you know.

725
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,920
So of course all our major franchises had to do it, especially California Keisha.

726
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Okay.

727
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:30,000
Um, so, uh, Mitch Pileggi, what does he, as X-Files fans, what does his apparent appearance

728
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
as the host, uh, lend to you?

729
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,040
What is, what context is he bringing in or what vibe is he bringing in from X-Files?

730
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,480
Cause he's got, he's sort of like, you know, he's kind of like, what are you guys up to?

731
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
Like kind of a thing.

732
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,280
And he gets, I think he gets more, he's a little skeptical of my memory of him.

733
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
He's really skeptical.

734
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,120
Eventually, he kind of is a little more on board with some of this stuff.

735
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:56,220
But yeah, he kind of brings a little gravitas, gruffness, but he's a, it's a seriousness

736
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,220
to the proceedings.

737
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,220
Sure.

738
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,600
And I think that's like, you go, okay, this is real shit if we've got Pileggi here.

739
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,920
He's, you know, he's like almost.

740
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
True man.

741
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,120
This is, I mean, this is sort of pre rise of JK Simmons, who you could see like maybe

742
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
that's true.

743
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
No offense to Pileggi.

744
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,640
Like that's like the A list version or something you would say, oh, you wouldn't want him now

745
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,380
where he's got this voice and I'm here.

746
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,160
So that means everything you see here is real.

747
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
So you better be careful.

748
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
Okay.

749
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
So that's, that's

750
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,240
If you, if you're questioning any of it, it's like you, you're volunteering to fight him.

751
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,800
You don't want to do that.

752
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,400
I do not want to do that.

753
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Yeah.

754
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Okay.

755
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
That's, this is a good context for Mitch Pileggi.

756
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:40,880
He also, he hosted another special from the same company, Nash entertainment called conspiracy

757
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
theory.

758
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
Did we land on the moon?

759
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,440
So he was, he was playing in this ballpark at the time.

760
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
He was hot.

761
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Yeah.

762
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Yeah.

763
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,360
And this, this very much now looking at first, I was like, wait, who is this guy?

764
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
I know.

765
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,400
And I was like, oh, it's Skinner, but Pileggi works.

766
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,120
He was on sons of anarchy.

767
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,880
It was on that Dallas reboot from a few years ago.

768
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Okay.

769
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,520
Current Walker reboot, I believe.

770
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
Oh really?

771
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
Yeah.

772
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,000
Did you even know that was, is it on TV?

773
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think so.

774
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,520
Texas ranger has a reboot.

775
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
It's just called Walker.

776
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Is he?

777
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
No, he's not Walker though.

778
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
Is he?

779
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
No, he's just.

780
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
No, don't be ridiculous.

781
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
Who's Walker?

782
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
I don't know.

783
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
Just a guy.

784
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,120
Somebody you've never heard of who has 400 times the money you'll ever have.

785
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,840
Is it been on for 10 years or has it been on for two weeks?

786
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
One or two?

787
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
I don't know.

788
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
These things happen.

789
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,600
I just saw like quantum leap reboot canceled and I'm like, there was one?

790
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,080
I knew that, I knew that, but I did not know there's a new Walker that had Mitch Pileggi

791
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
on it.

792
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Check it out.

793
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
All right.

794
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,760
Is it on CBS?

795
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,200
Is CW still around?

796
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
I think it is.

797
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
It might be on that.

798
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Okay.

799
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
If it's around.

800
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I don't know.

801
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
I'm out of it.

802
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
This is not Fox in the 90s.

803
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,280
I knew everything that Network Fox was doing in the 90s.

804
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Today, crap shoot.

805
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,960
Current CW is pivoting to alternative programming ironically.

806
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,440
Oh, okay.

807
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
As opposed to like sexy.

808
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
Oh, no more like Carter Dixie.

809
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Oh, no more like Carter Dixie.

810
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,920
Sexy teen shows where the teens are played by 25 year olds, you know.

811
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,600
Less teens, more Pileggi is what CW's motto is.

812
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:22,440
And I, well, but then Pileggi just left Warner Brothers alternative programming in 2023,

813
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
it says.

814
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
What do you, Pileggi?

815
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
Pileggi?

816
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
Yeah.

817
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
He was at Warner Brothers for 10 years.

818
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Wait, wait.

819
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Who are you talking about?

820
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
Mitch Pileggi?

821
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
Oh, now Pileggi.

822
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Sorry.

823
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
Who's the guy with the hair?

824
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
Darnell.

825
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Sorry, everyone.

826
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,960
I confused Pileggi and Darnell.

827
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,680
I feel like a fool.

828
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,160
No, I just, I thought.

829
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,640
Get your leather jacket guys straight.

830
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,040
Darnell is a wacky leather jacket guy.

831
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Darnell is not Pileggi.

832
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Pileggi is a serious leather jacket guy.

833
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,640
Yeah, Pileggi didn't work at Warner's.

834
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:57,400
So he comes out, you know, like what we're about to do tonight is going to shock and

835
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,840
appallination and the tone is great.

836
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,880
I think I thought that the guy, you know, the interstitial announcer is kind of more

837
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,840
like Fox bomb ass tonight, but Pileggi really is.

838
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,800
He just, just, he'd like lures you in with this like about to fall asleep.

839
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,800
He's great.

840
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,960
He's so good at this.

841
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,280
He's really good at this.

842
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,480
They really picked the right guy, I think, for that.

843
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:26,080
Watching it now is very much like, oh, they gave him like half a day or half a night when

844
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,480
X-Files was on break to film this stuff and then he went into a booth to do the narration.

845
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Yeah.

846
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Yeah.

847
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,160
But it's great, sleepy gruff, but the real star of the show, the Masked Magician, and

848
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:48,160
you know, we'll do the unmasking of him later, but for now, I mean, this is what makes these

849
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,000
iconic if they are iconic to you or if you have, perhaps you've forgotten about them

850
00:35:53,120 --> 00:36:01,120
as Michael said, but black suit, black turtleneck, gloves.

851
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,580
He's like, you know, so enigmatic.

852
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,840
What is his deal?

853
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,200
There's kind of a Darth Vader thing to him.

854
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,120
I feel like I, I think I always imagined that a guy underneath who was like terribly fucked

855
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,440
up and scarred or something, that's what I went to.

856
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,760
Did you guys have any notion of like what's behind the mask?

857
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:28,080
I thought he names checks them at the last one.

858
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,080
I thought it could be like Copperfield or Lance Burton.

859
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,400
I'm more like what Jason's saying.

860
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,880
I thought it was going to be a famous guy.

861
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,560
Yeah, I thought it was going to be a famous guy.

862
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,240
I feel like they themselves must have planted that rumor and tried to hype up the rumor.

863
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,480
So that it was some like power move.

864
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,320
What would motivate one of those people if we're reviewing that logic, which was not

865
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,360
ultimately true, but I really, is this a way to like crush the competition forever?

866
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,960
I'm letting it all loose.

867
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,400
Then I'll reveal it and like, and now this leaves me as the king, the only tricks I didn't

868
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,880
reveal are my own.

869
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Right.

870
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,440
I guess, I guess, I mean, there's some, if Copperfield on that's probably at the top

871
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,040
of the mountain, so it probably doesn't really make sense for him to do it.

872
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,680
But maybe you're a Lance Burton and you're number two or three or four and boy, the reveal

873
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,760
of who you are would be like, oh my God, he just, he just burned off all these classic

874
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
tricks.

875
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
Like, where can he go now?

876
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Where would he go from here?

877
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,240
I think what they did was actually a magic trick where they like planted some seeds or

878
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,040
like some innuendo and they just let people fill in the gaps.

879
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
Of course.

880
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
Yeah.

881
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
And especially kids.

882
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,040
They're like, well, I know two magicians.

883
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,400
It has to be one of them.

884
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Yes.

885
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Yeah.

886
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,880
Because it is pre, it's right before Blaine and it's before Angel kind of.

887
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
So yeah, who will?

888
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,640
He names a couple at the end and like, yeah, that's, that's all I got.

889
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,120
I don't, I don't believe this is Penn or Teller.

890
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,600
That doesn't seem right.

891
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,440
They have their own brand that they don't have to do this.

892
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,640
It could have been, it would have been funny if it was Teller, but he's too short to be

893
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
Penn.

894
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
Yes.

895
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
Penn is too tall.

896
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,640
Let's, let's talk about the mask itself as recreated by Jason.

897
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,080
Thank you.

898
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,760
The mystery, the streaks, the mysterious streaks and then kind of this, you know, yours is

899
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,640
cloth Jason, but the real one I feel like was kind of a, kind of a hard shell, maybe with

900
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,160
some cloth components.

901
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
Yeah.

902
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,240
And to me, does this make any sense to me?

903
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:29,040
It looks like a, it looks like a, like an almond, like a sinister, big sinister almond.

904
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
I know.

905
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,000
I don't, I don't see it necessarily, but I think I see what you're saying.

906
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,360
You know, it's around it or, you know, or if there was a watermelon from hell.

907
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Uh huh.

908
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,440
Well, I'm trying to figure out if it's the same mask the whole time, because later on

909
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
there's like.

910
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
I think it changes.

911
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
It changes, right?

912
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,640
Because there's paint on the chin.

913
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,760
The bullet catch trick, they have to draw streaks on his chin because he's got to be

914
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
able to move his mouth.

915
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,800
And then of course in the last one, he starts talking, which had been verboten in the earlier

916
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
ones.

917
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Like we can't hear him talk.

918
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,040
They kept saying it's not as regular assistance and you can't hear him talk.

919
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
Not as regular assistance.

920
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
Yeah.

921
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,080
That's a big way to throw you off the trail.

922
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
They did their homework.

923
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,880
There was no, they covered their tracks.

924
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,440
Hopefully they put this guy in a burlap sack and threw him into the studio.

925
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,240
Yes, of course.

926
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,560
Nobody could get a view on him.

927
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,120
But the, I do just love the, I mean, there's like kind of a Batman thing to it also.

928
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,520
It requires so much eye acting.

929
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,640
It really makes this get, which I will credit him for.

930
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,000
I think that his like hand work is, is good and cool.

931
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,640
That's obviously like all he has to work with, but boy, he'll just strike the big wide eyes.

932
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
Oh yeah.

933
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,560
It's like, it's all he's got really.

934
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,520
And it does just like create a character that with apologies to the guy is more compelling

935
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,840
than the guy.

936
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Once you see him.

937
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
Right.

938
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Yes.

939
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
Then Val, can I say his name?

940
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
Yeah, sure.

941
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
Val Valentino.

942
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,720
Val Valentino, who it turns out to be.

943
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Yes.

944
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,440
And the mask is kind of scary.

945
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,320
And as a kid, I was a little scared of him.

946
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Yeah.

947
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,400
There's a homemade, there's a homemade quality to it that also I think adds even to some

948
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
of the scariness.

949
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Yes.

950
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,240
What you did, Jason, is not terribly different than, I feel like the streaks in the real

951
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,480
thing are kind of like patchy and uneven.

952
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Right.

953
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,400
It is not, that, that aspect of it is not Darth Vader-esque.

954
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,160
It is not the highest tech, the highest design on him.

955
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,680
And when Jane was working on it, I was like, hey, feel free to smear it a little.

956
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,240
And I knew China, China markers pretty easy to smear.

957
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,000
So I was like, oh, this will be good because it won't make me, it's a wax.

958
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,160
It won't make me pass out.

959
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,040
I think he looks like almost aquatic or like alien and something like this, this picture

960
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
of him, especially.

961
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
Sure.

962
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,640
A little aquatic or something like a little blue, like tentacle.

963
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Something like that.

964
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
So, so.

965
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
I see what you're saying.

966
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,600
Obviously his hand movements are distinctive, but too, I feel like as it goes on, he's

967
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,040
like crossing his arms.

968
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:17,120
He's like doing the David S. Pumpkins arm cross in, in some of them, especially number

969
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,120
four.

970
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,800
I did it to him again.

971
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,280
Not to jump ahead, but number four, they start to lose the heat a little.

972
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,280
I think maybe before that, because like the first one, you know, I think they may be only

973
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,120
intended for there to be one of these, but then it's such a massive hit.

974
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:37,880
They commissioned much more, but by then they've blown off a lot of the like basics, fundamentals.

975
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:44,640
You get like a rabbit out of a hat in the first, or you get like big, big basics.

976
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,760
And then the things that I think in the second one, it's like a big Houdini one.

977
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,840
It's like one of the, he's going to drown sort of things.

978
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,760
And they're like, cause Fox, you know, you need the later, the big scary thing where

979
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,240
there's going to be a death probably.

980
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:05,440
And then the third one, I think what they're pushing is like the secret to a car getting

981
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,080
crushed by a tank.

982
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:12,960
And then the, I guess the magicians in there and it's, it's just not a, it's not a primary.

983
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,920
It's I guess it seems interesting.

984
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,800
I'd like to see that car get crushed, but also you're showing it to me now.

985
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,560
And at this point, I assume that the answer is like a compartment or a trap door because

986
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,440
that's the answer to all of them.

987
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,680
So you can see by number three, how, all right, we don't, we don't really have our last act,

988
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,200
which is why for the fourth, they they're like, all right, we got to do it.

989
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,560
We just got to show the guy what else is going to get these ratings up again, because we're

990
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,800
down to only, only 12 million viewers.

991
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,160
This is eating shit.

992
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,440
Only 12 million people watch number three.

993
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,080
Number four, excuse me, is a lot of specialty made stuff.

994
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
Okay.

995
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
Yeah.

996
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,080
You mean it's far.

997
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,080
Yeah.

998
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Like it's not just the rabbits out of the hat.

999
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,520
Like a room underground.

1000
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
Yeah.

1001
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
Oh yeah.

1002
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,520
It's elaborate.

1003
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,520
It's elaborate trap door.

1004
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:10,440
I like trap doors, but by the end, it's like too many trap doors, too many custom made

1005
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
devices.

1006
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,440
Yes.

1007
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,960
And when that's the answer to something that you've never seen before to begin with, now

1008
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,560
we've kind of lost some of the luster.

1009
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,400
So that first one is really like, let's rip through all the biggest, none of which I can

1010
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,760
remember now, as I try to think of examples, I did watch, I watched all of the originals

1011
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,000
because this came back for another special in 2002 and then a series in 2008.

1012
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,000
It wasn't Valentino by that point.

1013
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,040
I don't even remember if it's Pileggi.

1014
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Just seemed like too much.

1015
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,200
I was like, let me, let me, let me just focus on the nineties.

1016
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,200
Yeah.

1017
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,600
I looked that up because I don't think those are canon in my, my eyes.

1018
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:53,120
Pileggi, I think maybe came back and did some voiceover for the later ones.

1019
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,160
And I think Valentino has a producer credit.

1020
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,800
But neither of them on camera.

1021
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,800
Is that the deal?

1022
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
It seems.

1023
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
Yeah.

1024
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,240
That's, that's what it seems like.

1025
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:10,680
And had been unpromoted to my network TV from Fox primetime.

1026
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,600
My network TV is like the decay of UPN.

1027
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Is it?

1028
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,600
Well, or is it just what, I don't know.

1029
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
What is it?

1030
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,240
It's, I think it's, it's my blank in whatever city it's in.

1031
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,720
Someone, a professor explained this to me once and we're all like, huh?

1032
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,200
And it's like, yeah, it's, it's almost like lower than UPN.

1033
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,640
It seems kind of complicated.

1034
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:40,560
Is some people's Fox, my network TV with some, sometimes you see Fox on that.

1035
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,560
I don't know.

1036
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,080
Uh, this is a, this is a very dull, I know.

1037
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,960
My network TV is not me TV.

1038
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,680
No, me TV is different.

1039
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,080
Is that what Svenguli is on?

1040
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,080
Is it me TV?

1041
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,400
I believe Svenguli is on me TV.

1042
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Stop hamfisting your things into this episode.

1043
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
That's all I have to say about Svenguli.

1044
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,400
We'll get to Svenguli.

1045
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,400
This is our thing.

1046
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
This is our thing.

1047
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,600
First episode later.

1048
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
I let it meet Svenguli.

1049
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,240
I won't talk about him more.

1050
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,120
Uh, um, but the, a big thing we got going here as always is established at the beginning

1051
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:16,040
is the threat that this guy doing this, that he has to do it under secrecy because he may

1052
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,920
be blackballed from the magician's community.

1053
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,920
Yes.

1054
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,660
What this implies, this, that it's, it's been a handshake code for hundreds of years and

1055
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,800
he is the first to blow up the handshake code.

1056
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,960
Right.

1057
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:37,400
Um, and you start imagining just like a conspiring group of, uh, uh, why am I flashing this?

1058
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Yeah, I think in the ladies man, there's a bunch of men who are like mad at the ladies

1059
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,480
man because he fucks all the women better than they can.

1060
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
That's what you feel.

1061
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,960
You start picturing some group of magicians all going like, girl, we gotta get him.

1062
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
And I can't tell.

1063
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,020
It's, it's almost the most effective magic trick that the specials do is making you imagine

1064
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,420
that where you're like, was that ever the case?

1065
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,300
Was anybody actually mad at this or threatened by this or just some magicians were?

1066
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,860
Well, the other thing I learned is that there are multiple like brotherhood of magicians,

1067
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,820
Academy of magical arts, like brotherhood of mystical.

1068
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,500
There's, there's a lot of trade groups.

1069
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:24,220
It seems like, um, yes, the, uh, the Orlando magic I looked up, I assume that's like a

1070
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,820
magic group in Orlando.

1071
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,820
Yes.

1072
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,620
I think I got that right.

1073
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,620
Okay.

1074
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,620
Yeah.

1075
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,620
All kinds of organizations.

1076
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,620
Yeah.

1077
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,620
They're a team of magicians.

1078
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,620
It's a funny thing.

1079
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,020
The whole black balling.

1080
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:44,780
We're going to get this guy out of the Alliance forever because I mean, all right, it definitely

1081
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:51,580
does ruin the luster of some of these illusions to know how they're done.

1082
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:58,220
But, you know, in a lot of cases, Jason, as you were saying, it does become, uh, you know,

1083
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:03,140
like, like if I am, I watch these specials and like, wow, these taught me that anybody

1084
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,420
can be a magician as long as you know the secrets.

1085
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,420
Okay.

1086
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:11,300
So all I have to do is have some carpenters build a special box with a compartment and

1087
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,180
then a special place for an assistant to put her arm.

1088
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:20,420
And you know, when I have the Batman 66 as spike mechanism builds, I just need to make

1089
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,260
sure that the spikes are retractable and that they are custom built to my assistant's

1090
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:29,180
back contours so that the spikes can retract and then rest along her back.

1091
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,340
And the actual like this, you know, so much of this is like, so you want to see how I

1092
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,340
did it?

1093
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,340
It's easy.

1094
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,740
Six hundred thousand dollars were spent building a special thing.

1095
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,740
Yeah.

1096
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:45,380
It's sort of, you know, it ruins it, but it's also like, yeah, but the effort, if anything,

1097
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,900
this might have been the intent in a way.

1098
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:53,500
It also like illuminates, you know, the craft involved and how, you know, some of these

1099
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,340
things, very impressive amount of production.

1100
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,420
I also feel, and I think this is similar to what you're saying.

1101
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:03,340
I also feel in a similar way to a lot of like old professional wrestlers who were upset

1102
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,900
when Vince McMahon finally said, oh, this is predetermined.

1103
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,660
We're like, oh, well, yeah, of course.

1104
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,940
Like I feel like there was part of it was like, if the public knows we didn't really

1105
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,820
saw someone in half and put them back together, they're never going to go to a magic show

1106
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,820
again.

1107
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,940
You're like, oh, everyone knows that this is not real.

1108
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:27,140
If you as an audience member, if the point of your experience is to go, ha, that wasn't

1109
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,140
real.

1110
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,140
Right.

1111
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,340
I don't, you know, I, yeah, I think I think we're all aware of that.

1112
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,020
I think in the late nineties, people didn't think that people were being sawed in half

1113
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,580
and then put back together.

1114
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,580
I don't think.

1115
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,580
Yeah.

1116
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:45,780
Only in these rooms, like, no, you could not just go to any surgery theater that you wanted

1117
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,780
to and watch a man be operated.

1118
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:54,060
You can't just watch a live heart transplant, but this we know this, you can pay money and

1119
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,060
go see.

1120
00:48:55,060 --> 00:49:00,260
Speaking of professional wrestling, there is one of these that I think got relegated

1121
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:05,700
to a UPN or a mind network TV of like professional wrestling secrets exposed.

1122
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,700
Oh, yes.

1123
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,100
Where they show you like, oh, the there's mics under the ring.

1124
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,100
Sure.

1125
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,660
Here's how this is maybe pre broken.

1126
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,860
This is a real punch, but it's pulled.

1127
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:23,020
I know you think that the way Hulk Hogan punches looks perfectly realistic and exactly how

1128
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,220
a real fight would go.

1129
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,500
But no, no, no.

1130
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:30,740
Yeah, no, it's, it makes all the sense in the world that wrestlers punch and then also

1131
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,300
stomp on the floor while they punch.

1132
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,300
Yes.

1133
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:39,020
You can take 50 punches to the head and you can still rally and come back.

1134
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,020
Yes.

1135
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,300
And Jay Leno can get into the ring and dominate.

1136
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,300
Hulk Hogan.

1137
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,300
Yeah, yeah.

1138
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,900
It's just a matter of how you do the hold.

1139
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,900
Right.

1140
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:55,620
Yeah, there was a wrestling special produced by the same group, Nash Entertainment.

1141
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:00,980
That's where they went after this was a, well, now let's ruin wrestling.

1142
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,220
With real, those are real wrestlers.

1143
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,740
They're all different characters, most of them wearing masks.

1144
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,740
Oh, they did.

1145
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,940
Oh, it is a masked wrestler special.

1146
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,580
There's a lot of masks because I think like, oh, they don't want to be caught on camera

1147
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,620
for a thousand dollars, you know.

1148
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,620
Wow.

1149
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,660
You can go through the website of Nash Entertainment and see.

1150
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:29,540
They didn't make all of those Darnell era Shocking Fox specials, but a lot and the list

1151
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,540
is crazy.

1152
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:36,940
Let me just call out a few world's scariest ghosts caught on tape.

1153
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,340
When good pets go bad, secrets of psychics revealed.

1154
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,940
Oh, they're going to ruin psychics for us.

1155
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:43,940
Oh, no.

1156
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,140
What do I have left?

1157
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:52,700
There's a couple like alien ones, but the one that's the most interesting to me is all

1158
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:58,220
these like long clunky names and then it gets to rods, all caps, rods.

1159
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,740
They're not flying saucers or mysterious lights in the night sky.

1160
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,500
They're a curious new kind of UFO, one that's been caught on tape all over the world.

1161
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,020
We startling new evidence, aliens could be among us.

1162
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:13,180
Experts call them rods and they can barely be seen with the naked eye.

1163
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,740
You come across rods before in your alien travels?

1164
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,740
Absolutely.

1165
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,740
I have seen.

1166
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,740
Is rods a big area?

1167
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,300
Yeah, there's different types of different like common shapes and rods.

1168
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,300
I have seen.

1169
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,300
Okay.

1170
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:31,300
of cylindrical or circular or spherical type things, but yeah, no rods are out there.

1171
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,300
Keep your eye on the sky.

1172
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,300
Look out for rods.

1173
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,300
They're UAPs now.

1174
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,300
What's UAPs?

1175
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,300
I'm trying to remember now.

1176
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,300
Unidentified Alien Phenomenon?

1177
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,740
No, yeah, maybe that's what it means.

1178
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,740
Look what it is.

1179
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,740
UAP.

1180
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,740
I buy it.

1181
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,740
Mm-hmm.

1182
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:48,980
UAP definition is, here we go, I'm looking it up, la, la, la, la, la.

1183
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,380
UAP is Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon.

1184
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,460
Aerial Phenomenon.

1185
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,460
Not alien.

1186
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,460
Okay.

1187
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,780
If you had then looked it up and like, oh no, it's unbelievable ass pussy, why did I look

1188
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,780
that up?

1189
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,780
Ooh.

1190
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,980
I gotta check into these codes.

1191
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,060
I've never said that word on this show before and I never will.

1192
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,060
I just want to say that.

1193
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,060
A few of the word pussy on podcast override?

1194
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,060
I've never said it.

1195
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,060
I've never said it.

1196
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,900
I can't remember a time when I said it.

1197
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,380
I gotta say, National Entertainment did not get the word out about Clipaholics, the Jason

1198
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,140
Alexander hosted clip show.

1199
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,140
Oh my God.

1200
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,500
I need to do an episode on Clipaholics.

1201
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,500
With no further information, Clipaholics must be.

1202
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,260
I actually, fuck, you know, I was gonna maybe pitch you guys, because I went down this rabbit

1203
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:37,220
hole of like, inane music videos that Jason Alexander is in.

1204
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:41,260
I just sent Andrew Grissom a show that Jason Alexander was in that I've never heard of

1205
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,260
before.

1206
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,260
Who was that?

1207
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,260
And I got a fine, I was like, what is this?

1208
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,580
Is it the sitcom where he plays the host of Pardon the Interruption?

1209
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,380
Oh my God, what?

1210
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,420
Yeah, he plays the sports, right?

1211
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,420
I don't know.

1212
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,820
He's the star of, I don't even want to say the videos, I don't know how to frame this.

1213
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:03,020
Jason, I don't know, miscellaneous Jason Alexander crap, is that the episode?

1214
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,700
Jason Alexander's music video career.

1215
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,820
Yeah, there are enough, there's enough to do it.

1216
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,820
They're pretty funny.

1217
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,580
Well, you know what, it's gotta be a construct that also lets you talk about him in Criminal

1218
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,420
Minds, where he has long gray hair.

1219
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,420
Oh, Criminal Minds.

1220
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:26,980
Well, and my professors in school always taught music videos and commercials, because a lot

1221
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,980
of directors kind of go back and forth in those fields.

1222
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,860
One more creative filling, one more monetary fulfilling.

1223
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:39,460
The Mick DLT, where he gets to use a little of his musical theater talent.

1224
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,900
Oh, yes, so his big pre-sign filled, yes, yeah, okay, all right.

1225
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,940
We'll figure out what to call it, but Jason Alexander, hey, if you could throw it on a

1226
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:52,220
Club 3 poll, if you're out there and you want to grab Jason Alexander just for you

1227
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,060
Club 3 VIPs, I don't blame you.

1228
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,660
Grab him by the long luscious locks.

1229
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,660
It is Criminal Minds.

1230
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,900
The mysterious long gray hair of a criminal mind.

1231
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,860
I'm gonna find this, I'm gonna find what it was.

1232
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,700
I already don't remember what you were looking at.

1233
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,460
It's a Jason Alexander show you never heard of.

1234
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,860
It's not Clipaholics and it's not the show where he plays the part in The Interruption

1235
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,860
Guy.

1236
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,860
And it's not Bob Patterson.

1237
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,380
No, I know Bob Patterson.

1238
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,300
Give me some credit, I know his sitcom where he's a motivational speaker.

1239
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,900
He knows Creeping Bob Patterson.

1240
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,740
Do you know, though, that he separately had a different motivational speaker persona?

1241
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,740
Yes.

1242
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,820
There's Bob Patterson, but then there was Donny Clay.

1243
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,180
They are not the same.

1244
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,180
Was that the Funny or Die sketch?

1245
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,980
He did that on Funny or Die, yes.

1246
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,980
Of course I know that.

1247
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,980
Uh-huh, with that creepy couple.

1248
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,700
He made a sort of cancelable video, I forget what that was.

1249
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:49,580
Do you wanna go through the allusions or some of the other, I guess, the other notable people

1250
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,660
who are in this special?

1251
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,980
Sure, yes.

1252
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,180
Not his usual assistants, keep in mind.

1253
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,580
Not his usual assistants, which is very funny.

1254
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,860
I mean, I guess if you worked in magic, you do.

1255
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,980
Might be a way to know.

1256
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:08,100
I saw something online, though, that like, oh, some of his affectations or movements,

1257
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:14,420
some people that are in the magic world, I kinda guess, like, I think that's Valentino.

1258
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:19,820
Hard Copy looked into it, and a guy who worked at a magic shop looked at receipts, and he

1259
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:26,740
saw where a lot, like tons of very expensive magic equipment was going, and it was to maybe

1260
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:32,580
like, I'm gonna say Kentucky, and then he looked up what magicians are in Kentucky,

1261
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:37,220
and I think already there'd been the rumors about this, Valentino, and then Hard Copy

1262
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,100
confronted the guy, although it seems very fakey, like this whole thing, maybe Valentino

1263
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:47,940
himself may have started the rumors just to get the old Valentino publicity up.

1264
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:48,940
Sure.

1265
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:55,020
So, anyway, so yes, but part of the, you gotta remember, before the reveal, it was crazy,

1266
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,100
everyone was accusing each other.

1267
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,380
You'd accuse your own father or mother of being the mass magician.

1268
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,900
A paranoia was running high among everyone.

1269
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mass magicians could be everywhere, could they be in your home, in

1270
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,540
your church, in your bed?

1271
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,940
People constantly like, trying to like, they had a mask, or they'd hold it up and see could

1272
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,500
this fit, like my dad or something.

1273
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,500
Police lineups.

1274
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,500
Yeah, exactly.

1275
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,300
They'd make a bunch of people come in and put a mask on.

1276
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,300
They could be in my home.

1277
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,300
Right, yeah.

1278
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,100
Okay, but you were saying, are there other notable people who appear in these?

1279
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:30,420
Notable people, which I guess is a way to also talk about some of the narration written

1280
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:39,580
for Mitch Pileggi, is alternately very horny and horny, like there's some very horny and

1281
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,820
some very in poor taste.

1282
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,660
That was the exact, that was completely what I took away from it, is how often it just

1283
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:51,860
gets seized already in that zone and then we start going like, I mean, just a basic

1284
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:57,940
is like, and you know, and that's when your eyes, he does the trick while your eye is

1285
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:01,980
caught by one of his lovely assistants.

1286
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,180
What a distraction.

1287
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,140
There's a lot of innuendo about that.

1288
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,540
There's a very odd one where he comments on someone's midriff.

1289
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:14,180
Yes, I, yeah, I, speaking of Andrew Grissom, I sent him a copy of it because he loved these

1290
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:20,340
specials too, he's saying, and I sent him a memo of, which is, it's something like,

1291
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:26,180
this angle gives you a close up view of how our assistant fits into the compartment.

1292
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:30,140
It also gives you a nice view of her midriff.

1293
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,420
And that also, that it's horny, that's what's confusing about the horniness, is that it's

1294
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:39,580
horny but for a midriff, which is kind of, it feels like a kind of a clunky, like a technical

1295
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:45,940
term almost, a bare midriff, but saying like, oh, if I could get my hands on that midriff.

1296
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:49,060
Look at that, I mean, I guess you could be like those abdominal muscles, like it could

1297
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:53,980
be a little more clinical, but I really enjoy looking at the abdominal muscles.

1298
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,180
And that sweet tummy.

1299
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:02,460
That's because the assistants are, they're beautiful, obviously, but then they just,

1300
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:08,980
they look like JLo backup dancers, you know, they're as attractive as anyone, any women

1301
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,300
on TV at this time.

1302
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:19,020
It is, it is strange, the like, oh my, my, my, my, my, about like, yeah, sure, yes, you're

1303
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:25,860
not wrong, but it's also not the sexiest clothes or presentation I've ever seen, but to Mitch,

1304
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,860
I guess.

1305
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,860
Right.

1306
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:32,940
Now I'd like to, I like the idea that Mitch went like rogue during the doing of the video.

1307
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,980
Can I freestyle here?

1308
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:40,820
I'm going to go off, something on screen gave me an idea, and you know what, it gave me

1309
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:45,180
a little more than an idea too, if you know what I'm saying.

1310
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:52,180
Here's the one I wrote down verbatim, because it's like so kind of like simultaneously,

1311
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:57,780
like horny and clunky, now it is, John, here it is.

1312
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:05,000
Of course, he couldn't pull off this escape without the help of his beautiful assistants,

1313
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,100
also made in America, also very well built.

1314
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:18,940
So that's coming off a car, where they drop a giant weight on a car and destroy it, which

1315
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,980
the solution is so insane.

1316
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:29,840
I kept rewatching it because it's like, okay, when the assistant closes the door, it activates

1317
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:38,580
a secret latch, which dumps him onto the ground and dumps a motorized dummy onto the seat

1318
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:43,220
so that you could still have a live feed of a dummy squirming of something, all right,

1319
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,060
there's a body in there, move around.

1320
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:51,620
They zoom in on the dummy, and meanwhile, he is getting out of his like Velcro restraints,

1321
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:58,900
Velcro bag, crawls into especially made like gurney bottom, and you can just see him get

1322
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:06,220
wheeled off, like it's so complicated, I kind of loved it.

1323
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:11,820
Look, it's simple, we'll expose this, as long as you have a car that you're willing to crush,

1324
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:16,740
a big heavy weight to crush it with, a secret compartment in the car that can help you slide

1325
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:23,500
out, and a mechanized dummy to put in a bag to squirm, and a live video feed to prove

1326
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,260
that there is a moving body in there.

1327
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:31,020
That's all it takes, these magicians, they're fly-by-night, they're hucksters.

1328
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:39,660
Now, there is a simpler solution in the terms of the prestige, he must be using a double,

1329
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:45,180
because there is a trick, I think it's the teleportation trick, where it's like, how

1330
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,700
does that assistant get from here to there?

1331
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:58,780
They're twins, like, and the twins in this trick are the climb-a-zooski twins, climb-a-zooski,

1332
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:05,340
that's a long word, yeah, this is a tough one, climb-a-zooski, they're the Coors Light

1333
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:09,260
and Twins twins, a few years later.

1334
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,900
I keep seeing the Coors Twins, what the hell, what were these ads?

1335
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:18,100
These ads, oh man, these ads were huge at the start of the new millennium, they would

1336
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:27,420
say like, something on TV, and Twins, and I, this is what and Twins is from?

1337
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:34,500
This is, I believe, where and Twins originates, and they are the twins in this one illusion,

1338
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:44,460
they would go on to be a part of WCW, they're on the dance team, the Nitro Girls, yeah,

1339
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:52,060
they were Nitro Girls, and then they were gold and silver, as well as lolly and pop,

1340
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:57,140
in a segment with Johnny the Bull and Big Vito LaGrasso, of course, yeah.

1341
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:02,940
They went to, they were signed by WWF, went to Developmental, didn't really go much further.

1342
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:09,140
I get them confused with the Miller Lite Catfight Girls, who were on many Miller Lite commercials

1343
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,100
and then appeared on WWE.

1344
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:16,500
Mike, Mike, get a paper towel, your sweat on your brow is dripping on the microphone,

1345
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,500
you're going to electrocute yourself.

1346
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:22,420
Every beer had a different set of girls that appeared on many commercials, I hear some

1347
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,420
Ford voice.

1348
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,540
Let's do an episode about beer girls.

1349
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:31,420
We don't even have to put that one out, that's just for the boys.

1350
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:36,420
Well that one, and then in that appearance of these very prominent twins, soon to be

1351
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:45,660
extremely prominent twins, you get the line, most major magicians employ twins, and you

1352
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:50,100
thought all they were good for was gum commercials.

1353
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,420
Yeah I did think that all twins were good for.

1354
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:56,780
Good for nothing twins, I've always said.

1355
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:01,780
Then the gum commercials proved me wrong, all right, sure, those, but name me one other

1356
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,500
example of twins who were good for anything.

1357
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,500
Yeah.

1358
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,020
Did we get the double mint hat?

1359
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,580
No, I'm sorry.

1360
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:14,460
Do you think there was a draft of any of the, or like a version of this copy where they

1361
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,900
were like, God, this is so boring, this special, can you horny it up a little bit so we got

1362
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,020
something to say in between?

1363
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,620
Might have been Mike Darnell's notes.

1364
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,620
Was it Darnell?

1365
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:30,260
Look, we're covering the scariness angle of Fox, but we have no sexiness, so yeah, let's

1366
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,260
horn it up.

1367
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:35,900
Let's get it, and it's not just that there's ladies here, it's that Pileggi has to make

1368
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,780
very good, interesting remarks.

1369
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:42,780
Let's say you pull a rabbit out of a hat, boy I'd like to see one of his assistants

1370
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,740
in nothing more than a hat.

1371
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,340
That's actually too on the nose.

1372
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:50,060
That's a little clever, yeah.

1373
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,060
Now that's too much.

1374
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:55,700
Fox standards and practices would say no, not that.

1375
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:00,580
So the line is it has to be more, I mean the midriff thing is what I find funny.

1376
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:07,980
It's like not, it's never over, it's not like I'd like to do something, it's just like yeah.

1377
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:14,060
As long as he can break any, he can reveal all the tricks that he wants, as long as he

1378
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:17,140
never makes her midriff disappear.

1379
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:20,780
As long as he never makes any clothes appear over that midriff.

1380
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:25,540
Oh man, I can see the place where she was connected to her mother to get nutrients in

1381
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,380
the womb.

1382
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:33,860
Clear view of the clavicle from this recording booth.

1383
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:37,380
It's true, post having a kid you're like, hmm, belly buttons, I'm not sure my interest

1384
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:40,100
in belly buttons is too high anymore.

1385
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:47,420
There used to be a tube made of organic material that was connected to that midriff.

1386
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:52,020
Boy the wonders of life, the greatest magic in all the universe.

1387
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:57,140
Thank you God for all you do for us, the ultimate magician God.

1388
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,460
I would love to have your secrets revealed God, please.

1389
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:04,780
Maybe God will be unmasked when we reach eternal life.

1390
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:14,460
I don't think it's gross, but God wants us to ingest this placental material for nutrients.

1391
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,060
There's a cookbook or two out there.

1392
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:20,380
I'd like to eat these women's placentas.

1393
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,380
Too much, too much.

1394
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:22,980
That's too, hang on, it's mine or Zoe's.

1395
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,140
I self corrected that Mike Darnell would tell me that that was too much.

1396
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:30,780
I was just observing that they're out there, okay.

1397
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:32,940
Yeah, no Darnell would have noted me on that.

1398
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,660
Mike, that was too much.

1399
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:40,100
You want to tantalize, it's a magic trick, whatever, showing or saying anything.

1400
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:44,420
Though they start pushing it a little more because here's another one that involves

1401
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:49,820
spikes going right through one of the assistants and then he says, at last, some penetrating

1402
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,820
television.

1403
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:56,660
Okay, yeah, that is, I would have noted that, I would have said no.

1404
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:02,220
One where he's sawing an assistant in half, I hope he's got it right this time, be ashamed

1405
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,700
to mess up a body like that.

1406
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:14,340
And implies he hasn't gotten it right in the past, or that's part of the illusion that

1407
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,740
you're worried it's going to.

1408
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:19,060
I see me, Mitch Pileggi, they show me all the raw footage.

1409
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,700
They've they've they've gone through a couple of assistants.

1410
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,900
It would be I start narrating and I go, oh, now look at that midriff.

1411
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,500
Oh, no, the midriff's getting torn in half.

1412
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,980
Wait, guys, cut this one.

1413
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,260
Oh, thanks for flagging it, Mitch.

1414
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:36,900
Was that the one word a bloody saw created havoc in the woman's body?

1415
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:37,980
He killed another woman.

1416
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:42,940
It's a bummer to me because I won't be able to enjoy looking at her body while I'm in

1417
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:43,940
a VO booth.

1418
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:46,220
Oh, that's the tragedy here.

1419
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:47,900
Oh, man.

1420
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:52,340
Jane was watching some of these and I forget when she finally tapped out.

1421
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:56,820
I forget whether it was one of his lines or it was just the accumulation of just like,

1422
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:01,140
oh, so you're saying, yeah, the misogynistic words.

1423
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:01,940
But it was not.

1424
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:05,380
She was still engaged by the magician revealing secrets.

1425
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,100
Well, I mean, we are all engaged.

1426
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,340
OK, I just want to make sure it should not be.

1427
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,340
But they distract.

1428
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,580
Well, they should have gone the other way.

1429
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:16,700
Like, you know, we may never know the masked magician's true identity and he might never

1430
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:21,180
pull that shirt up so we can see what he's got going on in terms of midriff.

1431
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,220
That's the fix. Yes.

1432
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:27,380
If he could just be equally horny for the masked magician, for Val, Valentino.

1433
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,740
Who knows who's back there?

1434
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,900
And if he has, I don't know, boobs on his forehead.

1435
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,740
Oh, that's what I like to imagine.

1436
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,260
Just a solid man with forehead boobs.

1437
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,220
I wonder how tight his calves are.

1438
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:44,260
I wonder if they're too.

1439
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,180
Masked magician, why don't you whip it out?

1440
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:47,180
You got nothing to lose.

1441
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,820
We can't see your face.

1442
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,140
If you get laughed at, nobody knows who you are.

1443
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:55,060
If you're packing some if you're packing some heat, then you might want to take that

1444
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,380
mask off sooner than later.

1445
01:07:56,380 --> 01:08:01,100
And it turns out we can't see his dick either because it's got a tiny little mask on it.

1446
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,820
He came prepared.

1447
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:05,820
Came prepared.

1448
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,620
Most working magicians have at least several dick masks in their arsenal.

1449
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,020
Step one, hire twins.

1450
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,060
Step two, dick mask purchasing.

1451
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:19,940
Did I miss any of these?

1452
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,940
They're so fun. I'm glad you guys clocked this, too.

1453
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:24,860
It is like, you know, because the rest of this is all they're all interesting.

1454
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:28,940
They're all engaging. But like America, I kind of fell off after the first one.

1455
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:33,740
As they go, the only things that are striking my interest are these horny lines.

1456
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,660
Oh, shit, that might have been all.

1457
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:41,660
Oh, wait, I don't know the context of this, but I think he at some point I wrote down

1458
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,740
that he says, oh, oh, OK, it must be it must be another sliced in half.

1459
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:48,700
We're like, yeah, right. Then it's revealed that she is OK.

1460
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,620
And he says, and her stomach looks just fine.

1461
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:55,260
God, God.

1462
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:58,860
I think that was a maybe it wasn't because you could say that just

1463
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,580
and her stomach looks just fine.

1464
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,460
But he's like, I think is I think I know what you want here.

1465
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:07,300
You want me to put a little Mitch on it.

1466
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,660
Mitch it up.

1467
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:11,060
Detective Skinner would never or whatever.

1468
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,900
Director Skinner would never would never say that.

1469
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:17,220
That's why I love playing the role of plain old Mitch Pileggi.

1470
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:22,220
I can say and do things, think things that Skinner

1471
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,500
uptight Skinner never would write.

1472
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:29,220
I always keep telling the X-Files guy, when are you going to live with the producers?

1473
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:32,140
When are you going to let me show off Skinner's midriff?

1474
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,660
I work all day and night on this baby.

1475
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,780
You don't let me show it off.

1476
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:41,020
Hey, X-Files creator Chris Carter,

1477
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,980
when we're writing the new episode, why don't we show some of these alien

1478
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:48,300
autopsy photos and give them more of a womanly shape?

1479
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:49,420
What do you think?

1480
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,740
And then I can comment on them.

1481
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,100
I can mention what I like about him.

1482
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:56,380
He's pitching like, oh, yeah, this new show, Millennium.

1483
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,540
I've got some ideas if you want to hear.

1484
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,300
I'm going to do a voiceover the whole time on the show.

1485
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,060
Any time I can see a belly button, I'm going to really let.

1486
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,460
Can I just do the closed caption track?

1487
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:11,060
You're going to you're going to need that, right?

1488
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,820
For the blind.

1489
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,460
Let me handle.

1490
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:19,660
I am thinking like you, Mike, you were talking about meeting Jonathan Freaks.

1491
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:22,620
Now, if I ever meet Mitch Pileggi,

1492
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:25,860
I am only going to ask him about the mass magician.

1493
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,580
And hey, what was recording narration like?

1494
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:29,700
Were you in a booth?

1495
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,260
Were you between, you know, were you at lunch from the X-Files

1496
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,500
and they get you when you were on break?

1497
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,140
You'll see him.

1498
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,740
You'll see him visibly start sweating because of the sexual memories

1499
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,820
he's going to have. Yeah.

1500
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,260
He was horned up the whole time.

1501
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:44,460
He was doing those memories are just for me.

1502
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:48,180
Yeah. Well, per my request, we didn't do it in a voiceover booth.

1503
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:51,100
We did it in a bed with satin sheets.

1504
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,020
I laid down.

1505
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,620
They mounted a television on the ceiling above me

1506
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,740
and I demanded they all leave the room.

1507
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:01,260
This is a safe space for just Mitch.

1508
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,180
And you guys are giving a lot.

1509
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,260
You're assigning a lot to Mitch.

1510
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:07,540
I feel like he was just doing a job.

1511
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,620
Oh, just following orders, Jason.

1512
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,140
Is that what you're saying?

1513
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:12,780
Oh, boy, here we go.

1514
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,900
You know, he was just I know I think he was just cocky.

1515
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,780
He was just reading what was written for.

1516
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:20,860
But I think but, you know, I think actors have to do like

1517
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,300
do a full dive, go all the way there.

1518
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:26,740
Yeah. He reads that copy like, OK, so I have to inhabit

1519
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,940
the horniest mind in America.

1520
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,700
Well, so be it.

1521
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,780
To be the Fox Network Fox. Transform.

1522
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:39,060
I'm going to transform myself.

1523
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,860
I mean, I love it's the best part about these, I got to say.

1524
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,100
I it pulls a lot of focus.

1525
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,860
Here I am, like not even watching the tricks after a while.

1526
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:51,300
We're waiting for I'm clocking these lines for Pileggi.

1527
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,260
Yeah. Uh huh. Yep.

1528
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:55,900
He should really they should get him back,

1529
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,260
but he should just do sort of narrating any other magics

1530
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:02,260
like a Chris Angel magic special and just comments about Chris and stuff.

1531
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:04,060
Like, oh, yeah, that hair.

1532
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:07,820
Look at that hair like the brush that back behind his ear.

1533
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:12,900
Hope it's real.

1534
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,580
Hope it doesn't come off of his head when I touch the hair.

1535
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:18,020
Boy, I'd like to take off that studded belt

1536
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:21,860
and that other studded belt and the third studded belt.

1537
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,300
That's a man you look at.

1538
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,780
You go, hmm, wonder if he has ideas for Italian ice.

1539
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:34,380
Oh, this Jonathan Davis music is really getting me in the mood.

1540
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,620
Hmm. Yeah.

1541
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,020
Anything any any magic.

1542
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,660
What I think I just thought, wait, it's OK.

1543
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:46,220
And that's how he makes a handkerchief disappear.

1544
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,460
And boy, when I look at those assistants,

1545
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:52,820
let's just say I'm going to need a handkerchief when I'm done.

1546
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:54,860
You know what?

1547
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:58,340
You're going to want to see that handkerchief disappear as fast as can be.

1548
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,980
Do I think you've captured the voice perfectly, the special.

1549
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:02,980
See, this is what happened.

1550
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:05,700
I think I see I'm going to stay stuck like this from now on.

1551
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:10,020
Four episodes from now when we're talking about the teacups, it'll say hello.

1552
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:15,500
So Scott Gardner here here to talk about the maddest tea party there ever was.

1553
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,860
Like, I'm not even saying anything sexual.

1554
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:18,740
I just can't.

1555
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,900
I'm not going to be able to shake it the longer I stay at it.

1556
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,940
Right. Yeah. Hot, hot tea.

1557
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,340
I had 12 and hot at 12 or 13.

1558
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,540
You think I'd be like interested in this.

1559
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:31,860
But I was so like, how's he going to get out of that coffin?

1560
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,380
And like, you know, I was not.

1561
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,100
I was not. I didn't clock any of this.

1562
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,460
No, I was all I say.

1563
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,340
Yeah. Well, shows you where all of our brains were.

1564
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,060
But maybe our dads know.

1565
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:41,620
Yeah, maybe.

1566
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:44,020
But this is this this is for the dead.

1567
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,300
You don't want to think about.

1568
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,700
Look, you don't want to think about Pileggi as a sexual creature when you were 12.

1569
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:53,940
You know, I was thinking about him giving Scully and Mulder so much grief.

1570
01:13:54,060 --> 01:14:00,140
Yeah. But now I am wondering if Pileggi was like pitching its publicists like,

1571
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:04,620
look, Scully and Mulder get to be in sexy spreads and magazines.

1572
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,780
When it's my turn, you know, Pileggi

1573
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,820
never get to do a sexy spread.

1574
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:09,740
I don't know that he did.

1575
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:12,820
He was never in bed with between the two of them on like a Rolling Stone cover.

1576
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,940
I feel like he maybe had like if he was in a photo spread,

1577
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,100
he had like a button or two undone.

1578
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,740
And that was as sexy as it got.

1579
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:24,380
Let's find the sexiest photos of Mitch Pileggi.

1580
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:26,060
The sexiest Pileggi.

1581
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,340
Why was why can't there?

1582
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:29,300
Why can't Pileggi go Playgirl?

1583
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,660
Every he should have been in Playgirl.

1584
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,660
They I mean, everybody in the especially in the 90s, they had their sexy

1585
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:38,100
photo shoot if you want to have a popular TV show.

1586
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,260
But yeah, Pileggi was, I mean, the third lead on the show.

1587
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,620
Yeah. Basically, I found it pretty well.

1588
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:48,100
This is this isn't like a photo shoot, but here he is shirtless from something.

1589
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:49,940
Oh, wow. Yeah, there you go.

1590
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:52,500
Yep. You didn't think I could make glasses sexy, did you?

1591
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,820
Wow. Pileggi can do it all.

1592
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:56,540
He really can.

1593
01:14:56,540 --> 01:15:00,860
Gosh. So that well, look, he is if he is if you got a sexy results

1594
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:04,140
in your first two lines of your Google image. That's true.

1595
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:05,420
I think you're you're in a good place.

1596
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:06,540
Yeah. Mm hmm.

1597
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:09,980
So, yeah, we've realized that Pileggi is like kind of the star of these specials,

1598
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:13,260
really. How about this one from this is from Stargate, Atlantis?

1599
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,660
Stargate, Atlantis, another show.

1600
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:19,660
There's nothing sexy going on, but he's he's just in like a greenish, grayish

1601
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:23,740
jumpsuit, but he's kind of like a spread eagle, man spreading.

1602
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:27,900
But it's also a very it's a little I mean, it might just be the cut of the suit,

1603
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,700
but it's a little bit a little bulgy.

1604
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,820
You can see it if that's what you're talking about.

1605
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:32,860
Yeah, you can see it.

1606
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,260
He's he's he knows, too.

1607
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:35,500
You can see the look on his face.

1608
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,940
He knows what he's doing.

1609
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,620
He knows if you're taking a photo of that, he knows.

1610
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:40,340
He prepped himself before the take.

1611
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:41,860
Can I just can I fluff real quick?

1612
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:45,140
I'm always prepped to prep needed.

1613
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:49,060
It's always 50 percent.

1614
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,420
I'm Pileggi. That's how I that's how I work.

1615
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:55,820
When I'm on set, it's always 50 percent.

1616
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,420
Is there can there just be ever can there ever be a scene

1617
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:01,380
where there's a lady scientist and I say, I'd like to see your

1618
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:06,020
Stargate. Yeah, you keep pitching the Mitch.

1619
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,820
You pitch every three seasons and I don't know.

1620
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:10,540
It doesn't feel appropriate for it is your work and your Stargate.

1621
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,060
Take me. OK. OK, Mitch.

1622
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,020
And now we're not even the cameras aren't even rolling.

1623
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,420
I don't know. Doesn't matter.

1624
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:18,300
Just we're stuck in Max Masked Magician mode, Mitch.

1625
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,980
Ever since we did that, we do that special.

1626
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:25,020
Now you say everything weird every day, every day, every time since you did it.

1627
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:28,660
Mulder Scully, we spend all this time focusing on the X files.

1628
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,060
What about the X, X, X files?

1629
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:34,700
Oh, man, she's got to be deprogrammed.

1630
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:38,260
We have to take him to, like, a we never we never got him back.

1631
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,540
Yeah. Yeah.

1632
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:43,420
Well, Nash Entertainment can find some of those psychics if they. Yeah.

1633
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,460
Unless they exposed all of them too much.

1634
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:49,460
Mr. Pileggi, I hate to say this, but the test results have come back.

1635
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:51,940
You're permanently horny.

1636
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,140
It's an uncurable condition.

1637
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:57,140
Hey, I hope they never find one.

1638
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:58,020
Good news.

1639
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,260
I hope I test positive for the rest of my life.

1640
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:05,420
Does he, by the way, does he introduce himself as just Valentino in the special?

1641
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,180
Yes. Yes. When we get to the end.

1642
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:09,660
Yeah, it is just Valentino.

1643
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,020
I mean, we'll get let's OK.

1644
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:15,180
I mean, we can head for the because the reveal is a big part of it

1645
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:17,140
and something like darling implied.

1646
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:21,300
But like on the way to it, besides the sexy, sexy voice of Mitch Pileggi,

1647
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,020
is there anything we want to shout out?

1648
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:25,700
Anything that was like genuinely interesting to find out

1649
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,420
throughout these specials?

1650
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:30,260
Really, it's just like just to make sure I say it.

1651
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:34,780
The so much of this thing is just pace and ominous.

1652
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,460
Yeah. Yeah. The feeling that we're getting away with something

1653
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:41,620
because you could do there is a much drier sort of I don't want to say

1654
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,700
Mythbusters because Mythbusters has a style and an energy.

1655
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,380
But like they could have done the same special

1656
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,820
on the history channel or whatever.

1657
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:53,260
Yeah, you could just you could do this in a really dry way

1658
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:54,420
and it would have no impact.

1659
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:58,820
But how much of this is just that mood, just the air and waiting?

1660
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:03,500
And it gets so it does get like, all right, now we watch one slowly

1661
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:07,420
and then there's dancing and form and like, so how did we do it?

1662
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,100
And then you watch it all again.

1663
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:13,820
It is just it is it's not like 80 percent of this thing is style.

1664
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,420
Yeah. And as yeah, especially when you're a kid and you

1665
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:20,140
you don't notice how you're being manipulated by mood and style.

1666
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,140
Yeah. Yeah. So effective.

1667
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:24,780
And yeah, repeat like replaying things over and over.

1668
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,860
You don't notice like, oh, they're patting this out a little bit.

1669
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:27,740
Yeah. Yeah.

1670
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:31,060
There's ones where they do kind of like drawing on the screen.

1671
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,740
Like, look right there. A crew guy. Did you see it?

1672
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,580
Yeah, I saw when you surf it.

1673
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:40,940
Yes. I think it's extremely, extremely clear as the clip show editor

1674
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:44,620
veteran. Right. This is a you got never worked for Nash.

1675
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,900
No, I never worked for Nash.

1676
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,060
And I never worked for that Jason Alexander clip show.

1677
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,580
That's what you want. I was a dream.

1678
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:50,780
Ways of the dream. Yeah.

1679
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:52,980
David Faustino clip show, but not Jason Alexander.

1680
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,980
So you're way up sitcom side. Yeah, you got to earn it.

1681
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:59,860
Yeah. So, yeah, you you got to reuse this footage.

1682
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,100
You know, you got to do it.

1683
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,540
You got to show it from different angles.

1684
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:04,860
You got to punch in. You got to do all all the tricks.

1685
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:07,300
Yeah. Yeah. Milk it for all it's worth. Right.

1686
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:11,700
But any but like things that were like that actually was I

1687
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,340
I never knew how they did that.

1688
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,900
Spoiler alert, I guess, for listeners, if you don't want these illusions

1689
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:19,420
ruined forever, I turn off the podcast now.

1690
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:23,140
I do like first of all, I'll say that there's a YouTube channel.

1691
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:24,180
I'm sure we all found it.

1692
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,980
I assume that has all these clips on it. Yes.

1693
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:29,940
Like an official Masked Magician YouTube.

1694
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:35,020
And they like they they have posted the same clips maybe once a year.

1695
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:37,980
So you can find the exact same clips with the same titles

1696
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:40,380
from different years posted.

1697
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:43,340
So I don't know if that's something that helps them with the algorithm

1698
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,140
to get views or whatever. Yeah.

1699
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,980
But I found one of them that I like.

1700
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,420
I like it when it's a really dumb, simple trick.

1701
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,700
And like the explanation is simple.

1702
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,260
Like there was one where they have four different,

1703
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:56,500
I don't know, you'd call them bases and one there's a knife.

1704
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,700
Did you see this?

1705
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:00,060
There's like one of them is going to have a knife on it.

1706
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:01,380
There's four bases.

1707
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,020
And then you'll put styrofoam cups over all four of them.

1708
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:08,620
And Masked Magician will slam his hand down on all three of the cups

1709
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:12,500
and will not like impale his hand on the knife.

1710
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,460
And the assistant, while he turns his back, the assistant moves the cups around

1711
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,420
three card, what is it?

1712
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,540
Three card monti table style.

1713
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,900
And then he turns around, he comes back and it's very dramatic.

1714
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,540
He crushes three of the cups and then, of course, takes the last one off.

1715
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:29,740
And the knife is there.

1716
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:34,140
And the way that is done is one of the bases just has a little string

1717
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:35,580
attached to it.

1718
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:39,260
And the assistant, like they make sure to put the knife

1719
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:40,980
on the one that has the little string.

1720
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,780
So when he goes over and sees the four cups, it's clear to him

1721
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,700
that there's a string. Oh.

1722
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:46,860
And that's where the knife is.

1723
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,180
And like, it's just dumb.

1724
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,420
It's an easy dumb trick that you probably won't notice

1725
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,740
because the string is so thin.

1726
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:55,780
Little string is the solution on a lot of the illusions. Yeah.

1727
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:00,060
Contortionist assistant, that's like, yes.

1728
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:04,940
Squeezing into like a secret area or a secret wall.

1729
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:08,900
Although a tiger, the very first, like in the very first special,

1730
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:13,660
there is one where they, quote unquote, make a tiger disappear, I think.

1731
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:18,820
Or appear in a, they send up an assistant and then a tiger shows up.

1732
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:21,580
The tiger is in like behind a fake wall.

1733
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:26,220
So they have to feed the tiger a lot of raw meat before they trap it

1734
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:27,660
in a fake wall.

1735
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:30,460
And then it's still it's still airborne with because the assistant

1736
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,660
ultimately just goes into a little compartment under it,

1737
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:35,620
but has to share a really tight space with a tiger.

1738
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:37,340
Yeah, that's kind of upset.

1739
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:41,380
That one's kind of like, boy, that's still sort of death defying.

1740
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:42,660
I think for this.

1741
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:46,540
But yeah, a lot of the answer to so many of them is just compartments

1742
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:50,500
and a really flexible assistant, which is a perfect fodder

1743
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,140
for all it takes is flexibility. Right.

1744
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:59,700
Here's a good narration bit that's not a corny, but is confusing.

1745
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:06,500
That this is a real straight jacket, the kind you'd find in any good asylum.

1746
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:10,460
And it's like, that's a little catty that if they're not corny,

1747
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,620
they're very like a bit cheat.

1748
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:15,420
Like, it's a diss of bad asylums.

1749
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:16,580
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1750
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,980
Lacks asylum with no straight jackets.

1751
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,940
Unprofessional asylum, huh?

1752
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,660
Not again.

1753
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:29,020
Let down by the funding, the government funding for the next time.

1754
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:32,940
The next time you're taking a loved one to stay in an asylum forever.

1755
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:36,180
First question should be straight jackets or no.

1756
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:38,620
They say, no, you're out the door.

1757
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,060
Yeah, it's all look, it's a he can sell anything with that voice, really.

1758
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:46,060
Including shooting an arrow with a gun.

1759
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,060
Yeah, that is another little string one.

1760
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:51,980
And also the put upon crew guy

1761
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:56,620
waiting for his cue, there's a number of shots of put upon

1762
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:02,140
crew guys hiding behind something to fire a target or in one case,

1763
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:07,420
make a very elaborate conveyor belt appear,

1764
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:10,860
like so we can crawl out so it doesn't get burned alive.

1765
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:11,940
Oh, right. OK.

1766
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:13,420
This is this. OK.

1767
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,900
I don't know if you guys found this, this crossover with the Masked Magician.

1768
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,140
Cross. Do you know what I'm talking about? No.

1769
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,460
You mean the dramatic series crossover?

1770
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,140
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1771
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,220
And I believe that's the same illusion that is used in that.

1772
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:30,660
Where there is a rig that like pulls a rope through.

1773
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:34,900
It's it doesn't matter, but like it doesn't matter.

1774
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:39,460
He get the he will just just say where you're going that.

1775
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:45,020
Well, the TV show that Masked Magician crossed over on is Diagnosis Murder.

1776
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,260
Yeah. Classic.

1777
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:50,420
My grandparents love diagnosis and the premise.

1778
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:54,140
CBS, Dick Van Dyke, medical.

1779
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:58,340
Not I was going to say drama, but maybe I'd never seen the medical mystery.

1780
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,700
It is a drama, light drama.

1781
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:01,740
But yes, it's not.

1782
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:04,220
He's a doctor, but he's always solving.

1783
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,220
Yes. And it's dark comedies.

1784
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:09,460
And then there are light, light dramas, which is what this seems to be.

1785
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,300
And it was on for like eight years.

1786
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:14,940
Yeah. And I've tried watching it over the years and it's mostly unwatchable.

1787
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:17,780
Seemingly. This is the first I'd ever seen it.

1788
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:19,860
Oh, my God. It's so much hokier than I thought.

1789
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,020
Oh, I've watched a lot.

1790
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:26,260
Diagnosis Murder, Matlock, Walker and the spinoff of Walker.

1791
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:31,100
Martial Law was the Sammo Hung light martial arts.

1792
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,300
Oh, yeah.

1793
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,220
Cheech Marin in it. Or was it Chong?

1794
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:36,140
Which one was in it? I forget.

1795
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,540
But yeah, Diagnosis like Murder, she wrote,

1796
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:41,340
I think looks like a masterpiece compared to Diagnosis Murder.

1797
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,700
This is so dopey.

1798
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,460
This is so dopey, which is certainly fun to be had.

1799
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:49,020
But the premise of this episode is that someone is trying to kill

1800
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:52,300
the Masked Magician because he's revealing the secrets.

1801
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:56,940
Yes. And now could they have done this with just anybody

1802
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:59,300
playing the Masked Magician and being in that mask?

1803
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:03,860
Absolutely. But instead, they did it with the participation

1804
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:09,540
of Val Valentino, the eventually demasked Masked Magician.

1805
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:13,620
And it kind of seems like, you know, because presumably this

1806
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:16,180
must have happened after he had unmasked himself.

1807
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:19,820
And it's part of his publicity tour, because he tried to get like a big bump out of this.

1808
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:22,620
He went and did every talk show. He was on everything.

1809
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:25,940
He was on Regis and Kelly and various talk shows and whatever.

1810
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:29,700
And this seems like the biggest, like, put a lot of eggs in this basket.

1811
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,340
Yes. To start his dramatic acting career.

1812
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:35,740
Oh, my God. It is the dumbest shit.

1813
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:40,180
It's so dumb. And there's he does unmask when he's in the hospital.

1814
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:44,100
But then there also is a scene or more than one scene where he is in the mask

1815
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:48,340
talking to Dick Van Dyke in the hospital, in the hospital bed.

1816
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,420
And so the mask is just nodding around.

1817
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,220
I don't even know if it's like I'll just show it to Jason.

1818
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,860
He hasn't seen it. But this is this is like when he's later on.

1819
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:00,740
Well, I'm going straight over to the studio and start rehearsing for tomorrow night's broadcast.

1820
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,660
I don't think it's a very good idea.

1821
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:05,940
The Mask Magician is performing despite fervent protest from his team of top surgeons.

1822
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:08,780
You just told me I was fine.

1823
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:11,580
Yes, but I think there's a very good chance that whoever sabotaged that trick

1824
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:12,740
is going to try it again.

1825
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,420
And next time you may not be so lucky.

1826
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,740
Daring death for you, the viewer. Use it.

1827
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:19,780
If I was going to be scared off, I never would have done this in the first place.

1828
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,940
Besides, I'm getting a big raise.

1829
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:25,340
Wearing the mask there.

1830
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:29,580
I mean, that's the head just nodding around is so, so funny.

1831
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:32,620
Fucking funny. Yeah, yeah.

1832
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:36,420
I've got a clip, too, which is that so the I think important context

1833
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:40,180
is that he, you know, some of the excuse we nodded to this at the beginning

1834
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:44,980
once he explained what he did and why, why he revealed these.

1835
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,460
It was it was kind of pinned on.

1836
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:51,540
Well, the, you know, people aren't interested in magic anymore.

1837
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,740
And, you know, other media has kind of taken it over.

1838
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:56,620
And magicians are letting the old tricks grow stale.

1839
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:58,340
They're leaning on the same old tricks.

1840
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:02,260
And I want it to shake up the whole game to, like, inspire the best out of everybody.

1841
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:07,300
So then it leads to this scene where he is unmasked and he has a real arrow in him.

1842
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,060
Is that right?

1843
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,180
He's got to pull out.

1844
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:11,340
He let yeah, he got an arrow.

1845
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,700
And then, like, they left it in until he got to the hospital.

1846
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:18,220
And then Dick Van Dyke, 72 year old Dick Van Dyke has to pull it out.

1847
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:21,060
Oh, my God. So then you get this little scene.

1848
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:25,220
Only this time someone put an explosive charge at Dick Van Dyke's son.

1849
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:28,060
They want to kill me for revealing these old tricks.

1850
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,780
Well, another quarter of an inch down, they would have to.

1851
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,220
You know, I can't blame them for being angry.

1852
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,580
Why would you want to take the wonder out of magic?

1853
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:38,620
I love magic, but it's a dying art.

1854
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:44,140
Thanks to unimaginative magicians who keep rehashing the same old tricks.

1855
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:48,780
There's no magic about getting what is this problem?

1856
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:50,100
Like, what is this?

1857
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:53,420
That's what I that reading magicians talking about.

1858
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:57,020
It's like, we didn't really worry about a lot of these solutions are like

1859
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:02,100
a 90 or 100 years old and people do stuff kind of differently,

1860
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:05,260
which would make sense to be that old these solutions,

1861
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:08,940
because there's some corny ass stuff in here.

1862
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:13,860
There's some like stuff where it's just like, that's just like a trap door.

1863
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:16,980
Like, I I'm reading this book called I'm the Flash,

1864
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,700
which is about a guy who, like in high school, he, you know,

1865
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,940
gets roped into being a corny.

1866
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:28,460
And and and he learns all the like, well, here's how you hide the docks.

1867
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,140
Is this like a sliding doors for you?

1868
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:32,260
Do you think like, why didn't it happen to me?

1869
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:35,140
Oh, yeah. I don't think I had to worry about that.

1870
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:36,700
It's so nasty.

1871
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:38,900
Like, it's like the fifties and sixties.

1872
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:43,580
And it's just like, I yeah, they're running like in school.

1873
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:47,900
They're running like the numbers gate or like they're running bedding in school.

1874
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:52,060
They're running a casino for the senior class at someone's house

1875
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,100
until it gets shut down.

1876
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,980
But there's very much some of the tricks where it's just like,

1877
01:28:56,980 --> 01:29:01,860
and then he palm this or it's like, and then the other contraption

1878
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,980
that just made it disappear.

1879
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:08,740
Like I've this copy or whatever this line he says about, you know,

1880
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,340
magic is dying or whatever.

1881
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:11,980
I see it in a lot of places.

1882
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:16,020
This seemed to be kind of the like the premise of this whole special

1883
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,220
or his philosophy.

1884
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:21,900
But also, and correct me if I'm wrong, was he not just a cast in this special?

1885
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,260
Like, it's yeah, they just need somebody to do it.

1886
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,980
It's going to happen with or without him. Right.

1887
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:29,740
And then like all this like mythology was built and like his reasoning for doing it

1888
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:33,100
versus just like he wasn't doing that well as a magician.

1889
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:36,340
And he was like, yeah, OK, I'll do some work, some, but not a ton.

1890
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:39,700
And this is a way to kind of get an angle and maybe get some publicity out of it.

1891
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,780
Also, just him. Yeah, it's so funny.

1892
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:42,860
He has this stock. All right.

1893
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,180
Here's my justification.

1894
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:47,220
And you hear him say it in the actual special.

1895
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,460
And then a couple of months later, you're watching him do it

1896
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:52,260
from a hospital bed with fake struggling.

1897
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,540
It's these other magicians.

1898
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:57,700
Ouch. They just want to out me for oof.

1899
01:29:57,980 --> 01:29:59,980
All of my revealing of secrets.

1900
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:03,220
Ah, don't they realize that movies and TV

1901
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:07,180
ouch are making magic less popular than ever?

1902
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:11,420
Aye. Also, his his magicians may

1903
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:13,300
his real name is not Valentino.

1904
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:16,940
And it's not it's I forget it's like a regular name. OK, sure.

1905
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:21,100
When I was like, oh, Valentino, he must like, I don't know.

1906
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,940
I was like, he might have an accent.

1907
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:25,900
He might have some sort of like sexiness or mystery.

1908
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:27,860
Just hearing that name.

1909
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:31,500
And then he's like, hi, I'm Valentino. Yes.

1910
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:33,580
Yeah, that's the big disappointment, isn't it?

1911
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:37,420
I was just hoping that he had some sort of like lover's voice.

1912
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:39,100
I'm Valentino.

1913
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,420
Not Pileggi necessarily, but something going on.

1914
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:44,300
The longer you let him talk in this thing, it's just I'm Valentino,

1915
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,380
the mass magician.

1916
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:46,860
Ah, why do they hate me?

1917
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:50,340
He's less. He's got a less sexy voice than any of us.

1918
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:55,860
Val Valentino, born Leonard Montano.

1919
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,340
There you go.

1920
01:30:57,340 --> 01:30:59,820
I don't know. You can work with Leonard, especially if you got Leo.

1921
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:02,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm Leo Montano.

1922
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:04,780
You could always in the end. Yeah, you could work. You're right.

1923
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:07,260
That's not too bad. But yes, Leonard, though.

1924
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:09,540
Hello, I'm Leonard Montano.

1925
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:10,620
Like that's sort of. Yeah.

1926
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:14,180
And I was disappointed because I forgot how he sounded.

1927
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:16,620
But when I started reading again and I was like, oh, Valentino,

1928
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:20,060
oh, he must have some sort of exotic sounding voice.

1929
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,980
Oh, ouch, doctor.

1930
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:24,180
Ah, the magicians don't like me.

1931
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,300
There there's some.

1932
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,740
I'm trying to make them up their game.

1933
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:33,700
Don't they see? Oh, Barry Van Dyke has more sexuality in that clip.

1934
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:36,060
That it's so if you like, you know,

1935
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:39,740
I like to imagine watching this, you know,

1936
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:41,980
I'm going to show you this medical show.

1937
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:42,980
Dick Van Dyke is in it.

1938
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:47,260
But interesting fact, one of the other doctors is also Dick Van Dyke's son.

1939
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:50,180
See if you can spot which one 10 seconds in.

1940
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:53,100
Well, now, doctor, I think you really got to take a look at this guy.

1941
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:56,140
Oh, should I? I think I think I should.

1942
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:58,700
He's losing blood. Look at him. Oh, wow. You're right.

1943
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:01,580
It's it's not, you know, a hokey.

1944
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:03,580
It's nice that they got to work.

1945
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:05,460
It's nice to get to work with your son.

1946
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:09,980
Just in the same way that Lucille Ball, nice to work with her kids.

1947
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:13,700
A TV legend gets to bring their kid and force them into a show.

1948
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:16,300
That's nice, you know, and they get to work with them.

1949
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:19,100
So sure, that's just a nice thing, I think.

1950
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:22,060
For that lot of time, TV sets, it takes a long time.

1951
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:25,300
That's probably bonded a lot while waiting for the lights to get set.

1952
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:25,860
That's right.

1953
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:29,700
If only Jack Lemmon could have been on Thunder in Paradise with his son.

1954
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,580
That would have been better.

1955
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:33,580
They would have bonded.

1956
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,460
Hey, brother, if we get season five, you know,

1957
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:36,900
you're going to get Jack in here.

1958
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,940
The Holster loves the apartment, brother.

1959
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:43,340
Jack's shooting a machine gun on the boat.

1960
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:47,140
I mean, what gets me cooking like Glegary Gleg Ross, brother?

1961
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,780
Brother, I don't want to drive to Orlando.

1962
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:53,460
Can we film this in my backyard?

1963
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:55,660
Just do a lot of close ups of me.

1964
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:58,700
Tampa, you're saying? Yeah.

1965
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:03,620
Uh, the there is there was a Valentino quote of these, like,

1966
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:06,940
and this I'm blowing up after these specials.

1967
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:11,020
I've been doing giant shows in Brazil for 18 months.

1968
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:14,060
Then I went to Japan to do more giant shows.

1969
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:18,100
And whatever it was, I couldn't track him in the media.

1970
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:21,860
I'm like, oh, I think he's worth like I love magic.

1971
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:25,940
I have a lot of respect for magic, but I think he's working us right now.

1972
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:28,220
I think he's lying. Oh, perhaps.

1973
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:31,900
Just when he's like a lot going on, a lot of stuff going on.

1974
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:34,620
Do you see all the stuff I got going? Yeah.

1975
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:39,180
Yeah, it really it's it's kind of it must add to the deflation of the whole thing.

1976
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:42,780
Obviously, that when the unmasking happens, it's not one of the one

1977
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,140
of the two magicians that you've heard of. Right.

1978
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:49,580
But then also that, again, he's not some like fucked up scarred guy.

1979
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:51,540
That's what you want. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1980
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:55,460
That or at least just like, you know, I want I want like a, you know,

1981
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:58,860
you want to like a like a Lawrence Fishburne looking guy, you know, like,

1982
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:01,020
so like somebody cool or something.

1983
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:04,060
But that he is just kind of this like pasty guy.

1984
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:06,060
It's me, Valentino.

1985
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:08,420
It is it's kind of a letdown. Yeah.

1986
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:11,740
The way it plays out in the actual special.

1987
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:12,900
I mean, I remember this one.

1988
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,060
I remember the first one strongly.

1989
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:16,460
And I remember the here it comes, here it comes.

1990
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:17,700
What's it going to be?

1991
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:22,060
And then that he he does a big speech where he does some of this justification.

1992
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:26,340
And they deepen the voice, even though he's going to get unmasked.

1993
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:28,780
He hasn't talked in any of the episodes. Right.

1994
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:30,140
But they still deepen the voice,

1995
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:33,220
even though we are about to hear his real voice and see his real face.

1996
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:36,700
But he's still we got to go through this whole like, I'm not doing this

1997
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:39,340
because of the pressure that I'm receiving from fellow magicians.

1998
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,620
I'm doing this because of my love of magic.

1999
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:44,620
It's all right. This is dorky, even with the pitch down.

2000
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:49,620
In recent years, movies and video games have overtaken magic as our main.

2001
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:52,780
And then he does an even worse one down the road where he's like, oh, wait,

2002
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:56,140
this was in a fucking Reddit AMA later. Like, why did I do it?

2003
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:59,540
Well, because magic was being lost

2004
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:06,220
amidst the age of the information superhighway, he says, in like 2013.

2005
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:09,580
Wow. Using that phrase out of it as this guy.

2006
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:14,020
But anyway, you know, hey, because of these specials,

2007
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:16,500
remember to remember back when the first one aired,

2008
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:19,660
back when it got better ratings and what's airing right now.

2009
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:23,020
Everybody was gathered by the water cooler the next day.

2010
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:25,980
They were talking about magic the way it used to be.

2011
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:29,860
Back in, you know, 1904, the way everybody gathered at the water

2012
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:32,900
cooler the morning after seeing the Boudini show.

2013
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:38,580
People are still chasing that goddamn water cooler like he has a kid.

2014
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:41,500
I was just like, what is what is going on in water?

2015
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,300
It's like a thing.

2016
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,380
See, you'll see the great American watering hole.

2017
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:51,180
Certainly offices won't get destroyed forever by a disease

2018
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:55,660
taking away most making people not want to share from the same water

2019
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:58,260
cooler ever again. Yeah.

2020
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:01,700
I even when I worked in office, I feel like most people's

2021
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:05,580
feeling was like, I want to get in and get or it's like, oh, God,

2022
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,460
I don't want to run into someone.

2023
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:09,620
Yeah. How quickly can I let be a head down?

2024
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:12,780
Must focus. I look I would look up at you and be friendly.

2025
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:16,180
But you see, I have to make sure that the water cooler is working properly.

2026
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:18,460
And sometimes with tea, you got to press the other tab down.

2027
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:21,500
So I got to be staring to I cannot be friendly to you right now.

2028
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,220
I'm so sorry.

2029
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:26,220
No, it's it's all it's all that's all an illusion.

2030
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:30,300
Also, like movies and video games where I I

2031
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:34,020
I loved movies and video games as a 12 or 13 year old.

2032
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:37,460
And I was truly confused sometimes

2033
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:40,820
when they were like the dangers of this stuff.

2034
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:43,180
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

2035
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:45,660
Even the violence, even the violent ones?

2036
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:50,380
Yeah, it was pretty still pretty indifferent to like I was never

2037
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:53,620
scared because I knew it was pretend.

2038
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:58,620
I don't know. I think I was more scared at the mass magician of school.

2039
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:01,900
Yeah, mass magicians and school shootings that would come.

2040
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,660
So I think I was too. Yeah.

2041
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:08,260
I was scared of two things, possibility of school shooting

2042
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:12,260
and possibility of mass magician getting kicked out of the magicians alliance.

2043
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:14,260
Yeah, I didn't like so terrified for this.

2044
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:17,500
So the tension in this last minute is sky high.

2045
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:20,420
And then like at some point, he's like,

2046
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:23,540
so now magic is center stage again.

2047
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:27,180
Could you honestly say that you've been hurt by watching these specials?

2048
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,860
No. Hey, hey, hey, Mitch Pileggi

2049
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:34,340
jumping in here, the opposite.

2050
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:36,380
What if I guess I was hurt a little bit.

2051
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:38,020
Blue balls.

2052
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:40,060
What if he took it off and it was Pileggi?

2053
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:43,220
Oh, man, that changes the entire thing.

2054
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:43,980
Yeah, it really does.

2055
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,740
It was right in front of you the whole time.

2056
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:47,500
He was the host and he was the magician.

2057
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,180
Fuck. That would have been awesome.

2058
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:52,020
That's that's the sort of sinister behavior

2059
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:56,660
I would expect from the cigarette smoking man, but not director Skinner.

2060
01:37:56,740 --> 01:38:00,620
But that would have been that would have propelled Pileggi into a whole another career.

2061
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:02,900
Yes. Yeah. Oh, he'd be selling out.

2062
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:06,660
He would have gotten the Vegas residency that Dopey Valentino.

2063
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:08,500
Yeah. Could only dream of. That's right.

2064
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:12,620
And you know, we got some assistance from those wacky lone gunmen

2065
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,300
or three gunmen.

2066
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,220
What are they called?

2067
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:19,260
Huh? The lone gunmen, the three guys, the three guys.

2068
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:23,420
Yeah, they must have been working behind the scenes to make all those contraptions.

2069
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,700
You think they're making his tricks?

2070
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:26,860
The actors. Probably.

2071
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:29,460
Yeah, the actors making Pileggis.

2072
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:31,460
Sorry, buddy. You say assistance.

2073
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:32,700
My mind goes to one place.

2074
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,940
Well, that's what I thought, too, when you said his assistance.

2075
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:36,940
A midriff. A midriff.

2076
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:40,340
I do not need to see the lone gunmen's midriff.

2077
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:43,100
The three. What were they called?

2078
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:44,340
What was their official name?

2079
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,820
They had a spinoff show for one season.

2080
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,220
Yeah, I remember.

2081
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:49,580
Wasn't that the name of the show?

2082
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,580
Am I crazy? What's the go? Why am I thinking?

2083
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:53,300
Why am I not remembering?

2084
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:55,860
The Gunmen musical comedy Variety's Bower.

2085
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:58,940
Well, yeah, that Mike would remember.

2086
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:05,100
Eventually, he gets to the justification of like, because of this.

2087
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:09,780
OK, so, you know, so really all builds to like, and that's all thanks to me.

2088
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:11,860
Smoke, but the fakest smoke puff,

2089
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:13,900
the fakest thing of all of the specials.

2090
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:18,860
Valentino, I read the deflation of that moment.

2091
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:21,540
It really like sorry to stay in the horny front,

2092
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,420
but it is such a boner killer.

2093
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:26,820
That moment really like you because you understand everything.

2094
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,500
OK, A, you're not famous.

2095
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,940
B, you're not mysterious.

2096
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:34,340
See, you're not like just remarkable in any way.

2097
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:37,500
Like I expect like Ricardo Montalban with that name.

2098
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:40,860
And like if you if you if you go like, holy shit, look at this guy.

2099
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,380
I want a guy with black hair and a gray streak.

2100
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,940
I want the guy to still be like some bizarre.

2101
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:49,620
Who's the guy, the host of Plan 9 from outer space?

2102
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,140
Oh, yeah, yeah. Whatever, you know.

2103
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:53,780
I want some some weirdo.

2104
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:57,780
But Valentino, you just like you could just tell this guy's got nothing going on.

2105
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:59,580
He just doesn't have it.

2106
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:01,820
And then he keeps talking a little too long.

2107
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:05,060
And he says, oh, magicians everywhere have been letting go of their old tired tricks,

2108
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:07,300
creating bigger and better illusions.

2109
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,380
You see, I inspire.

2110
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:11,540
They're all I made everything better.

2111
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:13,700
I changed the whole magic economy.

2112
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:15,620
Everybody's doing better tricks because of me.

2113
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:16,580
I raised the bar.

2114
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:19,780
And the next time you see me, I'll be working on newer, better.

2115
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:24,620
And then you're like, I know, I know, as a 13 year old, I will never see you again.

2116
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:26,700
I am sure of this.

2117
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:27,940
Yeah, we never did.

2118
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:31,940
Val Valentino is not even a that's not even that doesn't exist

2119
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:35,660
in the like Chris Gaines, like weird pop culture cobwebs.

2120
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:36,740
Like, remember this?

2121
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:39,180
I don't Val Valentino gone.

2122
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:41,060
That has never stayed in my head.

2123
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:42,220
He failed.

2124
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:47,020
He failed completely to ever have any sort of like mental foothold

2125
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:51,340
because you kind of you do look at him and you're like, I enjoyed all these specials.

2126
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:54,140
But yeah, kind of fuck you, dude, on behalf of magicians.

2127
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:56,900
And he did get sued.

2128
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:00,140
Got sued. Yeah, they got the production.

2129
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:03,940
And because there were some magicians going like, well,

2130
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:07,940
I spent $50,000 making that contraption.

2131
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:09,900
And now everyone knows how it works.

2132
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,660
Yeah, justifiably.

2133
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:15,300
Some of those, you know, I expose the Houdini ones, I guess.

2134
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:19,180
But if you have this is in people's current act, it kind of sucks.

2135
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:24,300
In terms of the fallout of the whole thing, the hard copy

2136
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:26,180
did a victory lap.

2137
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:28,060
They said we were the first to expose him.

2138
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:29,620
And then they went on to call him.

2139
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:32,580
So who is this hocus pocus turncoat?

2140
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:35,180
And then the segment keeps going.

2141
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:39,140
And then there's a title at some point that they call him the magic rat.

2142
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:42,460
Wow. Really? Not good publicity.

2143
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:45,420
They say all the publicity is good, but I don't know about this one.

2144
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,500
He might have literally been blackballed.

2145
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,460
Maybe he tried like there was like he was going to do a show

2146
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:52,340
and the magicians are all like, fuck him.

2147
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:54,580
Hey, better than blue.

2148
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:59,100
Um, hey, they he tried to like ride the wave a little bit and like,

2149
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:02,740
you know, put on a little show for hard copy and hard copy follows him

2150
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:06,940
to as he goes and like, here he is getting a makeover

2151
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:10,780
by Giuseppe Franco, hairstylist of the stars.

2152
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:13,180
We were throwing a lot of names out in this one.

2153
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:14,660
You guys ever heard of Giuseppe Franco?

2154
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,340
I don't know Giuseppe Franco.

2155
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:20,060
If you Google Giuseppe Franco, what you will find is a lot of photos

2156
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:24,740
of a guy who looks like a real life Zoolander because he has jet black spiked

2157
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:27,740
hair that doesn't work on a man of that age.

2158
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:29,500
Oh, my God. He's got a salon in Beverly Hills.

2159
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:30,780
Yep. He's still he does it.

2160
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:32,460
He is still a hairstylist to the stars.

2161
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:35,980
And it's a lot of photos of him in between Stallone and Schwarzenegger.

2162
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:38,700
Can we go and get his hair done by him?

2163
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,380
Maybe, maybe.

2164
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:45,380
It might cost us a lot of all the club three monies go into one hairstyle.

2165
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:49,220
God, I want to go and get Giuseppe Franco makeover.

2166
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:50,820
You might need to.

2167
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,780
You're going to have to prove your you're going to have to show off

2168
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:56,220
all your stats, like, you know, give them your whole history,

2169
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:57,260
you know, screen junkies.

2170
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,260
So, you know, I kind of got some stardom off that.

2171
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:00,940
And, you know, just pitch yourself.

2172
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:03,980
OK, on the website for Giuseppe Franco Salon,

2173
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:06,500
there's a picture of model Tatiana Franco,

2174
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:09,980
which I assume is a daughter, but perhaps a wife, a young wife.

2175
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:11,100
I don't know.

2176
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:13,700
But OK, I'll make a I'll make a reservation here.

2177
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:15,140
These are very intriguing.

2178
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:18,140
Yeah, look at well, see if you can try to book one by the end of the cut.

2179
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:20,180
Oh, he does children's cuts.

2180
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:22,780
I assume it's not just famous children's cuts, but maybe.

2181
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:25,900
Oh, it's one of those where they don't say how much it is on the website.

2182
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:29,220
Oh, that's just franchising opportunities, though.

2183
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:31,620
So we could open our own Giuseppe Franco Salon.

2184
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:35,180
It is the cost of doing business that you have to get his hair.

2185
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:36,100
You got to go jet black.

2186
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:37,980
In which case, Mike, I know that's where you're heading.

2187
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,420
I'm headed there anyway.

2188
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:42,100
So, oh, there's multiple stylists.

2189
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:44,780
But I want to see if you can request Giuseppe himself.

2190
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:46,140
But isn't everybody?

2191
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:48,700
I mean, yeah, you're probably right in line.

2192
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:52,500
Probably your star meter has to be of a certain height to get Giuseppe.

2193
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:55,740
Well, if anybody ever gets a big break, you book your big thing.

2194
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:59,020
You sell a show that day when your meter is the highest.

2195
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:00,580
You got to call Giuseppe Franco.

2196
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:01,260
Oh, my God.

2197
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,540
Yeah, it should have been when Screen Juggies was at its height

2198
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:06,180
and I was getting recognized at the airport every time.

2199
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:07,140
That was the time.

2200
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:11,940
Giuseppe, you're racing Dan Murrell over there.

2201
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:12,940
Out of the way, Dan.

2202
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:17,020
It's well, it's like it's my gig to get me, Mundy, Dan Murrell,

2203
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:20,820
all in the different chairs at the salon, getting our hair cut at the same time.

2204
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:24,540
Boys still waiting, still waiting outside.

2205
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:26,100
Let me in, let me in.

2206
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:29,020
I had an appointment time.

2207
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:31,980
Yes, but I assume Giuseppe sounds like Geppetto.

2208
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:36,580
Oh, yes, but the Screen Junkies are busy with the Screen Junkie boys.

2209
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:41,340
Well, this is we'll explore Giuseppe Franco as well.

2210
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:44,500
Anyway, anyway, I, you know,

2211
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:47,660
winding down, but almost one of the only results I could find

2212
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:51,020
was like Valentino trying to get into a Chris Angel party

2213
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:55,380
and then Chris Angel saying, get that piece of shit out of here.

2214
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:59,460
So and it seems to be like a planted story

2215
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:02,300
that's supposed to show what a dick Chris Angel is.

2216
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:05,300
But then several weeks later, in the same Vegas newspaper,

2217
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:08,700
there was the flip side of it, which is like, yeah, this was a

2218
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:10,580
this is a party like anybody could go to.

2219
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,860
He just had to buy tickets.

2220
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:14,620
And then he just he bought a ticket and then was like wearing a mass

2221
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:17,820
magician shirt and trying to sign masks for people.

2222
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,540
So angels like, get the fuck out of here.

2223
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:21,300
Don't do that here.

2224
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,940
So his respect among fellow magicians is very low.

2225
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:29,820
There's a story that a pen of Penn and Teller has told in his book

2226
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:35,820
where he went to a Vegas strip club and Valentino was there.

2227
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:39,460
And he's like, hey, hey, Penn, it's me, the mass magician.

2228
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:43,380
Tell these girls, I've been telling my girls here that I'm the mass magician.

2229
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:47,580
He does this big like walkthrough like, let me name some names.

2230
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:50,540
Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Jim Morrison.

2231
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:53,180
What do they all have in common? I don't know what they all

2232
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:56,700
we know their names because they didn't wear a fucking bag on their head.

2233
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:59,820
I've never seen you before in your in your in my entire life.

2234
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:00,900
Good evening.

2235
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:03,740
And then he kept walking to get his victorious lap dance.

2236
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:04,620
OK, all right.

2237
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:08,580
So, you know, I think this guy I don't know about blackballing.

2238
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:09,500
I don't know about band.

2239
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,980
He certainly wasn't killed.

2240
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:14,540
But Penn and Chris Angel don't like the guy suffered.

2241
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:16,140
He suffered for it.

2242
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:19,100
Yeah. And Chris Angel only likes the highest caliber.

2243
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:22,060
That's right. As we know from his what's his podcast called again?

2244
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:25,060
Oh, yeah, I remember talking.

2245
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:27,860
Was it called Talking Junkies? Oh, well, great.

2246
01:46:27,860 --> 01:46:32,300
Now, now we're going to get blackballed from the podcaster.

2247
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,780
Well, that's right. I didn't reveal any secrets yet.

2248
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:38,060
You're showing the proper respect to his podcast with Rampage

2249
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:40,900
from the 18 movie. Wow.

2250
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:44,220
Hammer, his offensive standup comedian buddy.

2251
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:46,660
Chris only chooses the highest caliber. Right.

2252
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:48,420
And he doesn't want any part of Valentino.

2253
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:49,740
So Valentine, it just didn't work.

2254
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:54,020
He ended up like maybe worse than before, understandably.

2255
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:55,620
But the specials are neat.

2256
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:57,980
I think it helped Mike Darnell.

2257
01:46:57,980 --> 01:47:01,020
They used him up, you know, they took him for everything he was worth.

2258
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:03,140
Wave your arms around. Wear this mask.

2259
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:05,220
Yeah. And then they they left him for dead.

2260
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:06,540
Mike. Yeah.

2261
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:10,380
One of the more skeptic, like angry magicians was like

2262
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:14,220
Fox was working for years to get these made.

2263
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:19,620
And they finally found someone, an integrity free fraud.

2264
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:23,900
Like, yeah, there's some people still mad about it online.

2265
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:26,540
Understandably, because it did ruin some classics.

2266
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:30,660
Here's a quote from an article from Kevin Spencer, a touring musician,

2267
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:32,020
during Magician.

2268
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:34,060
Certainly no one's out to break his legs or kill him.

2269
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:35,100
That's just hype.

2270
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:37,100
We're just disappointed that someone who made his living

2271
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:39,940
performing the art of magic for over 25 years would be so quick

2272
01:47:39,940 --> 01:47:43,700
to betray their community and then still want to embrace them.

2273
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:45,660
In Vegas is gentlemen's clubs.

2274
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:48,820
He wants it both ways. Yeah, I feel bad for him.

2275
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:53,620
I, you know, and I just I did see years and years later

2276
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:58,100
in Philadelphia at the one concert hall there.

2277
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:00,860
Penn and Teller did do a bullet catch trick,

2278
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:04,300
but they each had like a six shooter.

2279
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:07,220
They each had like a three fifty seven magnum.

2280
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:12,380
So in their reactions to catching the bullet

2281
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:16,700
were very like so intense.

2282
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:20,540
I was like, oh, my God, they're like they thought it had happened.

2283
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:25,740
I thought like, oh, it worked on me even after watching these specials.

2284
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:30,300
I mean, in this special, he does it with a pen and teller live on stage,

2285
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:32,740
which is an endorsement of their act.

2286
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:35,140
Like it was so good.

2287
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:38,340
But I have to imagine loading like a six shooter.

2288
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:42,740
It's like easier to like, OK, that's a, you know, gunpowder

2289
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:46,060
and the real bullet will put it in our mouths at this point.

2290
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:47,260
Blah, blah, blah.

2291
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:49,340
You say blah, blah, blah. I don't know what I don't.

2292
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:50,620
Yeah, I'm not sure what you're talking about either.

2293
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:51,380
To me.

2294
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:53,820
So, you know, well, it's gunpowder, blah, blah, blah.

2295
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:58,780
No, I'm saying like it's probably, you know, easier than doing like the musket

2296
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:01,220
when he does the bullet catch.

2297
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:03,140
Magician was doing a musket thing.

2298
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:04,900
No, he does do a musket thing.

2299
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:06,260
OK, with the arrow thing.

2300
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:08,620
He like, no, there's another trick.

2301
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:13,580
OK, where he catches the bullet and like someone fires something

2302
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:17,860
so the target gets hit or it seems like a target gets hit

2303
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:19,780
and then a glass shatters.

2304
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:23,340
But he is like when he's using the rod on the musket,

2305
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:25,420
it's magnetic, the end of the rod.

2306
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:29,620
So he just palms the bullet and puts it in his mouth

2307
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:31,700
when he's like walking by something.

2308
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:34,540
So you're saying this just pen and tellers did a better version.

2309
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:38,060
Yeah, I'm saying that that trick is still done.

2310
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:39,660
And that's what it is.

2311
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:42,700
Yeah, I guess it ruined like a kind of a stock version

2312
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:43,820
of some of these.

2313
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:45,980
But if you were innovative, it didn't matter.

2314
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:48,020
Yeah, yeah, there.

2315
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:49,820
Did you find some of his old stuff before?

2316
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:53,780
Like he was on Merv Griffin and he's in a Herb Albert video.

2317
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:57,420
He's in the like a smooth jazz music.

2318
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:59,100
Yeah, I listened to that one, Magic Man.

2319
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:00,420
I didn't know there was a video.

2320
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:02,580
Yeah, yeah.

2321
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:05,380
But then, you know, he called himself the star of it.

2322
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:07,380
And I looked it up and there's just a room of magicians.

2323
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:09,860
Yes, I also was like waiting for a little things.

2324
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:11,900
He just he he paints it as that.

2325
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:13,660
But then like, wait, there's like a bunch of there's a fire.

2326
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:15,980
You know, yeah, yeah.

2327
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:18,780
And then the thing I couldn't find is there's a graphic novel

2328
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:23,020
or a comic book from 2007, I believe.

2329
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:27,340
Masked Magician 2007 comic book.

2330
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:31,260
And I was trying so hard to find like just a PDF of it or something,

2331
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,140
but I couldn't. I'd have to buy it.

2332
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:35,340
I think maybe I think there's maybe one on eBay.

2333
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:39,500
The publisher site goes to an Internet archive.

2334
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:44,620
Like someone posted like, oh, here's the publisher's page for it.

2335
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:46,220
And it was so old.

2336
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:47,940
They went to like just an archive.

2337
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,300
So they were still trying.

2338
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:51,540
They were trying to a movie at some point.

2339
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:53,420
But who knows how far that ever got.

2340
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:56,820
Character of the Masked Magician and and the YouTube is still active.

2341
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:00,740
Somebody is posting clips to this YouTube.

2342
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:02,940
They're the same clips they posted every year.

2343
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:04,020
They just repost.

2344
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:05,540
They just repost.

2345
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:08,260
I found the like big saw one like three times,

2346
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,060
maybe even with the same thumbnail.

2347
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:13,540
I found the Masked Magician has a LinkedIn page.

2348
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:15,060
Wow.

2349
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:16,900
Oh, and there's a demo reel.

2350
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:21,780
There is a demo reel to a rap song about the Masked Magician.

2351
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:22,860
A rap song?

2352
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:25,380
It's hard to tell if they commissioned it.

2353
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:27,380
What? OK.

2354
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:28,580
Is it good?

2355
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:30,540
No. OK. All right.

2356
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:33,020
Oh, damn. I thought I thought it was going to be really good.

2357
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:34,740
I OK.

2358
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:38,540
Also, if you're looking this this franchise up on YouTube,

2359
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:45,540
you might run into a video that I made that I believe as far as I can tell,

2360
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:50,820
I believe I may have made the only parody of these specials that has ever existed,

2361
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:55,700
unless there's something deep in the mad TV archives that I'm unaware of.

2362
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:58,780
But, you know, years later, I think 2013,

2363
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:02,980
I made a video for Funny or Die that was a parody of these specials.

2364
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:05,940
Which was very fun to get to, like, soaking the style of it.

2365
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:10,060
Everybody I did it with, I think, like recreated it really nicely.

2366
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:12,740
Just a really fun thing to to live in.

2367
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:18,740
The premise of my sketch was that you're going to watch the Masked

2368
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:21,100
Magician reveal how to make a handkerchief disappear.

2369
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:24,540
And the secret is it actually is disappearing.

2370
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:26,700
It is real. All magic is real.

2371
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:30,180
But what you have to do is pray to the devil

2372
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:35,820
and get him to show up in person with you and then give him a very awkward

2373
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:42,500
hand job, and then he will actually make the handkerchief disappear or whatever it is.

2374
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:50,620
The devil in this video played by future Lanuba boy Bugman.

2375
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:54,980
I remember that his parents came to watch this particular shoot

2376
01:52:55,180 --> 01:52:58,980
in which he has like a big red waxy fake penis.

2377
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:01,020
Sticking out of his pants.

2378
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:06,260
We gave him a we gave him a real rod to use a term from earlier in the episode.

2379
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:09,220
It was just very fun looking one way and watching this little

2380
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:14,380
red penis scene happen and then look over and see his dad like, there's my boy.

2381
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:17,140
But one reveal.

2382
01:53:17,140 --> 01:53:20,100
Who was the Masked Magician in that sketch?

2383
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:25,700
Who was it who got the honor of giving Bugman the devil a hand job?

2384
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:27,900
Well, here's the reveal.

2385
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:31,420
The Masked Magician was played by none other than Nick Weigert.

2386
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:36,140
So who was fucking great, by the way,

2387
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:40,100
the getting to make videos in front of that time were like just the cast

2388
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:42,940
in the office that you can grab or Bugman Weigert.

2389
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:44,380
Oh, geez. So good.

2390
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:47,180
Great with the eye acting, great with the the pantomiming and everything.

2391
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:51,340
So anyway, if I'll repost this somewhere, but if you want to see a video,

2392
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:54,420
if you can, if if you are a hardcore

2393
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,700
Doughboys fan or podcast world listener,

2394
01:53:57,180 --> 01:54:02,340
if any, you would like to see a video where Weigert jerks off Bugman as the devil.

2395
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:04,940
I'll make sure that you can see this somehow.

2396
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:06,740
Very exciting. Yeah.

2397
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:08,780
Um, do you have this song?

2398
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:10,740
I have a demo reel here.

2399
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:13,420
But does have the rap song in it.

2400
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:23,180
Mr. M.

2401
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:31,060
They want to kill him.

2402
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:36,180
His assistant, is he going to hurt her later?

2403
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:38,340
Showed up on diagnosis murder.

2404
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:47,820
All right. Wow.

2405
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:50,940
Wow. Mr. M. What a muse.

2406
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:53,380
He inspired some of the best music I've ever heard.

2407
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:55,740
I'm doing a sketch about him.

2408
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:59,340
And it was, hey, pretty fun doing an episode about worth the wait, I hope.

2409
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:01,860
I hope so. I really enjoyed it.

2410
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:03,860
Thank you, Michael, for this assignment.

2411
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:07,660
Thank you, Club 3 voters, for keeping it in that second place slot.

2412
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:10,580
We're going to do another poll.

2413
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:13,620
But I have I know it's been a long episode, and I'll just try to

2414
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:15,700
I'll try to handle this quickly.

2415
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:17,700
But now the Masked Magician has gotten its day.

2416
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:20,860
We're kind of at a reset point with the Club 3 poll. Right.

2417
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:24,500
And as we've recently discussed, Mike has recently celebrated

2418
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:30,060
a special birthday, a special non-complex triggering birthday.

2419
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:32,540
Right. Yes. Finally, 65.

2420
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:35,980
Extremely youthful.

2421
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:37,420
You ever seen a more youthful 65?

2422
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:40,980
Doesn't look older than a day older than 75.

2423
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:43,780
And my hair looks normal

2424
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:47,020
and the correct color for my youthful age.

2425
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:50,300
Get ready for Mike's new Mike Darnall-esque look

2426
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:53,140
debuting for a 65 special.

2427
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:58,780
So what I would like to propose for the next poll is this

2428
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:05,100
that we finally do the revenge of all of the Mike

2429
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:07,900
last place and second to last place.

2430
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:12,940
Usually kitschy variety specials with lots of the kind of celebrities

2431
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:15,020
that Mike likes. That's right.

2432
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:17,660
That have popped up in these Club 3 polls

2433
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:20,340
over the many months that we've been doing it.

2434
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:22,500
And I've compiled some of the candidates.

2435
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:26,420
If you want to yay or nay these, because I think I think I know what they are.

2436
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:29,340
And if you're if everybody's down with this, I think this could be a good

2437
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:32,900
next poll and a way to revisit some of your great suggestions

2438
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:34,700
that haven't made it in the past.

2439
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:37,060
Yeah. Well, obviously, I'm on board with this. Great.

2440
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,300
It's exciting to me.

2441
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:42,300
Can I can I pitch this title that we call this

2442
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,900
Carlson's Clash of the Kitsch.

2443
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:47,220
Oh, I like that.

2444
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:48,540
Yeah. Great. Great.

2445
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:49,420
I like that a lot.

2446
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:52,740
OK, Carl. So the candidates for the next poll,

2447
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:55,460
which you'll be seeing soon, listeners Carlson's Clash of the Kitsch.

2448
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:59,820
I got to clear my throat because these some of these are mealy mouthed.

2449
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:03,500
All right. The 1979 Legends of the Superheroes

2450
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:06,140
comedy roast starring Adam West and Ed McMahon.

2451
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:07,620
Four percent.

2452
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:10,060
I would give the stats of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2453
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:12,500
Approved. Just just give me a 100 percent.

2454
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:15,300
I just saw a clip that just Instagram wanted me to watch Adam West

2455
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:17,500
punching Solomon Grundy in this.

2456
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:19,220
And I was like, oh, we got to we got to do it.

2457
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:23,020
Who is Solomon? He's a DC universe bad guy.

2458
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:24,340
OK. Oh, yeah.

2459
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:26,460
He's not like a guy from McHale's Navy.

2460
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:29,660
He's not in the Bilko show.

2461
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:31,260
He's not an actor.

2462
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:35,460
I believe a folklore figure, maybe to Solomon Grundy bored on a Monday.

2463
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:39,500
I don't want to tip the scales for any of these,

2464
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:42,380
but just to say, you know, this one also features

2465
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:45,260
Ruth Buzzi, Gary Owens, Burt Ward, of course.

2466
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:47,620
Pat Carroll, voice of Ursula.

2467
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:53,580
Gilligan's Island versus 60s Batman on Family Feud in 1983, 14 percent.

2468
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:55,780
Great. OK, in.

2469
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:59,060
Oh, but and not all again, not to tip the scales on the Batman side.

2470
01:57:59,060 --> 01:58:02,020
Vincent Price. Yes. Very extra little treat.

2471
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:05,340
Just confirm it. You said 1983.

2472
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:06,980
Yeah, from later. OK.

2473
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:10,300
This would be an episode about a 1983

2474
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:13,220
family feud with stars of 60s television shows.

2475
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:17,380
OK, Spider-Man Rock Reflections of a Superhero,

2476
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:20,820
a 1975 rock opera released on vinyl.

2477
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:22,380
I would love to do it.

2478
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:25,820
The main theme sung by Ron Dante, who sang Sugar Sugar.

2479
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:27,860
Oh, I didn't even know this is Ron Dante.

2480
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:31,540
Ron Dante playing Peter Parker, I believe, as well on the album.

2481
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:34,220
But yes, singing the main theme, which I believe calls.

2482
01:58:34,220 --> 01:58:36,140
I've played this on the show before.

2483
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:39,820
Spider-Man is described as a sex machine in this song for some weird reason.

2484
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:41,700
Wow. It's very strange.

2485
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:44,380
OK. Grooves like a spider moves like a man,

2486
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:46,460
I believe, is one of the lines in it as well.

2487
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:48,460
It was like a spider moves like a man. Yeah.

2488
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:51,580
Just wish that suit would tear off.

2489
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:53,460
Let me see some of them in the roof.

2490
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:56,100
They call him the wall crawler, sex machine.

2491
01:58:57,020 --> 01:58:59,500
I crawl the walls just looking at him.

2492
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:02,220
Seven percent on that one, by the way.

2493
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:06,540
Don Knotts at Weeki Wachee Springs promoting The Incredible Mr.

2494
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:09,820
Limpit, one of my favorite phrases I've gotten to type in the polls.

2495
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:11,900
Yeah, that's 11 percent on that one.

2496
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:15,220
I am shocked that one was not received better.

2497
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:18,060
Are you shocked, though?

2498
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:22,420
No, I guess we haven't given enough attention to Weeki Wachee Springs.

2499
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:26,780
There's a lot of those Florida tourism places, the pre-Disney.

2500
01:59:26,780 --> 01:59:29,980
It feels closer to what the technical premise of the podcast is.

2501
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:34,060
It is, yet until this poll, I had never heard of Weeki Wachee Springs.

2502
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:35,180
Weeki Wachee Springs.

2503
01:59:35,180 --> 01:59:36,900
It's north of Tampa.

2504
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:39,580
Oh, yeah, kind of a like, yeah, whatever,

2505
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:42,100
gladesy kind of tourist spot, pre-Disney world.

2506
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:46,780
Yeah. And a lot of the basis of that is a special called Weekend

2507
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:49,340
at Weeki Wachee, where Don Knotts goes.

2508
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:51,580
You get to watch Don Knotts on vacation.

2509
01:59:51,700 --> 01:59:53,780
Am I dreaming?

2510
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:56,260
A dream. And finally, and you feel free to knock the look.

2511
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:59,700
This was pegged to like a certain time of year, but I don't think it has to be.

2512
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:01,780
Right. The Paul Linde Halloween special.

2513
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:02,980
Seventeen percent.

2514
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:04,460
The highest of any of these. That did pretty well.

2515
02:00:04,460 --> 02:00:05,460
Yeah. Yeah.

2516
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:08,260
What am I going to say? No to any of these?

2517
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:10,580
I mean, of course not. It seems like the best shot.

2518
02:00:10,580 --> 02:00:13,420
You were watching some of these while we were recording.

2519
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:17,860
You had your you were holding your phone sideways and like barely paying attention.

2520
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:22,140
I think I just sent a clip of Paul and Kiss to Mundy a couple of weeks ago.

2521
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:24,420
That just popped up. What do you say?

2522
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:25,580
I don't think he did nothing.

2523
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:28,060
Didn't respond to that. Usually he responds.

2524
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:30,020
But will the audience respond to the top?

2525
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:31,380
Because, yes, Kiss is in this.

2526
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:32,860
Betty White is in this.

2527
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:35,700
The Osmonds star studded.

2528
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:39,820
And then this is really that was going to be the five.

2529
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:40,940
We could go to six.

2530
02:00:40,940 --> 02:00:44,340
It's kind of a different category because we all all of these are kind of like

2531
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:48,020
specials or records and all with a certain type of celebrity.

2532
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:50,580
I will let you yay or nay.

2533
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:52,140
OK. Tony and Tina's wedding.

2534
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:56,140
Four percent nay, because we're going to do it, but not in this, I think.

2535
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:57,940
It feels different.

2536
02:00:57,940 --> 02:00:59,140
It feels different.

2537
02:00:59,140 --> 02:00:59,780
We will have it.

2538
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:02,060
There will be a different approach for Tony and Tina.

2539
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:06,940
Yes, it will be main feed and trounced by Griffin doing whatever he wants.

2540
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:09,660
Yeah. I remember you texting in the aftermath of that.

2541
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:14,740
Griffin, when we let you do whatever you want, if you could do me a favor

2542
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:17,020
and do Tony and Tina's wedding, I'd appreciate it.

2543
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:19,460
Tony and Tina's wedding.

2544
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:21,660
We may just have to do it in a live show.

2545
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:23,380
Do it. Perform it.

2546
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:25,940
Well, we're doing Tony and Tina's wedding.

2547
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:28,700
Do we owe them a license or is this kind of an off brand?

2548
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,740
Michael and Jason's wedding, we'll call it.

2549
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:32,180
Sure. Oh, OK.

2550
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:33,020
And we'll do a version of it.

2551
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:34,540
Can't copyright those names.

2552
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:37,220
Yeah. Wedding is a generic term.

2553
02:01:37,220 --> 02:01:38,780
I have. Well, you have one more thing.

2554
02:01:38,780 --> 02:01:39,500
No, no, that's it.

2555
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:41,940
Those will be your five for Carlson's Clash of the Kitsch.

2556
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:44,220
If the poll's not up already, it will be soon.

2557
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:47,500
I wasn't going to declare a second gate calling a shot.

2558
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:49,300
But now that you brought this up.

2559
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:50,980
Yeah, I have to. Yeah.

2560
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:54,980
Because this is another piece of pop culture trash that popped up.

2561
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:56,740
And I just we need to do an episode about it.

2562
02:01:56,740 --> 02:01:57,700
I'm not saying we have to do it.

2563
02:01:57,700 --> 02:01:59,420
By the way, you could throw it into here.

2564
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:00,900
Maybe that's not the way to do it.

2565
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:03,460
But it seems like he really wants to.

2566
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:06,580
I was going to say also up to you if you want to include

2567
02:02:06,580 --> 02:02:09,140
if you want to just put Jonathan Frakes into the poll,

2568
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:11,500
if you want to put I feel like there was another one

2569
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,420
that came up in this episode, but I forget already.

2570
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:14,020
Oh, I don't know.

2571
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:16,540
Frakes said a big catch all Frakes episode, perhaps.

2572
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:20,220
That's maybe main feed later is.

2573
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:21,900
No, Frakes doesn't go in this poll.

2574
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:24,540
But there is I guess I like the idea that in main feed

2575
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:28,220
one day shows up Frakes all caps exclamation point.

2576
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:31,340
Yeah, yeah. Maybe we get him.

2577
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:32,980
Let me say it does.

2578
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:35,660
It does belong on this club three list.

2579
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:38,220
But you but you know, maybe it wouldn't be fair to the rules.

2580
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:39,620
But I don't think it would be fair to the rules.

2581
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:42,460
We should give it the chance to lose in a future poll.

2582
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:43,660
That's what I bring it back.

2583
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:44,380
OK, yes, I agree.

2584
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:47,460
It can go on a future club three poll and lose tremendously

2585
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:49,100
because no one is interested in it.

2586
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:52,100
But I believe you think everyone in this room will be interested in it.

2587
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:56,460
I think Jason will cackle at it and you will go, oh, OK.

2588
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:59,260
Well, why are we going to set us up to play our games?

2589
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:02,580
I want to do an episode on Wayland Flowers and Madam.

2590
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:04,860
Yeah, that was earnest.

2591
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:06,340
That was earnest.

2592
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:08,220
I fucking hate this shit.

2593
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:10,100
I do. I like this is where we are.

2594
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:12,260
We obviously have a lot of overlap.

2595
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:15,020
If they're on something, I'm like, oh, these fucking.

2596
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:17,740
There was a I had never seen this before.

2597
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:21,340
There's some sort of sitcom where Madam is just treated as a character

2598
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:26,420
where, like, the family is like the military and she's making like mad.

2599
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:30,100
OK, first of all, well, he's a puppeteer or ventriloquist.

2600
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:34,900
Remember, Conti contextualizes for people born after 1978.

2601
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:36,660
And he had a famous. Amazing.

2602
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:41,460
We know he has a puppet named Madam who looks like Lady Elaine from Mr.

2603
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:46,420
Rogers is kind of like just a fine feather boa glad lady.

2604
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:48,820
She's like, she's horny.

2605
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:52,220
She's like, yeah, in the tradition of like, I guess, kind of a lane

2606
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:56,420
stretch or other like actresses of the old days, Mae West, whatever.

2607
02:03:57,140 --> 02:03:59,020
And I saw a clip of this.

2608
02:03:59,020 --> 02:03:59,940
I don't know what it is.

2609
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:03,300
I didn't even look into it other than just to go, oh, that's Madam.

2610
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:06,740
And it's just like there's a it's a sitcom where Madam is just a character.

2611
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:10,300
And I don't know if it was a sketch, but like there's this family in the military

2612
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:12,780
and Madam is just like horny for this general guy.

2613
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:15,180
And I was like, oh, we should probably.

2614
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:17,340
We have to do a Madam episode.

2615
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:20,020
We have we have to do.

2616
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:22,660
We have to is really no other way.

2617
02:04:22,660 --> 02:04:26,820
And Madam for sure, Madam's nose and chin are penis and balls.

2618
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:28,300
There's just no way around it.

2619
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:31,660
Like you see, like, well, who has the filthy mind now?

2620
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:36,180
No, I just watching a nice ventriloquism act and you're there seeing. Come on.

2621
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:40,060
I mean, yes, that's not even a leap.

2622
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:44,660
But this is one of those I like to get like I'm amazed it hasn't happened,

2623
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:47,340
that I haven't like, you know, gone to get a drink and then rejoin the group

2624
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:49,460
at a party and you're in the middle of going,

2625
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:52,420
tell me that Madam's face isn't a dick and balls.

2626
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:56,500
And then the person you're yelling at is like, what's Madam?

2627
02:04:56,900 --> 02:05:00,180
I thought you were going to say like you hadn't you.

2628
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:04,060
You went to get a drink and then you come back and Mike has Madam.

2629
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:06,260
I have a Madam puppet that I'm

2630
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:10,940
because it's your birthday and multiple people gave you full recreation.

2631
02:05:10,940 --> 02:05:12,180
Madam puppets.

2632
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:16,860
Your your goal should be to push this off until it's my birthday next year.

2633
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:21,060
And that's the only way I can get this in, is to do it on my birthday

2634
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:22,780
when I have like total control.

2635
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:25,860
But how am I going to be able to push it off when the hordes of our listeners

2636
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:29,660
start yelling, Madam, Madam, they're going to find out where I live.

2637
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:31,300
They're going to be pounding on my windows.

2638
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:34,260
Let me just to give the listeners a peek.

2639
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:37,020
I'll reveal podcast greatest secrets.

2640
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:40,060
I put my phone down.

2641
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:42,140
I was doing some other stuff the other day.

2642
02:05:42,140 --> 02:05:47,300
I put my phone down for a while and I came back and Mike had started

2643
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:53,340
a conversation in a group text about Lamp Chop and Sherry Lewis's daughter.

2644
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:55,060
Mallory Lewis.

2645
02:05:55,060 --> 02:05:58,060
Yeah, not even Sherry, the daughter specifically.

2646
02:05:58,060 --> 02:05:59,380
Mallory Lewis.

2647
02:05:59,380 --> 02:06:00,500
Yeah, we all know.

2648
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:03,220
Yes, we're talking about the category of hang around,

2649
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:06,580
who is the hang around of their own parents, their own celebrity parents.

2650
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:09,700
And and you said Mallory Lewis, of course.

2651
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:13,060
I can't believe no one else is texting about Mallory Lewis.

2652
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:14,540
50 text messages.

2653
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:18,020
I thought something was wrong because, you know, the I-message

2654
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:19,940
just displays something was very right.

2655
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:23,380
All right. What I said, I again.

2656
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:25,740
Sorry, we're making the listener Google a lot of stuff.

2657
02:06:25,740 --> 02:06:29,700
You Google Mike Darnell, now Google image Mallory Lewis.

2658
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:33,500
And just take her in, first of all, and then you will understand

2659
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:37,940
my comment that when I say I think that this woman had surgery

2660
02:06:37,940 --> 02:06:43,180
to look more like Lamb Chop, she had surgery to like narrow

2661
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:47,500
her eyes to look like the cloth, the strips of the puppet.

2662
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:51,860
Yes, it's a good theory to have to make her hair more like a mane,

2663
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:53,260
the mane of a sheep.

2664
02:06:53,260 --> 02:06:56,580
Oh, this is like Mike's cosmetic surgery, making his chin

2665
02:06:56,580 --> 02:06:59,100
and nose look more like a dick and balls.

2666
02:07:00,260 --> 02:07:03,300
So it can be like you can look more like that, too.

2667
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:05,420
Yeah, it can look more like madam.

2668
02:07:05,420 --> 02:07:08,500
Here's the clip I saw on Instagram.

2669
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:12,020
And madam is now in a military outfit.

2670
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:17,180
She just said, oh, my gosh, have I got to go through that,

2671
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:19,180
which is what I'm saying right now.

2672
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:22,140
And she's she's got her little puppet feet going through the tires

2673
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:24,100
too far apart.

2674
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:29,500
God, I just like the my the image of Mike holding his phone

2675
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:33,940
as far away from a microphone as trying to get both of you guys to see.

2676
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:37,020
But it certainly was not good audio for the for the listener.

2677
02:07:37,260 --> 02:07:40,300
Don't worry. When we get to the madam episode,

2678
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:42,380
the audio will be pristine and perfect.

2679
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:45,060
This is what you sure you don't want to just throw it in

2680
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:47,100
and see if it like takes the cake.

2681
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:49,740
Oh, you don't have to.

2682
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:52,500
I just be curious as an all right, put a madam put put

2683
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:57,260
Wayland Flowers and Madam in the bowl, five returning non-champion,

2684
02:07:57,260 --> 02:08:02,540
the opposite of champions and a future loser.

2685
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:03,780
But maybe not this time.

2686
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:06,500
This is Wayland Flowers and Madam Wayland Flowers.

2687
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:09,180
Madam like takes like it's a blowout.

2688
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:10,580
Yeah, maybe.

2689
02:08:10,580 --> 02:08:11,900
Oh, yeah, it might.

2690
02:08:11,900 --> 02:08:14,500
Then I'll be really upset.

2691
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:18,500
This is a great Instagram account called Pop Trash Museum that I like a lot.

2692
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:21,060
And this also I didn't realize this.

2693
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:26,300
And we missed this in the discussion of different like actor records.

2694
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:29,740
Richard Simmons has a couple songs, a couple.

2695
02:08:29,740 --> 02:08:31,700
I've heard one that I liked.

2696
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:33,740
There was certified yacht on the Yacht or Not podcast.

2697
02:08:33,740 --> 02:08:35,940
Yes. And I was like, oh, these are pretty good.

2698
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:38,580
I didn't even realize these existed until after we did the episode.

2699
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:39,780
Richard Simmons, I'm not bad.

2700
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:44,260
Yeah. So so that'll be on whatever part two.

2701
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:46,460
Let's really think.

2702
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:48,500
Are we going to throw it in as a wild card?

2703
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,300
I will allow it.

2704
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:52,540
You guys, you can make the final call if you want.

2705
02:08:53,620 --> 02:08:55,940
I got Jason, I think just really wants to do it.

2706
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:57,580
I think he honestly wants to do it.

2707
02:08:57,580 --> 02:08:59,060
Well, is this accurate?

2708
02:08:59,060 --> 02:08:59,820
To do what?

2709
02:08:59,820 --> 02:09:01,300
Wayland Flowers and Madam.

2710
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:05,060
I really don't know anything about Wayland Flowers and Madam.

2711
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:07,860
So it would certainly be a new territory for me.

2712
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:09,980
Oh, how exciting to learn.

2713
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:12,740
I look, I'm just I'm a sponge.

2714
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:13,660
I soak it all up.

2715
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:15,420
I'm intellectually curious.

2716
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:20,260
Yeah. I just no one on earth has ever said I'm intellectually curious.

2717
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:24,140
And the source of it was learning more about Wayland Flowers and Madam.

2718
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:27,660
Yeah, I feel like it might now.

2719
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:28,700
Oh, my God.

2720
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:29,340
I don't know.

2721
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:31,460
The Nut Club three numbers.

2722
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:34,220
Spider-Man record is pretty appealing to me.

2723
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:35,340
All that stuff is great.

2724
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:37,420
Yeah, I do do a little search.

2725
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:40,860
I think the Wayland Flowers may his life ended in a sad way.

2726
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:44,260
So perhaps we just focus more on Madam, the character Madam.

2727
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:50,060
But I don't know how much Googling people are going to do before doing this poll.

2728
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:53,460
I don't know how often how much research is done before people vote in the Club

2729
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:54,620
three poll. I don't know.

2730
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:55,620
Yeah, you really need to.

2731
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:59,060
You know, we don't send out a voter guide, but you can look up your own independent

2732
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:01,620
voter guide and it's up to you to put in the research.

2733
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:02,460
Yes. Yeah.

2734
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:04,980
I mean, look, it could be good listeners could be like,

2735
02:10:04,980 --> 02:10:09,180
I was struggling to have some talk to my great grandmother about.

2736
02:10:09,180 --> 02:10:10,740
And we help.

2737
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:12,380
We help them.

2738
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:14,860
Well, all of these solve that problem.

2739
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:19,100
All of these need to bridge the multi multi generational gap.

2740
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:20,780
I've got a podcast that can help you.

2741
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:24,700
I don't know that 40 year old family feud episode, though, that might be too modern.

2742
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:28,380
That's the one I know.

2743
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:30,860
This Richard Dawson and his new comedy.

2744
02:10:30,860 --> 02:10:32,740
Right, right, right, right.

2745
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:36,140
All right. Well, on that note, let's we'll send these topics into the wild.

2746
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:37,020
We'll see what happens.

2747
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:38,980
You survived podcast, the right club three.

2748
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:40,180

2749
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:41,580
Your bravery saved the pot.

2750
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:43,300
Hey, wait, Pileggi style.

2751
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:45,340
Your bravery saved the podcast.

2752
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:47,180
Well done, freedom fighters.

2753
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:48,620
And no pressure.

2754
02:10:48,660 --> 02:10:51,100
But, you know, we give you a lot of great content.

2755
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:53,780
You ever want to send us like a midriff pick?

2756
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:56,380
We won't complain.

2757
02:10:56,380 --> 02:10:57,060
Thanks, Mitch.
