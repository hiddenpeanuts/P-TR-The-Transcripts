1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,080
Forever.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,340
Dog.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,140
Warning!

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:14,300
The following podcast is an appalling pile of putrid emblem that would sicken a stink bug

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,620
with syphilis.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,600
It's Grinchmas on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,680
Welcome to a very special holiday podcast, The Ride,

8
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,900
hosted by three wise men,

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,860
wise mainly in their ability

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,680
to navigate Disneyland children's menus.

11
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,380
and Jason Sheridan.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,200
Yes, hello.

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,360
We speak from experience, you guys speak from experience.

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,060
We all just went together, all of us,

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,080
and Aaron and Lindsay and our friend Anthony Geo,

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,660
and I know there was a lot of kids menu ordering.

18
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,080
And our friend Andrew.

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,940
And Andrew Grissom.

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,660
Yeah, so kids menu in general ordering is tough

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,540
because a lot of places, the policy really is

22
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,100
that you should be a child.

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,820
You don't, like they don't necessarily wanna give you

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,120
whatever the deal is unless you're actually a kid.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,620
Right.

26
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,560
To entice parents to come in and order adult meals,

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,420
big boy meals.

28
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,420
But now with this new mobile ordering,

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,640
you can order kids meals all the live long day

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,640
and they won't know who it's for

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,500
because you're not, you don't have to have a kid there.

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,060
All it is, you order it and they put it right up

33
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,360
by the mobile ordering spot and you grab the tray.

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,620
It's so easy, you don't feel guilty at all.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,520
Well, I believe that Disney has always been like,

36
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,180
yeah, whatever, yeah, buy a kid's meal.

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,340
As long as you're spending the money, we don't care.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,600
Most places are like that.

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,760
But there's a social stigma.

40
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,480
Yeah, most places, like besides like McDonald's,

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,580
doesn't care if you're ordering the happy meal.

42
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,580
Right.

43
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:15,760
Why does that not feel as stigmatized as other kids?

44
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,740
Certainly you would not do it at a sit down restaurant

45
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,460
nor do I have a desire to.

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,740
No, is McDonald's because everyone knows

47
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,260
it's a little high in calories and salt and everything.

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,540
So like happy meal does shrink your portions.

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,780
Like is that?

50
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,700
Maybe it's just happy meals are just such a part of culture.

51
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,880
Why would you deny an adult the opportunity to buy one?

52
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,040
To get a toy, yeah.

53
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,540
I'm not sure, I know there are places,

54
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't have an example that really are like,

55
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,960
you have to have a kid to do the kid's meal.

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,100
So I think probably there's, you know,

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,720
most places will do it for you.

58
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,320
But yes, there's a stigma, you don't wanna look stupid.

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,500
And I think some places, the kid's meal

60
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,420
is kind of a discounted meal.

61
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,120
Yeah.

62
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,440
So, but I don't know, not necessarily at Disney probably.

63
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,640
But we.

64
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,400
So doing this order is kind of, that's a little trick.

65
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,440
It's a little.

66
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,820
That's a hack to you.

67
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,160
I thought it was pretty cheap.

68
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,620
Well we went, so we went down just to contextualize this.

69
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,240
Mike and me and Anthony Gia went down,

70
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,860
like we left LA at like 6.30 in the morning

71
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,080
to be there with Disneyland.

72
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,180
We did rope drop.

73
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,020
We did rope drop.

74
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,480
Almost to close.

75
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,240
We did 15 and a half hours.

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,320
Something like that.

77
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,700
Wow.

78
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,960
And so we started to get a little case of the Hungries

79
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,560
around 10, 10.30.

80
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,380
We were in Cars Land and we all kind of wanted a snack.

81
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,360
We had gone on Guardians three times.

82
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,160
We went on three times.

83
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,260
Cause we did it right at one o'clock.

84
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,140
Just walked right on.

85
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,300
And so we went, we walked into Flo's.

86
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,720
There's still seven breakfasts.

87
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,440
The kids options of breakfast,

88
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,620
a couple of us got like a little serving of eggs,

89
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,380
a little thing of potatoes, turkey bacon,

90
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,380
a little pile of fruit.

91
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,240
You had little waffles and turkey bacon.

92
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,400
Little waffles, yeah.

93
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,780
Little waffles.

94
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,620
Your new nickname.

95
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,820
Little waffles.

96
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,420
My new nickname or his?

97
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,780
Yours.

98
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,520
Oh, okay.

99
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,040
Even though Mike had it.

100
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,920
It's better for you.

101
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,280
All right.

102
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,300
Better for you, little waffles.

103
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,740
Yep, little waffles.

104
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,820
So yeah, so and it was like a few bucks.

105
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,860
It was like five something with the AP discount.

106
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,240
Yeah.

107
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,660
So like when you're looking at a full plate of food,

108
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,220
even at Disney, a full plate of food is never 5.75.

109
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,460
It's at least I think now $8, seven or $8.

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,940
So to have a very decent portion of food

111
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,160
is pretty unheard of,

112
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,860
which is why I think it's maybe a little discount.

113
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,240
I mean, obviously everything's marked up way high,

114
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,460
but all you have to do to get it is fraudulently pose

115
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,140
as a child or a caretaker to children.

116
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,740
What we did is we all four of us had big lollies

117
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,860
and we held the lollipops up

118
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,440
when we went to pick up the trays after mobile order.

119
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,720
And in your case, Mike,

120
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,040
you had to hold it to block your facial hair.

121
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,940
But a big enough lolly will do that easily.

122
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,520
I believe I was there to pick up the two trays

123
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,860
with the four meals.

124
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,200
And the one when there was like,

125
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,740
oh, you can come back and get the other tray.

126
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,440
And I go, oh no.

127
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,960
And I pointed to Andrew and I said, oh, I have a helper,

128
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,640
which is something that my mom or dad would say

129
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,100
like when I was little.

130
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,380
Really playing the part.

131
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,040
So and then we did this again later at night around seven.

132
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,880
I got chicken nuggets and it came

133
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,500
with fries, apple slices and a Coke.

134
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,060
Similarly priced like five or six bucks.

135
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
You had two children's meals on this day.

136
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,320
Well, but Mike, and at that one,

137
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,940
Mike ordered the toddler meal.

138
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,360
I ordered what?

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,200
Essentially a small,

140
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,480
the smallest serving you've ever seen of mac and cheese

141
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,760
and then a pouch of applesauce.

142
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
Yeah, it was like.

143
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,780
Why that?

144
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,160
I wanted a little snack to tide myself over

145
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,700
until like an hour or two.

146
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,260
And they had mac and cheese

147
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,000
and I didn't know the portion until I got it.

148
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,860
But it was like.

149
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,940
A baby cup that would fit on a tray of a stroller.

150
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,320
It was probably about four spoonfuls.

151
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,220
It was like a little pudding cup full of macaroni and cheese.

152
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,360
That was very small.

153
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,100
Five noodles.

154
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,880
And then I sucked applesauce out of a little plastic package.

155
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,640
Out of a tube.

156
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,680
Out of a tube.

157
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,460
This is perverse this day.

158
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,360
That was to tide you over to then

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,520
when you had Jambalaya a few hours later.

160
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,960
Then I had an adult meal.

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,400
I had an adult meal.

162
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,520
A full adult portion of Jambalaya.

163
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,100
Oh, oh.

164
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,260
But I had.

165
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,720
We should talk about this too.

166
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,800
I have to talk about this.

167
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,840
I mean this might be one of my greatest

168
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,580
like Indiana Jones sliding under the falling wall

169
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,280
and grabbing his hat at the last moment.

170
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,540
This was one of the most,

171
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,420
and I've been to Disneyland with you a lot.

172
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,260
This is top five moments with Jason at Disneyland.

173
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,420
And there was a Sunday.

174
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,560
So there was a Sunday that was holiday exclusive

175
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
and they were only serving it at the Golden Horseshoe.

176
00:06:59,700 --> 00:06:59,980
Yes.

177
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,740
And what was the Sunday?

178
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,920
Sure, it was peppermint ice cream.

179
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,320
Sure.

180
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,120
With candy cane pieces, brownie chunks, fudge.

181
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,440
Fudge or chocolate syrup.

182
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,440
I don't think it was, it wasn't hot when I got it.

183
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,560
So I think it was just chocolate syrup.

184
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,160
And then two mini churros that were filled with caramel.

185
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,420
There's still stuff in the churros.

186
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,760
There's stuff in the churros.

187
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,000
Within it, then these are buried deep,

188
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,540
many layers into a sundae.

189
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,360
No, they were sticking out like the sides.

190
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,080
So you could dip and put it back and then spoon

191
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,020
and then when you were ready for more churro.

192
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
This is a thing, you know,

193
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,180
they've been doing a lot of limited time food stuff.

194
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,660
So that's kind of how they're paying the bills nowadays.

195
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,720
That's a fun thing they do, yeah.

196
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,760
Because otherwise Disney's shutting the lights off.

197
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,460
No more AC at Disney.

198
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,460
They'd have to build more rides or something.

199
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,740
Which yeah, they're not doing that at Itosu.

200
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,660
They're barely doing that.

201
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,060
So I really wanted this sundae

202
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,660
and I didn't see it until like,

203
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,800
I was looking through the app and I saw that.

204
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,580
And right as you guys were finishing eating.

205
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,000
And your eyeballs turned into little mini churros

206
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,080
and exploded out of your face and then stuck back in.

207
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,240
Knocked me out of my chair across the table.

208
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,200
Ouch, hey Jason.

209
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
But I said, oh, I'd like to walk over to Golden Horseshoe

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,960
and get this.

211
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,020
And Lindsay said, that's great.

212
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,240
I have a giant cup of Disney coffee,

213
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,680
disgusting Disney coffee that I need to finish.

214
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,560
Right, before we went on Haunted Mansion or something.

215
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,740
I forget exactly what.

216
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,860
So we walked over there and there was a time crunch

217
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,060
because the Golden Horseshoe closes.

218
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,120
Closed in about 25 minutes or so.

219
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,500
I believe at like nine o'clock or was it 10?

220
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,300
It closed at nine.

221
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,580
At nine, so we're walking toward Golden Horseshoe

222
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,560
and you're like, this might not be right

223
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,460
but in my mind you're like rubbing your hands.

224
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,480
Like you're licking your lips and rubbing your hands.

225
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,020
Like you're very excited about the Sunday.

226
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,680
And all of a sudden, what could be here,

227
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,740
I'll ask this to the listener,

228
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,320
to Jason, what could be more attractive than a Sunday?

229
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,220
What would he be more excited about?

230
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,200
Because that is what he saw.

231
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,640
Especially in the frontier land area.

232
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,580
In that clue.

233
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,020
Yes, like when you're looking right at Golden Horseshoe

234
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,780
toward the Big Thunder area, what is right around there?

235
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,640
And an even more limited offering than Sundays.

236
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,140
You can always find a Sunday.

237
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,300
I know you're all shouting the answer right now

238
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,180
because the answer is the Mark Twain,

239
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,200
open at night because Fantasmic is not running.

240
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:26,920
Yes.

241
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,880
And you were like, oh, like you couldn't,

242
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,180
you were collecting yourself.

243
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,220
You were like, oh my, can we, is a Mark Twain open at night?

244
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,560
Oh, a night Mark Twain ride?

245
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,840
Like you kept like kind of like just questioning

246
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,880
the reality of it.

247
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,020
Like can we go on the Mark Twain right now?

248
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,500
And then like it was like, we saw you make like the decision

249
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,440
of like Sunday versus Mark Twain, Sunday.

250
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,900
And you're like, oh, when am I gonna get on the Mark Twain

251
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,420
again at night?

252
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,740
Because Fantasmic is usually running.

253
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm not sure why it wasn't running.

254
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,400
Yeah, I don't know if it was just the lower crowds

255
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,320
because it was a weekday or it was the weather.

256
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,880
It was a little chilly, but.

257
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,840
Yeah, nothing crazy.

258
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,800
Nothing crazy.

259
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,600
Our guest Anthony Gio had not been on it before either.

260
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,060
And he had said, oh, I'd like to ride,

261
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,060
like to see you with a shitty eating grin on your face

262
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,860
riding that boat.

263
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,120
And we didn't get around to it during the day.

264
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,060
So we just kind of written it off and then we saw.

265
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,280
So we were like, okay, you're like, okay,

266
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,600
I think there'll be enough time.

267
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,820
There's 25 minutes or whatever.

268
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,180
The boat ride isn't that long.

269
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,340
We got on Mark Twain, we went up to the top.

270
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,600
It was a beautiful night.

271
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,700
We were standing there for a while.

272
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,240
Yeah, so we were standing there for a while

273
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,880
and we're like, is it just staying in,

274
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,920
is it staying docked?

275
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,140
Is it actually going to go around the rivers of America?

276
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,180
So we asked and they said, oh, it's like 10 minutes.

277
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,900
845, it departs at 845.

278
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,380
It departs at 845.

279
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,600
So then now this is where stuff gets interesting

280
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,260
because Golden Horseshoe closes at nine.

281
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,580
So we're like, oh, well, how long does it take

282
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,140
to get around?

283
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,780
It's probably like 12, 13, 14 minutes to get around.

284
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,300
And we're standing on the top deck

285
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,920
and somebody encouraged you to maybe go down

286
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,640
to the Sunday and bring it back.

287
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,140
Yeah.

288
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,660
And you were like, yes.

289
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,160
So you ran down.

290
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,480
So I tried that.

291
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,340
I think I texted Scott at this moment and I said,

292
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,140
Jason's going to try to get, and I have a video of it.

293
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,580
Jason's going to try to go down and get the Sunday

294
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,940
and bring it back on the Mark Twain,

295
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,020
but he only has so many minutes.

296
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,860
Along with a lot of gifts of Ethan Hunt,

297
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,300
barely escaping explosions, clouds of fog.

298
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,720
So we were doing a bit where it was like

299
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,840
Mission Impossible, Fallout,

300
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,260
and you were running after Sunday.

301
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,220
And I think Anthony Gio was like, same old Jason.

302
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,680
I am screaming at strangers.

303
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
I'm working on it.

304
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,720
So we watch you as you run into Golden Horse.

305
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,440
We're like, oh man, he's got to make it, he's got to get back.

306
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,240
I go, oh, it would be horrible if he missed the Mark Twain,

307
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,660
but he had a Sunday in his hand.

308
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,020
The best if he could barely jump, barely make the leap.

309
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,960
With Sunday intact, it almost splashes out of the,

310
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,360
it leaves the cup entirely

311
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,260
and then splashes back down perfectly.

312
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,960
Or it landed in a lady's hat

313
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,580
and then he eats it out of the hat, like a lady's big hat.

314
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,140
And then he's like, excuse me, madam.

315
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,200
And then he takes the hat.

316
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,220
A makeshift bowl.

317
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,680
I'm MacGyvering this.

318
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,920
So all of a sudden we see him emerge

319
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,040
from the golden horseshoe with no Sunday.

320
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,220
And we're like, what the fuck, what's going on?

321
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,600
And I did though, like,

322
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,040
Yeah, yeah, you made a signal.

323
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,220
When you call this motion, like nah,

324
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,860
not gonna happen.

325
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,380
We're kinda running your hand across your neck.

326
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,240
And then you come up and you're like, line's too long.

327
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,040
It's not gonna happen.

328
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,920
Line's too long, line was not moving.

329
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,260
No one was getting, it was taking a while.

330
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,940
So then, Mark Twain,

331
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,520
and then the boat starts going around

332
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,580
and we're checking the time

333
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,700
and it's a lovely little trip around at night.

334
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,020
I don't think I've ever done it at night.

335
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,900
It's very nice.

336
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,280
I think by the time we passed the hungry bear

337
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,300
I had put it out of my mind the Sunday

338
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,700
to just enjoy the boat.

339
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,560
Cause I'm like, well, we're not gonna get back in time

340
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,880
and get unloaded.

341
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,180
But I still have my eye on the time.

342
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,800
But Mike still had his eye on the time.

343
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,460
And I was like, it's gonna be close.

344
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,280
So we're coming back at the dock.

345
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,520
And we come back on the dock

346
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,420
and it's a short little jaunt from the dock

347
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,560
to golden horseshoe.

348
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,900
You held your phone up.

349
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,360
Yeah, and was it 57 or 58?

350
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,000
It might have been 58.

351
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,480
It was 8 58 when we docked, I think.

352
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,860
So even then that's a process

353
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,480
of waiting for the doors to open.

354
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,720
You gotta get the people out of the way

355
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,400
and you're trying not to knock people out of the way.

356
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,480
So I was like, I think you maybe can do it.

357
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,220
So you went to the front

358
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,900
and Anthony Geo was right behind you.

359
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,120
Yeah, this has been documented.

360
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,940
Multiple photographers, multiple angles apparently.

361
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,580
I've only seen some of them.

362
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,480
So the boat, finally they open up all the doors.

363
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,960
You and Geo and I, I'm also like in tow, I'm behind.

364
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,160
And you guys take off.

365
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,100
And I look at my phone and it's 59.

366
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,820
It is 8 59.

367
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,020
And you are walking, walking, walking, walking.

368
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,380
And I'm looking and I can see now.

369
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,920
And then Lindsay got held up for a second.

370
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,960
And I kind of like looked back to check where she was.

371
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,780
I looked over, you make it in the door.

372
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,620
I can see the employees. I can see cast members.

373
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,000
I can see the employee taking the exit stops

374
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,260
out of the door.

375
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,960
Anthony Geo makes it in right.

376
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,900
The guy closes the door behind him.

377
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,300
And you guys made it in and I couldn't believe it.

378
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,180
It was like the most triumphant moment.

379
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,280
You made it into Golden Horseshoe.

380
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,580
Saloon doors that were closing.

381
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,220
And you got your goddamn Sunday.

382
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,860
I got it, I got it.

383
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,160
And I got to witness the,

384
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,960
there's like two people ahead of me.

385
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,080
They're running two different,

386
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,280
there's serving hot food on the one side.

387
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,260
And then there's another guy making ice cream stuff.

388
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,920
And when the person ahead of me just orders like

389
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,500
chicken fingers, I can see him kind of leaning next

390
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,880
on the cashier.

391
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,820
Like he's like, what's this last guy gonna do?

392
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,200
What's this last guy gonna do?

393
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,120
And I say, one peppermint holiday Sunday, please.

394
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,520
And he didn't throw his hands up, but I could tell he like,

395
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,240
I could tell he was like, all right, one more.

396
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,340
Like kind of got up from his lead and made it.

397
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,820
And he made it fast.

398
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,380
Like he was ready to go and it was delicious.

399
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,660
And like we had an Indiana Jones fast pass

400
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,300
and you were like, you guys go.

401
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,900
Go ahead, I'm eating this Sunday.

402
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,340
I'm not gonna scarf this down.

403
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,800
So you ate it alone,

404
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,780
but you ate it in the Golden Horseshoe, you took it out.

405
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,340
I took it back to where, across from the Jungle Cruise.

406
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,220
By Bengal Barbecue.

407
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,620
It's very nice indoor seating area by Bengal Barbecue.

408
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,620
And walk, and then we came and rejoined

409
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,200
because during all of this,

410
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,040
Aaron and I had broken off

411
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,360
to have a quiet dinner by ourselves.

412
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,680
I'm very pleased with that decision.

413
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,080
But I, to walk back up to you having,

414
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,120
just sitting here with the final,

415
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,820
I think you'd left the churros as the final component of it,

416
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,540
or at least one of them.

417
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,480
Well, I was, yeah, I was kind of going back and forth,

418
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,080
trying a little bit of everything.

419
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,640
And yeah, I definitely left some churro

420
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,580
for the end for dipping.

421
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,660
So this, in level of like, tier of treats,

422
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,540
this is a high tier treat, you think?

423
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,340
Yeah, I think it was a high tier treat.

424
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,560
And I kind of did something,

425
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,500
usually I like to have some bigger meal throughout the day,

426
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,100
but this day I sort of just kind of snacked through the day.

427
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,900
And I did find that very satisfying.

428
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,300
And it was extra satisfying to have this high level treat

429
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,240
at the very end.

430
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,500
With steaks, and with the wind lapping behind

431
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,760
of the closing doors of the saloon.

432
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,860
The fallout of all my good intentions?

433
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,300
Delight!

434
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,480
I will say this, there were two points,

435
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,620
because we showed up much later,

436
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,840
and split off for a little bit,

437
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,120
and both times that I needed to convene or reconvene

438
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,600
with the group, both of them,

439
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,260
one was Andrew and one was you, Mike.

440
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,420
It was, like, so where are you guys at?

441
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,220
Well, we're getting Jason a snack.

442
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,020
Which I love the we're getting, it's very parental,

443
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,960
like, he needs his juice.

444
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,100
His go-go juice.

445
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,800
He already had his packed snacks,

446
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,780
so he needs a purchase.

447
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,780
And you did have packed snacks.

448
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,080
I did have packed snacks, yes.

449
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,120
You really do, you bring a big bag full of stuff

450
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,800
to the parks.

451
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,020
I mean, it was a long day there,

452
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,900
but you bring a whole thing, like a picnic lunch.

453
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,420
I used to be real no bag, and then I found it better

454
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,580
to go back to an old Boy Scout trick,

455
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,300
and when you're camping or hiking in colder weather,

456
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,460
it's better to wear lots of layers.

457
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,400
Lots of thinner layers, and that way, if you get hot,

458
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,760
you just remove some of them,

459
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,300
but you still gotta put them somewhere.

460
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,520
So rather than carrying one big bulky coat,

461
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,820
I had a sweater and a t-shirt and a lightweight coat.

462
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,040
And a Swiss Army knife that every piece that came out of it

463
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,340
was a pretzel or a...

464
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,140
A granola, yeah, Nature Valley crunchy granola bar.

465
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,480
Or a peppermint stick.

466
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,680
Yeah, an important tool for the parks.

467
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,840
Well, harrowing adventure here,

468
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,380
and on the snack front, we should say,

469
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,260
as we record this, we're enjoying a holiday feast

470
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,400
that is far greater than five macaroni noodles

471
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,580
meant for a toddler.

472
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,380
We've generously been provided a huge plate of meats

473
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,060
and cheeses from our friends at Cheesemongers

474
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,500
of Sherman Oaks, our friends Kia and Tyler,

475
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,220
who listen to the show and have come up on the show before.

476
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,720
They made us a really nice little platter

477
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,120
and a note written to us good boys,

478
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,620
and we're working on clearing the plate.

479
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,380
We will not be leaving drops behind,

480
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,880
this is just as Mike is want to do

481
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,940
at your Liberty Taverns and such.

482
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,820
No, I would not disrespect the plate

483
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,040
like I did the plate at Liberty Taverns.

484
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,540
Our eyes were exactly the right size for our stomachs.

485
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,200
And yeah, that was great.

486
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,640
This is just, they're not an official sponsor

487
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,460
other than that they gave us cheeses and stuff.

488
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,520
But I'm just, I'm a fan of what they do,

489
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,000
and if you're in the LA area,

490
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,960
go to Cheesemongers of Sherman Oaks

491
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,240
and tell them your podcast's a ride, fan.

492
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,260
Because Kia once got recognized as being a fan of our show,

493
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,440
and she was very delighted by that.

494
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,800
To be recognized for fandom.

495
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,580
She also, she made an effort to make a plate

496
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,120
that was suited to, like it's cheeses and meats,

497
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,340
it's not super sweet,

498
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,460
but brownies were included for the treat boy here.

499
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,560
And I said best brownie I've had all year.

500
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, before we start recording,

501
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,440
yes, that's high praise.

502
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,980
I've had some dry brownies this year.

503
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,800
I feel like- This one was not dry.

504
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,200
This happened in 2018.

505
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
I don't know.

506
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,320
I feel like any time I go, you know,

507
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,400
you go into a bakery or cafe in LA,

508
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,680
and they have like a case of stuff,

509
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,080
and so many times been like,

510
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,220
ooh, that brownie looks good.

511
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,920
Oh look, it's got a little caramel drizzle on top.

512
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,140
Then God knows how long it's been sitting there.

513
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,820
It ends up being very dry or overcooked.

514
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,760
So, but these brownies, Kia,

515
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm gonna be asking for the recipe.

516
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,640
Yeah.

517
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,140
This was perfect.

518
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,840
I was like, we're trying to figure out,

519
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,240
what is their way to customize it to us?

520
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,100
And she was asking me, what are the guys like?

521
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,440
And I'm like, well, Jason likes sweets,

522
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,540
and Mike likes blue alcoholic goo.

523
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,060
Colors.

524
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,060
Which is why she included kintz paste.

525
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,720
That's as close as she can come.

526
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,060
It's almost like a Jell-O.

527
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,740
That's a really undercutting kintz paste.

528
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,040
Like a spread.

529
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,180
Yeah, a spread.

530
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

531
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,900
It's as close to like a jam or something.

532
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,520
Yeah, it's jelly.

533
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

534
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,820
Yeah, so that's an attempt to get,

535
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,060
that's as close as they could get

536
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,140
to your variety of alcoholic beverage.

537
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,400
If she could have dyed a wheel of cheese

538
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,980
all the colors of the rainbow,

539
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,940
that would have been something I'd be into.

540
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,060
The olives are pretty brightly colored green.

541
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,680
Yeah, but not bright enough.

542
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,420
Cheesemongers tip for Kia,

543
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,420
just set, you need a kid's menu.

544
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,560
You need a wheel of cheese that is

545
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,700
where you have dyed all of the,

546
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,500
you've dyed the cheese every color from red to purple.

547
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,560
Neon colors too, like those crayons

548
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,880
they introduced in the 90s.

549
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,400
Remember when they were like neon crayons

550
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,480
in the Crayola box?

551
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,020
Oh, sure, yeah.

552
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,600
You know what I'm talking about?

553
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,420
All of those other colors that goldfish are.

554
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,700
When you see goldfish that are not just the orange,

555
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,500
when they're also green and purple.

556
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,840
Yeah, that's it.

557
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,400
Yeah.

558
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,980
That's the answer.

559
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,540
If there's only one plus,

560
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,160
so that's the plus up we would do

561
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,760
with this fine cheese store establishment.

562
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,240
Ruin the cheese with colors.

563
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,180
More dyes.

564
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,240
More dyes, please.

565
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,620
I also, I was trying to find Disney connections

566
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,980
to any of this and what they included.

567
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,920
And in the plate there was some duck salami.

568
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,380
Yes.

569
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,180
Like Donald.

570
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,120
Oh, eating it.

571
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,920
So it's like we got to feast on Donald's remains

572
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,660
as we sat here.

573
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,080
That's nice.

574
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,520
Isn't that a sweet way to put it?

575
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,120
Yeah.

576
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,640
And also a type of salami called mole salami,

577
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,860
but it looks like mole.

578
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,440
And she has had to assure people

579
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,320
that this is not meat made out of a mole.

580
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,700
I would bet it would be fun

581
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,860
because mole is a Wind in the Willows character.

582
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,320
So we're like, we're eating mole.

583
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,900
Toad's friend mole.

584
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,400
Yeah, so that's another like theme possibility

585
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,180
is yeah, toad meats and badger meats.

586
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,260
I'm sure they're all fantastic.

587
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,580
So yeah, there's a menu.

588
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,480
That's really what Disney should put on the menu

589
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,040
is you should be able to visit all your favorite characters

590
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,080
and then meet your favorite characters

591
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,660
and then eat your favorite characters.

592
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,140
Sure.

593
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,560
Eat a mouse.

594
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,780
Oh man, if Mike could get an all you care to eat

595
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,880
family size platter of mighty Akron meat.

596
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,260
Oh my God.

597
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,820
Whoa, I like how you said all you care to eat.

598
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,420
Well, that is, I'm just following the-

599
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,560
Is that the new way to write it?

600
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,060
That is Disney switched, I think a lot of,

601
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,120
some restaurants switched to from all you can eat

602
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,680
to all you care to eat as a way to try and trick people

603
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,480
to like don't just eat until you can't eat anymore.

604
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,880
Just eat a normal meal.

605
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,260
I think it's a thing that came up.

606
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,580
I'm sure it's working.

607
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,260
For the obesity epidemic, yeah.

608
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,980
But yes, I would feast on the Banshee AKA the mighty Akron.

609
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,300
That would be, they don't serve that.

610
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
They really should serve like,

611
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,960
the canteen and Avatar, which is one of the best

612
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,080
quick service restaurants at any theme park I feel.

613
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,560
They don't make fake, they don't say like chicken

614
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,460
is Akron or something, but they should.

615
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,800
That would be fun.

616
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,600
Also something that Bikia Cheesemongers

617
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,620
or any aspiring restaurateur could do,

618
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,540
somebody, and you could spell it differently.

619
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,800
It doesn't have to be spelled like the fox

620
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,260
and there's eventually Disney owned word Akron.

621
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,020
You could spell it like crab with a K.

622
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,220
You could get it off a little bit,

623
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,940
but if you could be the first establishments

624
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,680
to get Akron meat.

625
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,880
And also it's a small investment,

626
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,140
but you would have to like, I guess, travel to Pandora

627
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,940
to get it really, but if your restaurant

628
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,800
got a teleportation, an Avatar pod,

629
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,660
and then you could go to that world,

630
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,440
hunt the Akron, kill it and bring it back

631
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,720
to earth with you, that's a hell of an angle for a restaurant.

632
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,680
Yeah, that's great.

633
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,940
I mean, theme parks are getting more immersive

634
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,320
and maybe that's the next step of we'll be able

635
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,960
to hunt our own quick service meals.

636
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,140
That's the only way to eat at the Evermore Park,

637
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,260
the fully immersive one is you have to

638
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,200
kill your meal before you eat it.

639
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,840
Or like a mystical creature.

640
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,140
A boar isn't mystical.

641
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,100
And in the Disney of the future,

642
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,840
you have to walk up to a Clarabel cow.

643
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,500
Oh, and milk her.

644
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,640
Yeah, get your milk from her.

645
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,540
She's friendly about it, she's perfectly,

646
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,020
she knows what she is, she's a cow.

647
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,500
Some of those cheeses did say made by Clarabel on it,

648
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,820
so I guess that's what.

649
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,080
That was another, is that real?

650
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,060
No.

651
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,860
Okay, I don't know the name of the chi.

652
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,760
I've got the ones Kia provided.

653
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,640
Yeah, sure.

654
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,460
You said she works closely with the farm,

655
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,440
so she works with Clarabel's home.

656
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,160
Yeah, she worked with the big Thunder Ranch before it closed.

657
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,740
Oh, sure, yeah.

658
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,960
It was all cheese from those goats.

659
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,520
Yeah.

660
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,260
One of my favorite things on the trip was that

661
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,100
we all had waters from that kid's meal in breakfast

662
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,760
and you went back to the counter to exchange it for a milk.

663
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,340
Yes, because it's protein.

664
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,420
Protein helps fill you up.

665
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,340
Also, I had a giant bottle of water in my bag.

666
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,960
A carton of milk, though, like a school child.

667
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,500
So here's the part of the podcast where the eater

668
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,180
of the toddler mac and cheese is roasting

669
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,500
the drinker of the child's milk.

670
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,260
I sucked apple juice out of a little packet, like a.

671
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:51,940
Apple sauce.

672
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,860
Apple, excuse me, apple sauce.

673
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,020
I slurped apple sauce through a straw, essentially,

674
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,560
in a, what do you call it?

675
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,660
Not a juice box, what are the?

676
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,520
Capri Sun.

677
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,060
Like a Capri Sun.

678
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,780
It was like a Capri Sun and I sucked apple juice out of it.

679
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,340
But I didn't go back to get it.

680
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,900
That's the difference here.

681
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,920
That's the issue.

682
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,700
That's the thing that makes it better.

683
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,200
We finally found the line.

684
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,320
I was also.

685
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:18,620
It was a return trip.

686
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,600
I was getting Tabasco, too, for the eggs.

687
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,520
That's true.

688
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,100
And you also said you were gonna go get a roll or a biscuit.

689
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,240
I was gonna buy an a la carte biscuit

690
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,540
because the biscuits looked really good

691
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,140
and I decided I didn't need the carbs.

692
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,780
But then you came back with the milk.

693
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,840
I came back with the milk.

694
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,580
I just thought it was fun.

695
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,580
Yeah, it is fun.

696
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,300
It was like a carton of milk.

697
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,640
Now you know, if you're wondering,

698
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,840
what is the dream world of visiting the parks?

699
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,720
A lot of people, yeah.

700
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,180
Think about that. With the guys themselves,

701
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,540
the real guys.

702
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,780
You know it involves carb considerations

703
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,080
and child's milk cartons.

704
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,620
Thrown out the window as I made everyone wait

705
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,200
while I went to a little pop-up shed

706
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,800
to buy a pot roast sandwich.

707
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,820
That is true.

708
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,680
We were waiting there and it wasn't so long.

709
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,580
It wasn't so long.

710
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,480
They have the food festival now in California Adventure

711
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,820
and they have all these different foods.

712
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,980
And you went to buy.

713
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,540
I went to get jalapeno spicy latkes

714
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,960
because I was like, ooh, that sounds good.

715
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,640
Jason was eating 11 a.m. spicy latkes

716
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,740
at one of these carts.

717
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,880
They were out and so then I went to the next cart

718
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,540
and I got a small beef sandwich,

719
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,560
small pot roast sandwich.

720
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,740
Pretty small, like Club Earl.

721
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,460
We should post the timestamps

722
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,020
of when all of these meals occurred.

723
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,240
Should write these in a fancy calligraphy font.

724
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,220
Should make this a limited edition.

725
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,580
So like a tapestry that you could mount on a wall

726
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,400
if you wanna honor Jason's meals for the day.

727
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,980
Or it's a 2019 calendar honoring

728
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,380
every month is a one through 12 items you had

729
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,000
on this particular day.

730
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,160
Oh cool, March is a Clif Bar and coffee he made at home.

731
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,060
All right, merch on the way in 2019.

732
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,960
But hey, we can't skip past 2018

733
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,080
because we're currently in the holiday season

734
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,360
and we have to acknowledge the reason for the season.

735
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,200
The real, the true, like why this time of the year matters

736
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,740
and that is Grinchmas.

737
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,880
Merry Grinchmas to everyone.

738
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,840
Grinchmas, I don't care if it's PC to say or not.

739
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,300
I'm saying it, Merry Grinchmas.

740
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,020
Happy holidays.

741
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,700
I've been saying to everyone on the street,

742
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,380
I don't care who hears it.

743
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,500
Okay, so Grinchmas if you don't know has been a tradition

744
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,580
for almost two decades running at Universal Studios

745
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,800
both Hollywood and Orlando.

746
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,040
Really just ever since the finest film

747
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,640
thus far of the millennium, the Jim Carrey, Ron Howard,

748
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,620
How the Grinch Stole Christmas came out

749
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,740
in the year 2000.

750
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,820
We're now, we're heading into 2019.

751
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,720
We're almost 20 years into this millennium.

752
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,520
Has a film topped it?

753
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,780
We got off to such a strong start.

754
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,720
It is still the movie to beat in the 2000s.

755
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,260
It is an unstoppable juggernaut.

756
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,860
Everyone has a tradition with it.

757
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,780
We all do obviously now.

758
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,640
We're excited, even though we don't have kids,

759
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,460
we are all thinking about having kids to show them this,

760
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,560
to continue the tradition on.

761
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,760
It would be the primary reason, yes.

762
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,940
To pass the fine tradition of Grinchism

763
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,560
down to a new generation,

764
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,280
because I'm worried it's gonna slide.

765
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,880
And everybody's so mixed up now,

766
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,140
what with this new one?

767
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:44,120
This new Grinch who's, he's making it a little too personal

768
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,360
with these ads all around LA telling you

769
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,360
your acting career isn't going good.

770
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,600
He's too mean.

771
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,520
You didn't learn those sides well enough.

772
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,880
Are those customized for each city?

773
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,780
In Detroit, is it about the auto,

774
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,900
is he roasting the auto industry?

775
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,360
The water, the drinking water?

776
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,620
Oh God.

777
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,060
They criticize farms in Kansas,

778
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,480
and they tell Pittsburgh steel workers,

779
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,240
hey, your steel sucks.

780
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,900
The Grinch goes there.

781
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,820
Did Donald Trump reopen those steel mills?

782
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,340
I didn't think so.

783
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,780
He's roasting coal miners.

784
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,280
But just like Trump, we like, he speaks his mind.

785
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,560
We want the Grinch to be honest.

786
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,860
That's what we like about him.

787
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,720
Yeah, yeah.

788
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:42,260
But even still, I think this new Grinch is too rude

789
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,560
and too animated.

790
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,860
And I want my Grinch will always be,

791
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,600
well, not the original Grinch, that was animated as well.

792
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,440
To me, the Grinch needs to be live action,

793
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,760
and it needs to be an actor who is suffering

794
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,260
for 20 hour days covered in yak fur,

795
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,080
and have in so much pain that he needs a CIA expert

796
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,460
to help him cope.

797
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,600
Yes, I think that's right.

798
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,360
I think that you wanna see that suffering on screen.

799
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,600
And that's a big part of what makes the Grinch,

800
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,900
you really believe why he's such a Grinch.

801
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,840
It's because you can feel Jim Carrey's pain,

802
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,600
and having like PTO, no, I guess that's later he has PTSD.

803
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,880
Panic attacks in the-

804
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,180
He went hard.

805
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,780
He's covered in a lot of makeup,

806
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,720
and he went hard in that movie.

807
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,360
He did, and that is a true fact that he,

808
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,180
it was like, I think the first makeup application

809
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,200
for this film took eight hours,

810
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,960
and the story is that he kicked a hole in a wall

811
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,780
and said, I can't do the movie.

812
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,460
What a prima donna.

813
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,060
Yeah.

814
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,180
He's not willing to do eight hours of makeup every day,

815
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,200
and I think they got it down there, it got better,

816
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,420
but I think where it truly got maddening for him

817
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,500
was the contact lenses,

818
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,960
because he had to put in the little reptile style contacts.

819
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,640
And I did a video one time where I was like,

820
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,460
it was kind of Grinch,

821
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
I was playing sort of like a Dr. Susie character,

822
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,280
and I was essentially naked,

823
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,000
and then covered in fluff,

824
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,120
something was sprayed on me to give me a furry texture,

825
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,920
and then there was talk of giving me contacts,

826
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,300
and I think I must have flashed to Jim Carrey and gone,

827
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,120
I think I'm going so insane already,

828
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,820
I think that will be the final thing,

829
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,700
because there was one other video where I did wear

830
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,120
little contacts, and it drove me crazy,

831
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,620
because I don't wear contact lenses to begin with,

832
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,940
so then these weird,

833
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,360
that's a hard thing to wrap your head around,

834
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,140
putting those up, but apparently, anyway,

835
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,780
back to Jim Carrey,

836
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,660
apparently he put those in, and for some reason,

837
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,380
the fake snow that was all over the set

838
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,980
was just gravitated to those contacts,

839
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,680
so he has no, none of Jim Carrey's real skin is visible,

840
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,720
or he's covered head to toe,

841
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,880
and then fucking snow is filling up in his eyeballs

842
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,860
that already have contact, horrible, what are you doing?

843
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,080
Can you see, you can see out of him,

844
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,600
just like everything is green as well,

845
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,640
and also distorted because of the way the thing looks?

846
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,460
I'm not sure, I haven't done that level of monster,

847
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,560
I haven't done the Marilyn Manson contact lenses,

848
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,660
I just did something that tinted my pupils blue one time,

849
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,280
and I hated it so much.

850
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,940
When did you see blue, basically?

851
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,540
No, I don't think I did, it ends up being fine,

852
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,880
but if you're not used to putting on contact lenses.

853
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,300
I'm sure they make it a little cloud,

854
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,500
I have never had contact lenses,

855
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,480
and I did ask an eye doctor once,

856
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,660
I was like, oh, could you size me for them,

857
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,220
just in case I decide to try them out,

858
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,280
and they're like, yeah, just a heads up,

859
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,700
just a reminder, you're pretty bad

860
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,460
at stigmatism in one eye.

861
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,560
And so he's like, so he put one in the one eye,

862
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,740
and that felt okay, felt a little weird,

863
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,920
but I had never had it done before,

864
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,060
he put it in the other eye, and within 30 seconds,

865
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,900
I was like, take it out, take it out, take it out.

866
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,280
Did it hurt?

867
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,200
It did hurt, it was simultaneously painful and annoying.

868
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,340
Oh, interesting.

869
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,800
Now there are special contacts

870
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,020
for people with this stigmatism, you can get it,

871
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,680
but it does cost more, and you have to make sure

872
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,640
you get the right ones and stuff, but.

873
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,800
The one that always seemed the scariest

874
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,400
was that when Jordy and Star Trek The Next Generation

875
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,260
would take his visor off, they'd have to put

876
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,520
an opaque contact, because he's blind on the show,

877
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,080
and he couldn't see anything.

878
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,720
Oh.

879
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,380
Which always sounded like I would have a panic,

880
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,600
claustrophobic panic attack with that.

881
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,980
No kidding. But I was like, God,

882
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,560
how often did he, once in a while,

883
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,860
he would take the visor off.

884
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,520
Yeah. But, yeah.

885
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,840
Just a solid wall inside your eyeballs.

886
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,040
Yeah, they would have to coach me through a technique

887
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,780
to make, we just did, maybe we'll talk about it later,

888
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,600
we just did a seance at the Magic Castle,

889
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
the Houdini seance, and this,

890
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,920
I sometimes sleepwalk in the middle of the night,

891
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,920
if the room is too dark, I get weird,

892
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,580
and I'll be like, where's the bathroom?

893
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,100
Or something, or where's the door?

894
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,620
I usually can't find the door, and Lindsay

895
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,740
will have to be like, oh, it's over here.

896
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,660
And she sent me into a brief panic attack

897
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,640
because the guy running the seance was like,

898
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,380
all right, I hope everyone's okay being in the dark.

899
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,240
She goes, I hope you're okay being in the dark.

900
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,340
She was kind of joking, and I spiraled for a minute,

901
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,980
just a minute of like, oh my God, yeah, what,

902
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,600
and I'm like, okay, it's fine, it's fine.

903
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,200
But I truly was like, should I tell them

904
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,840
I'm going to be bad in the dark, or should I?

905
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,340
Wow.

906
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,020
It's funny, when he said that,

907
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,260
it will be pitch black in here when I turn it down.

908
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,480
I did think, like, hope old blackout curtain mic's okay.

909
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,440
Yeah, but, so I could see, like,

910
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,720
I have that sometimes knee-jerk little panic attack thing.

911
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,700
I put on, for a funny or die, I put on a helmet,

912
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,640
a racing helmet, because those are very tight

913
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,380
over your head.

914
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:51,840
Yeah.

915
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,780
So the idea that it was tight, I think,

916
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,800
is the psychological thing, so I like squeeze it

917
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,900
over my head, and for like a minute or two,

918
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,760
I was like, you're not going to get out of this ever.

919
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,520
It's never going to, you're never going to get out of this.

920
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,300
And I had to be like, okay, all right,

921
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,080
it's fine, everything's fine.

922
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,260
They're going to have to chainsaw you out of it?

923
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,320
Yeah, and the same thing happened when I was fitted

924
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
for this thing that the bit I never did on Conan

925
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,000
is when I had to put on a big fat suit,

926
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,660
and they squeezed me into it, and my arms were over my head,

927
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,660
and they got stuck over my head, and that was the worst,

928
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,660
because it was like, you're never getting out of here.

929
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,700
You're never getting out of here.

930
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,300
And then they pulled it down on top of me,

931
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,600
and I was like, kind of seeing, like,

932
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,260
I was a very small circle in the room,

933
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,180
and no one's paying attention.

934
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,120
Obviously no one notices, because I'm not, like, screaming.

935
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,980
And then I was like, could we, could you, like,

936
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,360
put this on a different way?

937
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,240
He's like, oh, yeah, yeah, maybe,

938
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,920
luckily they cut it off.

939
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,620
But like, so I can see, those things, which are very minor.

940
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,180
You thought you were going to have to live as a fat man

941
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,440
the rest of your life.

942
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,680
I was going to.

943
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,820
When the doctor breaking the news, it's not coming off.

944
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,800
It's grafted to your body now.

945
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,080
Your skin has accepted it, and this is just your skin now.

946
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,860
This is your skin.

947
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,100
It's slowly turning into actual skin, cell by cell.

948
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,620
Hey guys, it's Mike here.

949
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,460
I have a little message about a company called Everlane that makes some awesome clothes.

950
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,500
Look, would you buy a t-shirt for $50 if you knew it only cost $7 to make?

951
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,400
No, of course not, you would not.

952
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,540
With Everlane, you never overpay for quality clothes.

953
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,720
Here's some great stuff about Everlane.

954
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,660
They only make premium essentials, using the finest materials without the traditional markups,

955
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,920
and they tell you the real costs, so you know you're never overpaying.

956
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,180
Everlane wants you to know what you're paying for and why.

957
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,060
They're very transparent about every step in their process,

958
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,480
from the materials they use to the ethical factories they work with.

959
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,360
Now, Everlane sells directly to you.

960
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,340
Their prices are 30 to 50% lower than traditional retailers.

961
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,280
Their clothes look better, cost less, and last longer.

962
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,760
They have essentials like the Cotton Crew t-shirt,

963
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,600
and they're exactly what they should be.

964
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,260
Simple, stylish, and they're made from quality material.

965
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,220
Now, I got some Everlane clothes.

966
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,100
I wear them a lot.

967
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,880
I have the Air Oxford shirt.

968
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,420
It's like a salmon-y color.

969
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,400
It's wonderful.

970
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,100
The 365 fleece.

971
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,380
It's relaxed crew.

972
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,160
It is, I look wonderful.

973
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,800
People compliment these clothes.

974
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,140
They say, Michael, you look good.

975
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,860
Here's the thing.

00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,460

You guys will look as good as me.

Now, to contextualize all of it, so like, yeah,

985
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
so when you get stuff like this on,

986
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,120
you either have costume contacts, costume fat suits,

987
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,220
costume makeup, you have to be in it for hours and hours

988
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,200
on a film set or a TV set.

989
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,100
And people like Jim Carrey, if you're the star of it,

990
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
they check up on you a lot.

991
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,240
But if you're just kind of in the background,

992
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,080
like, good luck.

993
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,220
You're just, they check on you every now and then.

994
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,140
You just have to raise your hand.

995
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,540
Just don't pass out.

996
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,900
Please don't pass out.

997
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,740
Yeah, so there's many who's extra,

998
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,700
the who's in Whoville that had to go through

999
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,200
a crazy process as well.

1000
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,180
They just, there weren't PAs rushing over to them with fans.

1001
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,240
There was like one fan for 30 Whovillians.

1002
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:24,720
Yeah.

1003
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,820
Well, and I bet the big concern was like,

1004
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,060
will Jim leave?

1005
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,900
Will he stop doing this?

1006
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,180
Right.

1007
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,680
Because he had to be in that costume

1008
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,180
for 92 shoot days or something.

1009
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,760
And they finally got it down to where it only took

1010
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,400
three hours to put on and one hour to take off.

1011
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,040
Madness.

1012
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,900
This is the kind of, thinking about all this,

1013
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,580
this is in kind of a crucial juncture

1014
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,720
where movies are changing a lot.

1015
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,400
And I, hearing about all this, you kind of go,

1016
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,980
yeah, maybe everything should be CGI.

1017
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,880
Maybe that's right.

1018
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,820
Maybe like, I'm, as much as any,

1019
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,400
I love seeing an ET puppet in a scene

1020
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,920
instead of a CGI creature.

1021
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,240
I prefer that in my Jurassic Parks or what have you.

1022
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,220
But when you're talking about a guy going mad,

1023
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,620
needing a CIA torture expert to help him through the process

1024
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,980
and require, and every second of the day,

1025
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,120
he's like, his face is getting touched up.

1026
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,780
And like, yeah, maybe computers make sense.

1027
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,680
Not the worst idea.

1028
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,280
I was watching a video of Ninja Turtles,

1029
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,280
the first Ninja Turtles,

1030
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,680
and they were doing fight choreography,

1031
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,440
but the guys were in the suits doing it.

1032
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,400
And I was like, man, are we ever gonna see

1033
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,780
a Ninja Turtle movie where the guys are,

1034
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,080
people are in the suits again?

1035
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,260
And the answer is no, there's no way.

1036
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,540
Like, there's just no way.

1037
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,100
Because you really imagine, and then I'm like,

1038
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,140
oh yeah, thinking about the day of work

1039
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,480
and how hard it was to puppet,

1040
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,660
because there's a puppet tear off to the side

1041
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,100
moving their head, but then there's a person

1042
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,120
in that just insane suit, big, thick rubber suit.

1043
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,220
I think there's fans in there,

1044
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,200
but like, how hard that must be.

1045
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,240
They did three Ninja Turtle movies.

1046
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,080


1047
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,140
Speaking of Conan, I don't think you worked with this guy,

1048
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,500
but the special effects guy who worked at Conan

1049
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,200
for a long time did the costumes for number three.

1050
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,220
Oh, he did?

1051
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,200
He took it over for number three.

1052
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,940
And I don't remember the stats,

1053
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,660
but he had a photo up in his office

1054
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,920
of all of the turtle suits dangling down.

1055
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,380
And once they were done,

1056
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,040
when you were done with the day of shooting,

1057
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,180
it was gone in the wash an entire day.

1058
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,400
So there had to be, I wanna say,

1059
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,440
four separate suits for all the main characters,

1060
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,100
just those.

1061
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,860
So they would clean them, essentially?

1062
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,000
Yeah, like, you're out,

1063
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,740
the cleaning process is so intense,

1064
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,920
like a full day is gone.

1065
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,300
So you're not shooting with that suit for an entire day.

1066
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,720
That's like a major, major wash in a shop

1067
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,920
for a long time.

1068
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,880
Because they would be sweating so bad in the suit

1069
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,080
and it would stink so bad.

1070
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,360
Yeah, and probably paint comes off

1071
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,940
and probably you gotta touch up.

1072
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,940
But seeing this creepy dry cleaner setting

1073
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,680
of all turtle skin hanging around.

1074
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,000
I'd still like to see it.

1075
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,480
Oh yeah, it's cool as hell, yeah, yeah.

1076
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,800
It's terrifying, though.

1077
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,780
Same guy did Short Circuit,

1078
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,600
so there's like a, what's the guy, Johnny Five?

1079
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,880
Oh, right, right.

1080
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,600
One of those is hanging around the office, too.

1081
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,060
And you had to wash Johnny Five every day, too.

1082
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,980
So you need like four Johnny Fives.

1083
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,800
Massage it, also.

1084
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,080
Make sure it's comfortable.

1085
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,260
So, you know, at Universal Studios,

1086
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,780
every year you can still visit a tribute

1087
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,040
to this glorious age of incredibly inconvenient film.

1088
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:36,980
Yeah.

1089
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,260
Oh, sorry, go.

1090
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,440
And not, again, to reiterate,

1091
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,540
not the current Grinch movie,

1092
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,380
current box office gross,

1093
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,620
211,690,175 people.

1094
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,700
Very successful, gonna top the original's gross,

1095
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,240
which was already, which I think was like around 250,

1096
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,340
240 million.

1097
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,600
Not acknowledged.

1098
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,400
I went up there last night.

1099
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,040
There is not a drop of new Grinch.

1100
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,400
Why?

1101
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,020
It is still Jim Carrey Grinch.

1102
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,960
I think I saw one poster from a picture at City Walk,

1103
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,100
but that might also have been the week it came out.

1104
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,960
The main, the actual area of Grinchmas,

1105
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,300
which I don't think I've clarified

1106
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,420
if you haven't been up there,

1107
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,600
it is essentially, this is a place called,

1108
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,960
is it called like Universal Plaza or something?

1109
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,400
It's like taken over this little zone

1110
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,860
that's this little Whoville winter wonderland.

1111
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,860
It's not necessarily a thing through the entire park.

1112
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,020
So there's this miniature Whoville setup,

1113
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,020
and within that, no acknowledgement

1114
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,140
of new current smash hit film, The Grinch.

1115
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,920
Maybe next year.

1116
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,080
Maybe they didn't have time

1117
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,100
and maybe they didn't wanna like muck it up.

1118
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,960
A different style, a very different style of film.

1119
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,320
It seems like they do,

1120
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,700
like Universal was doing the illumination Grinch though

1121
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,300
to like weave the Grinch into their universe of movies.

1122
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,080
And it feels very synergenistic or whatever the word would be.

1123
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,760
But so it's bizarre that they didn't roll that out

1124
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,660
in this year, cause that's the Grinch now.

1125
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,280
Well, and they're starting to, we've got all these films

1126
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,120
Grinch's illumination entertainment as is Despicable Me

1127
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,020
as is Secret Life of Pets, which is coming to Universal.

1128
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,900
So all of that, and supposedly that's coming out

1129
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,920
on the upper lot.

1130
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,200
So there'd be this little,

1131
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,200
there's already this little illumination zone.

1132
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,820
Grinch is right there.

1133
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:21,940
It would make sense.

1134
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
It would all tie together really clean.

1135
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,180
So maybe next year is the time to roll out

1136
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,220
the Gumber Batch Grinch.

1137
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,260
However though, maybe it happens

1138
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,120
and then maybe I kinda miss Jim Carrey Grinch in a weird way.

1139
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,940
I think it's kinda funny that they're still committed to it.

1140
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,280
Well, some of the set dressings that I saw looked like

1141
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,300
painted in the Seuss style, painted in the book style.

1142
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,180
Yeah.

1143
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,520
Sort of mixed in just.

1144
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,880
Well, and there's a lot of imagery around of the Seuss Grinch.

1145
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,600
So it's a big old mess of all Grinch.

1146
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah, the interesting thing about the Jim Carrey Grinch

1147
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,960
is how perverse it seems to me.

1148
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,140
Every time I see a photo of it, it's like scary and weird

1149
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,700
and illumination Grinch seems, you got it.

1150
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,120
He's straight ahead.

1151
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,280
It's normal. Sassy.

1152
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,020
Let me ask, did you guys see the Jim Carrey Grinch

1153
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:14,620
in theaters?

1154
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,720
No, I've never seen the entire film.

1155
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,620
Never seen the entire film.

1156
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,060
I haven't either.

1157
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,540
So I remember going to the theaters that weekend

1158
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,240
and my dad and brother saw it

1159
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,480
and I opted for the other big release

1160
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,460
of November 17th, 2000.

1161
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,380
Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Sixth Day.

1162
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,720
Whoa. The Sixth Day.

1163
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,280
Really?

1164
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,480
The cloning one.

1165
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,600
That's the one where there's two of them.

1166
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,900
It was fine.

1167
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:38,760
It was fine.

1168
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,960
I enjoyed it at the time.

1169
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,000
You know, this is a time of.

1170
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,020
The hell one.

1171
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,560
Is that the hell one or is that?

1172
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:43,940
No.

1173
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,380
Oh, what's the hell one that came around that time?

1174
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,700
That's right around that time.

1175
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,840
I can't remember it.

1176
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,140
It's like last two movies before Governor.

1177
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,660
It was Sixth Day and there was something about hell.

1178
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,400
I don't know, who cares?

1179
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,040
Who gives a shit?

1180
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,880
Both fine.

1181
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,620
Yeah, I don't know why they were insistent on seeing it

1182
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,520
and I was like, oh, maybe I'll go see The Sixth Day.

1183
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,420
What'd they think?

1184
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,800
I think they liked it.

1185
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,420
Yeah, I think they liked it okay.

1186
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,860
Like we laughed so much.

1187
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,680
We laughed up a storm, Jason, and you missed out.

1188
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,500
You missed it.

1189
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,680
This was also the time of Charlie's Angels

1190
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,960
would have been at theaters.

1191
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,300
The first one?

1192
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,000
Oh yeah, 99.

1193
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,780
The first one, yeah.

1194
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,960
No, 2000.

1195
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,880
2000.

1196
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,100
I think it was, I think Charlie's Angels is out there.

1197
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,460
I didn't see that in the theater either.

1198
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,600
I don't think I did.

1199
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,240
I've seen it though.

1200
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,600
Too bad no theme park presence of McG, Charlie's Angels.

1201
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,140
That would be, that's a perfect universal stunt show.

1202
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,100
Something, hold over and you're like,

1203
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,040
hey did you see when there was a Charlie's Angels thing

1204
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,740
still universal?

1205
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,960
That is perfectly, yes.

1206
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,420
They would still have it today.

1207
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1208
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,720
But there's new Charlie's Angels coming so maybe.

1209
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,000
Well one happened a couple years, few years ago, right?

1210
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:46,980
Is that longer?

1211
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,500
There was a short-lived ABC TV revival.

1212
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,160
Oh, was there?

1213
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,140
And it was so bland.

1214
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:51,860
God, I don't know.

1215
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,060
It was gone before Christmas I feel like.

1216
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,580
Wow, oh End of Days is what I was looking for.

1217
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,180
That was also kind of fine.

1218
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,680
Both of them pretty fine.

1219
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,620
Sixth Day and then Collateral Damage was the other one.

1220
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,840
He was getting, he had his eyes out the door I feel like

1221
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,940
of the movie career towards the end.

1222
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,300
Well in Collateral Damage I believe was one of the movies

1223
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,120
that got delayed because of 9-11 because like,

1224
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,920
oh there's way too many, we gotta dial back

1225
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,220
the terrorism attacks of this movie or people are going to.

1226
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,960
Yeah, a lot of movies got hit right after the fact.

1227
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,480
While we're talking about the film which influences

1228
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,600
the park show and the way it has been

1229
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,960
for many years running now,

1230
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,440
maybe not everyone would use this term but I will call

1231
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,020
what is on Who's Face's snouts.

1232
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,580
All of the, I characterize these bizarre noses they have

1233
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,440
as snouts and to me, this may have come up when we talked

1234
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,280
about Cat in the Hat but I am truly bothered

1235
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,460
and disturbed by the snouts.

1236
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,240
I understand that if you read a Dr. Seuss book,

1237
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,660
they don't quite look like you or me.

1238
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,240
They don't have human noses.

1239
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,580
However, had Ron Howard just made the decision,

1240
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,240
yeah then it'll be a bunch of humans.

1241
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,040
I don't think a single person is bothered by that.

1242
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,380
Scott, I'm 100% with you.

1243
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,380
Yay, I was worried.

1244
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,800
I haven't written down why are the residents of Whoville

1245
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,480
disgusting pig faced people?

1246
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,140
I don't understand it.

1247
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:28,740
There's just.

1248
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,660
The Twilight Zone, that one with the pig faces.

1249
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,440
Yes, I wrote down are they related to the characters

1250
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,260
in the Twilight Zone's Eye of the Beholder episode

1251
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,260
because it looks just like that.

1252
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,280
It doesn't make any sense.

1253
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,980
I went and found screen grads from the cartoon special

1254
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,740
and from the book and I'm like they're just kind of,

1255
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,560
cartoony but they're still human.

1256
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,940
Their hair is weird.

1257
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,440
It's not full on, they do not have bizarre animal faces.

1258
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,620
That was a big swing for the Howard movie.

1259
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,620
That was a big choice on their part

1260
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,540
and now we're stuck with it.

1261
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:04,340
And forever now, minimum wage actors on both coasts

1262
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,720
have to get these jobs where in order to perform

1263
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,400
robotic dance routines many times a day,

1264
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,380
to have that honor, they have to put on

1265
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,280
bizarre prosthetic snouts.

1266
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,560
Every single day.

1267
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,320
Some of them don't.

1268
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,200
Yeah, some of them have tiny little noses.

1269
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,800
Well, there's a bizarre, okay, so evidently there's a show

1270
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,100
at Islands of Adventure that is part of,

1271
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,680
that is not in Hollywood.

1272
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,200
There's a whole production in a sound stage

1273
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,180
and you'll be interested in this.

1274
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,000
From the pictures I saw, it looks like it is

1275
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,060
in sound stage 19, technically on the border of Islands.

1276
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,920
You enter through Islands of Adventure

1277
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,500
but you can see into the other park.

1278
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,900
Sounds in age 19 often used as the impact zone

1279
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,180
on impact wrestling.

1280
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:49,720
Oh, of course.

1281
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,540
Yes.

1282
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,540
But they build a full set and do a retelling

1283
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,900
of the Grinchmas.

1284
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,820
And I didn't watch an entire performance of this

1285
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,200
and if you, the listener, are mad that I didn't watch

1286
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,080
a full Grinchmas show, just please have some

1287
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,620
Christmas forgiveness for me.

1288
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,960
But I did skip to one random part where there's a little

1289
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,400
girl and she does not have a snout and there's a strange

1290
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,300
line about, well you just haven't grown into your nose yet.

1291
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,160
Ha ha ha.

1292
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,400
What do you mean?

1293
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,880
They start, they're born with regular noses

1294
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,700
and develop snouts through puberty?

1295
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,600
What are we talking about?

1296
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,080
First of all, I just came upon a picture of

1297
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,520
Matthew McConaughey at Grinchmas.

1298
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,620
Did anyone see this?

1299
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,240
No.

1300
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:33,640
No, I did.

1301
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,780
It's Matthew McConaughey and Grinch and then like

1302
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,100
two Whovillians or whatever.

1303
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,080
I don't know what it's from.

1304
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,680
I don't have any context for it.

1305
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,140
It's fun.

1306
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,120
I do, like, it's not just snouts.

1307
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:48,020
I think when you say snout, it undersells.

1308
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,500
Because I'm pro snout on humans for a lot of things.

1309
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,760
I grew up with a show called Zubilly Zoo

1310
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,040
and they were all animals.

1311
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,860
They all had, some people find this show a bit terrifying.

1312
00:50:59,100 --> 00:50:59,960
Yeah, I know.

1313
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,760
I'm no Zubilly Zoo fan.

1314
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,500
You know what I'm talking about.

1315
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,780
Ben Varine, classic kids show.

1316
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,320
And I get that that's a little creepy, but I like it.

1317
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,760
But it's an extra level of snout.

1318
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,460
It's an extra level of, I can't describe

1319
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:16,600
what makes it so weird and creepy.

1320
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,280
This upturned, I think it's like having a seal's face

1321
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,180
melded onto your face.

1322
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,580
I guess that's maybe, it does look like,

1323
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,840
it looks like experimenting was done.

1324
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,300
It looks like, it doesn't look natural

1325
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,380
and it looks like experiments were done on the Whoville.

1326
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,500
So there's maybe some horrible backstory

1327
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,880
of some island of Doctor Moreau

1328
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,920
where he engineered the Whoville's residents

1329
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,180
to be half snout, half human.

1330
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,660
Once humans have been synthesized with seals

1331
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,540
then I will have achieved my ultimate purpose on this earth.

1332
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,400
Yeah, why?

1333
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,960
What is that?

1334
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,040
I mean, like, I don't, it doesn't square

1335
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,600
with my image of the book.

1336
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,780
I read the book as a child and I watched the special

1337
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,780
and I did not think, oh, oh, mom,

1338
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,180
can we put on the special where the monster

1339
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,900
bothers the seal people?

1340
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,200
It is not an accurate, they could have absolutely,

1341
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,660
so much plastic is saved over many decades.

1342
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:17,980
They don't do this.

1343
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,400
And they're not like that in the special.

1344
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,020
If anything, their hair is the interesting part.

1345
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,360
They're furry.

1346
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,080
And they're kind of furry, yeah.

1347
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,040
Curly-Cue hair, yes, that's plenty.

1348
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,080
They're all furry and like,

1349
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,820
they could have all just been furry.

1350
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,480
Yeah.

1351
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,020
Just make them all like Chewie.

1352
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,640
We're just none of it, which is one of the only

1353
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,860
good choices in the Mike Myers cat in the hat.

1354
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,420
Right.

1355
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,500
Is that we don't have snouts.

1356
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,860
Or, what do you call a seal's face?

1357
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,860
That's, we need to, what's the actual term here?

1358
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,780
Face is fine.

1359
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,200
But a, I guess a seal has a snout.

1360
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,920
A snout isn't specific to one type of animal, is it?

1361
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:56,740
Don't think.

1362
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,440
Well, there's no seal people is the point

1363
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,140
in the only good thing.

1364
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,480
But you know who is a seal person?

1365
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,220
Thing one and thing two.

1366
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,080
And they are horrible in that Mike Myers one.

1367
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,680
I mean, they're definitely freaks of nature.

1368
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,640
Another thing, by the way, just side track,

1369
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,340
we already covered, we talked about the Mike Myers movie

1370
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,100
a little bit a while ago.

1371
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,580
But did you guys come across this,

1372
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,900
that when Theodore Giesel's widow

1373
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,580
made the deal with Universal,

1374
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,260
she was really, she really specified,

1375
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:33,740
the actors who star in any of these films

1376
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:38,140
have to be of the top tier box office talent.

1377
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,620
Like it's, we're talking, and they,

1378
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,380
she listed like Jack Nicholson, Tom Hanks, Jim Carrey.

1379
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,800
And so one of the people on her list was in it.

1380
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,780
But in the, if you think about it now,

1381
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,380
in the pursuit of getting the biggest stars in the world

1382
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,560
to be the Dr. Seuss characters,

1383
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,640
Jim Carrey is like literally going and say

1384
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,660
he might snap entirely because he's on a CILA

1385
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,440
level of torture.

1386
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,580
Mike Myers, do you remember the fact that he like

1387
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,240
was forced to do that movie?

1388
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:07,960
Because of the Sprockets?

1389
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,540
Yeah, the Sprockets movie fell apart

1390
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:14,720
and it was to like make good with DreamWorks

1391
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,200
or Universal, I guess.

1392
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,880
And like there was all, in the fallout of the Sprockets

1393
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,640
movie, people were like following him and bugging his house.

1394
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,260
And he was like being, there was this like

1395
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,840
bizarre top tier harassment going on of Mike Myers,

1396
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,900
thus resulting in him being forced,

1397
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,440
resulting in him being forced into fur for many hours.

1398
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:38,320
Both of these films are just literally torturing

1399
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,560
giant movie stars.

1400
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:43,420
And I remember, I mean the story is that

1401
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,400
the Mike Myers cat in the hat made the estate go like,

1402
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,600
no more live action, no more live action.

1403
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,300
But the other thing, and this stuff came up a little

1404
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,040
when we talked about Cat in the Hat with Jenny Nicholson,

1405
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,800
the initial deal as reported in the media

1406
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,420
was for three movies.

1407
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,480
And the third I think was Oh, the Places You'll Go.

1408
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,220
And that just never happened.

1409
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,440
They never made the third movie.

1410
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,400
And that was gonna be Jack Nicholson maybe?

1411
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,040
I was gonna say, are we gonna use him?

1412
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,880
We're gonna go to a lot of places.

1413
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,500
I flew with Jack's contract.

1414
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,240
Like famously Jack has like, in his Batman contract,

1415
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,620
I think he got to take off for Lakers games.

1416
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,420
Shooting, like it was something where he got paid

1417
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,060
so much more than Michael Keaton.

1418
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,180
He didn't have to work that many hours

1419
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,280
and then he got to go to any home Laker games

1420
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,800
if they were on the schedule.

1421
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,920
I don't know, he would have had going in character probably.

1422
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,320
Yeah, yeah.

1423
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,540
He would have been courtside as one of the characters.

1424
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,380
With a seal face and big swoopy hair.

1425
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,160
I think if there was apparently almost,

1426
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,580
like somebody pitched a version

1427
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,960
of a Jack Nicholson Grinch movie.

1428
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,800
And I think had that panned out,

1429
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,120
they would have taken him into the makeup

1430
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,340
and costume trailer, shown him all of this.

1431
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,360
So you'll be, it's actually Jack's fur

1432
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,100
and it's gonna cover your body

1433
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,240
and then we're gonna paint your face

1434
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,400
and it'll be kind of like whiskers.

1435
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,620
They would have taken him through the whole thing

1436
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,540
and then at the end, like nope.

1437
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,540
And then it just walks away.

1438
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,260
I don't think so, man.

1439
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,080
Not happening.

1440
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,220
And then they would have just like put him

1441
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,720
under a green light and that's your Grinch.

1442
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,320
How about a gel and we're done.

1443
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,720
You know, talking about, hey Listers,

1444
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,000
Matthew McConaughey was there

1445
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,980
and I hear when he was visiting Grinchmas,

1446
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,340
they did ask him, hey Matt, what do you wanna see?

1447
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,840
What would you like to see at night

1448
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,460
when it's dark on the tree?

1449
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,860
And he said, all lights, all lights, all lights.

1450
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,500
Oh my God.

1451
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,120
Man.

1452
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,400
We really had to wait for that.

1453
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,640
That required, hey speaking of Matthew McConaughey,

1454
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,780
10 minutes ago.

1455
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,760
How do you think I feel?

1456
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,980
I've been waiting for that for 15 minutes.

1457
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,540
You've been trying to concoct that,

1458
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,480
I think for 15 minutes. I have been trying.

1459
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,780
You're like, okay, all right, all right.

1460
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,760
What is the rhymes with right?

1461
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,440
I'm thinking about the deal for the live action

1462
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,120
Zeus movies.

1463
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,800
That was very good.

1464
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,420
Very good.

1465
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,560
You earned your milk.

1466
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,060
Here you go.

1467
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:55,920
Thank you.

1468
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,780
I need milk to wash out the duck salami.

1469
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,780
So because of the way this film is,

1470
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,240
you get a lot of seal people and you get to go

1471
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,340
hang out with them and watch a little show.

1472
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,720
Have you guys experienced a Grinchmas of any kind,

1473
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,040
either here or in Florida?

1474
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,760
Most of my experience with Grinchmas is going on

1475
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,480
the studio tour around Christmas and then doing

1476
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,560
the Grinch show for the Tram.

1477
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,200
The Whoville sing along on the studio tour,

1478
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,220
which has since been canceled.

1479
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:29,860
Cancelled, right?

1480
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,800
Oh, they aren't doing that now.

1481
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,520
So you would go, so generally on the Tram tour,

1482
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,980
you go see the War of the Worlds where there's a down,

1483
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:40,180
a plane and a bunch of houses or whatever.

1484
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,060
And then, I don't know.

1485
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:47,540
It's right before, literally next to the Psycho House.

1486
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,640
Oh wait, this is the day after then?

1487
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,660
It's before, I'm getting my geography wrong.

1488
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:58,480
Weirdly, the Whoville sets back right up to the Bates Motel.

1489
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,240
Literally, you just share a wall.

1490
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,240
It's very odd.

1491
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,700
And yeah, you pull up in front of the Tram

1492
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,620
and then they sing a song toward you and then that's it.

1493
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,360
Like a chore, that's accurate.

1494
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,040
And then it like, as you're pulling up,

1495
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,380
I don't know much about this.

1496
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,800
I don't have a lot of the song in my head

1497
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,180
except that a guy on stilts is like,

1498
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,620
we've been waiting for you!

1499
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,380
Which makes me uncomfortable.

1500
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,040
Why you shouldn't have?

1501
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,180
Listen, listen seal people.

1502
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,960
And there are a lot of performers in my memory.

1503
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,940
It might be 25, but it's a smallish space.

1504
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,700
It's a small space.

1505
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,040
And you always go by it on the tour.

1506
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,220
It's just usually there's not performers there

1507
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,220
and it's this weird,

1508
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,880
it looks like it's really faded in the sun over the years.

1509
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,940
They have not painted it.

1510
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,280
And usually around Christmas time,

1511
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,280
they just put stuff on top of it.

1512
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:49,800
Yeah, but there's like, it wasn't unfun.

1513
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,220
It was kind of like, oh good, the people are here.

1514
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,240
The Who's are here to sing.

1515
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,260
But it wasn't, it was.

1516
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,540
It's better than you would expect.

1517
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:02,300
It's not super, they put more into it than like,

1518
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,240
like little not snoopy shows.

1519
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,180
Yeah, so it's not nothing,

1520
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:10,540
but it is, does it make my enjoyment of seeing that set

1521
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,080
10 times higher?

1522
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,640
No, maybe 1.5 times higher.

1523
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,260
Like, oh, oh, that was nice.

1524
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,460
Great, and we're going on.

1525
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,320
I mainly am just thinking about the madness

1526
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,500
that sets in with the performers

1527
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,960
because they're in seal faces.

1528
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,120
They got their snouts on and they're like tram after tram.

1529
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,980
They have to perform the exact same routine.

1530
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,460
There's no room for deviation

1531
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,400
because it's a pre-recorded musical number.

1532
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,880
So they got to hit it exactly.

1533
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,320
And that's also the same zone where a Norman Bates

1534
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,460
has to wait around to attack the tram.

1535
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,200
And it's like, it's kind of weird up there.

1536
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,160
It's like in the hills and literally there's like coyotes

1537
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,680
wandering around that lot.

1538
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:56,280
That's the weirdest part of the tram tour, for sure.

1539
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,200
It's a weird juxtaposition of things, of scenes.

1540
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,720
The most happens up there, I don't know.

1541
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,760
And then no live person has shown up

1542
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:06,660
for 50 minutes.

1543
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,880
Because stuff, yeah, stuff would happen periodically.

1544
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,740
And I haven't taken the tram tour so much

1545
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,020
in the last couple years, but sometimes you would get

1546
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,320
performers doing stunts earlier, sometimes you wouldn't.

1547
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,500
There would be stuff that would pop up here and there

1548
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,240
on the tour.

1549
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,400
There's a little history of, yeah, I think they did

1550
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,220
like maybe a little western shootout.

1551
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,820
Yes, that's what my memory is that there would be like a guy

1552
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,720
who would do a stunt out of the second story

1553
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,440
and fall onto a mat, do like a stunt man fall onto a mat.

1554
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:31,940
Yeah.

1555
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,420
But yeah, and I remember a couple times

1556
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,620
when Norman wasn't at the Bates Motel.

1557
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,600
You never quite know what you're gonna get.

1558
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,900
Did you do the tram tour while Grinchmas was happening?

1559
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,900
Yes, and I specifically remember not really paying attention

1560
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,820
to any warning that this was going on

1561
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,240
or it not being clear to me.

1562
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,240
So I was just, I was talking.

1563
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,540
I was in the middle of a boring sentence about

1564
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,820
the Ron Howard film, which used over enough snow,

1565
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,640
fake snow to cover eight football fields.

1566
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,980
And then rounding a corner and then just a musical starting.

1567
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,320
And I feel like I was probably in pretty high danger

1568
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,240
of saying on mic, what the fuck is this?

1569
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,800
I truly didn't know.

1570
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,920
Wow, so you were just caught off guard entirely.

1571
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,900
Yeah, yeah, it really threw me.

1572
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,240
I had to stop what I was saying.

1573
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,860
It's like I had not been like, I hadn't rehearsed it

1574
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:20,940
or been told about it.

1575
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,620
There's a whole bunch of people doing a thing

1576
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:24,840
and you should be aware of it

1577
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,020
and here's what you do around it.

1578
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,240
Or I may have, they like, everybody had little like cubbies

1579
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,260
where they'd like slip pieces of paper

1580
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,400
that give you new like pages of the script.

1581
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,340
In your first year, you're really studiously looking at that

1582
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,940
and okay, so I'm talking about Crossing Jordan today.

1583
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,620
All right, good.

1584
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,460
And then by the last, your last couple months,

1585
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,260
you're like, what, I don't know.

1586
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,220
Like, I'll figure it out.

1587
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,680
So I may have just missed the memo.

1588
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,480
During slower production years,

1589
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,120
80% of your script was about Crossing Jordan, right?

1590
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,500
That was, I think for most of the late 2000s,

1591
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,860
the primary, I still don't know what it is or.

1592
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:02,260
No idea.

1593
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,000
The summer I started, there was a lot of,

1594
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,140
we had to talk a lot about Carpoolers.

1595
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:06,600
Of course.

1596
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,660
Which was a show with Jerry O'Connell

1597
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:11,900
and I knew about it because Bruce McCullough directed it.

1598
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:16,880
So we were really trying to hype people up on Carpoolers.

1599
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,800
And then currently, this is different

1600
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,620
because I think people actually watch Superstore,

1601
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,720
but it was funny having to watch a tour guide say,

1602
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:24,920
and if you look to your left,

1603
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,940
you might see some familiar shopping carts

1604
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,700
because they're trying to get you jazzed up

1605
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,360
for a bunch of shopping carts.

1606
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,100
Shopping carts.

1607
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,300
The famous Superstore Blue.

1608
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:36,060
Wow.

1609
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:36,760
Yeah.

1610
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:37,900
People go to the theater.

1611
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:42,500
So yeah, I didn't know how to respond

1612
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:46,480
and I'm mainly worried about the stir craziness

1613
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,760
of those actors and I still worry about the Normans up there

1614
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,560
just playing a psycho and just sitting there by yourself

1615
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,280
for hours on end.

1616
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:56,880
I was on.

1617
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,440
Crazy.

1618
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,640
I was unnerved.

1619
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,720
We were taken up around there.

1620
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,520
We had a walking tour of some of that area not long ago

1621
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,640
and we stopped in a golf cart right by the psycho house.

1622
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,860
Yeah, by the psycho house.

1623
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,080
And I briefly considered,

1624
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,220
oh, maybe I can get a picture on the porch

1625
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,800
and then a tram came by and Norman Bates came out

1626
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,560
of the house because they were still repairing

1627
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,480
the motel from Horror Nights.

1628
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,640
Normally, Norman comes out of the Bates Motel,

1629
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,160
he comes up to the tram, that's it.

1630
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,400
But they had put Norman in the house this time.

1631
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,280
So he comes out to terrorize the tram,

1632
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,480
but we're on foot like 20 feet from him

1633
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,620
and he turns and looks at us and I was like,

1634
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,340
ah, he's gonna come after us.

1635
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,980
Oh, if you look to your left, look out,

1636
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,660
there's Norman Bates and next to him,

1637
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,960
a couple of dipshits next to a golf cart.

1638
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,400
Yeah, we broke the illusion.

1639
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:46,980
We did.

1640
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:47,620
For sure.

1641
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,700
Us and the VIP trolley, we kind of followed up that road.

1642
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,120
That's true, there was a VIP trolley,

1643
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,680
we were all coming through the wreckage of the neighborhood.

1644
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,700
I take that stuff seriously and one time

1645
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:02,520
I was wandering the lot, I was walking around there

1646
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,300
with our friend Ryan Perez and we walked up

1647
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,540
to the back of Jaws, so we're across the lake

1648
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:11,020
watching the thing happen and I was like,

1649
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,420
I can't let this place down, this is my alma mater,

1650
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,300
we gotta do this right, so I made him react

1651
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:22,860
to the death of the fisherman getting eaten.

1652
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,060
It's funny you say that and I will keep the,

1653
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,780
whoever took us to do this secret,

1654
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,760
I don't know if it really matters,

1655
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,640
he said that he'll go over there on a lunch break

1656
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,720
and they'll always react to it, so he was like,

1657
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,960
hey, we're gonna go over to the behind the Jaws

1658
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,900
and we'll react when the guy gets eaten.

1659
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,500
So the tram pulls up, we were waiting for this,

1660
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:45,080
the tram pulls up, the diver, the blood, the whole thing,

1661
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,480
he and I go, ah, we react, I look over,

1662
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,320
Jason's on his phone taking a video of it,

1663
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,920
not reacting at all and we go, Jason,

1664
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,640
this is the whole thing, we were gonna all pretend

1665
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,900
and oh, I'm sorry and then it didn't,

1666
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,600
but you ruined it for those tourists.

1667
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:06,920
I showed them the real behind the scenes.

1668
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:12,120
You were like some sick sadist who just wanted to capture

1669
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,560
and capture his films.

1670
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,860
You were playing the part of a snuff filmmaker.

1671
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,100
It does count as something.

1672
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,220
It does count as something.

1673
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,180
It was so funny though, because I looked over

1674
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,580
and you were not reacting, you were just on your phone.

1675
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,460
When I was looking on YouTube,

1676
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,940
I think there actually was some additional tour content

1677
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:32,540
at some point in time for the Grinch,

1678
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,460
which is that, okay, so it's not there anymore,

1679
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,740
but in the place that is now Fast and Furious,

1680
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,660
there was this tunnel that was,

1681
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,340
initially when they built it, it was an avalanche

1682
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,620
and then they painted it and it's like

1683
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,300
an infinite tunnel effect that's spinning and spinning

1684
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,900
and it really bugs out your perspective and makes you dizzy

1685
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,120
and the whole tram fits inside of it.

1686
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:56,420
And so it was an avalanche first and then they painted it red

1687
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:00,660
for Dante's peak to pretend you were in a lava flow,

1688
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:02,300
which was a pretty tough sell.

1689
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,320
And then it became the mummy's tomb,

1690
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,940
the tomb of the dragon emperor

1691
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,760
and so it was just painted tan,

1692
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,740
but what is it, what do you mean it's spinning around?

1693
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,560
Avalanche makes more sense to me than that.

1694
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,180
It was always really odd, the whole thing was weird.

1695
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,100
Great effect, great effect, very story-enthusiastic.

1696
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,960
Yes, it does, yeah, it's a very neat,

1697
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,480
very big haunted house effect.

1698
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,500
Hard to find a property to climb onto though.

1699
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:33,280
Yeah, not a lot of things fit in terms of rotating tunnels.

1700
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,920
So I think they did, at one point,

1701
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,320
they tried to make that tunnel Mount Crumpet, the home of.

1702
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,080
Oh, they did.

1703
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:44,000
They tried to make it like a avalanche

1704
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,820
in the Grinch's mountain home,

1705
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:50,680
but by then it was already painted brown for the mummy.

1706
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,140
So they just kind of made it all bright green light

1707
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:58,820
and bright red light and it was that you were rescuing Max

1708
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,020
somehow, Max the dog.

1709
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,200
So when it was over, the Grinch is on screen

1710
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,580
and like, you rescued Max, but I did, how?

1711
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,400
I just saw flashing red lights in a tunnel.

1712
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:14,180
They really, a lot of lazy stuff with Grinch,

1713
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:18,660
like a lot of half ideas, not a lot of money put behind it,

1714
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,600
but here's our Christmas thing, here you go.

1715
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,100
I'll say this, I think you can get your picture with Max.

1716
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,980
Supposedly from stuff I read, Max, there's like 11 Max's,

1717
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:30,420
they're rescue dogs.

1718
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:31,500
Oh, that's nice.

1719
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,420
Isn't that nice?

1720
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:35,000
Like, yeah, they get to showcase a rescued dog,

1721
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,780
maybe get them adopted and.

1722
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,460
Well, you know, they're not too aggressive.

1723
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,240
Hopefully they're not too aggressive.

1724
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:40,600
No, no.

1725
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,100
You should adopt one of the Max's.

1726
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,640
You should get a dog, I'm trying to get you to get a dog.

1727
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,360
Cute little Max.

1728
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,540
You should get a Max, yeah.

1729
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,040
So I went up there last night and there's a,

1730
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:53,720
you can read a sign of Max Fax,

1731
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:59,820
which are, you know, that in the film there were six Max's.

1732
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,140
Okay, all right.

1733
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,760
It says the names of all the dogs

1734
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,140
that played Max in the film, fact one.

1735
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,380
Fact two, the film featured enough fake snow

1736
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,880
to cover nine football fields.

1737
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,640
One of my favorite things to say on the tram.

1738
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:14,720
Let's relate everything to football fields.

1739
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,360
Important context.

1740
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,400
That's fact two.

1741
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,660
Fact three, Max is much, much more

1742
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,780
than just Grinch's loyal dog and unwitting accomplice.

1743
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,640
He is also his moral compass.

1744
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,520
Fact?

1745
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,840
I get, about the character?

1746
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,320
Now we're not so much in logistics.

1747
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:34,420
Fact four, please listen to the trainer's direction

1748
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,980
when you meet Max.

1749
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,360
Thank you and merry Grinch's.

1750
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,440
So there's really only two facts in there.

1751
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,540
One is just kind of a little character analysis

1752
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:45,080
and one is just, hey, don't be mean to the dog.

1753
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,620
Yeah, don't turn your flash off.

1754
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,960
That's an instruction, not a fact.

1755
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,380
Weird sign, guys.

1756
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,140
Yeah, that's what, I think I feel good about this podcast

1757
01:08:55,780 --> 01:09:00,420
where I harangue makers of signs in theme park locations.

1758
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,660
Put them in their place.

1759
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:03,220
Yeah, they should know what's coming.

1760
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,640
Signs in front of places where rescue dogs

1761
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,540
are given opportunities to care of people.

1762
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:12,280
But I do have to say with the interview I saw

1763
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,620
with an animal trainer, he's like, yeah, you know,

1764
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,460
get people thinking about rescue dogs this time of year

1765
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:19,220
and people getting dogs for Christmas.

1766
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,620
No, don't get people thinking about that.

1767
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,220
This is like a bad time for it

1768
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:25,340
because what happens is a lot of people

1769
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,460
get animals for Christmas and then a week later

1770
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,100
they return them to shelter.

1771
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,700
Like so, folks, alls we're saying,

1772
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,380
if you're gonna adopt an animal,

1773
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,560
make sure you can commit to that.

1774
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,000
Do it in the off season.

1775
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,200
Do it in the off, just please, yeah,

1776
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,040
it'd be great to clear the shelters for Christmas.

1777
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,800
Just make sure you can handle the commitment of an animal.

1778
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:44,980
Can you?

1779
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:45,740
Can I?

1780
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:46,080
Yeah.

1781
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:46,400
No.

1782
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,380
You're going away for the holidays.

1783
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,840
So in January you'll get one, I got it.

1784
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,460
Okay.

1785
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:56,580
I'm gonna get you a St. Bernard for Christmas,

1786
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,760
but I'll give it to you in January.

1787
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,640
You know, I hear are, I mean, it'd be very fun

1788
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,040
if I had a giant dog.

1789
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,700
Dog and man, same size.

1790
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,880
Dog and man, same size.

1791
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:06,820
I think-

1792
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:07,840
He's gonna have the barrel around his neck too.

1793
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,820
I hear they're very, very manageable dogs

1794
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,380
and they are beautiful gray hounds.

1795
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,060
Oh yeah.

1796
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,000
They're aren't they gray, oh, they have a ton of energy.

1797
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,380
Not really, that's what we associate them

1798
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,140
because of unfortunate history of racing.

1799
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,220
But if you take them for a couple quick walks a day,

1800
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:23,840
they mostly like to sleep.

1801
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:24,580
Oh.

1802
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,140
And they're very affectionate and yeah.

1803
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,920
So you want a gray hound, not a purebred gray hound?

1804
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,860
I would love a lanky alien look.

1805
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,100
I like that they look a little spacey gray hounds,

1806
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:36,960
adorable dogs.

1807
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,740
Yeah, well, I'll think about it.

1808
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:39,480
I think those might be,

1809
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,960
well, I guess St. Bernard expensive too.

1810
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,580
Muts are obviously always cheaper than-

1811
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:44,460
You're gonna buy Jason a dog?

1812
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,420
Well, in this hypothetical comedy-

1813
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,500
Please do not adopt me a dog.

1814
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,000
Comedy scenario.

1815
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,520
But I'm not gonna, yeah, I don't know.

1816
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,320
That's a little bit of a, that is a little far for a bit.

1817
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,900
But the idea of him and a gray hound or him

1818
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,940
and a St. Bernard living together is great.

1819
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:58,480
Yeah.

1820
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,540
You should just do it.

1821
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,820
No one should, it's your choice to make.

1822
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:02,360
That's true.

1823
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:04,500
All right, fine, I won't adopt Jason a dog.

1824
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,880
I won't forcibly adopt him.

1825
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,200
You can cover the adoption costs.

1826
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:07,840
Let's compromise a bit.

1827
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,760
Oh, the adoption costs, they have deals.

1828
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,540
We got Edwin, I think he was 75 bucks.

1829
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:13,060
Yeah.

1830
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:15,940
You can get a real deal if you go into these shelters.

1831
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,800
Less than the price of Universal Studios admission.

1832
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,120
And you get a lifelong friend.

1833
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,680
Wow, but at Universal you get a $15 beer.

1834
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:25,720
That's fair.

1835
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,280
Which by the way, I was wandering around up there

1836
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,420
last night, checking out the Grinchmas festivities,

1837
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:37,020
got myself a Dufftoberfest, the seasonal,

1838
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,400
which I think I mentioned previously,

1839
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,740
the current seasonal Simpsons beer.

1840
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,820
I think in the running for, like,

1841
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,060
could be best theme park beer.

1842
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,960
Could be like best, not that there's a lot

1843
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,120
that are made specifically for theme parks,

1844
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,340
but it's like, I don't know, I mean,

1845
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,060
I like those Harry Potter ones a lot too,

1846
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,820
but Dufftoberfest is solid and nice and like wintery

1847
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:03,260
and toasty and no line at like the Duff Gardens area

1848
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,160
walked right up.

1849
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,920
Dufftoberfest completely original theme park Simpsons IP.

1850
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,140
There's never, is there an episode of Simpsons

1851
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,940
where they have Dufftoberfest?

1852
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,040
Could be like on the Duff tour maybe,

1853
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,560
but I kinda like that.

1854
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,440
The original Simpsons IP now created in the park

1855
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,320
and maybe you could see it in the show.

1856
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:26,720
If we tweeted Al Jean, we can get Dufftoberfest

1857
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,460
into an episode.

1858
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,520
It'll be a whole episode probably.

1859
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,920
They're out of ideas obviously.

1860
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever they can take.

1861
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:33,520
Yes, absolutely.

1862
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,320
So you were up there, I mean, reading the marketing,

1863
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:38,400
it definitely feels like the holidays,

1864
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:43,160
universal marketing materials for Orlando and Hollywood,

1865
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,440
they're really pushing the Harry Potter Christmas stuff.

1866
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,700
Grinchmas is still on the websites and all.

1867
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,320
There's still show times, all of that,

1868
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,960
but they're coming hard with that Harry Potter stuff.

1869
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,040
Yeah, and it was so crowded.

1870
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,240
There was a line just to get into the land.

1871
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:00,140
So I didn't give it a shot.

1872
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,680
And it was just like,

1873
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:05,800
just super crowded up on that upper lot in general.

1874
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,120
It was kind of a mess.

1875
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,920
And the main thing that kinda drives people to Grinchmas

1876
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,000
at night is this tree lighting ceremony

1877
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:16,280
that happens every half hour.

1878
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,980
And this is a zero sight lines experience.

1879
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,960
There is no, it is so impossible to get an angle

1880
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,820
of this thing, because there's just pillars and trees

1881
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,100
and signs everywhere.

1882
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,620
So there is so much jockeying for space

1883
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:34,260
and people standing up on chairs and climbing up on planters

1884
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:36,600
and pushing each other out of the way.

1885
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:39,580
And I went and stood up on something to get a view

1886
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,220
and I thought I had cleared some people behind me,

1887
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:42,920
but I had not.

1888
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:48,400
So I heard somebody behind me, excuse me.

1889
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,980
I turned back, I'm very like, I'm just like,

1890
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,160
oh my God, I thought I was not in front.

1891
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,140
I thought I'd clear you guys.

1892
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,440
A husband apologetic wife staring at me

1893
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,860
like that clerk who wouldn't approve the gay marriages.

1894
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,580
Just like staring daggers.

1895
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,260
So, and in general, everybody's getting bumped

1896
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,600
and jostled and nobody, they gotta figure out

1897
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,460
how to meet the demand of the tree lighting ceremony.

1898
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,700
The spirit of the citizens of Whoville.

1899
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,500
No, they're so kind.

1900
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,260
Their hearts grow and grow.

1901
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,500
And probably have less of a problem in Orlando

1902
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,120
because they have all of Seuss Landing to decorate

1903
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,920
and play around with and stuff.

1904
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1905
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,640
They're like trying to confine it to this tiny space.

1906
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:30,320
All told, I ended up being somewhat present

1907
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,260
for three separate tree lighting ceremonies.

1908
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:35,460
Wow, wait, they do it multiple times a night?

1909
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,920
They do it every half hour.

1910
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,600
Oh my God.

1911
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,960
And then you know what is a little neat,

1912
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,700
though I didn't make it into Harry Potter,

1913
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,600
it's kind of, there's certain views

1914
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,280
where it's in your periphery

1915
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,980
so you could see the projections on the castle

1916
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:52,080
and the fireworks going off in conjunction

1917
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,100
with the snowfall in Whoville.

1918
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,080
So that's kind of fun.

1919
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,460
I did get pictures of fireworks in the deep background

1920
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:04,320
and fake foamy snow in the foreground, which that's fun.

1921
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:07,920
So that's always, that's a theme park staple, foam snow.

1922
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,900
We had foam snow on Disney.

1923
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,220
Yeah, as we were leaving Disneyland at like 1130

1924
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,340
or something, it was doing that,

1925
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,200
and the foam smelled like nutmeg.

1926
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:17,080
Really?

1927
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,320
They made it smelly?

1928
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,680
Yeah, it kind of had like a fall,

1929
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,740
that sort of fall, candle-y smell.

1930
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,060
This seems like a good holiday thing

1931
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:28,540
to add to our vernacular of what we like and obsess over.

1932
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,440
Fake rocks and foam snow.

1933
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,220
Nutmeg foam snow.

1934
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,600
Nutmeg foam snow.

1935
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:37,860
If you're looking for a holiday present for us,

1936
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,500
not that you have our address or anything,

1937
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,380
just get us a box of nutmeg foam snow.

1938
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:44,360
That's on Jason's Amazon wish list.

1939
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,940
You can just buy him gifts.

1940
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,400
That and colored lights.

1941
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:49,900
That's one of my favorite colored lights.

1942
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,020
We were talking to Zach Ryder,

1943
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:53,980
we were talking about the Tron coaster,

1944
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,700
and I was like, I do want to see those colored lights.

1945
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,380
Yeah, I said, me and I don't know,

1946
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,120
he was so skeptical about the Tron.

1947
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,100
Yeah, yeah.

1948
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,200
But I am a real sucker for colored lights.

1949
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,560
Colored lights, fake rocks, nutmeg snow.

1950
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:10,100
Colored lights, who is the Grinch

1951
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,700
that doesn't enjoy colored lights?

1952
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,480
A colored light.

1953
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,920
Fun neon lights in the dark, that's the greatest.

1954
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,020
You got one of those light bulbs,

1955
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,300
a few years ago you got a light bulb

1956
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,020
that you troll with an app on your phone,

1957
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,780
and you were delighted by it.

1958
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,200
Yeah, it's great, any color of the rainbow.

1959
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,820
You can change it for the season,

1960
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,480
you can have red and green in Christmas,

1961
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:31,120
and purple and orange at Halloween.

1962
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:31,780
Yeah.

1963
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:33,160
You know, yeah.

1964
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,460
What else, what are we gonna say?

1965
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,300
Colored lights, of course, my god.

1966
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,300
Let's be very clear about this,

1967
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,540
we are pro colored lights.

1968
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:42,700
If anyone in any of these theme parks

1969
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,100
is thinking about not decorating for the holidays

1970
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,880
in one of these years, save some money.

1971
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,000
Don't do it, we need it.

1972
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,760
Okay, so what else in my Grinchmas excursion?

1973
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,220
You sent a postcard, right?

1974
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,760
I did send a postcard, I guess here,

1975
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,600
yeah, I can get into that.

1976
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:05,800
So, one of the things, one of the activities at Grinchmas

1977
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,540
is the Whoville Post Office,

1978
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:12,380
which has some sort of confusing terms.

1979
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,860
It isn't a place where you can send a letter

1980
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:17,000
to a loved one for the holidays

1981
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,780
with like a special Grinch stamp or something.

1982
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,860
It is a, I mean, it's a good thing what it is,

1983
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:28,940
it's that you send a postcard to the Grinch,

1984
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,500
and they give you an address for the Grinch,

1985
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,380
which is listed as Whoville WV,

1986
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,300
which I guess is another Whoville,

1987
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,860
like Whoville, Whoville,

1988
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,720
like it's New York, where it's the state.

1989
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,680
However, there is a state that is WV,

1990
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:47,340
it is West Virginia, and there's a zip code listed,

1991
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,060
so I'm like, so this is Whoville in West Virginia?

1992
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,620
Does How the Grinch Stole Christmas

1993
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:52,860
take place in West Virginia?

1994
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:57,020
Anyway, you send a postcard to the Grinch,

1995
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:02,460
and by doing so, they make, for every one of these postcards,

1996
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:05,620
they make a donation to a different charitable cause

1997
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,500
every year.

1998
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,380
This year, School on Wheels, an organization

1999
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,840
that provides one-on-one tutoring to homeless children,

2000
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,140
and is the only organization in Southern California

2001
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,440
dedicated to educational needs of homeless youth.

2002
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,740
So it's a nice thing, I think it changes every year.

2003
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,460
That's a good thing, you just write a fun little postcard,

2004
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,980
and then a donation is made.

2005
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,640
Good job, Universal.

2006
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,560
So, but to do this, you have to write a message

2007
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:35,680
to the Grinch himself, and here's what comes before

2008
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,940
the blanks of this postcard.

2009
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:41,920
Dear Mr. Grinch, I grew my heart three sizes this Grinchmas.

2010
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,920
Here are my good deeds.

2011
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,320
And then you have a three-step opportunity to prove

2012
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,480
that your heart grew via good deeds.

2013
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:53,580
And there are three of us, and I thought I should list

2014
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:56,060
a good deed for each of us.

2015
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:59,880
So I'll post this on Twitter so you can follow along,

2016
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:04,120
but here are what I consider Podcast the Ride's

2017
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,120
good deeds for this Christmas.

2018
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,600
Number one, Mike cleared his plate

2019
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,100
and did not waste one drop of food.

2020
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,540
Very good, Mike.

2021
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:17,680
Number two, Jason accepted his time in the penalty box,

2022
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,740
and thus he and Nick Mundy tolerate each other.

2023
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:24,040
And all they had to do was kick and scream

2024
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:24,960
while I was in there.

2025
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,680
And refuse to go the second time.

2026
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,520
Rightfully so.

2027
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,420
You did your.

2028
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,220
All of our limits.

2029
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,160
Did your due diligence.

2030
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,540
And number three, Scott kept wine grape growers

2031
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:41,760
and happily employed, and sowed the seeds of tolerance

2032
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,600
between hashtag launch queens and hashtag no launch queens.

2033
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,020
That's true.

2034
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:50,180
And for these three, I think all of our hearts grew bigger.

2035
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,540
This year, and thus.

2036
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:53,420
That's nice.

2037
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,080
Universal will make a donation based on these deeds.

2038
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,640
So you're welcome.

2039
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,120
What's the size of that donation?

2040
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:02,420
17 cents.

2041
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,080
Hey, every.

2042
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,860
It's an annual pass holder discount on a beer.

2043
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,180
Everything helps.

2044
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,420
So that was fun.

2045
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,400
I sent a postcard.

2046
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:15,260
I got to see this show where you see the moment

2047
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:19,940
where the Grinch flips, where he turns and becomes good.

2048
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:23,160
You see his heart grow as a bunch of red lighting

2049
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,220
that conveys that.

2050
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:27,500
And then the actual tree lighting things

2051
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,880
is impressive and fun.

2052
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,160
And so that little show is nice

2053
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,960
and you get to see some seal faces.

2054
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:38,520
You also get to see a beloved character from the film,

2055
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,680
Mayor Augustus Mayhew.

2056
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,300
Yes.

2057
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,240
Let's talk about Mr. Mayor.

2058
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:45,880
Uh oh.

2059
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:46,660
Uh oh.

2060
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,840
I mentioned this on the charity land stream

2061
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,700
that I wasn't sure you had come across.

2062
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,140
I was wondering.

2063
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:53,620
Yeah.

2064
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:55,940
We just did this thing for defunct land,

2065
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,480
a little this charity.

2066
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,520
We're very charitable in this Christmas season.

2067
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,340
And Mayor came up and I was wondering

2068
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:04,520
if this is who you're talking about.

2069
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:04,940
Yes.

2070
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:10,740
So I saw a report from Grinchmas,

2071
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:13,320
either last year or two years ago.

2072
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:18,700
And the vlogger spent some time talking to Mayor Augustus.

2073
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,540
And as I said on this live broadcast,

2074
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,200
as we have learned at this point,

2075
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,900
all other theme park based mayors make me furious.

2076
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:32,160
Mayor Augustus was no exception.

2077
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,020
Yeah.

2078
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,340
I think he's reckless.

2079
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,900
I think he is not,

2080
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:42,120
if one person can make Christmas go to shit in Whoville,

2081
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:45,600
clearly the mayor has not put precautions in place.

2082
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,760
He's mayoral sash has a bunch of medals and stuff on it.

2083
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,920
And I want a full accounting of how he earned

2084
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,540
all those medals because if not at best

2085
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:59,820
that stolen valor at worst he is like the hollow figurehead

2086
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,520
of a banana Republic.

2087
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:03,320
Yeah.

2088
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,140
What wars are occurring?

2089
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:08,800
What are there like Susie and beasts stomping around?

2090
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:09,920
Maybe, I don't know.

2091
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,180
Maybe he slayed a pack of Grinch's.

2092
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:15,360
You want medals for earned distinctions

2093
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,080
like it being your birthday at Disneyland.

2094
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:18,640
Yeah.

2095
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:19,980
He should have had a birthday button

2096
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,640
that would have made more sense.

2097
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,900
Yes, that's fine.

2098
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,580
Everyone has a birthday.

2099
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:26,840
I'm sorry you feel this way.

2100
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,460
I wasn't, I was also disappointed to hear like

2101
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:32,220
who played him, who embodied this character in the movie.

2102
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,700
It was Jeffrey Tambor.

2103
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:34,240
Yeah.

2104
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,080
Kind of a creep.

2105
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,960
Though unrecognizable on some level.

2106
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,180
Yeah, once you know it,

2107
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,800
once you know who's under that snout.

2108
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,940
But Martha Mae Whovier, the singer,

2109
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:46,720
star of the musical review at Christmas

2110
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,340
played by the great Christine Baranski.

2111
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,640
Always happy to see her at work.

2112
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,260
You know who was not happy to see her though

2113
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:57,660
was Mrs. Geisel, the widow.

2114
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:58,000
Really?

2115
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,680
Because her, she had a lot of like,

2116
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,400
well she before the film came out,

2117
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,040
she made a lot of cuts in the script and said,

2118
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:07,200
that American pie stuff has no place in Seuss.

2119
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,620
So things were offensive to her that were cut from the film

2120
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:14,260
and now she only has one problem with the finished movie,

2121
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,780
which is the, as the article describes,

2122
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:20,460
pillowy cleavage of Martha Mae Whovier.

2123
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,820
Odd word chosen by this entertainment weekly.

2124
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:26,060
By the way, I agree with her.

2125
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:27,920
Oh boy.

2126
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:28,820
Button up.

2127
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,780
You'll catch a cold, it's winter.

2128
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,980
This is a child's film.

2129
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:33,880
I do not care for that.

2130
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:37,660
Mike is chomping on his emergency graham crackers

2131
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:41,700
to keep his temperaments down,

2132
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,140
his inner humors balanced.

2133
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,940
The theater should at least provide an optional fence

2134
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,160
that can be put up if the audience votes

2135
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,960
to not see the pillowy cleavage.

2136
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,400
No bosom.

2137
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,680
I will not be subjected to that.

2138
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,160
Not for the holidays, it's a time of morality.

2139
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,680
But that's an instance, I don't think Martha

2140
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,300
is wearing a nose, right?

2141
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:03,200
Because she's gotta sing.

2142
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,560
She's gotta have that all clear.

2143
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,200
I don't know, but in the film she does.

2144
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,180
Oh in the film she does,

2145
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,120
but at the Grinchmas live review,

2146
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:10,680
quick little musical numbers,

2147
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:13,960
and the backup dancers also didn't seem to be.

2148
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:14,420
Okay.

2149
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:15,740
Covering noses.

2150
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,840
Hard to sing in snouts.

2151
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,720
Hard to sing, yeah.

2152
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,460
By the way, some of the things that were cut in the,

2153
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,080
like some sexual innuendos were cut from the movie,

2154
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,820
but also a sequence about a family

2155
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:28,080
that did not have a Christmas tree or presents

2156
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,320
called the Whosteens.

2157
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,840
Oh really, Jewish Whovils?

2158
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,700
Yeah, that was a joke in the,

2159
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,680
I mean, probably written by a Jewish writer,

2160
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,320
because a couple like Seinfeld guys

2161
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,440
like uncredited wrote on this movie.

2162
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,000
Oh okay.

2163
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:42,540
That's fun.

2164
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:44,980
And actually, no, I bet there were like,

2165
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,140
yeah, that's not so bad,

2166
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,300
and then also that there was a,

2167
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,640
that on the Grinch's wall was a stuffed

2168
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,960
head of the cat in the hat.

2169
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:55,280
That's kind of fun.

2170
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,560
Grinch murdered the cat in the hat.

2171
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,780
You seem to see a little dark for that movie, but sure.

2172
01:24:59,460 --> 01:24:59,980
Not too bad.

2173
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,220
I mean, here's my thing with both Grinchmas

2174
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,940
as like a theme park event in that movie,

2175
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,060
and I will say apparently the theme park event

2176
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:11,740
is very popular, and it seems like it was packed.

2177
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,160
Yeah, yeah, not any room to breathe, in fact.

2178
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,620
I can't figure out the,

2179
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:22,620
like the comedy of it, I don't know.

2180
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,560
I think in our comedy, we'd probably say,

2181
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,600
I'm not sure what the game of this is.

2182
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,580
Like I don't know what the point,

2183
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,840
it sounds like it is the very vestige of like,

2184
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:37,360
Jim Carrey wacky, like 90s wacky, but like for families.

2185
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:41,860
Yeah, it's like, well, if there's one thing

2186
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:45,760
you can pull from it, it's that the Grinch is rude

2187
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,700
and cantankerous, I guess that's the meat of it,

2188
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:53,920
and like I'm gonna go meet a guy with a lot of attitude.

2189
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:57,080
But real schticky too, right?

2190
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:57,900
Yeah, yeah.

2191
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,460
There was, I highly recommend,

2192
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,380
Universal made some like viral vids starring

2193
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:07,680
local actors playing the Grinch,

2194
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,580
and there's one where, especially I liked,

2195
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,140
where the Grinch reads nice tweets,

2196
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:15,600
got an inverse of the Jimmy Kimmel bit.

2197
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,700
People have tweeted nice things to the Grinch,

2198
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,840
and he hates all of them and like mock vomits,

2199
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:26,440
and one makes him so sick that he says like,

2200
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:29,360
somebody get me a glass of motor oil

2201
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,300
filled with broken glass.

2202
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:38,140
Which I like, I like a rude guy who eats inedible things.

2203
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,820
Egg shell pie, please.

2204
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:42,800
Dead is good stew.

2205
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:43,760
Yeah, that's something.

2206
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:48,900
Give me a carton of light bulbs already, jeez.

2207
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:53,060
That voice by the way is like, what is it?

2208
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:53,740
Yeah.

2209
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,140
All these actors have had to learn this,

2210
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:58,620
I was appraising it as kind of like,

2211
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,680
sort of like Jimmy Durante.

2212
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:01,520
Yeah.

2213
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:02,500
Cha cha.

2214
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:05,540
Yeah, does he have, has anyone watched an interview

2215
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:07,140
with Jim Carrey where he says like,

2216
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:10,420
oh I put Jimmy Durante together with

2217
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:11,860
McGruff the crime dog.

2218
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:14,260
Oh, it is like McGruff, absolutely.

2219
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,600
When we're talking McGruff, like it's kind of this.

2220
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,960
But it's a little more like,

2221
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,660
rocks in the mouth or something.

2222
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,600
I bet McGruff would also,

2223
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:23,500
McGruff would probably take a bite

2224
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,460
out of the cat in the hat.

2225
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,360
I'll take a bite out of him.

2226
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:31,240
Sometimes I gotta take the law into my own hands.

2227
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,280
Unruly cat was not given permission to enter.

2228
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,840
Home invader, home invader.

2229
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,660
This is, I just decided now where you have

2230
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:41,060
to eventually do the Patreon about the songs

2231
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:43,660
that McGruff does that you tipped me off on

2232
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:44,540
to a few months ago.

2233
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:45,040
Yes.

2234
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,400
Because I listen to them still a couple times a month.

2235
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:50,560
This is a McGruff album is what Mike's referring to.

2236
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:51,340
A couple of them.

2237
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,000
Yeah.

2238
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,140
You think you told me about one

2239
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,240
and then I found another one.

2240
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:54,900
Oh wow.

2241
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,800
There's like a Pizza Hut tie in,

2242
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:59,080
a separate McGruff album.

2243
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,940
And they're all about not doing drugs.

2244
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,340
So we'll do a Patreon only.

2245
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,000
Catchier songs.

2246
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:04,780
Good songs.

2247
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:05,460
Yeah, yeah.

2248
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:07,460
I know how to play them now on keyboard.

2249
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,580
Particularly, well I found out about it

2250
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:13,060
from the Beyond Yacht Rock podcast I'm a big fan of.

2251
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,100
And there's a McGruff song that is like,

2252
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:19,540
legitimately good attempt at Steely Dan style.

2253
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:19,960
Oh yeah.

2254
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:21,560
That is about alcohol abuse.

2255
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:22,560
Is it called alcohol?

2256
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:23,560
I think so.

2257
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:27,260
Alcohol will make you sick.

2258
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:31,240
My favorite two are Make Your Body Last and Inhalence.

2259
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:34,320
Don't do inhalence.

2260
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,800
They'll suffer in your brain.

2261
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,320
And the kids choir in all of them.

2262
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,320
See I reach for notes.

2263
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:45,320
The Steely Dan one as he has to go high and go,

2264
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,260
someday.

2265
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:50,100
There's one on inhalence he's like,

2266
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,480
when some kids, other kids are taking drugs

2267
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,080
I want you to play.

2268
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:57,280
And like he could hear the effort

2269
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,920
and having to go down notes.

2270
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:02,600
So get ready for Mike's pitchfork level

2271
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,500
dissection of a McGruff song.

2272
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:06,080
Oh God, do I love those songs.

2273
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:08,560
Podcasts that write classic albums.

2274
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:12,100
I played those for Lindsey's mom and sister at Thanksgiving.

2275
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,800
Like on an instrument?

2276
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,260
No, no, no, the videos of them.

2277
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:18,140
So to go back, I forget what other episode

2278
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:18,920
we mentioned this in.

2279
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:22,020
Mr. Bojangles performance is two of them.

2280
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,020
Two different ones.

2281
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:23,500
And then the McGruff songs.

2282
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:24,120
The McGruff songs.

2283
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:25,400
Is what you offered up as.

2284
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:27,780
The Spider-Man turn off the dark letterman performance.

2285
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,980
So you're just doing like a late night comedy show.

2286
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,480
It's like found footage festival for.

2287
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,040
I think I say.

2288
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,060
Mike's twisted.

2289
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:37,100
Videos.

2290
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:38,500
Mike's twisted vids.

2291
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,980
As I said, I think they had chosen most of the movies.

2292
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,440
So like it was the last day and they're like,

2293
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,180
well, I go, well, you want to watch it?

2294
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:45,120
I don't care about anything.

2295
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:46,860
I go, I just usually watch YouTube videos.

2296
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:48,180
And they're like, well, what YouTube videos?

2297
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:50,040
And I was like, well, here we go.

2298
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:52,020
So they're doing inhalants.

2299
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,480
How'd it go over?

2300
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:55,040
They liked inhalants.

2301
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:56,320
They thought inhalants is fun.

2302
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,480
Everyone who I play inhalants for really enjoys it.

2303
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,520
And everyone at the Thanksgiving festivities

2304
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,040
dropped the inhalants that they were currently doing.

2305
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,620
Wow, Mike, you really taught us a lesson with these songs.

2306
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,220
Where were we?

2307
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:13,700
McGruff sounds like the Grinch.

2308
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:14,440
Yeah.

2309
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,320
Oh, we can't, I can't figure out the tone.

2310
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,400
The tone of it, yeah, I don't know.

2311
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,520
Gruff, Gruff but schticky.

2312
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,360
It is like much more like,

2313
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,980
he's Beetlejuice too, right?

2314
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:26,780
In a weird way.

2315
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:27,800
Kind of.

2316
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:28,320
Yeah.

2317
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,340
He's like, but I mean.

2318
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,820
Beetlejuice also eats light bulb salads, I think.

2319
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:33,060
He likes grist things.

2320
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,300
I always, it's weird because the Grinch,

2321
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,560
another of this, this just came up too.

2322
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:41,260
You have a video that you did, a very funny video,

2323
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:44,380
but the Grinch and that song,

2324
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:47,320
sung by another future Patreon episode.

2325
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:48,180
Oh yes.

2326
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:48,860
Thorell Ravenscroft.

2327
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,840
Thorell Ravenscroft, who is,

2328
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,300
as the moon climbs high over the dead oak tree.

2329
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:59,740
And then also, you're a bad banana with a

2330
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:01,820
greasy black food.

2331
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,640
Like they make the Grinch,

2332
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:05,860
they're talking about the Grinch,

2333
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:09,280
but there isn't a lot of evidence in the original cartoon

2334
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,140
or in, and I can't remember about the book,

2335
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:14,140
that he truly drinks motor oil

2336
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,960
and he enjoys all, like he eats nail clipping.

2337
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:16,880
No, he's just a miser.

2338
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,360
Lives on the outskirts of town.

2339
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:21,540
But he's like a, he's kind of like a little fancy man.

2340
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:22,500
Like he's not.

2341
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,020
Little fancy.

2342
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,720
He's not so gross.

2343
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,620
He's not so grotesque in those things.

2344
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:30,060
This did fulfill sort of the promise of the Grinch song,

2345
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:32,600
I feel like, and make the character much more grotesque

2346
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,700
and weird and aggressive.

2347
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:35,440
Am I wrong?

2348
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:36,080
Do you know what I'm saying?

2349
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,400
Yeah, yeah.

2350
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,420
Cause from the cartoon, I was never like,

2351
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:40,660
ugh, the Grinch.

2352
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,660
I was just like, oh, that's that kind of like miserly man.

2353
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:47,440
But it's a big leap that he eats, you know,

2354
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,640
that he would eat a rat fetus pizza.

2355
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:53,740
Yeah, but they kind of say it in the song of the cartoon.

2356
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:54,560
Yeah.

2357
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,400
But they don't show you that he does that.

2358
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:58,360
No, but the song is,

2359
01:31:58,900 --> 01:31:59,480
Is it all?

2360
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,840
Why did I, I made that video

2361
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:01,780
because there's this weird song,

2362
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,100
it's a type of sauce, what is it?

2363
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,140
Oh God, why can't I think of it?

2364
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:10,500
It's like, I think it's more, it's comparing him.

2365
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,740
It's about you're a rotten egg.

2366
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:13,700
Okay, right.

2367
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:14,540
In hollandaise?

2368
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,180
Mixed with a Dracula fart.

2369
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,100
So it's not, yeah, so I guess nothing in the song

2370
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:22,140
actually says he eats any of the things,

2371
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:23,720
just comparing him to the worst stuff.

2372
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:24,760
So okay, so he's standing.

2373
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:28,680
It's not saying that unless they cut a little side track,

2374
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:29,760
which he eats.

2375
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,000
So then that, I guess, makes my point better, actually,

2376
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,880
that he's sort of, it makes sense that they cast

2377
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,880
like Cumberbatch as the Grinch,

2378
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,700
even though I saw somebody just post online,

2379
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:40,440
which was a good point.

2380
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,680
Why doesn't Cumberbatch have to use his English accent?

2381
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:44,440
Yeah.

2382
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:47,400
Which he's like uses that boring Dr. Strange voice.

2383
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,800
Yeah, why would you hire him to not?

2384
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,600
The Dr. Strange voice that sounds like just so,

2385
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,040
he's got the greatest British voice,

2386
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,200
and he has this Dr. Strange voice,

2387
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,640
and it sounds like the most effort

2388
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,260
that he possibly can exert, and it's like, why?

2389
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:02,540
Why wouldn't he just be the fancy Grinch?

2390
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,240
Not required to be American.

2391
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,300
Yeah, so why isn't the Grinch just,

2392
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:10,080
Sherlock, who has such a great evil voice

2393
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,140
and not this less good American Cumberbatch voice?

2394
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,600
The snooty guy who doesn't want fun.

2395
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:16,920
By the way, what I was after was arsenic sauce.

2396
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:17,840
Oh, right, right.

2397
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:18,540
Arsenic sauce.

2398
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,140
Yeah, arsenic sauce.

2399
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,260
He does, now most of it is,

2400
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,940
if you take the stuff literally,

2401
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,900
it is, if you think, that the Grinch's brain

2402
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,980
is actually full of spiders,

2403
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,420
and that he has garlic in his soul,

2404
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,540
but it is a leap to say that he eats

2405
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,000
scrambled cockroaches every morning.

2406
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,320
Right, like the actors said.

2407
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:45,200
Yeah.

2408
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,680
So that's the take, it's the full,

2409
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:49,840
like a gross, it's gross Grinch.

2410
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:52,120
Their take is he's gross now.

2411
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:55,080
That's the difference in the Grinch's, I feel like,

2412
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:55,720
is he's gross.

2413
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,840
I'm wondering, is it possible,

2414
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:00,700
because I don't know if this is in the movie,

2415
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:04,320
but this is a screen grab from a YouTube video

2416
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,600
walking around Grinchmas in Florida, I think,

2417
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,900
and one of the Cooville residents

2418
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:12,320
has a shopping bag from Who Mart,

2419
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:16,420
and it kind of looks like the Walmart logo.

2420
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,580
Do you think he was just kind of put off

2421
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:23,740
by the capitalism, by the rampant consumerism of the season,

2422
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:27,500
and he's just retreated to Mount Crumpet

2423
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:28,640
to get away from that?

2424
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,540
Which, the Jim Carrey Grinch?

2425
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,380
Yeah, or any of them.

2426
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:34,080
I guess there's Jim Carrey one.

2427
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:36,180
But that's specifically in the Carrey-verse.

2428
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,060
Is that in the movie, Who Mart?

2429
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:39,020
I don't know, I'm just saying,

2430
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,420
if it's in the theme park version of Grinchmas,

2431
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,840
which is not the illumination,

2432
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,660
then that's just in the Jim Carrey version.

2433
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,800
But I'm saying, I don't know if it's in the Jim Carrey

2434
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,380
version, or if that's a theme park exclusive IP,

2435
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,520
like we were talking about.

2436
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:53,560
But I'm saying, because it's in the Grinchmas,

2437
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:56,020
which is in the theme parks, which is the Jim Carrey-verse,

2438
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,000
Oh, you're saying it's in that tab.

2439
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,680
that's the closest one that it's tied to canonically.

2440
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:00,360
I suppose.

2441
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:03,320
So, I think you have to say then it's in the Jim Carrey-verse

2442
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,720
and not the original or the new illumination.

2443
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:08,880
We also know from the documentary Jim and Andy

2444
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,820
that Jim Carrey goes method.

2445
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,600
And you have to wonder if during the production of this film,

2446
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:18,380
he drank motor oil with broken glass in it every day.

2447
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,220
The legend, if he did,

2448
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:22,040
I feel like we would have heard about it.

2449
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:22,420
Yeah.

2450
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:24,460
Because he would have talked about it a lot.

2451
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:25,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2452
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:26,620
He would have been so happy.

2453
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,440
There'd be a full documentary about that.

2454
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:32,600
And that's when I decided the Grinch was gonna come back

2455
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,660
and make his movie.

2456
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:37,160
He was inhabited by the Grinch.

2457
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:39,720
Isn't there a video like this?

2458
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:41,380
Or is there a different Jim Carrey movie

2459
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:42,240
that he made a parody?

2460
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:43,760
I think there's some mashup.

2461
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:47,900
There's some Grinchy implying this, essentially.

2462
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:49,440
And he really did like fires

2463
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,340
every time he played Fire Marshal Bill.

2464
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,700
Those look like fun little, you know,

2465
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:58,680
just smoke goes up and he gets charred like a Looney Tune,

2466
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:01,740
but he really lit himself on fire every single time.

2467
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:03,360
You gotta respect it.

2468
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:05,840
I have a question.

2469
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:09,280
Where does my favorite Jim Carrey verse character

2470
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,620
show up in the park?

2471
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,860
And I think the answer is nowhere.

2472
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,660
Where does Baby Grinch show up?

2473
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,420
It's a real lack of Baby Grinch.

2474
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:18,600
I noticed that too.

2475
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:22,520
I want more Baby Grinch merch.

2476
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:24,200
I wanted little doll of it.

2477
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:28,280
I was once, I did, okay, this movie is on Netflix right now

2478
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,600
and I did skip to, I went and braved specifically

2479
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,680
the Baby Grinch scenes.

2480
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:36,840
I once again stand by my assertion

2481
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,500
that saying that you like the Baby Grinch

2482
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:44,820
is a provocative opinion that cannot possibly be true.

2483
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:46,380
I do, I'm looking at it.

2484
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,700
I'm trying to like analyze what you're saying

2485
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:51,360
and to see if I can find it in my soul.

2486
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:55,480
You're staring at the hairy green baby nipple

2487
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:58,000
and trying to find how anyone could not like this.

2488
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:58,780
I like him.

2489
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,200
Hold on, I'm taking an extra.

2490
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,780
I think that this might be.

2491
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:03,280
This is his favorite.

2492
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,280
Yeah, take your phone over a little.

2493
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:06,300
How?

2494
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:07,380
If we take a photo of it.

2495
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:07,900
That's good.

2496
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,300
Mike, your brain is full of spiders.

2497
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,860
That's fair and I'm sure there's many reasons

2498
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:16,520
why it's full of spiders, but I think Baby Grinch is good.

2499
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:19,560
I've had a year, we've talked, we've, a year.

2500
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:21,760
You've had time to think about this.

2501
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,360
Nine months and I've sat on it and I mean,

2502
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,120
I get this is a little scarier, this Baby Grinch.

2503
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,680
It's the most scary thing.

2504
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:30,200
But like this one's good, this picture of him is good.

2505
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,440
I don't know what that is.

2506
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,300
I don't know what this is.

2507
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,780
Everything you're showing is not good.

2508
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:36,440
These are different.

2509
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,960
Jason, you had my back about the snouts.

2510
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,540
What do you think of Baby Grinch?

2511
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,640
You like Baby Grinch.

2512
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:44,820
I kinda like Baby Grinch.

2513
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,720
I don't like Baby Grinch with that black matte backdrop,

2514
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,820
but when he's in his little chair

2515
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:52,960
and there's some colored light shine on him.

2516
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,340
Look at Baby Grinch.

2517
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:54,820
Looks a little softer.

2518
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,400
I like him.

2519
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,860
He looks mischievous there.

2520
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,480
Why are his eyes so big?

2521
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,120
I like it.

2522
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,600
Grinch ends up with tiny little beady eyes.

2523
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,940
Why does when he's a child, why does he have big old moons?

2524
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:08,520
Somebody made like a full Baby Grinch shirt.

2525
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:09,100
No.

2526
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:11,880
Let's see how much it looks like it's $30.

2527
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:14,060
I found this picture.

2528
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:14,840
You may be aware of this.

2529
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,660
I found on Inside Universal.

2530
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:19,060
Here is just a picture without any context

2531
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,460
of the Grinch sticking his head in a garbage can.

2532
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,360
I think this is very funny.

2533
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,800
I like that a lot.

2534
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:26,620
Yeah, I left it that a lot.

2535
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:27,660
Puking or eating, it's funny.

2536
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:31,320
And Scott, I almost texted you to get me the shirt up there

2537
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,220
from the gift shop.

2538
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,200
It's the Grinch and it says King of Naughty.

2539
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:37,580
King of Naughty.

2540
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:38,960
They also have Queen of Naughty.

2541
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,960
If I ever, if I show up somewhere

2542
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:44,420
and you guys are walking up to me

2543
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:48,000
and Jason's wearing a Queen of Naughty shirt

2544
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,200
and Mike is wearing a shirt that is just the full face

2545
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,600
of the Baby Grinch, I am turning around and walking away.

2546
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,200
No questions asked.

2547
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:00,460
I don't care if we're in the front row of a concert

2548
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,580
and we paid two grand for the tickets.

2549
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:03,360
Like the Rolling Stones.

2550
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:03,960
I'm hightailing it.

2551
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:05,700
If we're in another Rolling Stones bowl,

2552
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,520
I'm walking right away.

2553
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,960
You know, we gotta, if we can get you a shirt

2554
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,980
with like Jim Carrey with half the makeup on

2555
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:16,380
and him looking in the makeup chair,

2556
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:19,020
looking a little like, oh, can you believe this?

2557
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:20,420
We can get you that shirt

2558
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:22,440
and Mike and I wear our respective shirts

2559
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:25,500
and we can rent like a convertible

2560
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,060
and drive down Sunset Boulevard.

2561
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,180
We can recreate the entourage

2562
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:31,540
and they get both Grinch shirts.

2563
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,280
In a bright green.

2564
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:36,340
In a bright green Cadillac convertible.

2565
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,200
The Grinch guys.

2566
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:40,260
The Grinch guys.

2567
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,360
Some of the year's superhero.

2568
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:44,020
That is, this is a scraping the bottom

2569
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,000
of the barrel podcast if there ever was

2570
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,140
with the full, all things Grinch with the Grinch guys.

2571
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,660
Hey, we'll maybe there sooner than later.

2572
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2573
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,800
Like, remember that, remember when you said

2574
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,860
that was a bad idea, do we still think it is?

2575
01:39:59,020 --> 01:39:59,440
No, fine.

2576
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:00,580
I guess not, let's do it.

2577
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:02,920
There's those two Grinch shows now on TV

2578
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,520
and there's two Grinch movies a year.

2579
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,480
Pretty much none of them or will,

2580
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,620
they won't use the song from the cartoon at all

2581
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:13,800
or they'll remix it in a weird way.

2582
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,720
How did they, does Jim Carrey,

2583
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:17,820
seems like it barely uses the song.

2584
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,640
I think the song is iconic.

2585
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:20,320
Sure.

2586
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:23,780
Certainly the Karloff, Boris Karloff did the narration

2587
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:25,140
and the voice of the Grinch,

2588
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:28,760
Thorol Ravenscroft did the singing about the Grinch.

2589
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:33,660
Well, my friends, I'm glad I almost forgot to bring this up.

2590
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,880
Maybe they don't make, I mean, for sure Jim Carrey

2591
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,420
performs the song and he sings it.

2592
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:39,800
You're right.

2593
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,260
I mean, that does happen.

2594
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:44,360
But they had to make room for a whole lot of other songs.

2595
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:47,320
The Grinch movie soundtrack has appearances

2596
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:50,860
from legitimately some of our favorite artists.

2597
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,640
Mike, you love Bare Naked Ladies.

2598
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,280
They sang Green Christmas.

2599
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:55,760
Good song, good Christmas song.

2600
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,740
Ben Folds is on there, Lonely Christmas Eve.

2601
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:58,960
That's a decent song too.

2602
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,580
The eels are on it.

2603
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:01,260
Wow. Really?

2604
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:04,560
Bizarre soundtrack, but let me,

2605
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:07,280
I'm not even gonna say the artist of this.

2606
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:10,080
I'm just gonna play it and I'd like for you to listen

2607
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:13,160
to the original song, the second song in the soundtrack

2608
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,700
entitled Grinch 2000.

2609
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,020
This is a Flip Mode Squad.

2610
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:20,660
Oh my God, Flip Mode Squad.

2611
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:22,400
Labo, now.

2612
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:31,860
Busta Rhymes?

2613
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:37,180
Mizzerebel is Hezl!

2614
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:45,980
Yes, Busta Rhymes. I can't tell if the other Flipmode squad is on it, but yeah, this is a Flipmode squad.

2615
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,800
Jim Carrey Collabo!

2616
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:50,680
It's listed as Busta Rhymes and Jim Carrey.

2617
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:51,280
Yeah.

2618
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:51,800
Wow.

2619
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:52,840
Finally.

2620
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:58,080
The two, the wackiest characters in their respective mediums.

2621
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:58,420
Sure.

2622
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:09,220
The clown prince of rap, Busta Rhymes. I do love Busta Rhymes. I haven't listened to that entire song, but I'm excited to learn that they have a Collabo.

2623
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:13,300
There's a Smash Mouth song on here I've never heard called Better Do It Right.

2624
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:15,540
You got N'Sync?

2625
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:16,200
It's all feels very...

2626
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,460
Faith Hill? It's a heavy hitter soundtrack.

2627
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:23,940
End of the century. End of empire feeling like so much 2000 stuff does.

2628
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:27,140
Grinch 2000 was like a bookend of...

2629
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:27,980
Simpler times.

2630
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,700
Humanity in some way.

2631
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:42,500
Grinch, it's fascinating to me. It's like doing a whole Scrooge land. Because the Grinch is like Scrooge. He's a curmudgeon that doesn't like Christmas that gets turned around. So like, has anyone ever done a Scrooge land?

2632
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,240
The Cranks land.

2633
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:46,220
The Who, Christmas with the Cranks.

2634
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:49,260
Yeah. Other Scrooges. Yeah.

2635
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:52,720
Yeah, it's time to acknowledge all of the Christmas haters.

2636
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:53,320
Mm-hmm.

2637
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:59,400
And all Fred Claus land. That also seems like something Universal would do. Just committed to Fred Claus.

2638
01:42:59,660 --> 01:43:10,260
A walk around Fred Claus still. Did you know that? Oh yeah, I didn't. Yeah, he just walks around in the New York area and like, he hassles you. But it's like, oh that's Fred Claus. I've seen that guy, but I didn't realize.

2639
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,740
He just looks like a man. He's just a regular looking guy.

2640
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:40,100
Do you guys get the feeling with like Christmas movies, new Christmas movies that aren't like, you know, cookie cutter kind of Hallmarky kind of movies? Because I know people like those and they're fun, fluff. Does it feel like with Christmas movies now everyone's trying to go like, well, Elf was a hit a dozen years ago. Maybe this could become a classic like Elf. Which I am still surprised. Yeah. Oh yeah, people apparently really love Elf.

2641
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:55,100
Well, movies take like the crater, the meteor crater that is left by a single hit movie for so long, we're still watching Hangover ripoffs way down the line. It's crazy.

2642
01:43:55,100 --> 01:44:05,020
Oh, the Hangover influences, Game Night is, you can draw the line between like the R rated comedy of that. Yeah, for sure.

2643
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:11,920
Well, that's how, because comedy hits are so rare. If one happens, hurry, scramble, it's all this now.

2644
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:17,460
Yeah, it's like The Beatles and then The Wake of the British Invasion and all the other pop bands.

2645
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:23,620
Except some of those bands are good though. Oh sure, well some of the movies that get made turn out to be okay too. I'm not saying all of them.

2646
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:28,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no that's true. Yeah, there's things that probably happen as a result of Hangover that are fine.

2647
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:36,140
Fish Out of Water Christmas movies, I don't know. Any good ones lately? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if there is.

2648
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:41,620
People seem to like that. There's a Netflix one where Kurt Russell plays Santa Claus.

2649
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:50,660
Do people like that or is that ironic? It's the novelty of like, oh look, it's fucking Kurt Russell and he's playing Santa Claus.

2650
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:54,780
I like the idea of it. I'll look at a little bit of it. Yeah, yeah.

2651
01:44:55,320 --> 01:45:04,300
Well, I should say one more thing that I did during my excursion to Whoville, which I have to step away from the mic for.

2652
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,900
Let me go grab this thing, fill the space wherever you see fit.

2653
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:14,460
Alright, I'm going to talk to Jason about eating those pancake sausages again like we did on the Tokyo episode.

2654
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:19,620
So you said three to four a week you would eat of the stick, the pancake sausage on a stick when you were a child?

2655
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:24,480
Well, it's hard to feed. You know, you got to feed kids and you got to get them dressed and on the bus to school.

2656
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:27,120
I get it. They were real easy to microwave. Sure.

2657
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:35,260
I mean, my mom would go to what was called Market Day and she would like get a lot of sort of frozen things.

2658
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:40,100
There was a thing we would have like chili crispitos and they were like weird frozen.

2659
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:43,740
But then they were like, I don't know if there were beans in them or rice.

2660
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,520
And we all hated them and she would buy them every time.

2661
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:49,760
I would just reheat them because it was an easy thing to do.

2662
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,620
Did your parents have a garage? Yeah.

2663
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:55,900
Do you have a separate fridge in there just for soda? No, but that my grandmother did.

2664
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:59,000
My grandmother had a downstairs soda fridge as well.

2665
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:06,040
All right, Scott, modern day snacks. Here we have a French donut. Oh, my goodness.

2666
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:09,560
Oh, my goodness. This is your first good deed.

2667
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:14,200
Hey, all of our hearts are going to quadruple now.

2668
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:18,960
Look at that. I think this looks good. I think like visually.

2669
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:27,380
Yeah, this is an exciting display. And hey, I got forks. Dig into the Grinch's face.

2670
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:31,540
This is a treat heavy episode. I think we're all going to vomit.

2671
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,320
But we're going to be have our heads in the trash like the Grinch.

2672
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:37,000
We should do this while we're on air, can we? I guess we can.

2673
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:40,980
People will probably hate that. So, you know, no reason to do that.

2674
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:43,940
Imagine we're eating it right now, though, but we'll be eating it after.

2675
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:48,520
We are all. I just want to stab right into the Grinch's face.

2676
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:54,560
And I think this makes me feel like, you know, when you're looking at this,

2677
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:58,840
when you're looking at a delish, that is a thick layer of green frosting.

2678
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:03,680
I think this looks fantastic. And, you know, we talk about plus it up and stuff.

2679
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:08,360
It's hard to even think about a plus up when you're staring at a dessert of this magnitude.

2680
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:11,720
It's fine. The only way it would be better is if it was a baby Grinch donut.

2681
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:15,900
Sure. This does look fun. And I have to I do it to give universal credit,

2682
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:21,440
because I remember when Grinch was like 10, 12 years ago, I thought it was all kind of thrown together a little cheap.

2683
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,920
It does seem like they have pumped more money into it.

2684
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,740
And regardless of that, I do think that Dr. Seuss curvy Christmas tree does look nice.

2685
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:38,280
I think that's fun. Absolutely. Even if Scott did not really get to see it because it's surrounded by load bearing pillars.

2686
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:42,940
People sure fighting you at every corner. Yeah.

2687
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:48,980
You know what? I had a blast. I think it's I think it's kind of funny that it's still Jim Carrey Grinch.

2688
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:52,380
Another 50 years of this. Who like? Why not? Yeah. You know what?

2689
01:47:52,380 --> 01:48:01,680
I'm feeling generous. I'm full of I'm full of duck sausage and and I'll be full of green frosting.

2690
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:09,320
The spirit of giving is here. I say great job, Universal. Thanks for donating that money.

2691
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:14,720
Thanks for duck toberfest. Hey, I feel great.

2692
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:19,100
It's the end of the year. It's the final podcast, the ride of 2018.

2693
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:26,520
And I'm full of holiday spirit. My heart. My heart's growing many, many sizes. My heart is growing as well.

2694
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:29,520
Sure. Jason's eyes are growing looking at that donut. It is.

2695
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:33,860
And thank you all out there listening. It's been a wonderful 2018.

2696
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:37,340
Thank you for all your support and your kind messages. Yes. Very nice.

2697
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:43,540
It really has. I don't want to go on about this too much, but I was into the last one we're recording in 2018.

2698
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:48,720
I was thinking about the first one that we recorded in 2018 in Mike's other apartment.

2699
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:54,120
Yeah, we had been we were network orphans. Our network had fallen apart entirely.

2700
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:58,100
It was clear that if we were going to keep doing this thing, it was going to be much more inconvenient.

2701
01:48:58,200 --> 01:48:59,940
Oh, yeah. Kind of a pain to do.

2702
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:04,300
I don't think we really talked about stopping, but it was like, oh, come on, really.

2703
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:10,640
And I think the main thing keeping us going in my mind was the fact that it's been very fun to do.

2704
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:10,940
And I think that's what it would be.

2705
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:17,220
There will be even back then there was a little base of people who I knew would be sad if we stopped doing it.

2706
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:20,980
And that base has grown like the Grinch's heart.

2707
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:29,220
And I'm so glad we kept it up because if you think about like from those from that bad 2018 start,

2708
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,140
this year has been now we're with Forever Dog. We're wonderful.

2709
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,760
We launched the second gate.

2710
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:40,940
The live show Tony Baxter, the City Walk Saga, all of this in 2018.

2711
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,440
Pretty crazy year. Yeah, really.

2712
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,920
If you put it all and stack it up like that. Yeah.

2713
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:49,700
Wow. Club 33. We get to go to Club 33. It is pretty crazy.

2714
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:54,160
We conquered fears. I wrote down. I mean, the haunts now.

2715
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:55,880
What's that? I love haunts. Yes.

2716
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:00,600
You're a haunt guy. I'm becoming the launch queen. I'm on my way.

2717
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:04,860
Jason had nothing to conquer. I got married and divorced.

2718
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:09,560
Why didn't we ever bring that up? We never talked about your brief fail.

2719
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,540
We don't have time, though. We have to wrap this up and say thank you to everyone.

2720
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:22,500
And I have the number. I want to say the number because I realized between the City Walk Saga and the second gate and the regular show.

2721
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:26,900
We in this year released 73 episodes.

2722
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:32,700
Wow. Mania. Gee whiz. What a jam packed year.

2723
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:37,500
But they were all blessed. They were all great. I had a great time.

2724
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:43,720
So many of every single one of them. Perfect. There's no error that could be taken out of a single one of them.

2725
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:49,060
Audio quality pristine. Yes. Mike cord rustling non-existent.

2726
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:52,700
Didn't have it in your head. We're leaving that in 2018 too.

2727
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:56,680
Hey, yeah, that's it. We have Mike stands now.

2728
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:01,260
Look, we were scrambling in the in the chaos of a network collapsing.

2729
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:05,660
You can have time to think about getting a stand. But we got it now.

2730
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:11,520
We're stands for stands. And I'm using that hip language now.

2731
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:19,620
No, really, this has been a great 2018 and and, you know, big stuff coming in in 2019.

2732
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:24,400
Such as an episode about McGruff.

2733
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:32,000
And I bet we'll do one about that circle of life movie in the land pavilion.

2734
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,700
Yeah. And that's that's all the ideas we have.

2735
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,180
We're very tired. It's been a big year.

2736
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:43,120
We'll figure it out. OK, don't hold us to the fire.

01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,600
You got Blizzard Beach just released.

2741
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:05,680
You'll have actually I don't remember what was just released.

2742
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:08,520
Blizzard. Well, this will all by the end of December.

2743
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:11,160
This will all be and this year, you know, the Queen Mary.

2744
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:15,620
My Tretz of the Queen Mary. Yes. And now that you know, now that we've done

2745
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:19,000
Grinchmas and Blizzard Beach, there are no more Christmas topics.

2746
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:20,220
That's it. We have run through it.

2747
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:23,020
And even that one, Blizzard Beach is a stretch of a Christmas topic.

2748
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:25,240
Yeah. More of a winter topic. Yeah.

2749
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,220
Yeah. We got to be loose with this thing.

2750
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:32,960
But we've got a lot. We've got a year now to figure out the next one and a lot of other stuff along the way.

2751
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:38,420
It's going to be great. Hey, you survived podcast, the ride 2018.

2752
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:41,540
Seventy three episodes.

2753
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:44,360
We made it.

2754
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:46,240
I feel great. It's a great year.

2755
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:50,860
Thanks, everybody, for your support and seriously for, you know, making us want want to keep doing.

2756
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:54,100
Yeah. So much encouragement. It's nice when people like a thing you're doing.

2757
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:58,360
It really is. That's right. It is everything, isn't it?

2758
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:07,140
Yeah. And hey, Mary Grinch, Mary Grinch, Mary Grinch, to us all, especially Edwin, who is sleeping on the courts.

2759
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:10,380
Mary Grinch, Mary Grinch, everybody.

2760
01:53:14,456 --> 01:53:16,496
Hi guys, it's Mike here with a quick addendum.

2761
01:53:16,936 --> 01:53:18,736
So after we finished recording this episode,

2762
01:53:18,996 --> 01:53:20,496
we got a very interesting email

2763
01:53:20,496 --> 01:53:22,296
from Universal Studios Hollywood.

2764
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:24,516
They wanted to send us to interview

2765
01:53:24,516 --> 01:53:26,376
a very important Christmas figure,

2766
01:53:26,936 --> 01:53:29,156
yes, the Grinch himself.

2767
01:53:29,296 --> 01:53:32,156
They wanted us to come out and interview the Grinch,

2768
01:53:32,336 --> 01:53:33,656
and how could we say no?

2769
01:53:33,676 --> 01:53:34,756
So we said yes.

2770
01:53:35,356 --> 01:53:37,616
Now normally we would have sent Jason Sheridan,

2771
01:53:37,696 --> 01:53:40,376
our Cub reporter, but look, it's the holidays,

2772
01:53:40,496 --> 01:53:42,036
he's already back on the East Coast

2773
01:53:42,036 --> 01:53:44,876
enjoying the holiday festivities and treats,

2774
01:53:45,756 --> 01:53:47,536
so it was up to me.

2775
01:53:47,756 --> 01:53:51,536
So I went up there and I talked to the Grinch,

2776
01:53:51,936 --> 01:53:54,096
and look, it got a little controversial

2777
01:53:54,096 --> 01:53:57,556
in regards to another host on the show.

2778
01:53:58,056 --> 01:53:59,696
He hasn't heard this yet,

2779
01:53:59,696 --> 01:54:01,936
so we're gonna have to find out his reaction

2780
01:54:01,936 --> 01:54:04,016
in a couple episodes probably.

2781
01:54:04,616 --> 01:54:07,796
But you are about to hear my interview

2782
01:54:07,796 --> 01:54:11,076
with the man himself, the Grinch,

2783
01:54:11,196 --> 01:54:12,896
the one who stole Christmas.

2784
01:54:14,096 --> 01:54:15,396
We have video of this too,

2785
01:54:15,696 --> 01:54:18,316
because I'm not gonna, it got cut off a little bit

2786
01:54:18,316 --> 01:54:19,996
is what I'm trying to say with the video,

2787
01:54:20,296 --> 01:54:22,696
but you can see most of the interview on our Twitter

2788
01:54:22,696 --> 01:54:24,816
and probably on our Facebook page.

2789
01:54:25,216 --> 01:54:27,816
It's very good, it's probably the best viewed

2790
01:54:27,816 --> 01:54:29,796
in a video and not just audio,

2791
01:54:30,116 --> 01:54:33,116
but also there's a video, I met the Grinch's dog Max.

2792
01:54:33,616 --> 01:54:36,696
So look, I was doing a lot of good journalism

2793
01:54:36,696 --> 01:54:39,856
and good in-depth interviews,

2794
01:54:39,856 --> 01:54:43,916
and please enjoy this little addendum

2795
01:54:43,916 --> 01:54:46,636
to the Grinch episode,

2796
01:54:47,256 --> 01:54:50,636
Mike Carlson's interview with the Grinch.

2797
01:54:55,288 --> 01:54:57,388
Hello, Mr. Grinch, I'm here, yes.

2798
01:54:58,408 --> 01:54:58,948
It's a pleasure.

2799
01:54:59,068 --> 01:54:59,968
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Grinch.

2800
01:55:00,148 --> 01:55:01,728
Oh, of course, thank you for coming.

2801
01:55:01,728 --> 01:55:01,948
Thank you.

2802
01:55:01,968 --> 01:55:04,908
My name is Mike Carlson, I'm from Podcast the Ride.

2803
01:55:05,688 --> 01:55:06,568
Podcast the Ride?

2804
01:55:06,588 --> 01:55:08,528
It's a theme park podcast.

2805
01:55:08,708 --> 01:55:09,468
Like the radio?

2806
01:55:09,728 --> 01:55:13,388
It's like the radio, but I guess it's worse, probably, because less people hear it.

2807
01:55:13,488 --> 01:55:14,748
Oh, that's disappointing.

2808
01:55:14,888 --> 01:55:18,508
But I mean, there's a small but very, like, excited fan base.

2809
01:55:18,508 --> 01:55:19,148
Oh, perfect.

2810
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,928
So that's good, and they're very excited.

2811
01:55:21,008 --> 01:55:21,708
There are 10, 13 people.

2812
01:55:21,788 --> 01:55:25,268
At least 13 people listen, and they're going to be very excited about this interview.

2813
01:55:25,868 --> 01:55:28,808
So I just have a few questions for you.

2814
01:55:29,608 --> 01:55:33,368
What does it mean to you to have a holiday named after you, the Grinch?

2815
01:55:33,728 --> 01:55:36,768
Wow, yeah, well, being a celebrity is really a big responsibility.

2816
01:55:36,868 --> 01:55:42,728
Having a whole holiday named after me, it fills me with complete disgust.

2817
01:55:42,768 --> 01:55:45,368
They want to commercialize me, and I do not approve.

2818
01:55:45,528 --> 01:55:47,748
Do you know, I don't get enough royalties for this!

2819
01:55:49,108 --> 01:55:50,608
That's a breaking coverage right there.

2820
01:55:50,888 --> 01:55:52,428
Well, yeah, hey, I understand that.

2821
01:55:52,428 --> 01:55:55,248
We don't get royalties for a podcast either, so like, yeah.

2822
01:55:55,248 --> 01:55:56,008
Do it, Mark!

2823
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:57,588
It's fun, I guess.

2824
01:55:57,628 --> 01:55:58,468
It's Mike also.

2825
01:55:58,508 --> 01:55:59,288
It's okay, though.

2826
01:55:59,728 --> 01:56:00,468
Okay, Paul, whatever you say.

2827
01:56:00,648 --> 01:56:01,488
Anything is fine.

2828
01:56:02,208 --> 01:56:05,068
You know, you seem like you're a bit of a grump sometimes,

2829
01:56:05,068 --> 01:56:06,948
but have you made any friends here at Universal Studios,

2830
01:56:07,228 --> 01:56:10,348
like with the famous Universal characters like Transformers or Lucille Ball?

2831
01:56:10,808 --> 01:56:12,568
I don't know what you're talking about, Peter.

2832
01:56:12,908 --> 01:56:16,468
What I make friends with is who I already have, my friend Max.

2833
01:56:16,468 --> 01:56:17,388
Have you met Max yet?

2834
01:56:17,568 --> 01:56:18,748
I have not met Max.

2835
01:56:18,768 --> 01:56:19,588
I'm excited to.

2836
01:56:19,588 --> 01:56:20,428
He's just sitting there.

2837
01:56:20,648 --> 01:56:22,428
You don't need another friend, man.

2838
01:56:22,628 --> 01:56:24,668
All you need is man's best friend.

2839
01:56:25,828 --> 01:56:26,128
His dog.

2840
01:56:26,588 --> 01:56:28,108
And possibly Mothermay.

2841
01:56:28,628 --> 01:56:29,208
Wow!

2842
01:56:29,728 --> 01:56:30,688
Yes, yes.

2843
01:56:30,808 --> 01:56:31,228
Woo!

2844
01:56:31,408 --> 01:56:33,808
I'm very excited to meet all the people from Whoville.

2845
01:56:34,328 --> 01:56:34,908
Wait, Mothermay too?

2846
01:56:34,908 --> 01:56:35,788
Look, she's taken, man.

2847
01:56:35,788 --> 01:56:36,288
Back up.

2848
01:56:36,508 --> 01:56:37,608
Okay, well, I wasn't actually.

2849
01:56:37,648 --> 01:56:38,868
There's no, like, sort of thing.

2850
01:56:38,968 --> 01:56:39,528
I was...

2851
01:56:39,528 --> 01:56:40,908
There's not a thing between, is there anything?

2852
01:56:41,008 --> 01:56:42,348
Yeah, I know, because she's with me.

2853
01:56:42,468 --> 01:56:42,968
This guy.

2854
01:56:43,428 --> 01:56:45,008
Okay, well, I just want to say, yes.

2855
01:56:45,048 --> 01:56:46,148
You guys have a good time.

2856
01:56:46,168 --> 01:56:47,408
I won't even talk to her, you know?

2857
01:56:47,588 --> 01:56:48,168
I won't even...

2858
01:56:48,168 --> 01:56:49,108
I would appreciate that.

2859
01:56:49,108 --> 01:56:50,308
Thank you so much, James.

2860
01:56:50,488 --> 01:56:53,568
So, yeah, as far as, like, just being here at Universal,

2861
01:56:53,568 --> 01:56:55,768
have you made it out to City Walk or anything,

2862
01:56:55,928 --> 01:56:58,128
or are you just kind of stuck here talking to folks all day?

2863
01:56:58,388 --> 01:57:00,308
Have you not seen the chain around my ankle?

2864
01:57:00,548 --> 01:57:01,568
No, I can't go anywhere.

2865
01:57:01,608 --> 01:57:03,548
They don't let me go 10 feet out of this space.

2866
01:57:03,748 --> 01:57:04,488
Okay, well that...

2867
01:57:04,488 --> 01:57:06,448
No, I haven't been anywhere else.

2868
01:57:06,608 --> 01:57:07,148
Okay.

2869
01:57:07,508 --> 01:57:09,128
I know, and so does the boarding.

2870
01:57:09,348 --> 01:57:12,448
There's a great Margaritaville restaurant that if you get done with Grinch-erence,

2871
01:57:12,468 --> 01:57:13,188
I think you should go.

2872
01:57:13,328 --> 01:57:14,648
Wait, explain to me of Margaritaville.

2873
01:57:14,668 --> 01:57:15,108
What is this?

2874
01:57:15,128 --> 01:57:15,808
Is this a town?

2875
01:57:16,188 --> 01:57:16,888
Well, it is.

2876
01:57:16,888 --> 01:57:17,588
It's kind of a place.

2877
01:57:17,608 --> 01:57:20,608
It's a state of mind, really, but it's a restaurant where you can have a margarita

2878
01:57:20,608 --> 01:57:22,428
and, like, a wet burrito or something.

2879
01:57:22,428 --> 01:57:23,168
It's very delicious.

2880
01:57:23,168 --> 01:57:23,908
You should try it.

2881
01:57:24,048 --> 01:57:25,028
Wet burrito.

2882
01:57:25,528 --> 01:57:26,648
Sounds sloppy and delicious.

2883
01:57:26,708 --> 01:57:27,448
Right on my alley.

2884
01:57:27,588 --> 01:57:29,108
Yeah, so when you're done, you might...

2885
01:57:29,108 --> 01:57:30,948
Maybe we'll all go and get one after this.

2886
01:57:30,948 --> 01:57:31,868
Ooh, you're not kidding me?

2887
01:57:31,868 --> 01:57:32,548
I am, yes.

2888
01:57:32,648 --> 01:57:35,088
All right, we have to devise an escape plan to get me out of here.

2889
01:57:35,208 --> 01:57:36,868
Yeah, well, I'll figure it out after this.

2890
01:57:37,748 --> 01:57:39,428
And just to wrap up real quick, on our podcast,

2891
01:57:39,508 --> 01:57:41,768
we often have a debate about the Grinch,

2892
01:57:41,808 --> 01:57:44,768
and specifically you as a baby.

2893
01:57:45,348 --> 01:57:48,168
There are a lot of pictures of you online,

2894
01:57:48,188 --> 01:57:51,088
and it's very cute.

2895
01:57:51,508 --> 01:57:52,548
I think you're cute.

2896
01:57:52,648 --> 01:57:54,088
I think you were a cute...

2897
01:57:54,088 --> 01:57:54,968
Yes, I am cute.

2898
01:57:55,088 --> 01:57:56,588
Yes, I agree with that statement.

2899
01:57:56,848 --> 01:57:58,688
Okay, so basically I just want you to solve the problem.

2900
01:57:58,828 --> 01:57:59,508
Are you cute?

2901
01:57:59,588 --> 01:58:02,128
I think, yes, Baby Grinch is very cute.

2902
01:58:02,408 --> 01:58:03,368
Well, who's...

2903
01:58:03,368 --> 01:58:04,668
All right, I want the names.

2904
01:58:04,768 --> 01:58:05,548
List them out for me.

2905
01:58:05,668 --> 01:58:06,788
Who thinks I'm not cute?

2906
01:58:06,908 --> 01:58:11,188
Well, my co-host, Scott Gardner, says Baby Grinch isn't so cute,

2907
01:58:11,228 --> 01:58:12,688
and I disagree with him.

2908
01:58:12,948 --> 01:58:15,008
Oh, okay, where's a baby picture of Scott?

2909
01:58:15,008 --> 01:58:17,728
Because I bet he's not that cute either.

2910
01:58:17,908 --> 01:58:18,288
Oh.

2911
01:58:18,308 --> 01:58:21,668
Well, look, next year I will bring Scott's baby picture,

2912
01:58:21,828 --> 01:58:22,888
and I'll show it to you.

2913
01:58:23,008 --> 01:58:24,328
What do you think is a baby picture?

2914
01:58:24,548 --> 01:58:25,528
I think he's cute too.

2915
01:58:25,588 --> 01:58:27,708
I think you and Scott as babies are cute.

2916
01:58:27,928 --> 01:58:30,208
Oh, so just a general, oh, baby's a cute thing?

2917
01:58:30,708 --> 01:58:31,728
Yeah, I like babies.

2918
01:58:31,908 --> 01:58:33,488
Thank you so much, Mr. Grinch.

2919
01:58:33,768 --> 01:58:34,128
Oh, thank you.

2920
01:58:34,208 --> 01:58:35,428
We say at the end of a podcast,

2921
01:58:35,888 --> 01:58:38,688
you, Mr. Grinch, you've just survived Podcast the Ride.

2922
01:58:39,368 --> 01:58:40,128
Hooray!

2923
01:58:40,268 --> 01:58:41,988
Wait, did you want me to say that?

2924
01:58:42,028 --> 01:58:42,868
Oh, you could say it too.

2925
01:58:42,928 --> 01:58:43,748
Yeah, let's do that.

2926
01:58:44,388 --> 01:58:47,508
You've just survived Podcast the Ride.

2927
01:58:47,588 --> 01:58:49,508
Pretty good. Thank you so much.

2928
01:58:49,828 --> 01:58:50,848
Pretty good. That was fantastic.

2929
01:58:51,048 --> 01:58:53,268
Amazing. That's what I meant to say.

2930
01:58:53,388 --> 01:58:54,288
Thank you, Mike.

2931
01:58:54,428 --> 01:58:55,068
It was a pleasure.

2932
01:58:55,148 --> 01:58:56,968
Oh, I love your padded coat.

2933
01:58:57,068 --> 01:58:58,628
Oh, thank you. I like your coat too.

2934
01:58:58,648 --> 01:58:59,348
See, there's the juices here.

2935
01:58:59,408 --> 01:59:00,008
Yeah.

2936
01:59:00,528 --> 01:59:01,288
