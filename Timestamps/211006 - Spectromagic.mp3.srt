1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Welcome to the Splendor, the Spectacle, the Sparkling Sensation, the second gate of podcast,

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the Ride, where today we talk SpectroMagic.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hi.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hi, I'm here, yes, and we're talking about SpectroMagic.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We're talking about SpectroMagic, and that gives me the question,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
how does the third host feel about this, Jason Sheridan, today's topic, SpectroMagic?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh, I'm not thrilled.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The week of my birth, the week of my birthday.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, right.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You have to share the week.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Early October is associated with joy for you, but fright for others.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And now Spectromen could be lurking around any quarter.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So when birthday season rolls around, when the weather starts to feel that way,

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
you should be elated, but instead you're worried these guys could pop out from a bush or something.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I am worried that a glowing ball is just going to spin right out,

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
fresh out of the kingdom of light-spiration and get my ass.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Are you concerned that an Ellen-style prank is about to be pulled on you?

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That perhaps Scott and I, or I, have arranged a couple men to dress up as...

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, they were sent back to hell.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They were sent back to hell by the Florida Elements.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I know they're not walking back in.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay. I'm just saying, had you thought of it.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not saying it's happening because it's not happening.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, yeah.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Certainly not.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Really is not.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There's no one.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're in the garage still.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The garage door is open.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Your back is to the alley here, so you wouldn't even be able to see if they came behind or to the side.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You would kind of get a good glimpse of them coming in the door here.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I hadn't considered that possibility.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And now I'm wondering if the open door is like a red herring.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If that's a trick to draw my attention.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I thought this was safety for COVID purposes, but in fact, it's made you quite unsafe in another way.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a long con.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I've been feeding you information about COVID numbers for weeks to make you think that us recording in the garage was for safety,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
when possibly it was just to have, I don't know, let's say, Evan Susser come from behind you dressed as a Dolphi Spectro man.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Or the lesser Mime Spectro man faces.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sure.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
In the second run.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's a question if it's lesser.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't know.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Before we get too far here, what we're talking about, this is an old, no longer with us parade from the Disney World Resort.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This was at the Magic Kingdom, and we're doing it because we're still in the birthday week.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World, but it is the 30th anniversary of this parade, which was done for the 20th anniversary.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And they throw a lot of math your way right at the top.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And not just math, but also a little bit of a twist because while this parade is essentially, if you don't know it, it is a nighttime parade, a light sparkling parade that was kind of a replacement for the Main Street Electrical Parade.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And that's all fun.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We'll talk about what's good about that and the score and the nice things about it.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But you may have heard us talk about it on the show before because this parade features who Jason has dubbed a group of people who he has dubbed the Dolphi Spectro man.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, Dolphi is a descriptor.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Spectra man is the official company term.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, that's what out there.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Dolphi, I think you put on it and it's accurate.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And if you haven't seen what we're talking about, you should look at probably the art that we're putting up.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sure we'll be tweeting Dolphi Spectrum and shit all day.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But the main thing that I'm driving at before we get too far is that if you thought this was just a regular second game in October, you thought wrong.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is a sneak attack.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Just like maybe is coming for Jason.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is a special all of a sudden surprise haunt cast the Fright hit the music.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, yep.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yep.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Wow.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How could it not like you didn't even know it was coming.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Everybody probably jumped out of your chairs listening to that.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right. Well, I think they did.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They were they were like a regular episode at the start of October.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I guess so because it's the first week.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So but then yeah, then they were like really scared.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now they're double scared because we were you know, we're teasing that some person is going to jump out and jump scare Jason.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a trick and got to retreat.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So you guys all at home got jump scared in your own way by a different theme.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They're probably all still coming down from it.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Probably the heartbeats are kind of returning to a normal rate.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So we'll try to not hit you with anything too crazy.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Just let you like give you a second to calm down before the next big.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What if we just played the theme again?

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What if you never this is a very scary theme.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We could just drop it in nine times in the episode.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I guess we really can do whatever we want.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So I could just say I call for the regular theme again.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Just kidding. This is a regular episode.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And then I could cut right to the original theme.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Constant redistricting.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah. These episodes kind of like gerrymandering them into different make it pink.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Make it blue as well.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Perhaps maybe I declare you know what?

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is not honk.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is the regular second gate.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Patreon could do anything we want.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Really?

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Send it right back to where it started.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You could say that it's technically part of the city walk saga.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You could you could cut 10 minutes that then gets uploaded to the main feed.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So everyone's got to hop over there.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Listen to 10 minutes and then come back.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Wow.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's a level of complication I really admire that we would say stop.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Go to the main feed.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Then now come back.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So do the inconvenient obstacle of like doing like three swipes on a smartphone.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh, OK.

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Pull down. Refresh.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
OK.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All right.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
There we go.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That. Yeah.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So it's a little like podcast scavenger hunt.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So yeah.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Prepare for anything is what I'm saying.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Like in and during the show I go, Jason, look out.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That was my that was clearly a Mike genuine attempts to do that.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But that did not work.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You didn't fall for that.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No, I didn't sell it enough.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But now it's going to be a boy who cried wolf situation where if, for example, a literal wolf walked through this alleyway and I can't say that I haven't now I haven't seen a coyote in these parts for a while.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But coyotes got bad enough in this area that they did start putting up signs telling you what to do.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
A coyote. The word the term is hazing.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're just supposed to yell like, oh, hey, stop.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Get out of here.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So I'll teach you that right now.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But anyway, just like because you're preparing Jason for whatever, there could be a genuine danger.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's good.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Now nobody's ready for.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, that's true.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That is true.

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I believe those signs have the website coyote hazing dot com on them.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Cool.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, it's like if you were not some dating site or something.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And I'm forgetting I meant to look that up because I was like, wait, am I supposed to haze them or not supposed to?

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Because some wildlife there like don't bother them.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But coyotes.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, I've seen lots of coyotes living out here.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There's a lot.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We've had run ins with them multiple times.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And I haze them.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I make them. I make the coyote feel bad about themselves.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, I really like you.

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What are you doing here?

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No one wants you here.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No one likes your personality.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's stuff I say to the coyote.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You stink even from across the street.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Your fur looks matted, dude.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sorry.

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Decide if you're a dog or a wolf.

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Pick one.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Pick a lane.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Until then, go pick a gutter and crawl in it.

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hey, it's the only way to keep safe is to be mean to the coyotes.

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So that's why I have to do it.

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah, you got to.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You got a dog to save.

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah, exactly.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It is when I'm walking a dog.

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes, I'm walking a dog.

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It could be entirely a close call episode.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But yeah, for now, the only thing we have to fear are the Dolphi Spectrum and themselves.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
How do we set the stage?

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What's the minimum that we need to say about this parade before we just start talking about the Dolphi Spectrum?

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's the sequel to the original.

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm losing my mind.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The East Street Electrical Parade.

176
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Jesus Christ.

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah, you consider it a sequel?

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't you think? Kind of?

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I mean, they don't say like it's...

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Not narratively.

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, they don't put a two next to it, but it is like the...

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's in a lineage of nighttime colorful light parades.

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'd say it's only the second colorful night parade in Disney history because I think it was the first time that one was replaced.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Now it's happened a bunch of times and like other parks get new custom.

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You have your paint the nights and things.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There's not the pressure on it that there used to be.

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But this was like originally it was like replacing SNL cast.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Now we know what happens all the time, but the first few the pressure was on.

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Spectrum Magic, I think did pretty well.

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's more of like a Murphy Piscopo era.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Light Magic clearly was a Gene DeManey and Denny Dillon kind of like...

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, of course.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Really quicks to cancel almost immediately.

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

197
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, it could have ruined...

198
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Night Parade as SNL cast.

199
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, could have ruined Night Parades for a long time, but just narrowly escaped and they got back together.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They got back together, yeah.

201
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, so it's...

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What is it?

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
20 years combined it lasted?

204
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Or balance?

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Under, because there's a gap in there.

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, but I think it was...

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What is it?

208
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's from like 1991 to...

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
2010?

210
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
2010, I believe.

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But with a gap sizable enough to eliminate...

212
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't think I know how long the gaps were.

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The gap was about two years because for the Millennium Celebration, they brought back the Main Street Electrical Parade.

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And then when that ended the next day, Spectre Magic was back.

215
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay.

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And then they were replaced, they sent the Main Street Electrical Parade to Paris.

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's why it originally...

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
From Florida, yeah.

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, the Florida version got shipped over to Paris so they could open with that.

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Leaving a slide and leaving them with something special to do for the 20th anniversary.

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Which I gotta say, speaking of special things for these anniversaries, we were kinda being flippant about the 50th anniversary beacons of lights that all of the...

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Is that what they... magical beacons?

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Something beacons.

225
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Magic beacons.

226
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Magic beacons.

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We're saying maybe that that could be stupid, but everybody see that Epcot?

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That Epcot thing looks awesome.

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Really good.

230
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, very good.

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Hope that never goes away.

232
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah, that should just be a permanent.

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Which you might.

235
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If you haven't seen, they put up like... I mean, it's projection effects and lighting effects, but then also kinda like in between the panels, they put like a bunch of balls in.

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a big ball and they put a bunch of balls in.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah.

238
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There's color patterns and then there's like twinkling lights and then there's like wavy light.

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Like it does a lot.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It does quite a bit.

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It can like slowly change the gradient, I feel like.

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes.

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah.

244
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a very subtle grade, yeah.

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Surprisingly so.

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It felt very like digital for being an old analog.

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah.

248
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But in the ballpark from how Spaceship Earth has been lit before, in the ballpark of like those orange, pink, purple kind of color schemes that were part of Epcot forever and part of like a lot of the Epcot color schemes.

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So it's like, it all makes sense.

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah.

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I feel like sometimes we bristle at some of the more recent developments where like, what?

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
How did it make this make sense?

253
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But like this is like right in the ballpark.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Also, the monorails.

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, that looks great too.

256
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Are glowing on the track, like glowing the color of the monorail underneath.

257
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Like...

258
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They kept that one quiet.

259
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's some easy, that's some great easy shit they should have done 10, 20 years ago.

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It looks so cool.

261
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

262
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's like, you do that like on the back of your TV or something, you know?

263
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
There's guys racing in Burbank that have that under their car.

264
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That technology has been around.

265
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

266
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So that's cool.

267
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Everyone was trashing Harmonious.

268
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I heard that.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Seemingly.

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Said it wasn't great.

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Almost everyone I saw said that.

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But then all that light stuff.

273
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Everyone was like, yes, sir.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah, it seems like the thing that isn't an official show everybody loved and the thing that is an official show that's been building weird, ugly barges for a long time.

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That was a...

276
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I felt like a real lame...

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I felt like I disappointed this, maybe a person or two when I was down there with this bachelor party group who don't have things memorized as I do.

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And there were people who pointed at those barges like, what's that ride?

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And I had to say, that is not a ride.

280
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That is infrastructure for a show that's not going to be here for months.

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And then I watch a face droop and walk away from me.

282
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's like I said, Santa wasn't real.

283
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It would have been better if you said, I don't know.

284
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah.

285
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Because then first of all, you let them down with no ride.

286
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And then second of all, how did you know that?

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Why would you know that?

288
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah.

289
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So two things were disappointing.

290
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I didn't say...

291
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I think the only way I escaped with any dignity is that I didn't say why that's for Harmonious.

292
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Nighttime spectacle coming to Epcot.

293
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Replacing Epcot forever.

294
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Let me describe that show for you.

295
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's the tradition of illuminations, which is kind of just like celebration, like a global celebration.

296
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The worst.

297
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It gets sucked in the stomach.

298
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well.

299
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I only ever half saw Epcot forever because I think we were at Epcot like two nights.

300
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And the second night I just caught like the tail end.

301
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And the very first time I saw it, I think I was with you, Mike.

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We were by wherever some pyro went off.

303
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And the winds and the smoke.

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I mostly saw smoke.

305
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll say that.

306
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I do not see a lot of the kite effects.

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah, it was OK.

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It was OK.

309
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I wanted more.

310
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It didn't feel as Epcot as I wanted it.

311
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It didn't feel like it's history of Epcot as it should have.

312
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah.

313
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's like a little like imagination song.

314
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But, you know, come on.

315
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah.

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's go hard here.

317
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I feel like I skipped the genre.

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I haven't seen one of those in a while.

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But Spectra Magic does take me back to when I did watch these things.

320
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And I do clearly remember watching this on my first visit.

321
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah.

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And enjoying it.

323
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah, sure.

324
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll show you that at the top.

325
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The scariness and the creepiness of the characters in this did not really register with me at the time.

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Of course, now when I look back with photographs, it's undeniable.

327
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They're horrifying.

328
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, but same way.

329
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
When I saw this the first time, I wasn't like, I was like, oh, cool.

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There's lights.

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And I was not scared by it.

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And that was this is coming from a person who was scared of half of everything at Disney World the first two times he went.

333
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, just like random vehicles, trams, a crowded bus.

334
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes.

335
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The main street, a certain corridor of Main Street, certain corner of Main Street.

336
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I would be frightened by it because the lighting was bad or that I didn't like the paint.

337
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah.

338
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
This is how scared I was.

339
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
A little dim around here.

340
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Exactly.

341
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So yeah, no, it didn't register at all to me.

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So yeah, when you were talking about your fear of the doll face spectrum and when we looked it up, obviously I was like, oh, I did not register that at all.

343
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I think it was just a matter of I would have seen this.

344
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
First of all, this would have been my first nighttime parade.

345
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I saw this before the Main Street Electrical Parade.

346
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.

347
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I think I'm sure I did too.

348
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm pretty sure.

349
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah.

350
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So we definitely like for a long time, basically until like my family took a long trip back when we were older, when I was older, I had kind of mushed the two together in my mind.

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And then when they started redoing the Main Street Electrical Parade out here at Disneyland.

352
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But my family, when I was like in first grade, took a big trip with my grandparents as well.

353
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And that was November 91.

354
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So this this was a month old.

355
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It was all over the in-room TV channels.

356
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It was all over like the VHS vacation tape that I probably like watched a bunch before we went.

357
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And I was just like, what are what are these guys?

358
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Who are these guys?

359
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't like these guys.

360
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Are you aware of them before you went?

361
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You think I don't see them between or like maybe from like Disney Adventure or Disney magazine?

362
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Like they there's all the postcard, all the still photos promoting this have Mickey surrounded by the spectrum.

363
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And I'm just like, what is happening to me?

364
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What are these men done to Mickey?

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We need to make it awesome, by the way.

366
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
He looks great in this.

367
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah, we need to find some promotional material to see if we can find exactly what a young Jason Sheridan may have seen.

368
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, there's plenty of postcards for sale on eBay.

369
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Like you can see the general, but yeah, there are Disney Adventure articles.

370
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I have some of my old adventures.

371
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I have a lot of those.

372
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So maybe I maybe there's something I have old Disney.

373
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I found some old Disney magazines, but I think they're from later.

374
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I think from like ninety four, ninety five.

375
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So the hype train for Spectro Magic was at ninety one.

376
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I mean, like a piece of footage where one was right up in the camera or something and then like stepped out of the way, revealing some stuff, a sort of like Cirque du Soleil type.

377
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You know what I mean?

378
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Cirque du Soleil promotional footage.

379
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It'll start with somebody with creepy makeup, like blowing a bunch of confetti and then and then ducking out of the way like a low angle shot of like somebody like putting their face in the camera.

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah, like something like that.

381
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah, I think maybe some there must have been some reveal that was mildly disturbing again to fully contextualize this for anybody who doesn't know.

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I would say that in general this parade was yeah, it's like the Main Street Electrical Parade, but like more advanced in certain ways.

383
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's got this like wonderful waltzy music vibe that I think the score people really enjoy.

384
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Some of the lighting effects are a little more sophisticated.

385
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Just in general, yeah, it's kind of like in some ways advanced, maybe like less charmingly rinky dink version of the Main Street Electrical Parade.

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And that's that for the most part, because a lot of it is just what you expect from these parades.

387
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You see scenes from movies, but rendered in minimally and with lights.

388
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So it's odd that what it begins with is this strange otherworldly little scenario with these characters you've never met before and an implied mythology that makes no sense.

389
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yeah, right.

390
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
These weird little creeps.

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And it's the first like quarter of the parade.

392
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah, are these guys and I think that was my overall impression of Spectre Magic is I really like it.

393
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I like the music.

394
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I like the parade.

395
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah, the something like six hundred thousand lights on this.

396
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And it is like you were saying a technological upgrade over the Main Street Electrical Parade.

397
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But I after I saw the first time as a kid, like a first couple of times, I was like, OK, they go away after the first few minutes.

398
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And then they're gone.

399
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
They don't come back.

400
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And then it's just my friends like they go away and they they don't.

401
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Really, I was just had a very over act.

402
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I was a very nervous child and I have an overactive imagination that adult should have just taken me aside and said, hey, listen, it behooves theme parks to not threaten or kill their guests.

403
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So these people aren't going to hurt you.

404
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
These doll men are not going to hurt you.

405
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That would do you think you expressed your fear of the doll men to your parents?

406
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I think they probably could tell I was like on like vibrate like uncomfortable.

407
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Like I knew I was being a little silly, but I was like, I just don't like these guys.

408
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And then later on in life, the purge movies have those kind of masks, too.

409
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh, yes.

410
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Similar. Yeah.

411
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Some of those in a Halloween store several hours ago.

412
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And yes, as I stare at the spectrum and it is very purgy.

413
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, that's I never even thought about the purging.

414
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It is funny as a kid, because you because when you're scared, generally kids don't they try to like not lie their way through it or something or pretend they're not scared.

415
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Because like the my my story with Alien encounter where I was so excited about it, but then when we was there and it was soft opening and I was like, we had a chance to go on and I was like, oh, yeah.

416
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, is it open? Oh, like I was just like trying to like get out of saying like, I'm scared.

417
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
No, that's embarrassing.

418
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's embarrassing to do.

419
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But then eventually I have to be like, I don't want to go on it.

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, but as meekly as possible, you're the most backed into it.

421
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Right.

422
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I try to say everything but this.

423
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Are they sure they're letting little kids go on it?

424
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Are you sure they're not destined for older people?

425
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Well, they actually definitely let little kids go on it.

426
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And then they had to put up a lot more warnings like we can't not let you on this because it's a pretty easy like not danger.

427
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You're not going to get whipped around.

428
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Sure.

429
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But maybe don't like I bet my grades aren't good enough.

430
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
They probably check your report card.

431
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Right.

432
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I did get that one B.

433
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, I'm not.

434
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm wearing.

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh, I'm wearing shorts.

436
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I think I read in Disney Adventure.

437
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You had to wear pants in there because like there's like there's mosquitos.

438
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They lose a bunch of mosquitoes and you really should be wearing pants.

439
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm pretty sure the one with hammer and goofy on the cover.

440
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's what they said in Disney Adventure.

441
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So I can't do it.

442
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I can't go on Alien.

443
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Probably you shouldn't go in there either, Mom.

445
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm looking out for your legs, too.

446
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah.

447
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I always see them get nipped up.

448
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We don't need to get bitten.

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We really don't.

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The can we say the actual narrative of like who the Spectral Men are in the narrative of the ride?

451
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I would I would love to do that.

452
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And I don't want to take away from anyone the chance to say the story yourselves.

453
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I just want to play this quick thing.

454
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

455
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Because and you might have stumbled into this yourselves.

456
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I just really like the way that I came about it because I didn't know there was a story in a mythology.

457
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And I just found it in a video by the user TPM Vids who makes pretty good videos.

458
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And but just the way he framed his opening line into then what it becomes just just really made me laugh.

459
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So just pay attention to the opening and here.

460
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The story of Spectral Magic is quite simple.

461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The Spectral Men are the keepers of the night who hold all the magic to the parade, allowing it to light up.

462
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But these Spectral Men were afraid to come out at night until their how Mickey Mouse asked if they would help him bring the lights alive for everyone to see the Spectral Men and Mickey Mouse led the parade through a variety of things.

463
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
OK.

464
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The story of Spectral Magic is fairly simple.

465
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The Spectra Men came to Earth in light eggs and only Mickey found them and he hid them under the earth until he had somewhere to let them loose.

466
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And that became Disney World, but he wanted to wait until the 20th anniversary.

467
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But by that time they had grown and they'd commandeered their eggs as balls to ride around on.

468
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I just what this nonsense is like.

469
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This is the opposite of a simple story.

470
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It is not a simple story.

471
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You are leaving out of the word.

472
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm very intrigued by, of course, is keeper.

473
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh, yeah.

474
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
All right.

475
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We got keepers.

476
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And that's great.

477
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Night as well.

478
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, again, feel free to like that went by in a flash.

479
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
We can step through this slowly.

480
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, we wish we have to.

481
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Spectra Men and their story.

482
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
He left out that they come from the land of light spiration.

483
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I have a slow slow to go on this that maybe we can just let's just stop whenever anything's intriguing, which will be probably always the Spectra Men are keepers of light.

484
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
They hold the parade's magical light and transform it for you in the midst of night.

485
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
OK, so like but what if a parade doesn't?

486
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
How does the mainstream electrical parade work like batteries?

487
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
They didn't. So they didn't need keepers of light to make that go.

488
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
No, but didn't the guy in the video say they were keepers of night?

489
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Maybe.

490
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I think he said keepers of night.

491
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I think he said not say keepers of light.

492
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Where is your source on this keepers of light?

493
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It is from I want to say this might be from the much embattled news source WDW News Today.

494
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Interesting.

495
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:42,000
There was a big article about it, which I have some I have some general questions about the journalism on on this synopsis, which I'll get to.

496
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But the next point is where Jason has been heading.

497
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
They come from a land called Lightspiration, Lightspiration, where everything is filled with rays of light and magical bursts of color.

498
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Great lightspiration lightspiration.

499
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
The country has like a second capital letter in it, first of all, but not a space.

500
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And they were always afraid to come out of hiding and share their magical light until one day Mickey, the Spectrum King, asked if they would join him.

501
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Wait, that says that in there? Yeah.

502
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That he's the king of the Spectrum.

503
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
The king of the Spectrum.

504
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But he isn't one.

505
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
We know this about Mickey.

506
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
He's not he's many things.

507
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
He's not a Spectrum man.

508
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
He's and you can't I don't I mean, I guess they can elect non.

509
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Well, I don't know if you like the spectrum.

510
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I mean, they honor as their ruler a non spectrum man, but it seems shouldn't it's an issue like there should be pride in your your species or whatever it is.

511
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Hold on to a couple of hold on.

512
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Hold on.

513
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
There's a lot here.

514
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
There's a lot here.

515
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Is it in a completely male society?

516
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Hmm.

517
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I mean, there's no women in the parade, right?

518
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Spectrum.

519
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
There's no spectrum.

520
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
They don't call it spectrum.

521
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
People.

522
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Ball riders and I don't have a better way to describe it.

523
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
There's people who sit on top of balls and then there's troubadours.

524
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
OK, so that's that's it.

525
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
There's no no gender.

526
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So Jurassic Park was all female.

527
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
OK, yeah.

528
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Spectro or in what is the country inspiration?

529
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Inspiration.

530
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
My brain is fried after for today for some reason.

531
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Light.

532
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Light.

533
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Inspiration is all male.

534
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
OK, so I wonder, are they just a more maybe they're immortal.

535
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:38,000
They're like to the watcher and there are multiple watchers in the Marvel universe who just sort of see perceive all of the universe at once and they exist for basically all of time.

536
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah.

537
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So maybe that's what this is.

538
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Well, no, but there's like female coded watchers.

539
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
OK, well, I mean, just in the general of what they do now.

540
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Oh, in terms of what they did in terms of how they're gender spectrum.

541
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Exactly.

542
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah.

543
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Omnipotent creatures.

544
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yeah.

545
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I think something we're missing is why are they here?

546
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But they come from light, inspiration.

547
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Now they're here to hold the magical light of the parade.

548
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Spectro magic was Mickey.

549
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Did Mickey just want to start this parade and then knew them?

550
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I know some guys.

551
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
They come from a place.

552
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
They'll bring the light is the idea that they're I think they're being used.

553
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
First of all, like you have somebody bring like a crop that they've harvested from the country.

554
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You don't care about them.

555
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You just you're after the goods.

556
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So it's very dehumanizing, dehumanizing to these guys.

557
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Did Mickey conquer the country somehow?

558
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
That might be what the subtext here is.

559
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Well, Mickey in this parade is wearing a gigantic cape with a huge collar jutting out that is very kingly and it's very space kingly.

560
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Uh huh.

561
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Especially.

562
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So, yeah, I want to say, yeah, I mean, the way he's dressed, he certainly feels like a reigning conqueror.

563
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, so Mickey perhaps came there, came to that country and ruled it with an iron fist after, I don't know, taking control somehow.

564
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Maybe a coup.

565
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I think so.

566
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Is it possible that the Main Street Electrical Parade was winding down and he knew how much trouble the power situation was?

567
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
We talked about it in our episode.

568
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
How are we going to all the battery packs?

569
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I just how do you keep it all?

570
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You know, fires break out in the beginning.

571
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He didn't want that situation again.

572
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
He knew he needed like an organic source.

573
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I got to go find a lamp.

574
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Is it on Earth or is it in space?

575
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Hmm.

576
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I feel like it's in space.

577
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah.

578
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Does that control all light?

579
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah.

580
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Or all night?

581
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
All this light.

582
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Like this kind of slightly brighter light.

583
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh, so there's different keepers.

584
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Not too bright.

585
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Not so bright that you can't see it.

586
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Oh, there's different keepers for different types of light.

587
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah.

588
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Okay.

589
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I think so.

590
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah.

591
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Well, they probably it's light spiration could be a star.

592
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Maybe that's the deal.

593
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah.

594
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
They all.

595
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So he went to like I wonder if we're talking about Walt's Grand Ambition and maybe Mickey

596
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
had that too.

597
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So he's like, what if I go like mine a star?

598
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
We talk about stars and are like when you wish upon a star.

599
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That's what that's Mickey's favorite song.

600
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah.

601
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Why can't I go to a star, steal the light from it?

602
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And then he was very surprised to discover this race of I guess four guys.

603
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah, there's four of them living in the star.

604
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's like Mickey's Solaris movie.

605
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Like I'm on a spaceship to the sun.

606
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Oh, no.

607
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
There's four guys here.

608
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Oh, shit.

609
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You want to I'm going back to Earth.

610
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You want to come or is that what you probably don't want to come?

611
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Right?

612
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
No, we'd like to come.

613
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Where?

614
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Sure.

615
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Sure.

616
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Hey, you guys.

617
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You looking for a king?

618
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You looking for some in a roll?

619
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah.

620
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
What does that mean?

621
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh, it's nothing.

622
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It just means I can tell you to do whatever you want.

623
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Hey, maybe you can help me with something that I'm trying to get a new parade.

624
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Go in the old parade.

625
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The keeper of that parade is AC Delco car batteries.

626
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Like I don't know.

627
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't do that dog.

628
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Dog.

629
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Give it up for AC Delco.

630
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That was like a rim shot.

631
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Or a coyote.

632
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Oh, you're not out of the woods yet, Jason.

633
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah, I don't know.

634
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
There's a lot going on.

635
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I think the Spectre men were about to die out because they like the species was going

636
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
to be done like through some freak effects.

637
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Like a species popped up.

638
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
There was only four males.

639
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So that's like sure.

640
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
That's like ants.

641
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
They're going to be gone before you know it.

642
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That the ability to reproduce.

643
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But life finds a way.

644
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That's what I brought up.

645
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The Jurassic Park thing.

646
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Mickey could.

647
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He probably has samples of their DNA on file at Disney Disney World.

648
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So he could probably he's probably can recreate them in a lab when the technology is right.

649
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
He's probably been experimenting up until now.

650
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
He is like often described as like a cypher like Mickey.

651
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You can put any job on him.

652
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But in theory, if you pile them all up, he does become an ozymandias for you.

653
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Ozymandias from Watchmen where it's like, oh, he's a super gene.

654
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
He's he's too good.

655
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
He's got everything.

656
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah, he's like the reverse, like the opposite Homer who's had every job and is perfect at

657
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
them.

658
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
He's conquered all the jobs.

659
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
He's conquered all the jobs.

660
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah, yeah, he's always maybe has like a little comical trouble, but ultimately, right.

661
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Job works out great.

662
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
He could keep it as long as he wants.

663
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Usually denies it to go to the next job.

664
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Right, right.

665
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah, I've created life.

666
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I've created life from a jar.

667
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Our energy problems are over.

668
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I rounded up these spectrum men.

669
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I had him pee in a cup.

670
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm not saying you're light.

671
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
He's got all it really could be like a doctor of island or island doctor Moreau where he's

672
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
got like Leonard O'Columbus somewhere.

673
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Yeah, like in a room somewhere and he's been testing on him ever since.

674
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm not some Republic's cereal, cereal super villain.

675
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The parade started 35 minutes ago.

676
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
This is at this pace.

677
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
We're only a third of the way through the back story.

678
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Okay, all right.

679
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Continue, continue.

680
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
No, it's beautiful about it.

681
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
There's so much there.

682
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Did we do the names?

683
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I do.

684
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't want to miss anything here.

685
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I get breeze through it though.

686
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The Mickey the Spectrum and King.

687
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That's what we got hung up on.

688
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
He is there.

689
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yeah.

690
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
He asked if they would join him in a nighttime festival of magic and light and come and bring

691
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
the magical light for everyone to see scared to confront people.

692
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
They hesitated.

693
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
These things were an affront fight.

694
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yes.

695
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Okay.

696
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Mickey coaxed them into doing something they didn't want to do.

697
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That's not great, but okay.

698
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Maybe they liked it.

699
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's going to be fun.

700
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's going to be all right.

701
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm your king also.

702
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You don't call it choices.

703
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah, that's a good point.

704
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
King.

705
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
They brought along their magical spectro balls and I'm sorry.

706
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Maybe we didn't say after much consideration, the spectrum.

707
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Spectrum.

708
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And we think about it.

709
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You have a clock sticking.

710
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Then they brought along their magical spectro balls and like trumpets to spread the joy

711
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
of their magical light to everyone.

712
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But Mickey controls the light they magically create and powers the parade through his electro

713
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
ball, which is not a spectro ball, changing it from night to day or crystal to magical

714
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
case.

715
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Okay.

716
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So magical spectra Mickey's electro ball is in controls everything, but it's vastly

717
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
smaller than a spectra ball.

718
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh yes.

719
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Check this shit out.

720
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I got Spencer's.

721
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Look at Spencer's gifts.

722
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
This is awesome.

723
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
This is awesome.

724
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
This is going to my float.

725
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So does it just stare at this for hours?

726
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I told wall, put it in your apartment, man.

727
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Put it in the apartment.

728
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It'll really trip it out, bro.

729
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Cause what that is is it is like Mickey on it.

730
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Mickey's in a big golden cape and with like standing on like the marquee of the old Las

731
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Vegas Hilton and he's holding one of those.

732
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's like an old sign when you think of when your idea of science, when you're six years

733
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
old, which is a little zappy ball.

734
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I still don't know what it is.

735
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's the zappy ball.

736
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's a clear ball and zaps come out of it when you touch it.

737
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Your hair might go up.

738
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah.

739
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
But a spectral ball is something that you ride around.

740
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Right.

741
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Okay.

742
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That's a vehicle.

743
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That's it.

744
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Now here's where I, here's where that's actually the end of the backstory.

745
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The here's where I start to take Umbridge with WDW news today.

746
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And this is the only reason I take it right.

747
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Right.

748
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Everything else is perfect.

749
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Great organization.

750
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Right.

751
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Of course.

752
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The story of the spectrum in has never really been told or even mentioned.

753
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Well, that's true.

754
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You cannot argue with that.

755
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
This is maybe the first most anyone has discussed the spectrum and outside of the people who

756
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
made up the name.

757
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah.

758
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah.

759
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yeah.

760
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
There's probably a lot of people involved in the production of spectrum magic, the parade

761
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
who never knew any of this creative entertainment uses backstories as well as the Disney

762
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
engineering.

763
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Uh, sorry.

764
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
The spectrum and aren't really scary, just misunderstood creatures of the night that

765
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
just want to bring you their power of magical light.

766
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Does that make you feel any better?

767
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
They aren't scary.

768
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Says these trustworthy theme park journalists.

769
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah.

770
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So why are you scared?

771
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't, I don't know.

772
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I, I, I learned this story from the Disney dish did a multi-part discussion about the

773
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
history and the Genesis of this parade a few years ago.

774
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And I, I messaged Len Testa and I was like, Hey, off the top of your head, I remember

775
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
in an episode you said the names of the spectrum men.

776
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Uh, do you know them?

777
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And he's like, I think that was a gym, but I can check.

778
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And I was like, all right.

779
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So I kept looking and I found, I was like, Oh no, they did do a spectrum magic history.

780
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And, and I found it.

781
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I found what I, I, I, this all came back to me by the way, a few years ago, I was driving

782
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
back.

783
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Uh, I was driving through the Sepulveda pass listening to the Disney dish and I distinctly

784
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
remember driving 75, like ladies looking at you like, Oh,

785
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Disney dish.

786
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah.

787
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What can I speed up?

788
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
This is at the stop sign and he hears that that's it.

789
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Exactly.

790
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And they're like, they kind of like get like all, yeah.

791
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And then he appeals out after that.

792
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah.

793
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Coming back.

794
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's a Sunday morning coming back from my short gig, uh, brief, uh, tenure coaching

795
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
the UCLA improv team.

796
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Uh, yeah.

797
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Well, if the women knew that, they knew that, shoot up like they were touching an electric

798
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
pole and they start talking about the doll face spectrum.

799
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And they're like, but then they start talking about the names.

800
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And then, so I found the episode because it was labeled.

801
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I thought it was just tossed off in an episode, but it is actually, they did a three part,

802
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
uh, story about the Genesis of spectrum magic.

803
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
This one then is really looking, yeah.

804
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I take that back.

805
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
They, Jim and Len really climbed the mountain.

806
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yeah.

807
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Geez.

808
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, what are their names?

809
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Uh, okay.

810
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I think in order, uh, I got to do this in escalating order opera, uh, rapper, low ball.

811
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Now we're not in the same.

812
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You couldn't, this was on the SATs.

813
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Are these also the names?

814
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You couldn't like name a category.

815
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Well, you got away for number four.

816
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Hyper chic.

817
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
C H I C. Yeah.

818
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Hyper chic.

819
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Hyper chic.

820
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
These aren't the same thing.

821
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You know what the thing is is that too, how do you spell rapper?

822
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Well, that I don't know.

823
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I heard it.

824
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Oh, you heard it.

825
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I see.

826
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Did you read it?

827
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Cause I thought it was R A P P E R.

828
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Probably if it's opera.

829
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Well, that's why it's confusing.

830
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Cause if they were all just different names, then okay.

831
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But rapper and opera are both, you know, musical things.

832
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
This is kind of, this is the same type of confusing, the same type of early nineties

833
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
name.

834
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Confusing.

835
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I mean, I think it's, I think it's, I think it's, I think it's, I think it's, I think

836
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
it's, I think it's, I think it's, I think it's, I think it's, I think it's, I think it's,

837
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:29,280
Yeah.

838
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:37,080
That's not when Williams,

839
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,320
Wendy Koopa is one of the characters.

840
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,160
Ludwig von Koopa, Iggy Koopa.

841
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,280
Yes. Well, some of them are like punk.

842
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,880
One of them is classical and then others are, there's Morton Koopa Jr.

843
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,600
Morton was that provocateur talk show.

844
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,680
They're not the same category. I love the name. By the way, this is not a complaint.

845
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,600
I, these, those names are like my favorite thing.

846
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,560
Roy Koopa is one of them.

847
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,640
Yeah. Who I think is named after a, uh, who the guy from wizard,

848
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,400
uh, um, Roy would I want to say it like, so he's supposed to be glam rock.

849
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,880
Oh yeah.

850
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
I think I'm making that up.

851
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,320
Oh, we got to do a full patron on the Koopa kids.

852
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,720
The Koopa family tree.

853
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,640
I loved loved and love the Koopa kids.

854
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,440
Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Yeah. Yeah. I would love a whole, if they're going to start,

855
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,800
like, I don't know how I feel about this Mario movie,

856
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,560
but if it gets us to just a full suicide squad,

857
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Oh, if the Koopa kids, yeah. Yeah.

858
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,640
Well they gotta be in there.

859
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,240
It's like, like rabble rouser, 14 year olds,

860
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,200
that's a great idea. Yeah. Um, anyway, those names are okay.

861
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,200
Hyper chic was that hyper chic is probably, I mean, I guess chic is a band.

862
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,240
I mean, if you're going with hyper chic and low ball, like you're starting to sound

863
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,880
like, like, you know, a goons in an 80's movie.

864
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,080
Low ball sounds like he was in the W short lived WWE faction, retribution.

865
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,040
I just looked up low ball by the way. And there is a,

866
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,080
there is a band called low ball, but it's post this parade. Yeah. But they're,

867
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,720
they're basic Google description.

868
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,000
Low ball is a band that teases sexuality, but doesn't want to be labeled by it.

869
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,240
I can appreciate that. I really can appreciate that. That sounds good.

870
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,440
Yeah. Sometimes it's what you're not saying.

871
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,640
He's a sexuality, but doesn't want to be labeled.

872
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,840
That couldn't be more of me. Yeah. I tease it, but I just like,

873
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,400
I don't want to be part of my identity. Okay. Low ball, low ball and hyper chic,

874
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,400
hyper chic. They are any of them look hyper like sheaker stylish?

875
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,920
I don't think they all have like bright hair. Right.

876
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,280
They're all look pretty hype.

877
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,840
The hyper chic is a good way to describe if any of them in a way,

878
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,880
low ball is not a good way to describe a single one of them. Yeah. Rapper and

879
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,320
opera. I don't know because they don't really,

880
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,680
the music that you hear is pretty uniform throughout. It is a classical one.

881
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,280
Yeah. It is a nice song, but there's no rap in this parade.

882
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,480
Not that I could hear. No opera really either. It's very confusing.

883
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,080
Very confusing. I am if we maybe haven't described their,

884
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,640
their look well and I don't know if you guys have spectrum in front of you,

885
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,720
Jason, if you were, I have brave here. Yeah. Doing such in general,

886
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,640
it is kind of like, I mean the wardrobe is extremely captain.

887
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,080
EO it's obviously very post captain.

888
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,360
You know, there's like sort of a rainbow power,

889
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,160
just all the colors represented and then like light up spangles.

890
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,680
But then like they put on different colors of clown wig.

891
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,880
Um, and then,

892
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,760
and maybe took like a hair straightener to it to get like kind of a Wayne and

893
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,520
Garth effect. And then, uh, put on,

894
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,960
uh, Casper, the friendly ghost masks,

895
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,960
just like divorced from the greater context of the ghost. And then,

896
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,960
and then lit all that up from the inside. Uh,

897
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,120
is there any other descriptors that might, uh, do them justice?

898
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,480
Yeah. It's like, um, I don't know.

899
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,960
It's like you dressed your dolly up as captain EO and put a wig on it. Like,

900
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,480
just like a generic doll. You're like, you're imagining like a little dolly.

901
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,480
You would have like a kid would have maybe 20 years ago,

902
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,440
where it's a generic face and it's just like you pretend the bottle and all that

903
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,520
stuff. And then you give it a haircut.

904
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,840
The hair all reminds me of if my sister decided to cut Barbie's hair,

905
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,160
this is always how it would end up. Any self-administered doll haircut.

906
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,440
It looks thrown together. It looks like they had those masks hanging around.

907
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,920
They had the wigs hanging around and they had old captain EO,

908
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,360
like crew uniforms and they were like,

909
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,080
I'm going to put these three things together. Like that looks okay.

910
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,680
Yeah. And when the merchandising team,

911
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,920
when it came time to make merch, uh, over the years, I feel like they have,

912
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,000
you know, maybe been like, yeah, these guys,

913
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,920
these guys are kind of horrific. Like here, these are,

914
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,720
these are a line of pins with pieces of the parade floats in the pin.

915
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,800
Okay. Uh, that they sold about seven years ago. Um, like ground up,

916
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,080
like you like shunks. Yeah. Um, they,

917
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,800
whatever they saved that wasn't totally deteriorated.

918
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Here's a true bit or and kind of doesn't look like it. And he's in a,

919
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,200
he's in a cowboy hat. He's in a white cowboy hat.

920
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,560
So is he one of those? Is that low? Does that mean low ball? Like,

921
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,400
I don't know why.

922
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,560
Well, this one is one of the ones who sit on top of glowing orbs.

923
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,520
And this I think is a pin from the time because it doesn't have that little

924
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,200
Mickey ear. And I don't know this guy. Yeah,

925
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,440
it does look like a generic baby doll. You gave like a haircut to, yeah, yeah.

926
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,480
You gave like, I want it to look like Uma Thurman in pulp fiction.

927
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:03,320
Severe bangs. I can pull it off as a hairstylist, even though I'm six,

928
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,840
but put it, put them, put them in a Natalie Portman's wig from closer.

929
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,280
Am I right folks? It's that shade. Yes. That particular pink. Absolutely.

930
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,520
That's where Mike Nichols got the idea. He was seeing the parade at Disney world.

931
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,160
Um, yeah, it's, it's odd. It's, it's a,

932
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,160
it's an aesthetic for sure.

933
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,200
And they're an old the adventures of old hyper chic and opera with all that

934
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,600
backstory. They're from space. They're hyper chic and opera and they ride in

935
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,880
spectra balls and then they are gone in like the first two minutes.

936
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,680
Yeah. Why is there any of this?

937
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,280
And they're not like in between,

938
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,200
you would think they would be in between and like they're checking to make sure

939
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,840
their light is functioning properly and they're providing the joy that,

940
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,200
that Mickey wants them to provide.

941
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,240
There's no resolution to the right. You don't get to see, you know,

942
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,240
like Mickey making them go back to a cage parade.

943
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,920
Let's go. It's also like money.

944
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,440
The light milking machine.

945
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,760
They're all hooked up to something like matrix style or something.

946
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,320
I'm putting, that's what we're all in. And let's see if you,

947
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,640
I'm putting the organic light extractor down your throat again at the end of the

948
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,480
night.

949
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,840
Mickey looks like, uh, I will say this, looking at this one photo,

950
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,160
Mickey looks like Liberace. I was going to say, yeah,

951
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,440
it really looks like Liberace.

952
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,720
It occurred to me as well because with the light,

953
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,920
the way that it is lit is also like it,

954
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,440
there's a lot of white and there's a lot of bright gold.

955
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,000
It's all very Vegasy. Yes, absolutely. Uh,

956
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,400
can't argue with that element. Yeah, that's cool.

957
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,160
No, that's awesome. He is, is fantastic.

958
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,560
That kind of brought me to another theory about what's going on here.

959
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,240
If we can't trust this backstory and if WWW news today,

960
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,520
if this reporting where they admit that this story has never been mentioned,

961
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,960
if we can't trust that, all right,

962
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,760
let's think about the Liberace story and what we know from one of our favorite

963
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,560
recently mentioned films. Yeah, behind the candelabra.

964
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,480
Uh, Liberace liked to take the,

965
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,200
I know that it happened to Scott Thorson.

966
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,400
I feel like maybe other men as well that he dated, uh,

967
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,600
that he took them and like he wanted them to go to plastic surgeons,

968
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,320
be molded in his own, like Liberace's standard of beauty.

969
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,800
That is me. I'm, I'm the most beautiful. You should look like me.

970
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,200
Is there something,

971
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,120
this maybe butts up against this backstory of him going to this planet or

972
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:44,960
whatever.

973
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,960
Did Mickey date the spectrum men and then try and they looked different at one

974
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,680
point in time. But he said, you should be more ageless.

975
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,440
You should look more youthful here. Look like this. And then he puts,

976
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,000
he pulls up a painting of himself. Like they didn't have that coloration.

977
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,240
They were not pale white until Mickey said,

978
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,320
you should look like this. I'll take you to a guy to make you look like this.

979
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,600
So Mickey took them to the Disney world doctor on main street,

980
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,600
the Disney world plastic surgeon. Yeah. It's captain hook. Okay.

981
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,240
It's a, it's a severely drugged up captain hook and falling asleep while doing

982
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,520
the surgery with his hook. Okay. The only way they give it to the eighties,

983
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,800
they didn't have the technology yet.

984
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,120
Are you implying though that the faces are in the way that the first, the Mike,

985
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,280
Michael Myers mask in the first Halloween was spray painted white or a paint

986
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,120
at white.

987
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,880
Is this a Mickey mouse mask with the ears removed and just like the face part

988
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,320
then kind of painted an opaque? Yeah. Yeah. I think,

989
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,480
I think something like that,

990
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,400
unless we're going with the idea that this is their,

991
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,280
their actual skin and he was maybe,

992
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,080
or maybe like like Mickey masks were grafted onto their faces.

993
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,800
But we have to look like, and it just didn't, it didn't land correctly.

994
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,880
It looks weird on their bodies. These,

995
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,080
these poor spectrum and we're not meant to have Mickey doubt faces.

996
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:12,440
You know,

997
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,440
that's what reminds me of a comic book character named professor pig from Grant

998
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,080
Morrison's Batman run who put these and boy,

999
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,160
do they look exactly like these characters. The doll,

1000
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,120
they called them the dollar trans and he would know a doll mask and he would

1001
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,960
graft it to this face of his victims. And here I'll show you a little bit.

1002
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,960
I'm going to walk over Jason's seen this. Okay.

1003
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,440
You're sure about, yeah. Oh no. Oh, they're very scared.

1004
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,760
This is a ventriloquist vibe except they're like, like they're, they're,

1005
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,960
they've got like shocks of red hair. Yes. Oh yeah.

1006
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,240
That's kind of a more like gritty, severe version of the spectrum,

1007
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,160
not dressed as magically, which makes it even more.

1008
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,680
Creeps who were like plastic surgery, basically molded in a likeness.

1009
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,720
And I think we're underselling to the ones on the spinning or they kind of have

1010
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,360
frizzed out hair as if they all just touched Mickey's electric orb and it gave

1011
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,840
them like crazy static hair.

1012
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,400
Their hair kind of looks like a bunch of like cassette tape,

1013
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,520
like unraveled and glued piece by piece. Yeah.

1014
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,800
Like just a big nest of cassette tape. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1015
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,200
Something bad happened to these doll face spectrum. Man. The only way. Yeah.

1016
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,240
Either I can't say that it's both Mickey conquering them and Mickey forcing them

1017
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,480
to get plastic surgery. But,

1018
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,960
but they probably all ended up like Matt Damon going like my face,

1019
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,160
my fucking face.

1020
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,920
Yeah, for sure. There's some version of that happened,

1021
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,760
whether Mickey was involved or not. Some version of that happened.

1022
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,560
Behind the Cannella wrote Patreon coming soon. I guess kind of have to,

1023
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:00,960
evidently.

1024
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,840
I guess tied into probably a full Liberace and we got to get Eva on cause she

1025
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,560
did the full tour. Oh yeah. Yeah. She went into like the mysterious limo.

1026
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:14,240
It's not like a great, not remotely shady. Yeah, no, no,

1027
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,120
not weird at all. Well we're onto Mickey. Look,

1028
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,640
when you're one of the biggest stars in the world, you get,

1029
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,720
like things get weird. You lose touch with reality and we're onto him.

1030
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,240
Mickey's a monster. And we know. And we're in our haunted month.

1031
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,600
So for the biggest monster of the month so far is Mickey Mouse.

1032
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,600
All that said, I think the parade is kind of nice.

1033
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,840
Once you get past that, on the Disney dish,

1034
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,680
they pointed out that a lot of these selections for the rest of the parade are

1035
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,880
things that were floating around in the company at the top.

1036
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,400
So like Fantasia had had a re-release for the anniversary.

1037
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,600
Little mermaid had been out for a little while, but the, uh,

1038
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,640
television animation wing was working on the little mermaid TV show,

1039
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,720
sleeping beauty,

1040
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,640
I think maybe was about to or had come out of the Disney vault or is about to

1041
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,280
go back in the Disney vault. So they're sort of not,

1042
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,400
not all current recent films,

1043
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,400
but things that they've recently been putting in front of people.

1044
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,560
Yes. I mean, there's recent stuff in the second version.

1045
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,320
At some point in the show there, there's like some musical elements, uh,

1046
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,520
you know, Chippendale playing the piano. That's great.

1047
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,320
The conductor in the later parades is the genie from Aladdin,

1048
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,240
but in the earlier parade it's Roger Rabbit, huge in the early nineties,

1049
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,400
late eighties.

1050
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,320
And the genie, which I didn't know this is the appearance of the Dan Kastlin,

1051
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,160
net a genie.

1052
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,480
You can really tell you can really tell. Oh boy. Yay.

1053
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,680
Goofy. Not the best, not the best voice.

1054
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,440
And he talks a lot. Yeah. He talks the whole time.

1055
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,120
He's conducting other characters to play instruments. Yes.

1056
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,840
He goes like, Oh, what a sound. Timpani.

1057
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,600
Okay.

1058
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,880
A big element we have not addressed yet and that's the narrator slash announcer

1059
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,520
of this parade is Jiminy Cricket.

1060
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,720
You say that like it's the craziest.

1061
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,360
Can you believe it?

1062
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,320
It's just, there's so much spectrum and stuff at the top.

1063
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,400
You would think it would be like ultra chic or something.

1064
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,680
Well,

1065
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,240
or you think you'd see him earlier on as it stands.

1066
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,880
He's a little pseudo animatronic saying like, goodbye, good night.

1067
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,360
Like at the very end.

1068
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,880
Which is good. That little animatronic on a float is very good.

1069
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,200
This is, this is a thing that I think always happens is that they,

1070
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,600
they end up relying on the characters because most people they're coming to the

1071
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,640
parks, want to see the hits. They want the favor. Oh, Jiminy Cricket.

1072
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,720
They don't want a opera to announce the park,

1073
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,440
but we want opera to have a lot of more dialogue,

1074
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,160
any dialogue whatsoever. Like anything we want to hear.

1075
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,800
What happened to him when I hear his story, it makes everybody sad.

1076
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,840
He's like tapping Morse code to try to get help during the parade.

1077
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,600
Is that what all the giggling it? Cause they like,

1078
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,160
they giggle and then sometimes they say like zoom.

1079
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,480
Like they, they just kind of make like unpleasant, like.

1080
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,440
Yeah.

1081
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,520
Skittering noises.

1082
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,640
That's not a good aspect of them either.

1083
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,840
No, it's like they're like little, yeah, they're a little, little like,

1084
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,640
you know, like the creeps like that are just giggling.

1085
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,880
Yeah. Weird little giggling creeps. Yeah. No, that,

1086
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,680
that makes them more unnerving for sure.

1087
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,760
Who also are kind of like the sort of a drunken demeanor to them as

1088
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,400
well. Cause the way those balls that they ride on spin around and they're kind

1089
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,320
of like always kicking and heaving to and fro.

1090
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,800
Yeah. They're like thing one and thing two or something.

1091
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,560
There's an element of like, of like that kind of a.

1092
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,840
Nervous. Yeah. Yeah.

1093
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,640
From the, yeah, not even the book thing one and thing two.

1094
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,840
Sometimes doing very sharp movements.

1095
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,080
Like I saw some videos where they move too fast.

1096
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,960
Are they like, and I don't mean to bring up something Scott is terrified of,

1097
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,440
but are they like when adults play Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Ann?

1098
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,680
It reminds me of that. We're talking about doll hair and they're doll.

1099
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,600
Yeah. It's, it completely fits in that. Now, oddly,

1100
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,640
the way they're dressed helps me out because it's not like big puffy sleeves

1101
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,520
and gingham. That's where I started to get, like you put them in space clothes.

1102
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,960
Great. That, that undoes like 50% of it for me. Okay. But yeah,

1103
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,240
Oh, completely. This like absolutely recurring thing. I hate,

1104
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,080
no adults should dress like Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Ann.

1105
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,840
And do some sort of routine.

1106
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,240
Especially not some old soft shoe or something or anything where they like

1107
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,920
flopped down and kind of pout like, Oh, I fell on my bum.

1108
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,400
They've got stuffing for bones. Of course you're going to flop a little.

1109
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:12,400
But you must like when adults play like Marionettes and move as if they had

1110
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,800
strings attached to them. Right.

1111
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,360
In sync doing it. Is that okay?

1112
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,600
Um, I'm trying to think.

1113
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,680
It doesn't specifically bother me. And I think I like that music video,

1114
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,880
but I don't like when they go really close and they have very plastic faces.

1115
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,160
They all kind of look like to bring up a reason thing. Late shifts. Leno. Right.

1116
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,440
Right. Right. Like if you saw that like really close,

1117
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,440
high res of JC in plastic doll. Wait, are they married?

1118
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,960
Wait, is the Marionette one different than the doll one? No, they can't be.

1119
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:44,840
It might be.

1120
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,920
There's different costumes because they're kind of more like Ken doll style,

1121
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,280
but then they're also up on strings and that's a little more of the bowler hat

1122
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,840
and the ruse cheeks, which I'm not.

1123
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,080
That's getting in the scare of your territory. Yeah.

1124
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,560
I kind of prefer them as creepy plastic Ken dolls.

1125
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,680
They really should do like a horror nights or a nots maze.

1126
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,320
That's just Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy, which just all.

1127
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,920
They should not, but I guess if they want to extract screams, I think,

1128
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,720
I think I would like to think, is there any listeners agree with this? Like,

1129
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,480
does this say, I guess I don't scream when I see it.

1130
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,480
It just makes me very embarrassed for the people dressed like that.

1131
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,880
Well, what do you, you know, that it's not a good, valuable piece of entertainment.

1132
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,840
You know that you're going to be bored shitless during his Raggedy Ann routine.

1133
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,120
Well, I just wanted to make sure, you know,

1134
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:38,120
Scott that for sure we do not have a male and female performer that might pop in

1135
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,480
now dressed as Raggedy Ann.

1136
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,760
For sure your wife and child are not finishing up getting ready.

1137
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,760
Don't you dress this baby as a, oddly he is a baby,

1138
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,040
but if he was dressed as a baby, quote unquote, I'd be like, I can't,

1139
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,480
I gotta get out of town for a little while. I gotta erase this from.

1140
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,840
Wait, so you're not going to,

1141
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,440
you can't dress up like baby Huey with like a big Stokie and like the bonnet.

1142
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,360
No, we've never put them in a bonnet. Absolutely not.

1143
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,760
You've never drawn big rosy cheeks like a big rouge on his cheeks.

1144
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,160
No, no, no, no.

1145
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,920
Has he ever had a big lolly?

1146
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,840
I would, it would be dangerous is the reason why not. I, you know what?

1147
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,880
No, I will allow him to have a big lolly as soon as that's okay. Okay. No,

1148
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:29,360
but I think makeup, never keep makeup away from my child.

1149
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,920
Even for the haunt season?

1150
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,000
Yes. Yes. I don't want to be scared by him.

1151
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,680
I don't like, I guess some fun frights during this month or it can be a little

1152
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:48,000
fun, but I want to be afraid of my son. Okay. That's fair.

1153
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,400
Well, or a doll wig. This is, uh, it's off. It's really,

1154
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,840
a baby dressed as a baby is a deceptively terrifying phrase to me.

1155
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,560
What about a baby dressed as an adult baby?

1156
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,640
I mean, that's kind of like, this is some overlap. I think with what I'm,

1157
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,240
you think there's some overlap. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or like if, yeah,

1158
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,280
it's I think bonnet. It's all about bond. I think I'm not into bonnets. Okay.

1159
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,600
What can I say? Is that weird? I'm not into bonnets.

1160
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,920
Scott is not into bonnets. All right. I guess that's,

1161
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,560
I'm looking trying to look for a baby costume for a baby,

1162
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,960
but I don't think it exists.

1163
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,840
Google that kind of breaks Google when you type it in.

1164
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,440
Yeah. There's like baby dressed as old person.

1165
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:33,640
There's baby dressed as stay puff marshmallow man. But yeah,

1166
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,480
that's all just cute. Oh, baby dressed as Pope. There's another,

1167
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,200
Pope is too young. I've heard of young Pope's, but that's too young.

1168
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,000
Baby dressed as peanut baby photography props.

1169
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
This is just a baby in like a cool vest with like a hat that like a cabbie hat.

1170
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:54,840
Well, but you kind of,

1171
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:59,040
I think didn't we determine that you kind of like what's her name and Geddes?

1172
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,160
Uh, like it's a, I think it depends. I, I, yeah,

1173
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,280
I know what you're saying now because we talked a little bit about the defunct

1174
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,040
and Getty store that was at Disney, uh, that time, time Disney.

1175
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,280
Some of the most prime real estate smack in the middle is now occupied by a

1176
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,240
Starbucks, right? A always crowded, uh,

1177
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,280
Starbucks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was babies, babies, like in pods of peas.

1178
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,440
Yeah. I think it depended on what the, what the,

1179
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,240
what the photo shoot was if I liked it or not, I could be wrong.

1180
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,800
I feel like you saw a couple that you want. I think any reaction that isn't,

1181
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,400
you're an anguetties photograph.

1182
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,800
I think I was excited because there was an anguetti credit card. Oh, right.

1183
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,080
Oh, that's right. So you're just dreaming of points. Yeah. Yeah. I like the,

1184
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,160
it's kind of a babies dressed as points, whatever that, whatever you manifest,

1185
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,680
what a, that's adorable. Um, yeah, I'll, I'll,

1186
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,040
I'll see if I can find a baby dressed as a baby, but so far no luck.

1187
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,280
Actually listeners too, not that I'm dying to see this in my feed,

1188
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,880
but you know what I'm talking about, right?

1189
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,400
It is, I think maybe actually what Jason said is correct.

1190
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,200
A baby dressed as an adult baby. That is what that maybe is the line.

1191
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,400
That's why a giant diaper and a giant bonnet and then like make,

1192
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,280
make up. Of course I see my son in diapers,

1193
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,440
but if I saw him in a like costume diaper, a big cloth diaper,

1194
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,440
I think that's weird. Yeah. Okay.

1195
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,800
I think if no one can provide a lot of sort of like sweat here,

1196
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,280
I'm getting fatigued by a creepy all of us.

1197
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,080
I think this is going to be like a, uh,

1198
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,560
close encounters of the third kind situation where no one can provide a photo

1199
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,120
of what we're talking about. So you are going to have to do it.

1200
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,680
You're going to have to create the photo just so you can see it in your mind.

1201
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,600
You're enough to post it. I can't do this to my, I will have, I have to save him.

1202
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:52,080
I would sooner, uh, wear all of this myself. Well, that's fine. Hey,

1203
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:52,760
that's fine too.

1204
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,320
If you can do sort of a forced perspective or make it look like you're a baby,

1205
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,560
then we'll, we'll accept that.

1206
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,200
It tricked me into doing adult baby photos.

1207
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,240
It only took three years to do it.

1208
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,400
Fucking spectrum in look what they led us to another level.

1209
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,400
We're starting off here. You thought this wasn't even a haunt cast episode.

1210
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,360
This might be the scariest of the month, right at the top.

1211
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,000
For sure.

1212
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,920
Do you want to know about the most chilling twist so far?

1213
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,480
The Anne Geddes credit card does not have good reviews.

1214
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:25,680
You're kidding. It's got a two, four, it's got, uh, uh, pros and cons.

1215
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:31,160
Uh, it's got six bad and the only good is considers applicants with fair or poor

1216
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,000
credit. Hmm. Now, if you're trying to build your credit back up, you need,

1217
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,640
you know, people say like, well, get a, let's call, you know,

1218
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,000
get some sort of card, but, um,

1219
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,400
a super money.com does not seem to be into it.

1220
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:50,160
And I feel like Mr. Ask Mr. Credit Card is not going to be very complimentary

1221
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,000
either.

1222
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,040
I don't like the rewards on the Anne Geddes credit card,

1223
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,040
which is that at your door suddenly one day appears a baby resting in a hollowed

1224
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:01,880
out pumpkin.

1225
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,720
Yeah. If you didn't ask for this,

1226
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,960
I don't want to suddenly take care of this child.

1227
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,320
And what do I do with the pumpkin?

1228
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,840
If you spend a thousand dollars in the first three months, that's the bonus.

1229
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,960
There's a baby in a pumpkin. So 5,000 and you get triplets.

1230
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,160
Oh yeah. Yeah. And it's a gourd.

1231
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,960
There's a lot of different gourds and stuff around too.

1232
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:26,960
It's a squash. Yeah. For the gamut. Um, what do we, how do we get out of this?

1233
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,920
What do we install this people? There's, I think some listeners,

1234
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:35,000
let me represent the listeners who I think will say, okay,

1235
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:40,240
how come they did an episode about Spectra magic and it was the creepiest

1236
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,320
episode, although there's a lot of competitors to that,

1237
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,840
but it was among their creepiest episodes when it, to me,

1238
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:50,240
the listener is something that I hold in high regard because it was like a

1239
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,120
magical thing of one of the first times I went and the song is wonderful.

1240
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:59,080
I will let, let's go, let's give the song that I think that song is great.

1241
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,320
And I feel that way too.

1242
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,320
Me not being so cognizant of these Dolphi spectrum men.

1243
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:09,560
What I remember is that song being like a stirring score that feels like

1244
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:14,160
early nineties Disney in the best way. Not that it's nineties ish in its music,

1245
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,520
but in it's that it's somewhere between little mermaid and beauty and the beast.

1246
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:22,560
It's got that kind of, I don't know, soaring majesty. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

1247
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:27,560
Yeah. Yeah. And those, just those like horn lines that are the very like

1248
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,320
dredge up Disney magic. Yeah. Well they're played on a light trumpet.

1249
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,680
So it tried to not make sense. Yeah.

1250
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,960
Some very fun animals in this.

1251
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,840
There's a big peacock that looks good with all the lights.

1252
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:45,080
There is a lot of large fish and the little mermaid section.

1253
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:49,400
There's some giant fish spinning fish floats.

1254
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,840
And I, the one of the videos I watched a little kid, you can hear them go,

1255
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:58,040
here comes the big fish and like, that's pretty cute.

1256
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,640
Great. They're right. They're not lying. Yeah.

1257
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,520
It has, it has one of my favorite things and I don't remember if I mentioned it

1258
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:10,120
when we did mainstream electrical parade, uh, the seven dwarves with lights.

1259
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,160
Yeah. Make me laugh. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just,

1260
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,880
it doesn't look like they put much thought into their outfit and they don't

1261
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,240
look pleased to have lights on them. Just be, I mean, especially grumpy,

1262
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,120
but it's just literally like they're wearing like a bad light Christmas vest or

1263
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,640
something. And they're walking around. It looks totally out of place. I mean,

1264
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,920
it looks out of place for other characters too,

1265
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,320
but for some reason the seven dwarves just with the lights on doesn't make

1266
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,160
sense to me.

1267
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,760
And there's a Peter Pan and an all white tunic covered in lights.

1268
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:40,080
That makes sense to me. Yeah. Don't like that word either.

1269
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,280
White tunic.

1270
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,560
Covered in light.

1271
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,960
Yeah. That doesn't help me later anymore. Peter Pan, his iconic tunic.

1272
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,200
All white tunic. All white, of course.

1273
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,120
All white tunic and even captain hook wears, you know,

1274
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,400
all white on the float as if to say he's been redeemed.

1275
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,920
So they're pure. They're all pure. They, the light has,

1276
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,960
has purified them, but not Chernobog.

1277
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,720
There was a giant Chernobog that apparently opens up,

1278
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,760
but no one seems to be able to catch it opening up on video says that Scott

1279
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,160
played. He says that the Chernobog would open up its like big wings,

1280
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,040
but there were clearance issues with it depending on where the parade was.

1281
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,520
So often it didn't open. People would think it was broken,

1282
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,480
but they weren't in the right spot for the parade.

1283
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,720
It would need a lot of space to open up its wings.

1284
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,520
So there are only a couple of places that it could do it.

1285
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,520
Yes. That's crazy. It's that bit.

1286
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,480
That's gotta be one of the biggest floats they've ever done.

1287
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,440
Yeah.

1288
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,520
They commit to something so specifically scary. Yes.

1289
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,000
Like, yeah, that would freak out little kids you would think, but it's,

1290
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,480
it's cool. Well, the Chernobog is cool.

1291
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,600
Seems less scary after they've all been traumatized by the spectrum map.

1292
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,520
I think that's what I knew as a kid. I was like, it's all like, okay,

1293
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,200
here's everyone. And even like this Chernobog with this sinister music,

1294
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,760
I was like, I don't know. The spectrum man are gone. Those guys are gone.

1295
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,360
Good. The light part of the parade.

1296
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,280
I like, oh good. It's just the parade floats just blasting smoke,

1297
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,160
blasting ankle level fog.

1298
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,840
The Chernobog is like the devil is the devil basically. Yes.

1299
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,920
But there's something more calming about the devil. He's not,

1300
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,720
he's not like insecure. He's not giggling, you know, he's just, you know,

1301
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,800
he's sitting there. He's not, he's not like any like weird.

1302
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,680
There's not as much weirdness for whatever reason. He's evil incarnate,

1303
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,320
but the doll face spectrum men are definitely giving worse vibes.

1304
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,080
Oh, bad vibes. Very bad vibes. I mean the devil, if you just reject him,

1305
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,080
you know, nothing to worry about unless she tries to make a deal with you.

1306
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,520
Is that right? He's going to win. Huh? Oh, but if you engage,

1307
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,440
if you just ignore, is that right? You're the one with the religious training.

1308
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,760
You just got to tell them, no, this is, I don't know. For my,

1309
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,120
I feel like all of the, the,

1310
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:04,080
the light side like all the God and Jesus stuff is more like codified

1311
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:08,840
stories from the Bible, from scripture. And we know, all right, this is,

1312
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,360
we, this has been passed down.

1313
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:15,480
The devil stuff all feels like made up by whatever teacher works at

1314
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,800
the Catholic school. You know what I mean? Like, like the devil,

1315
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,480
it's like, they all know like, Oh, Oh, devil just improvise,

1316
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:27,000
just make up whatever you want. Yeah. And like tent revival lists, like,

1317
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:31,080
like also scammers, like maniac scammers.

1318
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,360
That's why we can't decide. I mean, there's like, uh, you know, we don't,

1319
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,680
we have not agreed that, that God is a man with a long white beard, but that,

1320
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,120
that image is maintained and we certainly have all decided what Jesus looks like

1321
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,920
the devil. There's thousands of devils. Nobody can write is, yeah,

1322
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,160
is the devil 300 feet tall or is he, or is he a guy?

1323
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:54,600
Is he a little like Victorian? Is he wear like fancy?

1324
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,960
Is he wear like Austin powers clothes essentially, but a dark burgundy?

1325
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,920
Is he chic? Is he ultra chic? He's, or is he a Chernobog?

1326
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,520
Is he a kind of like a gargoyle type?

1327
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,280
That's how you know it's all both. There's no, nobody could ever settle on it.

1328
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,040
How tall is the devil?

1329
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,480
Can I ask what your idea of him was growing up? What did you think he looked like?

1330
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,520
Oh my God. Can I even answer that? Um,

1331
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,920
cause I thought he looked like probably, and not that I w I,

1332
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,000
we did not go to church,

1333
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,840
but I just had the cartoon idea of what he like a cartoon devil basically from

1334
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,560
any, any old looney. Was the devil on Looney Tunes?

1335
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,560
Probably sometimes. Yeah. Once in a while.

1336
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:39,280
I think I thought the devil was like tall,

1337
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,960
but not like taller than any human.

1338
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:47,120
Okay. So not like so giants or anything, just like a normal human size.

1339
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,360
Like he would have to duck to get into my bedroom,

1340
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,360
but I feel like I did imagine what it would be like if the devil walked into my

1341
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,800
bedroom. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Oh yeah. Well he's a duck cause of the horns.

1342
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,360
The horns add like almost a foot. Which is my idea.

1343
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,640
I said you could give him three foot tall horns if you wanted to.

1344
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,280
It was like six five or six six maybe. Yeah. In your range, honestly.

1345
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,920
I'm six three. Yeah. So that's the jump scare.

1346
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,320
That's the ultimate scare we're heading for.

1347
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,160
The reveal. Jason, who do, what did you think the devil looked like when you were

1348
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,000
a young man?

1349
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,840
Like riding some sort of like glowing shape with

1350
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:30,160
glowing shaped hair and it was spinning and like the face of a twisted doll.

1351
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,520
Like, all right.

1352
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,320
That's too scary. That could never.

1353
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,680
It's too scary. Okay. So, so spectrum, man,

1354
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,720
tall guy and like Chuck Jones devil.

1355
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,440
So does that mean short you think?

1356
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,200
I didn't think of him as I thought of him as I guess normal height,

1357
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:54,040
but I guess if he was like a little taller than like bugs or something,

1358
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,320
I guess he wouldn't be so tall,

1359
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,280
but much taller than like hot stuff. The little devil. Yeah, for sure.

1360
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,480
If that was, I would assume you were going to say hot stuff was your devil

1361
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,720
growing up. I guess you like, I guess you like him. We all like hot stuff.

1362
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:11,720
You did not know who hot stuff was. Didn't that come up once? Cause he's a devil

1363
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,600
wearing a little diaper.

1364
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,040
Would you be okay with a kid dressed as hot stuff? A little devil.

1365
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,080
I don't hate hot stuff. The little devil that might not seem consistent,

1366
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,880
but I'm looking at it. Maybe I didn't remember hot stuff.

1367
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,400
I'm not super familiar with them. I'm not creeped out by him. In fact,

1368
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,920
there's a sticker where he's, uh, he's licking a,

1369
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,920
I look, I'm going to say ice cream cone, but it's not because it's on fire.

1370
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,800
He's licking a fire cream cone. Okay.

1371
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,600
A hot cream cone.

1372
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,640
You can't be mad at that.

1373
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,600
But then there's another one where he's just licking an ice cream cone.

1374
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,080
Well he likes both.

1375
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,840
Maybe that maybe one is the before and one is the after.

1376
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,400
He licks a nice hot stuff, licks an ice cream cone once briefly,

1377
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,120
and it lights on fire immediately. Right. Yeah. That's how hot, hot stuff is.

1378
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:03,520
You said baby Huey earlier. So we've gotten two Harvey comics character references.

1379
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,120
Maybe not.

1380
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,880
You said, yeah, there was the, will I dress for the baby? Yeah. Like baby Huey.

1381
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,720
Oh, like baby Huey. Oh, I meant, wait, I think I'm,

1382
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:17,200
what's the baby from Roger Rabbit? Baby Herman. Baby Herman. Okay.

1383
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,040
Either works either works. Baby Huey a little more.

1384
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,680
I'm more creeped out by baby Huey easily. Yeah. I think maybe Herman's funny.

1385
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:28,800
He is huge. Yes. That's true. Big things. Yeah. Okay. Small spaces.

1386
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,160
Things that are supposed to be small. Yeah.

1387
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:36,200
I wish this parade went harder with all the weirdness is this is always what we

1388
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,000
I think end up saying. Ah, you don't want characters. You don't want,

1389
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,720
you want something scary. You're like, look,

1390
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,960
everybody likes this on this magic night song, but you want like,

1391
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,200
maybe this music should be more demented. Well,

1392
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:54,000
demented or just the more original characters, a little more unusual.

1393
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,640
I think it kind of like,

1394
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:00,240
I don't think I like this parade as much as I like even paint the night.

1395
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,080
I guess the song is better.

1396
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:06,640
Well, I've seen that discussion of like, if it's not electrical parade,

1397
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,680
then is it what's the best night parade? Is it this or paint the night?

1398
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,320
I think paint the night. I just, obviously technology is so much better.

1399
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,200
It's like, this is the bridge between the two of them and either you get the fun

1400
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,400
jankiness of the original.

1401
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,400
This is the bridge one that's like still fun to look at and it's not bad,

1402
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,880
but paint the night then has some really incredible stuff.

1403
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,040
And especially that last float with Mickey. Yeah. So impressive.

1404
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:36,360
Magic I think is as cool and advanced as you can get with analog,

1405
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,240
this analog style. Right. That's what I liked about it. It's like, yeah,

1406
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:44,480
it feels like a next evolution of, of electrical parade.

1407
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,360
And I liked that Florida had their own thing.

1408
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,080
I like that you don't just go there and see the same thing. Yeah. Uh,

1409
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,760
and being from California, I know the major electrical parade, this,

1410
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,760
I don't know. And I do remember like after all this ragging, I do,

1411
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,000
I remember watching it when I was seven and I don't remember a lot.

1412
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:04,320
I think it speaks to these parades in general that I remember watching

1413
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,920
electrical parade when I was like four. I remember watching this when I was seven.

1414
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:11,360
They're so striking from times where I can barely remember any of it,

1415
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:15,640
but I remember where I was. I remember my view of main streets specifically.

1416
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,480
That's how I think there's something really magical about your,

1417
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,200
you're up at night. You maybe aren't a lot when you're,

1418
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:26,000
when you're in your part of that's like the culmination of a big exciting day

1419
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,960
and you're a little fatigued, but it's a, uh, uh, you know,

1420
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,800
it's kind of the last thing you do. There's some magic to the weariness and, uh,

1421
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:39,200
yeah, that's still the case. Yeah. Yeah, totally. When you're out at like at 11 P

1422
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:42,160
whenever we saw the, uh, a mainstream electrical parade, it was like,

1423
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,320
I don't know what was a later show. I think it was,

1424
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:48,720
and you're like a little punchy. Your brain's a little bit more like accepting of

1425
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:52,240
like, yeah, this is real. Uh, and then yeah, you're just like, uh,

1426
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,640
everything's better. I'm tired,

1427
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,720
but not like bad tired cause you're still at the park.

1428
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:03,480
Yeah, totally. So yeah. Look, nice things to say. It's not.

1429
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:08,160
Yeah. Light magic is definitely worse. Unpleasant.

1430
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,720
Oh, well let's, you know,

1431
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,720
we haven't talked about is the fact that they win the parade.

1432
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,760
There was a lengthy hiatus and then it came back and they stopped using the doll

1433
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:21,880
faces. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Spectrum in there more. They were face characters.

1434
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,440
You would say, um, not unamended.

1435
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,600
It's essentially like white face paint and then mixed with like a big plastic,

1436
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:35,400
uh, chins and noses. Now, if you're thinking that sounds equally as creepy,

1437
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:39,400
I think quite possibly, I think you would have, I,

1438
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,440
I don't think it's a done deal that the doll faces are creepier than the second

1439
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,960
version, the face version.

1440
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,000
To me they were creepier. I don't really remember much of the second version.

1441
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,840
I'm sure I saw it at least once. Um,

1442
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,080
the watching it now, I, they,

1443
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:01,880
they looked like the guys with David S pumpkins. That's what I jumped to.

1444
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,760
They reminded me of that. Um, but the break dancers. Yeah.

1445
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,200
Yeah. The skeletons who break dance. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah.

1446
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,320
You know what they look like is I reference this from time to time,

1447
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,560
mother goose rock and rhyme. Uh,

1448
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,960
there's this weird like torture sequence, uh, in a dungeon.

1449
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:22,920
And there's these sort of like mime ish characters who do tickle the lead

1450
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:26,760
character Gordon until he then that's the torture. It's like,

1451
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,400
one of those things that you watch now and just like, uh, oh, this, like,

1452
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,760
oh, this is okay. And when you as a child, this is the scariest scene.

1453
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,560
This is hellraiser. Yeah. Um, but they, whatever those characters are,

1454
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,440
it's very, it's, it's very Cirque du Soleil as well. And again,

1455
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,720
kind of light magic ish. Right. I don't like this either. The new, yeah,

1456
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:51,480
the newer spectrum men, definitely the costume looks more cohesive.

1457
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,760
They obviously identified those weird old masks are bad or looked weird.

1458
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,720
Yeah. It did. It looked like they were thrown together. Now. Yes.

1459
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,080
Does it make it less creepy? That's up to you.

1460
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:06,960
That's up to you the listener to decide, but I do think it looks more

1461
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:11,320
of a piece more. Yeah. That's what I'll say.

1462
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,720
This is a weird one. Like honey, I shrunk the kids for me. Um,

1463
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,800
the honey guys shrunk the kids play area. Um,

1464
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,160
in that it's stuck around longer than I thought where I'm like, Oh,

1465
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:26,120
there's high definition footage of this. Yeah. Oh yeah. And then I watched

1466
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,640
a production from 1992 and it looks like a snuff film.

1467
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,800
Got to adds to the aesthetic of the spectrum and creeps. Um,

1468
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,400
you know what they look like? Also is the, are you, uh,

1469
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:44,240
is anybody familiar off hand with the David Bowie ashes to ashes video?

1470
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,320
Is it kind of like harlequin mode? I mean, look at that costume.

1471
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,680
Oh, right, right, right. Right. It's a good,

1472
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,160
it's almost like they said make these characters look like the ashes to ashes

1473
01:17:55,160 --> 01:18:00,160
video, right? Which this is cool and I admire it and I love the song.

1474
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,880
I don't know that this I'd want to see,

1475
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:08,640
I don't think when they passed away, that's the phrase. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1476
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:14,160
Um, uh, yeah, I think when he passed away, people weren't like, Oh yeah,

1477
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:18,320
I remember. I'll always remember him as a weird comedian, Delarte clown.

1478
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,760
Uh, you know what I think also part of it is I do think it not being creepy

1479
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:31,120
music makes it creepier. Do you know what I mean?

1480
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:35,160
No. Yeah. You know what? When you see either set of spectrum in,

1481
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:40,200
what you should be hearing is the Danny Elfman score when the clowns are,

1482
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:45,160
uh, destroying Pee Wee's bike and Pee Wee's adventure.

1483
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,040
Yes.

1484
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:51,200
But like demented, uh, creepy carnival.

1485
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,200
Like if you, you would just know what you were getting into.

1486
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,200
If that was the music, these guys showed up.

1487
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:58,200
Even just even as something like a riff off of the opening,

1488
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,200
like the Batman theme from Batman returns when Batman's fighting all the clown

1489
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:07,200
gang at the start where it's like, at least it like is a little creepy.

1490
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:10,200
Yeah. It's obviously not that you wouldn't use the Batman theme,

1491
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:13,200
but still it doesn't suggest it.

1492
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,200
So almost like we would still be saying these creepy doll face men are creepy,

1493
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:20,200
but there's something it doesn't suggest it.

1494
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,200
So it's like, they're trying to hide how creepy they are.

1495
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,200
Or they're not aware of it or something.

1496
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,200
Or they're not aware of it.

1497
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:30,200
Either set of spectrum in could be Batman villain goons.

1498
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,200
Yes.

1499
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:35,200
A couple of them choose your villain choose you want to serve.

1500
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,200
You fit aesthetically with a number of them.

1501
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,200
Well, it could yeah.

1502
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:43,200
Be a classic or a newer one, like professor pig, of course,

1503
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,200
which is he's what?

1504
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,200
10 years old at this point, 12 years old.

1505
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,200
Something like that.

1506
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,200
Yeah.

1507
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,200
So it could be any kind of Batman villain, but yeah,

1508
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,200
it doesn't fit with the other characters.

1509
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,200
It doesn't seem like a character that would be in the other cartoon,

1510
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,200
like an animated movie.

1511
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,200
So yes, it's just God, they,

1512
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:02,200
there's gotta be pins Jason was showing where they're kind of like,

1513
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,200
Oh, there's gotta be pins Jason was showing where they're kind of drawn.

1514
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,200
That doesn't help.

1515
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,200
They're scary as a drawing.

1516
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:12,200
The, the, um, pieces, by the way,

1517
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:16,200
it's a miracle that they saved any pieces because, you know,

1518
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:21,200
they admit it after this closed in 2010, the, uh,

1519
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:24,200
floats sat backstage and I was there.

1520
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
They were like in temporary, like tent,

1521
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,200
like they were not well protected by the elements.

1522
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,200
They just, the float pretty much just rotted away.

1523
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,200
Yes.

1524
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:35,200
And in 2013, Disney just went, the parade is retired.

1525
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,200
That's all they said.

1526
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,200
And then a year later they started selling the piece pins,

1527
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:44,200
which go for like 50 bucks or more on eBay.

1528
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,200
Hmm.

1529
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,200
Is that the most expensive Spectro magic merch?

1530
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,200
Uh, it seems like it.

1531
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,200
I saw one that was $5 and it seemed like it was broken.

1532
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,200
It was missing the piece.

1533
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,200
It might be worth a check.

1534
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,200
I'm looking right now.

1535
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,200
Yeah.

1536
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,200
Yeah.

1537
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,200
There's a little, uh, souvenir showdown, uh, Smackdown.

1538
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,200
Yeah.

1539
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:05,200
They just, uh, they left the parade out in the rain is what happened.

1540
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,200
This thing that ran for decades.

1541
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:12,200
Then it just kind of, it kind of rotted away and not the things that should have.

1542
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,200
The parade itself was nice.

1543
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,200
The floats were nice.

1544
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:19,200
The depictions of little mermaid and the dwarf's mine and Schoeneberg,

1545
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,200
these were all cool.

1546
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,200
It is the Spectra men who should rot.

1547
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,200
And who knows what happened to them.

1548
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,200
Again, they might be loose.

1549
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,200
They might be on your block.

1550
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,200
They might be on my block.

1551
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,200
They might be behind Jason right now.

1552
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,200
They aren't, but they aren't there.

1553
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:41,200
But, but you know, who is here raggedy and raggedy Andy worse, worse,

1554
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,200
worse.

1555
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:48,200
I'm trying to find there's something 400 and you text us or so.

1556
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,200
Get over here.

1557
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,200
Get over here.

1558
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,200
You're like writing a book.

1559
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,200
So over here, get over here.

1560
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,200
You're like writing a major movie right now.

1561
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,200
Are you like bored?

1562
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,200
Go to party city.

1563
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,200
Here's what it looks like.

1564
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,200
Here's what you got to do.

1565
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,200
I'm Venmoing you fifty dollars.

1566
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:11,200
This there's like there's like a five hundred dollar like print of Spectra magic.

1567
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,200
Oh, that like depicts the Spectra men.

1568
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,200
I don't know if this is a fish.

1569
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,200
It's it's acting like it's official.

1570
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:21,200
It depicts the Spectra men in a much cuter way.

1571
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,200
This is fascinating to me.

1572
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,200
They're like these cute little you see this from here.

1573
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,200
Oh, I have seen I believe that is official.

1574
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:35,200
OK, because like that is a much different that makes a lot of sense.

1575
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,200
They're like these cute little like great gazoo kind of sprite characters.

1576
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,200
Great Gazoo cute.

1577
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,200
Oh, yeah.

1578
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,200
Yeah.

1579
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,200
Oh, yeah.

1580
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,200
Oh, yeah.

1581
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,200
Oh, yeah.

1582
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,200
This is confusing me.

1583
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,200
My answer is not no.

1584
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:54,200
But I don't think he's even meant to be cute because the persona he's like 80 years old.

1585
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,200
Right.

1586
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,200
I think it's weird to go.

1587
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,200
Yeah.

1588
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,200
Yeah.

1589
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,200
I think so.

1590
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,200
No question.

1591
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,200
Yeah.

1592
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,200
He's a little stinger.

1593
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:06,200
Are we letting our love for the great gazoo get in the way of saying I don't think you're

1594
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,200
cute?

1595
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,200
I don't even know.

1596
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,200
The word is not.

1597
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,200
Let me look at him.

1598
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,200
I guess.

1599
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,200
I guess I could say I think that is too definitive.

1600
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,200
No, he's cute.

1601
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,200
He's little.

1602
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,200
He's got a big head.

1603
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,200
No, he's cute.

1604
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,200
I guess.

1605
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,200
Very, very cute.

1606
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,200
All right.

1607
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,200
All right.

1608
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,200
The listeners will agree that the great gazoo is very cute.

1609
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,200
You know, I guess I'd have to vote.

1610
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,200
I just.

1611
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,200
He's mean.

1612
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,200
I honestly think it's mean.

1613
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,200
You can keep me mean and cute.

1614
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:35,200
Honestly, my feeling of him without looking right at him, I actually think he's cuter when

1615
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,200
I'm looking at this photo because he's so mean.

1616
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,200
I actually think he comes down a peg in my memory.

1617
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:44,200
He's always calling Fred, hello, dumb dumb.

1618
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,200
He's always calling him an idiot.

1619
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,200
It's not cute behavior.

1620
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,200
Yeah.

1621
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:52,200
But then I'm, you know, like I shouldn't judge that because I in a weird way think that Barney

1622
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,200
Rubble is cute.

1623
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,200
Is that insane?

1624
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,200
No, but like a little simple guy.

1625
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:02,200
He's the most simpleton, you know, he's got he's got rocks for brains.

1626
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,200
That's all it's in part.

1627
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,200
He's got a rubble in his head.

1628
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,200
Barney is cuter than Fred for sure.

1629
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:11,200
Fred is not cute, but that's that's not what Fred's after.

1630
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,200
Right.

1631
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,200
That's not what he's going for.

1632
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,200
There's no criticism.

1633
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,200
Mm hmm.

1634
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,200
No criticism of Fred.

1635
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,200
I like them all.

1636
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:22,200
I texted you both this picture and they both this is this gives me a very different perception.

1637
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,200
I don't want to do this right towards I assume the end of the episode.

1638
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,200
It better be.

1639
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,200
But this gives me a much I love this print, by the way.

1640
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,200
Mickey is full on in the Liberace outfit.

1641
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:36,200
He's got the thing, the hot the get whatever the store is.

1642
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,200
Not hot topic Spencer's Gifts.

1643
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,200
Thank you.

1644
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,200
Lightning.

1645
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,200
There was a show called Gadzooks or something.

1646
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,200
Oh Gadzooks.

1647
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,200
Imaginarium.

1648
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,200
Imaginarium.

1649
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,200
Sure.

1650
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,840
And there's these little there they look they're short.

1651
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,520
They're like great Kazoo size.

1652
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:52,240
They all have like kind of like froey wigs with different colors.

1653
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:57,480
They're really fun designs and they're wearing the Spectro men outfits.

1654
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,480
These are much better.

1655
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,480
Yeah.

1656
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,640
Something about size proportionate like limiting detail.

1657
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,640
Yeah.

1658
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:03,640
They're great.

1659
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,640
They're real.

1660
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,640
The way it was found to depict these characters is not horrible monsters.

1661
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:14,040
And it makes sense with the way you were describing them with like the giggling and they're mischievous.

1662
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,800
This makes much more sense when you look at these type characters who look kind of like

1663
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,080
little kid type characters.

1664
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,080
Cute little stinkers.

1665
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,080
You know what?

1666
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,080
I'm real.

1667
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,720
I think I follow Morgan Ditta or Ditta.

1668
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:28,880
I don't know how to pronounce it, but I follow her on Twitter.

1669
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,560
She's done work for like Imagineering and like done these prints.

1670
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,520
They do those like art prints.

1671
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,520
Right.

1672
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,960
Sometimes like that's what this is.

1673
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,280
It's one of those prints.

1674
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:42,520
So maybe this is just yeah this is like from this is like based on the original art and

1675
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:48,040
they decided to portray them in the worst way they could possibly portray these characters

1676
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:51,160
because I could say just initially that I like these characters.

1677
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,160
I like the look of them.

1678
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,160
Like if that's all you knew.

1679
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,160
Right.

1680
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,160
All right.

1681
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,680
So it's styled by Morgan Ditta.

1682
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,640
The Spectremen are fine.

1683
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,640
Right.

1684
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,360
But as because I think you're right.

1685
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:05,440
I think it's an age that I think they're if they're like younger and smaller.

1686
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,440
OK.

1687
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:10,880
But the idea that the Spectremen are adults look like that.

1688
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:11,880
Yeah.

1689
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,520
Horrible.

1690
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,600
And then the idea that they were forced to look this way that their faces were carved

1691
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,560
up at the request of Mickey Mouse, which is what I'm increasingly sure happened.

1692
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,840
It does seem to be the case.

1693
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:24,840
Yeah.

1694
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,240
I think the evidence is there.

1695
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,400
And they haunted me as a child much like it chapter one.

1696
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:34,520
And then they came back around us as I'm driving around Los Angeles like it chapter two.

1697
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,160
It's been a plague on me.

1698
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,160
Boy.

1699
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,160
Yeah.

1700
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:48,920
If you like deep faked a Spectremen, say, lowball into it and just the same movie, no

1701
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:49,920
change.

1702
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,920
Oh, just replace Pennywise.

1703
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:52,920
Yeah.

1704
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:53,920
Yeah.

1705
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:54,920
Maybe it could be a lot scarier.

1706
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,920
Yeah.

1707
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:56,920
A lot scarier.

1708
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:01,800
Well, if anybody gets a Disney Plus meeting, we should go in with the Spectremen.

1709
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:07,840
Because we pitch things a lot, but we don't really like do the like like genre.

1710
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,360
And that seems like an intriguing pitch.

1711
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,360
You know, like we're here.

1712
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,400
We're hearing all about Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

1713
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,160
But yeah, serious Spectremen.

1714
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,160
But it's scary.

1715
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,160
It's intentionally.

1716
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,160
Uh huh.

1717
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:22,160
Yeah, no, I think that's right.

1718
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,160
Right.

1719
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,680
And Disney Plus is not representing horror.

1720
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:25,680
They don't even realize.

1721
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:26,680
Yeah, that's true.

1722
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:32,120
They deep in the Disney archives lurk some of the scariest characters ever do.

1723
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,600
I guess it's for Hulu.

1724
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1725
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,600
It'll be for Hulu.

1726
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,600
Oh, yeah.

1727
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,440
It goes next to American Horror Story.

1728
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,720
Could be an American Horror Story.

1729
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,200
American Horror Story Spectremen.

1730
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,200
Spectremen.

1731
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,200
Spectremen, yeah.

1732
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,960
Ryan, I know you're listening.

1733
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,640
Pick up the phone.

1734
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,080
We see the names of the subscribers.

1735
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,960
We saw when Ryan Murphy showed up.

1736
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,960
That's right.

1737
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:53,960
Come on.

1738
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:54,960
Come on.

1739
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:55,960
Come on.

1740
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:56,960
Come on.

1741
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:57,960
Come on.

1742
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:58,960
All right.

1743
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,160
You survived podcast The Ride.

1744
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,160
I'm sorry.

1745
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,120
You survived haunt cast The Fright.

1746
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,240
The first haunt cast The Fright.

1747
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,320
Now we're in it.

1748
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,400
What other horrors await throughout this month?

1749
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,480
We will soon find out.

1750
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,280
I think we've got good stuff lined up, fun stuff lined up.

1751
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,880
I think we know what all of them are yet.

1752
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,360
The ones we know I think are...

1753
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,360
The ones we know are good.

1754
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,360
We know Haunted Mansion that we know.

1755
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:28,840
That'll be the end of the month and then everything in between will be a surprise and hopefully

1756
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,000
not scary surprises.

1757
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:37,320
Which we made it through the episode without for now.

1758
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:41,560
Hopefully Jason doesn't drive home and force Spectrum Men to pop out of it.

1759
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,280
I see something in my rear view mirror.

1760
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,280
No.

1761
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:45,280
Are we asleep?

1762
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,280
No.

1763
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:53,920
Somebody snuck your car keys out of your pocket with a hanger while we were recording, went

1764
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,320
into your car, Spectrum Men, get in.

1765
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,320
Then return them.

1766
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,320
Wait a minute.

1767
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,640
Jason gets in.

1768
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:05,160
Yeah, there's this three Spectrum Men in the back and one in the passenger seat.

1769
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:10,560
They just all turn their heads in unison to look at me and go, hee hee hee.

1770
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,600
You can use the carpool lane.

1771
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,600
All right.

1772
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:21,600
Put on the Disney dish, Jason.

1773
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,600
Goodbye.
