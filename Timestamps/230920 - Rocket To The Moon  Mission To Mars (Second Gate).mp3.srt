1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,340
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,160
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,320
where today we're going totally 80s,

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,760
by which I mean a ride from the 50s,

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,460
set in the 80s, which was the future of the 50s.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,340
I'm Scott Gerritner, joined by Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,580
Hi, I'm here, and even though I know exactly

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,840
what you're talking about, I'm working

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,500
without what you just said in my mind.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,830
It's pretty, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,360
It's a tad complicated, but you know,

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,640
not really once we get into it.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:44,880
No, no.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,680
Jason Sheridan, hi.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,900
And a version of this ride was active in the 80s.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,380
Yeah, the 90s.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,140
The 90s.

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,360
The 90s.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,680
Made it into the 90s.

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,360
That's true.

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,380
You rode it a couple times in Florida in the 90s.

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,740
Okay, yeah, I did not.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,900
I don't think I made, or I was like somehow,

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,640
it would have been there still at Disneyland,

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,520
Mission to Mars, that is, first time I went,

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,440
but I was probably scared of,

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,260
even though it wasn't a thrill attraction,

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,700
I don't think they're taking a five-year-old on that.

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,880
Oh yeah, that's interesting.

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,440
Or whatever it was, yeah.

31
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,640
Would you have been scared

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,380
because of the idea of lifting off?

33
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,220
Yeah, you know what, I wonder if a lot of people

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,240
had this reaction, and again, I didn't go on this ride,

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,260
I wonder if this is the kind of ride

36
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,620
where you expect some shit to go down,

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,540
but then, like it has an air as if,

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,740
and then watch out and all the seats are gonna drop

39
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,160
or it's gonna start spinning around like a centrifuge,

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,160
but kind of nothing actually happens.

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,540
It seems exceptionally stationary.

42
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,020
Oh my God.

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,400
Except for a moment of vibration or two.

44
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,100
I think so.

45
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,020
I've said this before on the show,

46
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,740
that at Pirates Cove, which is a local little place

47
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,840
that I went, a theme park I went to as a kid,

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,140
they had a UFO ride.

49
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:01,780
Yeah.

50
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,960
And it was tiny and it probably could fit 20 people,

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
25 people, and all it was was you got on,

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,780
there was a screen that showed the UFO like lifting off

53
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,140
from like a third camera, like a different camera,

54
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,720
and you went into space, and it was certainly,

55
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,360
the weather on the video was different

56
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,160
than the weather that was outside.

57
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,720
Sure.

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,000
It scared the shit out of me as a kid,

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,320
as a four or five year old,

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,380
because I thought we were leaving the earth.

61
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,480
Yeah, that's a whole dimension of, you know,

62
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,400
I forget, and I'm gonna start to experience this

63
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,940
as I head towards those ages with my son,

64
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,460
but that, you know, even if you say

65
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,360
the ride doesn't do anything scary,

66
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,780
some of it is psychological, some of it is the illusion.

67
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,780
I could see the light coming in through the door.

68
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,740
I saw the light around the door,

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,880
and I remember even like, I think,

70
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,000
telling myself like,

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,820
well, that's probably, it's the light from outside,

72
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,820
we haven't actually gone anywhere,

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,560
but I still, it freaked me out so bad.

74
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,640
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
This isn't the world,

76
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,680
although how old are we talking?

77
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,760
I think five, but, but, could have been eight or nine.

78
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,720
Could have been.

79
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,420
I think it's important, again, again,

80
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,820
as I start to remember what happens at what ages,

81
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,560
I think it's important to not, you know,

82
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,080
yes, are we good boys?

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Yes, we're scared of a lot of things.

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,720
Yeah.

85
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,780
We can cut ourselves some slack for some of those early,

86
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,480
this stuff is scary, stuff is psychologically scary.

87
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,120
And you never know what is gonna be with which kid,

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,560
like, my sister did not have nearly like,

89
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,940
these reactions that I did, for whatever reason.

90
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,780
Well, scary, I think too, I,

91
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,840
it's a compliment to the creators in that, like,

92
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,820
when they would tell me, they're like,

93
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,920
all right, you're going to space,

94
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,540
I was like, holy shit,

95
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,800
well, that's an adult telling me,

96
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
or an adult robot telling me.

97
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,220
If it was a robot, it was smaller than you than whatever,

98
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,240
but a big towering robot.

99
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,160
So I'm just buying it hook, line and sinker.

100
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,020
Yeah.

101
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,460
There's a magic to that age where you just,

102
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,120
you just buy it.

103
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:01,800
Trust adults.

104
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,020
All adults for whatever reason.

105
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,480
I was gonna say, in horror fiction,

106
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,340
I was like, yeah, there's a magic that goes on too long

107
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,640
if you don't have enough going on, you know.

108
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,600
I need to go to college, it's very important for me.

109
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,940
Oh, okay, I guess.

110
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,500
The power of illusion.

111
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,260
Who would have known?

112
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,140
Complete waste of money.

113
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,960
Okay, so today is part of kind of,

114
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,300
we're heading back into the orbit of something

115
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,060
that we said earlier in the year.

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,860
There was a declaration that was,

117
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,600
this will be the year of Tomorrowland.

118
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,280
We're gonna do a lot of Tomorrowland stuff.

119
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,740
We're gonna tackle the Tomorrowland problem.

120
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,160
We have not made good on that at all.

121
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,600
No.

122
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,600
And look, I don't know, it was a soft promise.

123
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,520
I didn't mean to, and we, look, we did Vegas,

124
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,540
and Vegas was a lot of fun.

125
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,940
We had a lot of guests we wanted to get to,

126
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,060
various other shiny distracting objects.

127
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,740
But we remain committed to this goal.

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Will it eek into next year?

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,380
Almost certainly.

130
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,500
But look, I still like the idea of it,

131
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,740
and that's why we're going back to Tomorrowland today

132
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,760
with some old school stuff.

133
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,740
I said I have an idea for us to do to fix Tomorrowland.

134
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,960
I don't want to reveal it here,

135
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,040
but I think we can get to that by the end of the year.

136
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,440
Sure.

137
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,180
So we'll be doing things.

138
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
The things will happen.

139
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,340
Well, also, like in the spirit of the way

140
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,920
the Disney company sometimes treats Tomorrowland,

141
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,760
we're like, oh yeah, yeah, let's get back around to that.

142
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,940
We do have to do that at some point.

143
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,100
Or we could, I don't know,

144
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,600
we could redo the tree house for no particular reason.

145
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,980
Yeah, kind of the way America and the world at large

146
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,540
is like, oh, the future.

147
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,540
Yeah, I guess we should think about that.

148
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,720
It's a heady thing to think about.

149
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,040
Should we paint some parts of Tomorrowland?

150
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,620
Or I don't know, let's just add Baymax to California Adventure.

151
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,540
Yeah, okay, let's just do it.

152
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,820
We'll sell some more Baymax merch.

153
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,120
Let's put a bunch of Japanese text under English text

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,000
and call it a new land.

155
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,760
Yeah, it's a land.

156
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,840
It's a land now.

157
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,560
There you go.

158
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,420
Hey, yank out those Tomorrowland ferns, plant cabbages.

159
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,200
Hey, look, everything's edible now.

160
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,440
Nice, nice.

161
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,740
You're referring to the Tomorrowland 98 redo.

162
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,000
Right.

163
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,820
Where, unless I'm wrong, where like,

164
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,820
well, part of our future theme is that everything is edible,

165
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,160
so all of the plants that you see will be.

166
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,040
I think you could just pick it up and eat it.

167
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,800
Can I do that?

168
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,840
No, absolutely not.

169
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,140
Do not do that.

170
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,380
Do not reach out to the planter.

171
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,880
Am I thinking about something else?

172
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,780
No, that's what I was referring to.

173
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,340
And that was a true full redo, and that's what we got,

175
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,600
was edible plants.

176
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,000
There's a lot to get to.

177
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,540
What's that?

178
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,860
Rust-colored buildings and edible plants.

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,280
Yes, and also cigarette butts and some of those planters,

180
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,560
because it's still the late 90s, you know?

181
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,420
Sure.

182
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,500
Yeah, and maybe we're avoiding Tomorrowland things for a reason,

183
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,480
because we're going to be cranks about it.

184
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,280
Understandably.

185
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,420
It's a land where some of the best attractions of all time have lived,

186
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,660
some of the best aesthetics in any of the parks have lived,

187
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,160
and then also a bunch of junk.

188
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,740
It's always been the case,

189
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,920
and we need to keep working and diagnose the problem.

190
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,460
Are you specifically referring to Disneyland?

191
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,240
Because Disney World, they injected a bunch of money into in the 90s.

192
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,780
I called Tomorrowland 94, I think they called you Tomorrowland.

193
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,420
Well, I know that, Chase.

194
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,140
You don't need to explain that to me.

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,400
It's up there, it's up there.

196
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,240
It's one of mine.

197
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
It's in better shape in some ways.

198
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,140
Better shape.

199
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,240
But they've also let that aesthetic kind of decay a little bit too.

200
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,880
It's not as fully there as it was in 94, 95.

201
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,060
I like those crystals.

202
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,240
I'm on record.

203
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,580
I like those things coming out, whatever you call them.

204
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,500
The big jutting out rocks at the entrance?

205
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,520
I like that.

206
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,440
Okay, sure.

207
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,500
So they got those.

208
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:04,940
Yeah.

209
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,360
But they've kind of tamped it down.

210
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,160
They've made it a little more restrained than the loud neon greens and purples,

211
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,120
and doodads and stuff.

212
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,300
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

213
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,120
I think somewhere before they started doing that, they're all full of…

214
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,740
We'll talk about one of them today with the Moonliner,

215
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,200
but they're all full of like, here's what Tomorrowland is now.

216
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,240
This is what it's going to be.

217
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,100
It's going to be this forever.

218
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,120
Three years later, I don't know, put this up.

219
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,080
I don't know, this is here.

220
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,720
Something that doesn't match any of the rest of it.

221
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,900
Yeah, it's like you're doing the Macarena, you know, pretty quickly.

222
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,060
There was months where it was like, it's going to be Star Wars now.

223
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,460
It's just going to be Star Wars.

224
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,080
It's a Star Wars holding pen.

225
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,680
Yeah, it's going to be the Millennium Falcon.

226
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,600
The Star Wars themed lounge.

227
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,300
Tomorrowland means Star Wars.

228
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,820
That was going to be it for a few months.

229
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,740
Oh, you mean if they were going to…

230
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,140
I meant before Galaxy's Edge, that was the plan.

231
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,700
Oh, sure.

232
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,560
Millennium Falcon on the top of the whatever people mover track.

233
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,800
Would have been okay.

234
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,280
I don't know.

235
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,160
I mean, okay, it would have gotten some money and it would be fresh.

236
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,560
But it's at least, yeah, I mean, the hopeful thing is that you get a whole new Star Wars.

237
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,060
Sorry, it's the Star Wars, this area of park we didn't even have before.

238
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,960
And then Tomorrowland also gets a big refresh.

239
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,880
Right, which the rumor…

240
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,060
And yet…

241
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,860
Every year, that's the rumor.

242
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,560
There's a rumor here, all sorts of rumors.

243
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,220
Who's working on it, what it is.

244
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,520
There's a little piece in the Imagineering doc.

245
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,660
You see that Joe Roady picks up a thing and actually that's for Tomorrowland.

246
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,960
I think that's Space Mountain's track.

247
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,140
Oh my God, he's doing it.

248
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,640
We're doing it.

249
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,340
Let's go.

250
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,760
Joe Roady walking around.

251
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,740
Yes, Joe Roady's walking around.

252
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,120
He's counting steps and he's counting the amount of track he needs to put the people mover back in.

253
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,980
And as soon as he counts, he finishes counting.

254
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,720
We're getting it.

255
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,140
It's coming.

256
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,880
He's doing one of his beautiful illustrations that he like jots out in 30 seconds and is

257
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,760
more beautiful than anything I've put pen to paper to in my life.

258
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,420
Your way your bar is beating you.

259
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,000
Joe Roady is a better artist than me, Jason.

260
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:08,020
No, no, I mean like if I tried my hardest to make such a masterpiece today, better than

261
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,880
what he just like shits out.

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,440
His Post-It notes are like, well, that's stunning.

263
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:21,140
He drew on his Instagram, he posted pictures where he was drawing on a dusty car, like

264
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,560
in the dirt and dust.

265
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,100
Drawing with dust?

266
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,760
Drawing with dirt and dust, like drew like a landscape or something.

267
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,360
So, Roady's Dustlands, turn it into Roady's Dustlands, do anything.

268
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,600
They're going to make it all with dust.

269
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,640
Well, I'm sure the future is bright now with all the headlines we're getting about the

270
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,300
Disney company.

271
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,020
I'm sure they'll put all of it, everything they got right into.

272
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,980
Man, I really, there's like so much Apple, like selling to Apple rumors.

273
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,140
And then there's some like fan, like fan fiction being created.

274
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,980
Well, you know what though, they should do, they just sell to Apple, but the parks will

275
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,380
be its own business.

276
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,480
And Apple won't own that.

277
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,400
And I'm like, that is not what's going to happen.

278
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,580
Why would that happen?

279
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,340
I don't know.

280
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,240
I like the idea of that.

281
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,540
Agreed.

282
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,280
I agree that that would be fun, but that's not going to, yeah, Apple's like, oh, we don't

283
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,620
want that theme parks that make tons of money over, like, why would that be?

284
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,500
Yeah, leave that out.

285
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,460
That's no thanks.

286
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,640
That's all we can do is advertise our product at these things indefinitely forever.

287
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,020
Yeah.

288
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,560
Oh yes.

289
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,340
And that where there's all these like stray future areas where we're supposed to be like

290
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,480
letting you know about futuristic products and it all has stuff from 2012.

291
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:33,900
Yeah.

292
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,560
If you're lucky.

293
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,040
Right.

294
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,260
Apple would love to put Apple stuff in all of those.

295
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,540
Maybe that's the only way this gets done actually is if Apple buys it and they go, well, we

296
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,260
got a Tomorrowland.

297
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,340
Let's put the it'll be all app Apple land.

298
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:47,840
Sure.

299
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,780
Look, if it makes it all white again, then great.

300
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,000
Honestly, if everything looked like an Apple store, if it was a land that looked like a

301
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,620
big Apple store, it's better than what we got in most of them.

302
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,360
Yeah, sure.

303
00:11:59,560 --> 00:11:59,700
Some.

304
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,960
Yeah, that's probably right.

305
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,500
As long as the Mickey tumbling thing is still there.

306
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:03,980
Of course.

307
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,600
No, I know.

308
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Yeah, that needs to be carved out like a national park.

309
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,600
You don't touch that.

310
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:07,840
Right.

311
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,080
Right.

312
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:14,360
There was a period like 10 plus years ago or so now where when the Disney stores were

313
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,660
still in malls, they're like, we need to make these more appealing.

314
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:26,160
And they consulted with the Apple design team to like, how do you do store?

315
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,740
Like, and so if you remember a very small period where like the Disney stores were a

316
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,880
little more restrained and then they died.

317
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,820
I do remember that.

318
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

319
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,380
It was a bummer.

320
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,160
Yeah, no, we need our bit.

321
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,020
We need our giant plush piles and which day I just saw destination.

322
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,620
What is it called?

323
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,800
Destination D?

324
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,440
Yeah, they had like a big plush pile.

325
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,660
When you got there, like they remade the plush pile from the Disney stores.

326
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,300
This is a little kind of that.

327
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,800
This is like, how desperate are we?

328
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,900
Like I think that I paid a lot of money for they briefly have for a day.

329
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,940
They had a thing that used to be 10 minutes from me.

330
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,440
Vloggers.

331
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,280
I could always go to.

332
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,820
Please just make it look a little more busier in here so I could remember.

333
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,160
Hundreds of vloggers weeping at the foot of the plush pile at destination T.

334
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,680
This is why we don't get invited to stuff.

335
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,360
We won't go and cry at the plush pile, the foot of the plush pile.

336
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,760
I am baby again.

337
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,320
I'm mommy.

338
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,820
Mommy milk, please.

339
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,800
I have my plush.

340
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,860
I know I need my milk.

341
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,800
And I'll make 100 vloggers doing that.

342
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,540
They're all on the ground.

343
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,080
All with the camera on portrait mode.

344
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,500
We're here at the Oogie Boogie Bash and it's the bad guy from Big Hero 6.

345
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,060
And then we're just off to the side like who the fuck was the bad guy in Big Hero 6?

346
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,260
I remember the kid and I remember Baymax.

347
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,760
That is true.

348
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,520
I don't remember the villain.

349
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,820
I know what he looks like, but I don't remember who the villain was.

350
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,280
We're just so cold.

351
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,700
We don't we aren't ready to burst into tears.

352
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,180
Well, as Billy Corgan made the distinction on that podcast, he's not a Disney adult.

353
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,320
He's a Disneyland weirdo.

354
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,320
I like it.

355
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,180
I feel much closer to that.

356
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,460
Not that we don't like Disney movies.

357
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,880
Good distinction.

358
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,600
I like it.

359
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,080
Anyway, let's okay.

360
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:30,080
So if we're tracing this Tomorrowland problem, let's go way back all the way, almost all the way back at least to 1955.

361
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,540
This is some original Disneyland shit, some original Tomorrowland shit.

362
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,540
Rocket to the moon.

363
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,440
But this will this history will also include it kind of evolved or I don't know, kind of.

364
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,840
It changed at least into some other rocket to the moon, flight to the moon, mission to Mars.

365
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,380
I think it's all one thing.

366
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,020
But if we start digging in and we're like, flight, there's a lot to flight.

367
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,080
We can we can certainly splinter it up.

368
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,780
Why we undersold flight?

369
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,100
But we'll see.

370
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,120
Let's see where it goes.

371
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,800
But basically, let's start calling this rocket to the moon and see where we land.

372
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,260
Sure.

373
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,820
Yeah.

374
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,580
This is unlike the sword episode we did recently where we're like we're peeling off soaring around the world.

375
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:24,560
This one within five or ten minutes of reading about these attractions, I was like, these three share one Wikipedia entry and one yesterlain page.

376
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,260
That's what I thought.

377
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,840
Exactly.

378
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,580
Because initially before we knew anything, we're like, and then mission Mars is its own thing.

379
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,580
Yeah, mission Mars would be its own thing.

380
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,020
Yeah, for sure.

381
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,600
Yeah, I think so.

382
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,500
And then we all start reading and like, is it?

383
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,040
There's almost is no space on the Wikipedia.

384
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,180
And if we're wrong, tell us we're wrong.

385
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,140
If we're if we do all of this and we're missing a big area of something that's great about one of these, then let us know.

386
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,560
The podcast.

387
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,220
Smack us in the face.

388
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,020
Yeah, you might.

389
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,060
Yeah, let us know.

390
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,660
I mean, a mission Mars is its own episode, but you'll get a 30 minute chunk of like the update on my Larkana collection.

391
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,980
That's what's going to happen if it's its own episode, which is fine.

392
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:06,160
But you know, it's funny is between recording whichever that was in and it coming out, I saw comments about I'm glad Mike's doing Larkana.

393
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,540
I between that, I forgot what Larkana is.

394
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,800
It's one of those things.

395
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,280
I have my Instagram.

396
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,200
No, a collectible card game.

397
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,160
Oh, right.

398
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,660
It was it's you're saying it's a new it's a magic.

399
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,860
It's like a magic gathering collectible card game.

400
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,440
And yeah, like anything.

401
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,800
Just so you know, say whatever you want.

402
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,240
Anything you say after this, I will not remember and ask you about in several episodes.

403
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,760
That's OK.

404
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,400
I'm not offended.

405
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,080
But it's got like a new art things and like Mickey's in like a different wizard's outfit and stuff.

406
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,340
So like they've recontextualized the characters even had like Mickey.

407
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,320
Yeah, Mickey's in it.

408
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,840
That's how much I was not paying attention.

409
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,340
Like little John will be able to like give Cruella de Vil a concussion.

410
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,120
Is that?

411
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,300
Well, that sounds interesting.

412
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,080
Yeah, they have different powers and like different abilities.

413
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,680
So, yeah, you can.

414
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,600
I don't know that it's specifically a little John is a TKO punch or anything.

415
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,680
But can I get a card that's X-rays of characters with broken?

416
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:10,680
Well, maybe in the second wave of you're not going to if you have Bianca and Bernard in your deck, their fatality together is really impressive.

417
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,420
They rip out.

418
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,980
They rip out someone's throat and eat it.

419
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,060
They go inside their body and know.

420
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,360
From the inside.

421
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,300
And then right.

422
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:18,960
Wow.

423
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,300
And then each of them go out one eye socket.

424
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:31,080
Much like the downtown Disney ordeal flick from a bugs life goes into your eithra and destroys a person from the inside.

425
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,800
What a specific poll from our own continuity.

426
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,560
Yeah, of course.

427
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,540
I'll never forget what happened to Mitch on that episode.

428
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,880
Eurethral matters.

429
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:41,580
Yeah.

430
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,760
OK.

431
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,000
But it's not Lorcan.

432
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,740
Feel free to do that.

433
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:52,520
If you want to do the episode without me, if you want to do an official or can probably will do or I'll just be or do it at my place and I'll just like zone out.

434
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,540
Yeah, I'll just be in the recliner and kind of nod off.

435
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:05,780
We did try years and years ago to play Mike's old Marvel at a game called Overpower, which is like Marvel Marvel from the 90s.

436
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,000
And you will not believe how quickly people tapped out on this thing.

437
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,720
So I don't still don't know how to play.

438
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,060
Still, it's impossible.

439
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,160
It's a little confusing.

440
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,080
OK, so broad strokes.

441
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:29,880
I mean, the reason as we teased in the Soren episode, I think there's there's some notable stuff about this attraction, especially the first one from 55.

442
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,160
I do think this is the first Disney screen ride.

443
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,380
It's notable for that.

444
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:43,340
I think there's a number of things that make it like, oh, this did kind of set the stage for this attraction, that attraction, often Tomorrowland stuff.

445
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:52,580
And so in the biggest way, the fact that this is the first Disneyland attraction where you go to space, which there have been many since.

446
00:18:52,700 --> 00:19:03,700
So it's it's notable, I'd say, for that and that the main source of it's it's round auditoriums that make you feel like you're going inside a spaceship and you have screens.

447
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,640
But screen around screens, one up at the top and one down at the bottom.

448
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,380
And one shows you where you've been and one shows you where you're going to talk like Doc Brown a little bit.

449
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,680
But that's that that seems that's like what I knew before I started looking into anymore.

450
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,300
Yeah, it's interesting.

451
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:23,760
I wonder.

452
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,920
Yeah, like there were probably I guess like if you really like what's the first screen?

453
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,440
It's like some maybe it's the train coming out in the movie theater.

454
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,640
That's really the first.

455
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,140
Oh, yeah.

456
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,040
From the first moving picture.

457
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,580
Oh, yeah.

458
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,840
Can we do an episode about that?

459
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,460
I think we could.

460
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,080
Yeah.

461
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,480
But yeah, this is the first like big attraction that's recorded.

462
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,660
Maybe there's a World's Fair thing or something that was vaguely like this.

463
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,940
But yeah, well, yeah, I bet there's something else that uses like you feel like a really, really simulator.

464
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,560
But I think for Disney and like, am I wrong?

465
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:05,580
Is it the only thing in Disneyland that was some when it opened the first couple of years where you're in a seat and you're meant to think that you're moving?

466
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,540
Yeah, I think so.

467
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,580
I think you're right.

468
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,680
I think as far as I know.

469
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,060
So it's it's big for that reason.

470
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:19,720
The the the general idea beyond that, the year it opens is 1955.

471
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,720
It is set, as I said, in 1986.

472
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,020
And this is one of the big culprits of that early Tomorrowland thing.

473
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,780
That's kind of odd that it's set in the way off future of 1986.

474
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:41,740
And the prediction about 1986 is that moon flights will be so common every day that you don't even think anything about.

475
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,080
You're like a little impressed, but, you know, you do it all the time.

476
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,460
You're taking trips to the moon, at least.

477
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,040
It's like it's like being in L.

478
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,140
A.

479
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,860
and going to New York for a few years.

480
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,780
You know, try to go once a year, at least.

481
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,220
Well, and all thanks to our friends at Transworld Airlines, TWA, the sponsors.

482
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,160
TWA.

483
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:07,440
And that's part of why that's the premise is that, you know, they're putting a friendly face on airline travel.

484
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,440
And then it's fun to be on TWA.

485
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,740
It's aesthetically pleasing.

486
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,440
And we've got those stewardesses.

487
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,660
You like them, right?

488
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,820
Well, eventually we will be doing moon travel.

489
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:27,660
So all the customer service you come to expect from TWA, you're going to have it as you go back and forth to the moon, including those stewardesses.

490
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,680
That was part of it.

491
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:28,900
Yeah.

492
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:43,440
In the early, at least in 55, it was, I think, maybe not entirely, but a largely female staffed ride for that reason that, you know, like we have to like gender specify.

493
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,020
Yeah.

494
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,500
Stewardesses are with.

495
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,900
That's the term.

496
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,060
And that's it's going to be that in space, space stewardesses.

497
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,300
And they also they have to wear vaguely humiliating costumes.

498
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,960
That's going to be part of it as well.

499
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,520
Yeah.

500
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,660
I don't know if you saw any of what women had to wear on this attraction.

501
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,800
Here's a picture.

502
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,140
Now, there's a man next to her and the man's in like a jumpsuit and sunglasses.

503
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,280
His is kind of it's just like a shinier version of just kind of like a jumpsuit.

504
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,800
The woman is in these like crazy round.

505
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,980
David Bowie costume.

506
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,420
Yeah, a little bit.

507
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,220
Yeah, yeah, sure.

508
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,500
And like kind of cinched space belts.

509
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,140
And then this like, I don't know how to it's like she's got like molecules in her hair.

510
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:38,840
Yeah, got a beehive hair and then like a little like sprig of a pixie dust tree poking out of her.

511
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,600
This is this is a little silly.

512
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,540
This is a little silly.

513
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,640
For sure.

514
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,640
Yeah, a little silly, but she is more clothed than I was expecting.

515
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,940
You would expect like the short dress of the flight attendants of the day.

516
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,300
I think that's what they did.

517
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,960
I think we talked once about the we talked about the Tomorrowland Rocket Man and the equivalent.

518
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,120
The Rocket Girl was in like a short skirt and space boots.

519
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,720
Right.

520
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,580
But they didn't go with that here.

521
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,880
Space go go boots.

522
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,860
Space go go boots.

523
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,140
Yes, this will continue.

524
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,360
It should have.

525
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,840
I mean, why do we let go go boots go?

526
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,240
It's very interesting.

527
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:20,780
The the 50s optimism of like not only is this company going to be around to get forever,

528
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,220
it's eventually going to go to space.

529
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:30,180
It's not going to like limp into a merger less than 50 years later with American Airlines.

530
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,460
You know, just kind of become a sub brand.

531
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,340
People remember because it looked cool.

532
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,140
Yeah, a nostalgia act.

533
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,980
Yeah, yeah.

534
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,220
It's before it's before NASA was founded at all.

535
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,160
So, you know, before we knew, all right, this is the space agency.

536
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,380
That's who will handle the space flights.

537
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,280
It may be plausible that TWA will be that the airline companies will be.

538
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,880
Yeah, yeah.

539
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,660
Trips to the moon.

540
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,400
As far as anybody knew pre NASA.

541
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,320
Sure crazy.

542
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:07,220
The time, the amount of fairly short in the history, like the amount of time it takes from there's no NASA.

543
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,480
This is right is open.

544
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,040
And then we're on the moon.

545
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,740
Yeah, it's so short.

546
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,060
Nobody cares about the moon anymore.

547
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,800
We're on the moon.

548
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,520
Everyone cares.

549
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,860
The biggest thing you ever saw in your life.

550
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Two years later, the moon again.

551
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,500
Yeah, get rid of the moon ride.

552
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,560
Yes.

553
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:32,260
It's a period of time where it's like, look, either TWA will take us to the moon or we got to figure out something to do with all these ex-Nazi scientists we got like skulking around.

554
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,100
Yes.

555
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,840
We don't want to make it anything worse.

556
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,620
We don't want to make anything that kills us.

557
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,940
Yeah, I'm so like ignorant on timeline stuff with history.

558
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,220
It's just like reading all that.

559
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm like, God, that's crazy.

560
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,220
There are a few only a few years really.

561
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,740
Oh, yeah.

562
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,960
Scheme of things of like what's how much stuff changes.

563
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:59,160
Mike, I'm right there with you because researching this episode, I had to remind myself, oh, twelve people have walked on the moon.

564
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,140
Six Apollo missions.

565
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,780
That's the full.

566
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,080
Made it to the moon.

567
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,540
Yeah.

568
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:03,960
Wow.

569
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,580
It seemed like I don't know.

570
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,720
Again, I'm ignorant to a lot of things, but it's just like we were like, well, we went there a couple of times.

571
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,600
I don't know what else we're going to do.

572
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,960
Like, Mike, I guess we can.

573
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,860
The only other thing in my mind is like you set up full colonies up there, but the big pain in the ass.

574
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,080
That's going to be hard to do.

575
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,960
And why is it?

576
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,060
I don't think it's better in any feasible way to be on the moon.

577
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,740
No, there's no resources.

578
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,780
You got to bring everything right.

579
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,840
Mars is closer to closer to being livable, but you'd still have to do a lot of work.

580
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,740
That's and it's farther away.

581
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,680
Remember the point in time where it was like Elon's going to do it.

582
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,740
He's going to like set off nukes.

583
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,620
It's going to terraform the surface of Mars.

584
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,560
And everybody, we're all buying, even I am kind of like, well, maybe.

585
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,840
Yeah, no, this guy has not shown his cards of being an absolute incompetent maniac.

586
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,800
Yeah, a couple of years it really worked.

587
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,540
The PR really worked and I'm gullible.

588
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,640
I fell for it for a few years.

589
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,960
I think once he just he had like a cushion of people around him.

590
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,440
And the more direct it got, the more we're hearing straight from this man and his destroyed rotting brain.

591
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,340
You'd watch Star Trek, the motion picture, which there that's basically the plot.

592
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:24,180
There's something called Vagir, which is like an old satellite, something that's got gained sentience and terraforms a planet.

593
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,560
Essentially, he must have watched that or something and it was like, I know what I'm going to do.

594
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,920
Like people like, yeah, OK, like set off two nukes.

595
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,580
Yeah, OK.

596
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,500
That'll seem like clean plan.

597
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,160
Fix the problem of making Mars livable.

598
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:51,540
It seems like he had a big PR team or a big crew around him and then seemed to get into a mood where he's like, I'll speak directly to the people.

599
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,780
And after a few years speaking directly to the people, it's like, can we just send you to Mars alone?

600
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,440
You start laying the groundwork.

601
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,400
Yeah, just we'll give you a shovel.

602
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,020
Start digging.

603
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:04,900
Yeah.

604
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,480
Well, Bill Maher still thinks he's cool and smart.

605
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,400
As he told Billy Corgan on a recent Club Random.

606
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Billy Corgan's on his way to becoming a guy.

607
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,060
So we're right on the line.

608
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,800
We're right on the line.

609
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,000
There's like a lit like it's soon there will be a little too much Billy Corgan talk for my taste.

610
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,560
But right now we're under where we're currently under.

611
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,520
But like at any point it could rupture.

612
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:32,920
Yeah.

613
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,320
Well, Billy was skeptical of Elon.

614
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,020
I'll give him that.

615
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,020
That's good.

616
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,460
Yeah.

617
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:36,960
OK.

618
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,020
He was like, no, we're the smartest guy I know.

619
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,220
And I'm like, yep, that checks out.

620
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:49,260
Was Billy in that Knicks like floor seats where it's like Zazlov and Bill Maher and Woody Harrell?

621
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:58,160
If you expanded the photo, is like Billy Corgan on one side and like the thing nobody wants to say is that the padding people are conveniently cropping out.

622
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,040
That isn't it.

623
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,700
Michael Michael, you know, someone we like shit, shit, shit.

624
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,340
Michael B.

625
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,900
Jordan stuck in the nightmare blood rotation.

626
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,200
No one wants to point out that Woody Harrelson is a bit like loves a lot of Bill's theories on stuff too.

627
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,280
Woody Harrelson is at a good route, like a second round of his career.

628
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,810
And then he did one of the worst SNL monologues ever.

629
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah.

630
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,520
I think he I think he beat Elon, actually.

631
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,400
It's very possible.

632
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:33,760
At least Elon just did jokes, didn't just like monologue for seven confusing, sometimes scandalous minutes.

633
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,500
Trying to make a poor analogous point.

634
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,340
And it's just like, hey, man, just do a cheer scan.

635
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,420
Like, come on.

636
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,260
That would.

637
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,180
So if you were there, you'd be like, sorry, not canceled.

638
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,320
You're doing a cheers monologue.

639
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,200
It's going to be a let's remind me.

640
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:46,940
Let's do a throwback.

641
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:48,460
Yeah.

642
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,940
It's been a tough couple of years, man.

643
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,020
We don't really want to hear about this.

644
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,280
Just promote triangle of sadness.

645
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,000
Is that what it's called?

646
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,780
I think so.

647
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,800
OK.

648
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:03,280
You know, the last thing I'll say about Billy real quick is he addressed the Big Thunder meme of being looking sad.

649
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:03,660
OK.

650
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,060
And he said, I had a great day that day.

651
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,040
I had a one like it was wonderful.

652
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,180
Somebody took a picture of me.

653
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,480
I looked sad on the ride.

654
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,500
It's funny, but I was not unhappy being at Disneyland.

655
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,020
I love Disneyland.

656
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,980
So there's that.

657
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,320
So easily he gets get some points there, too.

658
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,300
Yeah.

659
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,520
For being happy on the show.

660
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,700
Other him and Eisner are my top two right now to go after together.

661
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,680
Oh, boy.

662
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,060
Seems seems pie in the sky.

663
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,480
I just knock them both out at once.

664
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,640
Get those guys together.

665
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,420
Maybe Michael's a big fan of melancholy and the infinite sadness.

666
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,160
I don't know.

667
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:40,840
It's possible.

668
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,620
We don't know much about his music taste.

669
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,500
We don't.

670
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,040
Mm hmm.

671
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,060
Yeah.

672
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:53,360
So it is interesting the public's feeling about space travel and how stuff like people like there's so much UFO stuff these days.

673
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,720
Nobody could people could give a shit about that.

674
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,960
So it's like that's the other one I'm worried about rupture.

675
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,060
There's going to be a day where Mike is like today's the UFO one.

676
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,900
I'm diving in.

677
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,060
That might be my birthday episode next year.

678
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,760
We'll see.

679
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:13,540
But yeah, so it's like because I think like for a long time, space and kids loved space and I certainly loved space as a kid.

680
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:21,700
But I wonder if that is like if kids now care about space, kids are even interested in it in the same way at all.

681
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:22,740
I don't know.

682
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,380
I don't have an answer.

683
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,740
My child is not old enough to give me her opinion on space.

684
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,900
Yeah, mine's not into space yet.

685
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,180
Yeah, I'm sure to some degree they'll be.

686
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,120
Oh, that's cool planets and learning about how big it is is cool.

687
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,540
But like I would space people were obsessed with space and Star Trek and everything.

688
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:44,900
And I think maybe it's just so much in so much pop culture that it almost isn't novel anymore as much.

689
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,240
Maybe.

690
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,040
Yeah.

691
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,720
But I don't know.

692
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,700
We found it all.

693
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,560
Yeah, OK.

694
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,620
It's big and it's planets.

695
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,040
Got it.

696
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,360
But it's yeah, this ride is reflecting the time that it's right before all that we're figuring it all out.

697
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,340
And it was part of the Disneyland TV specials.

698
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,540
There were these like the specials that Walt would introduce.

699
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,500
I think we're like made genuine a time.

700
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,940
It was definitely like science fact more than science fiction.

701
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,920
Or it'd be like a split.

702
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,220
There'd be these little vignettes of like here's what people used to think about space.

703
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,920
And it was a bunch of silly cartoon stuff.

704
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,240
But then they would legitimately discuss here's how we think these missions will work.

705
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,760
And they'll use the gravity of the little swing around the moon.

706
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,660
And like they made a lot of predictions that were pretty accurate.

707
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,380
And this ride is definitely that.

708
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:37,480
This is not like you go up and see a space girl and like golf into craters.

709
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,060
Right.

710
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,100
This is like let's try to accurately predict how space travel will be.

711
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,640
Well, and there is, you know, there's some footage of this ride.

712
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,460
There's a lot of tributes to this ride on YouTube.

713
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,740
I found one where someone made like a semi recreation that was pretty good.

714
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:06,420
I think the footage that really survives is the astronaut on the moon going like, hello, you know, just like talking to you.

715
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,120
Is that right?

716
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,240
Is this the one?

717
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,600
This is it's funny.

718
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,000
There's all this Disney footage that you're like where I've seen this.

719
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,600
But where was that from?

720
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,460
And what is it?

721
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:23,980
Because I remember another thing is that part of the same thing where like there's two space guys and they start they pick up a third space guy and throw him back and forth like a football.

722
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Is that from flight to the moon?

723
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,740
I don't know.

724
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,620
I don't know if it was in the rides or this was just old Walt specials.

725
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,200
Yes.

726
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,700
I got a look.

727
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,140
I think I have one of the metal box.

728
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,420
Yes.

729
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,000
One or two.

730
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,260
I have one or two of those.

731
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,960
I got to go back and those big DVDs Leonard Malton would introduce.

732
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,580
Right.

733
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,260
Would introduce.

734
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:49,460
I bought one at Disneyland, which was very foolish looking back because it probably cost a fortune.

735
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,420
Sure.

736
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:50,660
Oh, yeah.

737
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,640
It probably cost like 40 or 50 dollars as opposed to just ordering it on Amazon.

738
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,140
And all the clips are just on YouTube.

739
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,840
A lot of the worth money though.

740
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,280
Yeah.

741
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,660
Look like those are shot up and probably I have I think I have a Tomorrowland.

742
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,040
I think I have Tomorrowland and like Disneyland opening.

743
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,580
Yeah.

744
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,900
But yes.

745
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:17,660
There is footage of like one astronaut like greeting you and he's like, and this is my climate controlled suit.

746
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,180
And this is our little Rover.

747
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:32,200
And it this might be you're saying the first screen ride might be one of the early instances of like very stiff, very specific theme park footage acting.

748
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

749
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,660
Sure.

750
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,500
Yeah.

751
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,700
Yes, you found my climate controlled suit helps me adjust to the elements here on.

752
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,260
Yeah.

753
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,220
The first thing where people talk very stiff and dull.

754
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,780
I mean, is it different so much different than the Neil Armstrong?

755
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,220
One small step.

756
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,300
One.

757
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,620
No, they predicted that.

758
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,080
Yeah.

759
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,980
That astronauts would be kind of strange and un-caring.

760
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,520
He wasn't like, holy fuck, I'm on the moon.

761
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,640
Holy shit.

762
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,040
Can you get a load of this?

763
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,220
There's a dust and I can see the earth from here.

764
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,640
Yeah, he was just like one small step for a man.

765
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,140
One giant leap for mankind.

766
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,240
Like show some enthusiasm, man.

767
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,320
He didn't say look at me.

768
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,560
He didn't say we.

769
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,140
Yeah, he didn't say we.

770
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,020
He didn't say.

771
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,260
He didn't flip off ex-girlfriends.

772
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:14,900
Right.

773
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,020
Yeah.

774
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,500
In hindsight, I think I would have been a little more excited.

775
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,420
You didn't know you were fucking a moon man.

776
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,260
Yeah.

777
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,040
Let's say every girl would turn him down in high school.

778
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:34,000
He unfurls something you think it's a flag and then it's just a list of everybody who's wronged him.

779
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,560
It's my enemy's list.

780
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,280
How do you like me now?

781
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,520
I'm on the goddamn moon.

782
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,340
Yeah.

783
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,300
Missed opportunity.

784
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,380
So that's just how adult men talked.

785
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,020
Mm-hmm.

786
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,480
Yep.

787
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,000
Yep.

788
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,180
Reserved.

789
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,040
Stiff clipped.

790
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,060
So dead inside.

791
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:59,020
Kind of a deep voice, but then kind of it could only do that's a lot of your ever get excited being on the moon.

792
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,160
Do you think there was ever like when the cameras were off?

793
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,480
He's like, holy shit.

794
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:04,960
Buzz.

795
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,500
Hey, you fucking believe this?

796
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,020
Cheers.

797
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,900
Hey, quick cheers.

798
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,300
Yeah, maybe beer open.

799
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,240
I don't know.

800
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,280
Mm-hmm.

801
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,300
It is like the Mr.

802
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,800
Show sketch, right?

803
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,100
He's like, well, we did everything we could up there.

804
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,000
Walked on it, played golf on it.

805
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,500
I don't know.

806
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,420
Yep, yep.

807
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:23,720
Yep.

808
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,000
Well, that's what happened.

809
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,560
We just ran through everything.

810
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:26,940
Yeah.

811
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,700
But it was still, it was all ahead of us then.

812
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,200
Everyone was still a moon dreamer.

813
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,480
It opened four days later because a disgruntled electrical worker severed a bunch of the cords.

814
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,380
So they wouldn't like, John Hench himself had to like go figure it out.

815
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,200
Oh, yeah.

816
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,240
Enjoy your moon ride, folks.

817
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,780
Oh, you really, how, you want your moon ride?

818
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,080
Bad enough, you're going to, maybe you should have treated old Ed a little better, huh?

819
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,520
Oh, man, we got to do that episode where we try to catalog all the disgruntled.

820
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,540
Someone was doing Twitter threads.

821
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,580
Disney's Menace Men.

822
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:17,380
Yeah, where, where about like the guest who got too drunk at Epcot and wander backstage and started beating up guests.

823
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,040
Remember it?

824
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,220
Like it made it through a lot of the utilidors.

825
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,080
This was like five or six years ago.

826
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,180
He got into the tunnel?

827
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:33,040
He got, he wandered into closed interventions, eventually got into the tunnels, got a golf cart.

828
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,360
No one was really injured.

829
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,480
I, this is like.

830
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,040
What was this?

831
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,900
This is like five or six, yeah, this is a true thing.

832
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,160
Five or six years ago?

833
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,660
It's reasonably recent.

834
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,460
The utilidors are under the Magic Kingdom, not to Epcot, so that doesn't necessarily square.

835
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,760
But there's still some backstage.

836
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,140
This was not, this was a cast member or just a patron?

837
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,820
No, it was a person drinking around the world who got hammered.

838
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,120
That was a beauty.

839
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:02,980
That was really good.

840
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,740
Thank you.

841
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,960
I know you like it.

842
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,600
Long age.

843
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,980
Beat up employees.

844
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,860
Anyway, I'll bring it back to the subject.

845
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:18,360
Since you mentioned John Hensch, John Hensch credited it with designing the rocket, which the white and red TWA rocket.

846
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,880
Yes.

847
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,060
Looks pretty good.

848
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,580
The Moonliner.

849
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,040
There's a nod to it now.

850
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:32,180
Early Disneyland icon, tallest thing in the park, taller than the castle, pre-matterhorn, that's the probably the most impressive thing in the park.

851
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:45,440
Yeah, and probably it's not the worst downgrade that involves in this, these attractions, but going from the TWA one to the Douglas aircraft rocket is pretty rough.

852
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,700
How so?

853
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,200
Oh, it looks like shit.

854
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,740
The Douglas rocket that just says Douglas along the side.

855
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,400
Does Douglas look that much worse to you?

856
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:53,940
It looks pretty bad.

857
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,580
This is a take.

858
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,740
I'm going to look at this.

859
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,520
Yeah, I gotta look at this too.

860
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,900
We're talking about when the sponsor changed.

861
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,500
It went from one now defunct company to another.

862
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,100
All right.

863
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,500
Yes.

864
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,620
TWA, sporty, red little stripes.

865
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,960
I don't look, I don't think, I think looks like shit is a big reason.

866
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,140
You're saying Douglas, this is Douglas.

867
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:14,820
Yeah.

868
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,800
Looks like shit compared to the original version.

869
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,500
Well, there's a side, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

870
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,900
There's a side of that rocket where it says Douglas all the way down.

871
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,560
You say that as if it's inherently bad.

872
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,360
What's so bad about Douglas?

873
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,700
It's just kind of ugly.

874
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,800
It's just kind of ugly.

875
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,180
I guess so.

876
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,820
I feel like the TWA one says it like up top, kind of small.

877
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,720
It's going, yeah, it's going horizontal and Douglas is going vertical,

878
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,680
so it takes up more space on the rocket.

879
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,980
This is not, I am not alone on this.

880
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,000
I saw this take online, but this was my reaction too.

881
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,100
Douglas Moonliner looks like shit.

882
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,600
I agree that it's a little more functional.

883
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:00,140
I just, I think you've, I think you've, you've gone so far and it's still a big rocket ship.

884
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,280
I'm speaking a little flippantly, but like, I mean, look, I,

885
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,040
I don't know what the flight to the moon poster looks like,

886
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,140
but the poster for rocket to the moon is pretty good.

887
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,020
Like they sell recreations of this.

888
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,480
Sure.

889
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,060
I guess, okay, I like, cause the, the like stripes on the bottom,

890
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,380
the red stripes on the TWA rocket.

891
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,060
The white and red, I prefer.

892
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,080
I prefer.

893
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:23,640
Yes.

894
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,820
But yeah, I'm not offended by the Douglas as much, but I agree the TWA is better.

895
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,600
I think the TWA is better.

896
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,660
I did wonder whether flight to the moon, the second one version of this attraction,

897
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,020
whether it was kind of the redheaded stepchild,

898
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:45,980
but I was interested to learn that when they transitioned from one to the other,

899
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,400
they demolished the building and rebuilt it.

900
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:49,780
Yes.

901
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,420
To make it a little bigger.

902
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,040
Yeah.

903
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,740
Got a little more capacity in there.

904
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,980
If you, if you had more to say about rocket to the moon, forgive me.

905
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,660
I didn't mean to force us to move on.

906
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,360
Oh, no, no, sure.

907
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,740
Hey, it's look, it's fine.

908
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,180
It's a little interesting.

909
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,240
I think we, we talked about in the, when Tomorrowland was weird episode,

910
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,040
how they were stuck making the rocket out of aluminum

911
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,660
because they made a big deal with Kaiser aluminum.

912
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,240
Yeah.

913
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,040
Even though an aluminum rocket doesn't make a lot of sense

914
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,200
and it like shifted weight and shape in the sun.

915
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,380
So it would like make big creaking sounds.

916
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,880
Expanding contracts in the hot and the heat and the cold.

917
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,740
So this assignment is good.

918
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,860
John Hench designed the rocket and this assignment is given to him.

919
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,200
And he's like, how am I actually?

920
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,800
Okay, so we have to have aluminum somewhere as part of this.

921
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,240
Well, to build the bay, it's going to,

922
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,120
steel is going to have to enter into it for it to like stand

923
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,360
and be a big, tall rocket ship.

924
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,200
So we'll use steel and actually aluminum and steel,

925
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,660
if they touch, can create a toxic reaction of some kind.

926
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,900
Like they're not supposed to touch.

927
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,220
So the shell, the aluminum shell they were stuck building

928
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,260
couldn't touch the steel frame, which is what was actually,

929
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,880
what made it work.

930
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,000
just made no sense.

931
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,780
It was one of the dumbest deals they ever cut.

932
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,000
There's a blog of the Douglas employees on the Douglas rocket

933
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,380
and one man is smoking a pipe.

934
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,560
I have that on my desktop.

935
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,900
all right, it's a little simulated rocket ride.

936
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,200
Why?

937
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,480
It'll be very common to go and yes, you'll be able to take a pipe.

938
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,200
Yes.

939
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,500
Which I think you're still not, wasn't supposed to,

940
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,180
but I guess the Douglas employees.

941
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,520
Is that why?

942
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,500
Okay, I didn't have that context for the picture.

943
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,220
That's interesting.

944
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,120
It's from stuff from the park blog.

945
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,800
It's Mr.

946
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,780
Douglas himself.

947
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,300
So that's Ronald Douglas.

948
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,840
CEO of the company, Donald Douglas Jr.

949
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,120
But I don't think that's the guy smoking the pipe necessarily.

950
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,580
It's a funny picture.

951
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,120
There's only one child.

952
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,920
Everyone else is like wearing suits and big coats

953
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,160
and they're already ancient.

954
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,480
60 year older.

955
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,140
Yeah.

956
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,800
Might not have been, probably people our age in there

957
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,020
and we just think they look older.

958
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,040
But yeah, I guess the employees were allowed to smoke pipes on the ride.

959
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,040
Yeah, yeah.

960
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,000
They made some other declarations about what, okay,

961
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,160
so it's going to be an eight hour trip.

962
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,380
That's something they said.

963
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,500
Its speeds exceeding 172,000 miles an hour.

964
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,900
These are the official like TWA projections.

965
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,840
So if, I mean, that's like, that's a, not even an international, you know,

966
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,880
as many, it'd be much longer to go to Australia.

967
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,820
Much longer to go to Japan from here.

968
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,000
I just want like in their vision, what's on the moon?

969
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,660
Is it like, are you only going up there to work or scientists up there?

970
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,760
Or are we, are we playing on the moon?

971
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,040
What is TWA's, like, do they make it so we can like,

972
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,000
we're going to fill those canyons with water and it's a beach destination?

973
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,520
Are they going to build a big aluminum frame?

974
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,620
Once we've built our aluminum moon shell,

975
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,980
then you'll be able to breathe inside.

976
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,080
It'll be relaxing, full of lakes and rivers and water skiing.

977
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:20,900
Sure.

978
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,880
The ride wasn't fantastical like that.

979
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,380
So yeah, it's so, I don't know that they had thought about it.

980
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,340
What's the end game here?

981
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,000
What are we?

982
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,900
We'll put some nice stuff up there.

983
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,880
Shuffle board courts, boxes of Canadian club whiskey,

984
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,360
Chesterfield cigarettes, everything you want on a vacation.

985
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,140
Yeah, you could smoke a cigarette on the moon.

986
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,740
Which is cool.

987
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:42,900
Yeah.

988
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,240
So I don't know if even like space tourism right now,

989
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,480
right now space tourism is just going in like,

990
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,320
just even escaping Earth's orbit a little bit.

991
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,720
Like that's what Blue Origin is doing.

992
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,720
And like, it's not like you're going even that far into space.

993
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,900
You're just in space for what?

994
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,680
Like 10 minutes, 15 minutes?

995
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,400
Yeah.

996
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,540
So maybe they even, they thought this through and were like,

997
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,860
we don't know what people are going to do when they get to the moon.

998
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,620
Let's just send them into space.

999
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,740
That's kind of as good.

1000
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,120
Well, not many people have been to space, so they'll pay so much money for space.

1001
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:14,540
Yeah.

1002
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,500
So yeah, I don't know if anyone's cracked the code of what are we going to do when we get there?

1003
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,580
It's been, I guess, one of the big mysteries.

1004
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,180
Yeah.

1005
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,560
We figured out how to get there, but you need to build what you put on it.

1006
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,400
You need to build a theme park on the moon.

1007
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,440
That's the only like, that's what happens around tourist trap things.

1008
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,440
So really what has to happen is that there has to be a bubblegum shrimp on the moon.

1009
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:34,800
Yeah.

1010
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,060
Ripley's believe it or not, all the usual suspects.

1011
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:37,420
Yeah.

1012
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,380
You need to just do that.

1013
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:44,340
Kind of like a, like, yeah, the moon realistically today would have like the motion 4D theater.

1014
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,740
And it's an old movie from, you go on a ride that's like,

1015
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,080
meant to be the second, the Scooby Doo 2 on Monster Island.

1016
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,440
Like they haven't changed the Scooby Doo 2 movie on the moon.

1017
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,400
And the theater stinks for some reason.

1018
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,000
Yeah.

1019
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:01,300
Yeah.

1021
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,660
It's a bubblegum shrimp and it's whatever is it, the Niagara Falls Mall.

1022
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,780
Before colonies, we need to build like, yeah, the Niagara Falls Entertainment District.

1023
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah.

1024
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:18,960
And the only difference is that like the iFly, you don't need a fan when you're doing the skydiving.

1025
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,120
It's still an iFly, but it's just naturally.

1026
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,980
It's iFly, but no fan and then gravity is the other thing.

1027
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,620
They put a roof on it so you don't float all the way out of the thing.

1028
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:25,900
Exactly.

1029
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,980
So that's, but other than that, it's basically City Walk.

1030
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:29,760
They got it.

1031
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,320
They had a Virgin Megastore, but Virgin went under.

1032
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,580
That's just nothing.

1033
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,460
I think people are, people live in there now.

1034
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,440
People stowed away.

1035
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,820
There's four people who've been to the moon who we haven't tracked.

1036
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,540
And either they floated into space forever and died and their heads exploded,

1037
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,080
or they live permanently in the closed Virgin Megastore.

1038
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,680
When the Virgin Megastore was somebody accidentally opened the back door

1039
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,960
and a bunch of old CDs got out and are floating in another space junk.

1040
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,180
Yeah.

1041
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,680
Like whatever era.

1042
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:03,440
They kept gaining speed until they hit a Russian satellite and just severed it in two.

1043
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:09,240
The first two floors are Spirit Halloween and no one's been up in the third floor for a while.

1044
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,520
We don't ask if there's aliens anywhere, it's up there.

1045
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,100
Whatever the alien equivalent of bats are.

1046
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,820
This is a joke, but also it's not, it is how everyone thinks.

1047
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,220
I guess that is…

1048
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,680
The moon, it would get crappy so quickly.

1049
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,520
So quickly.

1050
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,220
That area, that Clifton Hill Niagara Falls area is so insane.

1051
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,840
And it's funny, but it's also a reminder of like, wow, this is kind of like as good as things are.

1052
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,340
They have like, this is like themed entertainment.

1053
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,380
There's a beautiful site and then what do we put around it?

1054
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,620
A bunch of like screaming irritating shit.

1055
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,420
We can do anything here.

1056
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,820
I don't know about a big hamburger.

1057
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,720
That's what the moon would be too.

1058
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,060
It's very funny.

1059
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,560
I've watched some videos about Pigeon Forge.

1060
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,320
Oh yeah.

1061
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,120
And I feel like…

1062
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,360
Scott's voice got lower.

1063
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,360
Oh yeah.

1064
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:11,900
I feel like the Niagara Falls vibe is tempered a little in Pigeon Forge.

1065
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,580
Because there is so much stunning natural beauty.

1066
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,300
Okay, sure.

1067
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,340
Like the mountains and the forests and just the wooded areas.

1068
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,940
Oh yeah, Niagara Falls is like, let's go see the natural beauty and then everything else is…

1069
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,600
That's in a corner and then there's much more crap.

1070
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,360
Yeah, yeah.

1071
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:34,840
You can just imagine eating your plate of fried shrimp at the Bubba Gump

1072
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,520
and staring out into the nothingness of space

1073
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,380
and have your William Shatner Blue Origin moment where you're like, nothing matters.

1074
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,760
Nothing means anything.

1075
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,420
You're eating your shrimp.

1076
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,060
You bought your Bubba Gump shirt and you're just staring.

1077
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,820
The shrimp makes me feel nothing.

1078
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,720
You're looking at Earth and you're like, I feel nothing.

1079
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,140
I thought this was going to be the answer to all of life's questions, but in fact it's the opposite.

1080
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,840
Well, you're feeling that way because you bought a non-alcoholic ice cream drink

1081
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,060
and you're wondering why you're not getting a buzz.

1082
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,080
Yeah, that's part of it too.

1083
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,660
The Applebee's isn't even…

1084
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,660
There's a little moon inside.

1085
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,760
You can sit in a booth that's like a moon rover, but it's not that cool.

1086
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,500
This is as good as it gets.

1087
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:21,980
Wow.

1088
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,040
Or on the moon.

1089
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,880
It's a Mars simulator on the moon.

1090
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,040
Or a moon simulator on Mars.

1091
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,100
We're always pining for something we aren't at.

1092
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,360
Yep, that's a good point.

1093
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,980
So, yeah, we'll see.

1094
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,020
I don't know if anyone really…

1095
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,100
The only practical reason now is just to get people off of our dying Earth,

1096
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,640
which is still going to take a few years, I think, before it's completely dead.

1097
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,940
Before it's not livable.

1098
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,080
Sure.

1099
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,420
Well, now the mood is completely dead.

1100
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,000
Sorry!

1101
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,740
I think it's going to be a few hundred years at least.

1102
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:02,700
It's going to be a little while, but we've got to get working on that 40 theater for Rango the Adventure Continues on the Moon.

1103
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,780
Yeah, that's true.

1104
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,000
We wanted to be in charge of a theme park project forever.

1105
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,360
Maybe a moon one is what we want.

1106
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,020
Yeah.

1107
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:15,100
Maybe we need John Binkowski to put a rock and roll theme park on the moon.

1108
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,280
Or is this moon-based rock and roll songs?

1109
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,200
You know, moon-age daydreams.

1110
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,080
Fog hat the ride.

1111
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,540
One silly thing.

1112
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,860
One other odd thing about…

1113
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,840
So there's the moon liner outside the ride, and then like, was that the ship we're getting in that?

1114
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,400
No, no, no.

1115
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,140
The real rocket will be much bigger.

1116
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,760
It'll be 240 feet in length, and it will use nuclear energy as fuel.

1117
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,140
So these are nuclear rockets.

1118
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,920
You will take a TWA nuke jet to the moon.

1119
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:57,600
I don't think anyone thinks they're getting into that Millennium Falcon that's in Galaxy's Edge, but it is a little bit more like, that is what you're supposed to assume.

1120
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,280
Yeah.

1121
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,560
And this is definitely like, oh, cool, it's a rocket.

1122
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,200
A child might probably.

1123
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,480
I buy it as like, that's the story.

1124
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,400
I know I'm not, but…

1125
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1126
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:14,960
I actually, I bet like regular people might even think that you are like, you're born and then you are inside that.

1127
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,680
Maybe, yeah.

1128
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,640
Well, I am saying that I think they do a better job of that.

1129
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,020
Sure.

1130
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,020
But then I, for some reason, I do assert that I know better.

1131
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,440
The cockpit does a lot of lifting.

1132
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,180
The like movie perfect cockpit, you know.

1133
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:35,060
Yeah, as a kid, that would be really cool to see what you're going, what you think you're going into, but they make that distinction on the ride.

1134
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,300
It's very fact-oriented.

1135
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:50,220
The experience is nine minutes long, which seems too long for, yes, for something that where I'm like, I'm looking through a transcript.

1136
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,000
Is there a funny line in this that I can say on the…

1137
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,440
No, no, there is not.

1138
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:00,580
It is extremely fact-oriented and then you meet Captain Collins, okay?

1139
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,860
Is Captain Collins nicer, make a joke?

1140
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,700
No, not really.

1141
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,700
You know what it reminded me of, I realized, is how this is early Disneyland.

1142
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,060
They're figuring it all out.

1143
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,940
They don't know yet that things can be like jovial, silly, fun.

1144
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,260
Jungle Cruise didn't have jokes when it started.

1145
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,460
Jungle Cruise was just meant to, we just say real facts about lions.

1146
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,800
And it's kind of like that.

1147
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,040
Like now you might have like, whoops, and something goes right.

1148
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,400
And then they kind of injected humor a tiny bit in the other iterations.

1149
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,860
But early Disney is like, no, we're here to teach.

1150
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:31,120
Education.

1151
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:31,640
Yeah.

1152
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:38,880
Which is funny, because you still see a lot of people like Epcot has strayed so far from its original.

1153
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,920
And they're like, okay, so is this what you want?

1154
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,360
Show a ride-through video of Rocket to the Moon falling asleep halfway through.

1155
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,900
Yeah, well, Mission Space is in the same vein as this for sure.

1156
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,160
And it's awful and I don't like it.

1157
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,680
And I know some people like it, but I don't.

1158
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,800
Gary Sinise in both Mission Space and the movie Mission to Mars.

1159
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,240
That's right.

1160
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,160
Which doesn't seem to have a lot of connections besides the name and touchstone.

1161
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:07,900
That's right, yes.

1162
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,140
Yeah, it's weird.

1163
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,260
But I don't think it has anything to do with it really.

1164
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,420
And then, but and kind of Gary Sinise is in the ride.

1165
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,560
It's a ride where you go to Mars and he's in it.

1166
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,940
But I don't know if he's supposed to be that character.

1167
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,860
I don't think so.

1168
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:28,620
Yeah, I know.

1169
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,160
I could be wrong.

1170
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,300
But that's why it's him though.

1171
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,900
Is it is a Mission to Mars tie in.

1172
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:34,440
Right, right.

1173
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,200
But I don't know.

1174
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,140
Maybe I'm wrong.

1175
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,080
I guess I didn't even think about that.

1176
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,180
That's at least why they had a relationship with Sinise.

1177
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,100
Oh, you know what?

1178
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,540
I think this is where I have to talk about this.

1179
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,300
I was recently pursuing a gig.

1180
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,720
I was meeting somebody to potentially do a project with WGA sanctioned in the clear.

1181
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,020
It would have been fine.

1182
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,740
But so he is kind of like catching up on this case.

1183
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,060
So you did this and you did that.

1184
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,200
And I'm talking about my history and what I've done.

1185
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,140
And then he's like, so this podcast I got to ask you about.

1186
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,580
You're like, it's a theme park thing.

1187
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:12,960
Yeah.

1188
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,580
And he says, yeah, yeah.

1189
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,600
Disney daddies.

1190
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,580
That's interesting.

1191
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,520
And I was like, no, it's not that.

1192
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,440
It's way.

1193
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,260
Where did you get that?

1194
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,300
Because that's a phrase that we've said.

1195
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,060
And he's like Wikipedia.

1196
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,660
That's on your own Wikipedia, my man.

1197
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,320
And I was like, oh, God, crap.

1198
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,740
And this is me.

1199
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:38,580
I was meeting somebody for the first time and esteemed and older, older man.

1200
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,280
And and I'm like, oh, shit, what was all that again?

1201
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,660
And I really I remembered.

1202
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,380
Yes, I remember.

1203
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,300
OK, here's a big I this is my own fault.

1204
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:47,700
Right.

1205
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:47,960
Yeah.

1206
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,220
I asked the audience to put a this because of mission space.

1207
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:54,560
Right.

1208
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,600
It was something it was something where I wanted Father of the Year data.

1209
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,040
Yeah.

1210
00:53:59,180 --> 00:53:59,720
Oh, yeah.

1211
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,560
Gary Sinise had some unsourced thing of being father of the year.

1212
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,820
And I wanted to take it from him.

1213
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,620
So and basically, like it's been through somebody.

1214
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,760
Bless you went and added that to my Wikipedia.

1215
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,660
So my Wikipedia for a while had this strange distinction about like he was beat out.

1216
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,040
Gary Sinise in these several years to be one of the Disney daddies.

1217
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,500
Oh, my God.

1218
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,880
This has just been in my Wikipedia.

1219
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,660
But at some point, oh, gee, because it connected to his at some point that got flagged.

1220
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,860
Like, OK, we know Sinise was not.

1221
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,940
So the Sinise got pulled from it.

1222
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,160
So here's what's now on my Wikipedia.

1223
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:43,660
Gardner has been voted as one of three Disney daddies with a Z by prominent members of the theme park journalism industry.

1224
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,100
So now it's just this like like Tomorrowland.

1225
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,040
We're pulling elements.

1226
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:54,480
It's just this decaying husk of a fact or a joke in an award section on my Wikipedia.

1227
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,580
That just that just means nothing.

1228
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,920
And that came up in a job interview.

1229
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,900
And I had to.

1230
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,700
There's a minute.

1231
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,860
This guy's coming to meet me and he's like, oh, my God, this guy seems all right.

1232
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,860
But he is he's the host of a podcast called the Disney Daddies.

1233
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,460
Well, it doesn't say that he got confused there.

1234
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,860
But yes, this is a moment that I had in my life and I didn't get the job.

1235
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,060
Let me just say, I don't think that's why.

1236
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,240
But I would say it is not why.

1237
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,200
However, my goodness, this look what I did to myself.

1238
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,100
Look what the pit that listeners helped me dig for myself.

1239
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,520
Wow.

1240
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,440
Now you're never going to get to write the sound of freedom to.

1241
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,660
Now you're never going to get to do a pass on the Polly Pocket movie.

1242
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:39,360
I've got I was I was so like I went I even print up the poster with the taglines.

1243
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,440
Got to be never trust a second pedophile.

1244
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,100
Never trust a pedophile again.

1245
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,560
Oh, my God.

1246
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,120
Disney Dad.

1247
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,820
Just seeing Disney Daddy's written like that.

1248
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:49,960
Yeah.

1249
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,060
What happened now?

1250
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,100
That just means nothing.

1251
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,400
Now the part that I asked for is gone.

1252
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,220
His body.

1253
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,220
I was voted as one of I had to be voted this.

1254
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,520
Who are the other two?

1255
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,400
I think it's both of you.

1256
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,240
Well, why?

1257
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,260
Why would we have to be voted then?

1258
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,420
Yeah, the voting is I think that's where it because the voting was originally that I beat out Sinise.

1259
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:10,980
Yeah.

1260
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,840
But now it's just the stray.

1261
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,580
Now it just now it just means nothing.

1262
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,040
Yeah.

1263
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,120
The more we the more we yank, it makes less and less sense.

1264
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,480
Well, look, you were number one.

1265
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,180
You were the first one to have a child.

1266
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,440
Mike was second.

1267
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,620
I was immediately eliminated because I don't have children that I know of.

1268
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:31,880
Mr.

1269
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,180
Jason or Mr.

1270
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,380
T as we call him.

1271
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,920
He doesn't even know the tea and podcast.

1272
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:43,340
He was when he when he we don't know what Jason gets up to when he goes to the Jersey Shore and he was in a taffy haze.

1273
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,920
Who knows with tea just exploding out of him.

1274
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,500
Who knows what he got up to?

1275
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,340
A body falling apart.

1276
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,020
By Mr.

1277
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,100
T we mean taffy.

1278
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:58,160
I've been to the doctor so many times this year, but my tea is at an all time high.

1279
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,280
Maybe I need to get my tea down.

1280
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,240
You lose one sense and then another becomes a superpower.

1281
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,420
Yeah, that's you with tea.

1282
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:11,040
Jason, maybe you could introduce a new product testosterone infused taffy.

1283
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,860
You know, people with low T.

1284
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:13,640
Tea taffy.

1285
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,720
Yeah, tea taffy.

1286
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:20,220
Should we start a new thing to put to replace your Wikipedia with right now?

1287
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,980
Do you want that changed and we'll have a listener do it?

1288
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,100
What I really make it worse.

1289
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:26,720
Could we?

1290
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,260
Gairdner has been voted the top Disney daddy in the theme park community.

1291
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,890
Like, let's get us out even out of there.

1292
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:42,120
I mean, the worst the worst thing would be if you added I'm like, how can you change it with just one word?

1293
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:48,180
And I think if you can get in, Gairdner has been voted as one of three little Disney daddies.

1294
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,240
I'm going to I'm going to delete it as soon as I can.

1295
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:58,600
But I but I somebody should try to add it just so we can see what that looks so it can be there for a minute.

1296
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:10,240
Scott Gairdner accolades are is include the number one Disney daddy and the one of the three musketeers along with beloved men Bob Iger and David Saswab.

1297
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,760
Known for front row Lakers is front row Lakers seats with David Saswab.

1298
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:18,800
And Disney daddies.

1299
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:26,440
I wish actually was more accurate to my view of what the Disney daddy's is, which is a podcast hosted by three single dads with three sons each.

1300
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:33,280
So if they could change it at least to that to change your because it does say about your family and you're also on your Wikipedia.

1301
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:38,360
But if they could change it to that, a single dad, Scott Gairdner is a single dad that has three sons.

1302
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:46,400
He's been voted as one of the top three Disney daddies who have three three children.

1303
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:46,760
Three.

1304
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,940
Yeah, I don't know.

1305
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,100
However you want to do it.

1306
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:49,580
Yeah.

1307
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:49,940
Yeah.

1308
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,460
And then it's but then I'm taking a wrecking ball the whole time.

1309
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:52,640
All right.

1310
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,820
That's I had to lie.

1311
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:58,580
This this came to bite me in the ass and my award section needs to go.

1312
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,700
But let's have a part.

1313
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,140
Let's demolish it before it gets imploded.

1314
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:02,420
Right.

1315
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,880
Let's let's spray a bunch of graffiti all over it before we get rid of it entirely.

1316
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,760
Unless they won't let me myself do it.

1317
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:10,920
OK.

1318
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,100
I've been meaning to bring that up and then it's a nice like oh man, I have to talk about it.

1319
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,440
OK.

1320
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,440
This the ride itself in terms of like what does it do?

1321
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,360
It does.

1322
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,820
The seats vibrated a little bit.

1323
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,960
This is the original 40x.

1324
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:25,880
Right.

1325
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:34,040
Is how they gave you any bit of space travel feeling is there's a little bit of shaking going on while you watch screens above you and below you.

1326
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,380
Unless I'm wrong.

1327
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,900
That's kind of what this is.

1328
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,960
The shake a little while you get serious moon info.

1329
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,180
You get to see the backside of the moon.

1330
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,020
That's part of it.

1331
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:43,260
Yeah.

1332
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,260
This is described as one of the thrills of the ride.

1333
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,020
There's a bit there's light flares.

1334
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:47,440
Right.

1335
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,120
And it will allow you to actually see the backside of the moon.

1336
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,440
And the big reveal is the backside looks the same as the front side.

1337
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:53,740
Sure.

1338
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:53,980
Yeah.

1339
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:58,740
But there was a thought I think at the time like I don't know maybe that's where all the aliens are hiding.

1340
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,100
Right.

1341
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,300
The dark side of the moon.

1342
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,920
Of course Pink Floyd will have a ride on the moon when John Binkowski gets involved.

1343
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:04,500
Oh that's perfect.

1344
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,320
Dark side of the moon and the coaster on the moon.

1345
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,440
Right on the dark side.

1346
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:07,860
Yeah.

1347
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:12,680
Maybe the dark side as the cheese maybe as the babes you know.

1348
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,440
Oh the cheese and the babes did you say?

1349
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,900
Yeah that's what they were thinking back then.

1350
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:17,760
The space babes.

1351
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,680
Babes will feed you cheese.

1352
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,200
Space babes.

1353
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,640
Like green like Star Trek green ladies.

1354
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,720
Oh yeah beautiful green ladies.

1355
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:24,320
Yes.

1356
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,420
Otherwise look like humans.

1357
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:31,060
Maybe if you want to maybe for fun you throw a third breast in there.

1358
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,160
Yeah total recall style.

1359
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,420
If you're feeling silly but otherwise yeah they are our normal babes.

1360
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,900
Anyway that's sort of what this is.

1361
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,940
I think for the 50s pretty good.

1362
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,980
I think a little dry by our standards but it's a ride.

1363
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,440
It's a you go to space.

1364
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,860
There's some there's a little bit of a pre-show.

1365
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,660
Your seats shake a little bit.

1366
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,000
So you know I don't know if you have maybe you don't have star tours without this.

1367
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,360
I mean you don't have space mountain without this.

1368
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,660
It started carving out an area of Disney rides so it's important for that reason.

1369
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,460
I bet it was cool for a short amount of time.

1370
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:11,360
I bet like just being in Disneyland and being in anything even though Tomorrowland was kind of crappy versus the other lands.

1371
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,260
It was still like pretty cool for a couple of years.

1372
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:18,480
Oh and the part of the space race I'm sure it was awesome.

1373
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,680
Yeah so I will give it that.

1374
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,080
Yeah.

1375
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,780
Because I don't always sometimes you look back at some of these things you go this doesn't even look like it was fun then.

1376
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,020
But I could see this being fun at the time.

1377
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,260
I think with fresh like theme parks are not around us all the time eyes.

1378
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,380
It's different than it's not like a carnival ride.

1379
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:41,780
It's you know I don't think there are there's I don't think there's a lot of things where you like enter a room and the room is like special and feels like another kind of room.

1380
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:46,980
Right and outside of like movie theaters it's like these screens are big like yeah that too.

1381
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,140
You don't see those everywhere.

1382
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:48,760
Yeah.

1383
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,740
So just even seeing it used in a different way I'm sure was pretty cool.

1384
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:53,200
Yeah.

1385
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:53,820
Yes.

1386
01:01:54,040 --> 01:02:01,360
But then TWA stops sponsoring it and the theaters are too small so they wreck it.

1387
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,480
It's gone like my awards section soon.

1388
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:10,620
And it's also the big tomorrow the first big Tomorrowland redo is coming.

1389
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:15,960
Tomorrowland 67 which is where we get the Carousel of Progress.

1390
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,540
It's where we get People Mover.

1391
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,300
I think that's where the rocket jets move up to the top of that structure.

1392
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:26,800
So kind of the biggest overall that leads to the Tomorrowland we know today.

1393
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,880
So they get rid of this and almost the exact same spot.

1394
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,500
They build bigger theaters though not radically bigger.

1395
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,400
It's still two domes that are supposed to be rocket ships.

1396
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:41,820
Right.

1397
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,140
And it's not rocket to the moon it's flight to the moon.

1398
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:44,920
Don't know why.

1399
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:45,520
Right.

1400
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,040
Yeah.

1401
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,600
Maybe did rocket feel like limiting like.

1402
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,660
Flight seems less flight seems more mundane because of flying from air travel.

1403
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:55,100
Yeah.

1404
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,600
So maybe there was the idea like oh it's just going to be normal.

1405
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:57,940
Sure.

1406
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:58,660
Commonplace.

1407
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:03,340
Is this where because I had a hard time tracking this.

1408
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:08,360
Is this where the mission control room full of animatronics shows up.

1409
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,140
I think so.

1410
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,180
I think it's at that point.

1411
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:17,680
So that's probably the most notable addition here is that now there is a true pre-show.

1412
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,480
Yes.

1413
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,480
And I don't think I knew this was there at all.

1414
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,080
A room full of audio animatronics.

1415
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:27,260
I didn't either and I was so excited because again I knew this was a little dry going in.

1416
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,620
But then I discovered this and I went OK here we go.

1417
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,780
This is footage that has escaped me in my many years looking at this crap.

1418
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,960
Robots we didn't know about.

1419
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:36,340
Yes.

1420
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,020
Yes indeed.

1421
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:44,480
And this is the home of a name that is used for various things in theme park lore and

1422
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,220
one of our favorite vloggers Mr.

1423
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:47,580
Morrow.

1424
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:48,040
Mr.

1425
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:48,460
Morrow.

1426
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,620
Tom Morrow.

1427
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,040
Yes.

1428
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,180
I actually didn't know that either.

1429
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:54,440
I thought it originated from the people mover but no it's here.

1430
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:55,960
Oh that it was just like a joke.

1431
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,900
It was just a pass by joke.

1432
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:58,200
Yeah.

1433
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:04,600
And didn't they also call wasn't the Nathan Lane Innoventions robot where you can see

1434
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,880
his insides called Tom Morrow.

1435
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,060
Is it the weird little one?

1436
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:13,140
I don't remember if he was little but he sings It's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow while

1437
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,340
you wait for Innoventions to open.

1438
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:28,620
So he's only one animatronic I think speak turns around acknowledges you speaks to you

1439
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:31,180
interacts with a cast member that had never happened before.

1440
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:36,280
The live person cues then even has a little back and forth with a with an animatronic.

1441
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:37,160
So Mr.

1442
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,640
Morrow is from this.

1443
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:46,020
Do we get any sense of him really to like him beyond that they did it.

1444
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:49,340
He's not as quirky as like John from Carousel of Progress.

1445
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,040
No.

1446
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:54,680
But he still has you know old style animatronic charisma.

1447
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:00,000
I like seeing this style of Disney animatronic.

1448
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:05,140
I feel like they were they really the robots were all made by crusty old men and they were

1449
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,880
really good at making crusty old men.

1450
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,520
Made them in their image like God.

1451
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,120
Yeah.

1452
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,320
So that's good.

1453
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,120
Yeah.

1454
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,840
But yeah I don't know.

1455
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,480
I don't know that he's so memorable but I don't know maybe I don't know.

1456
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:22,800
Is it because he wasn't as entertaining or is it just because this ride wasn't that popular

1457
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,520
or it going away.

1458
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,140
I don't know.

1459
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:30,720
I don't I'm not saying he's great in the sense and great like John or something but I'm now

1460
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,140
he did.

1461
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,280
Now forgive me.

1462
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,400
I don't remember this distinction.

1463
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,380
I don't remember if this is Mr.

1464
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,220
Morrow or here's where you get into like how many episodes

1465
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:41,560
are these and you realize like that.

1466
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:41,900
OK.

1467
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:46,020
It's just what was the change was that they changed the name of the it's not Mr.

1468
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:46,420
Morrow

1469
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,020
it's Mr.

1470
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:47,760
Johnson.

1471
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,800
So why is Mission to Mars different.

1472
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:50,220
Mr.

1473
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,600
Morrow is now Mr.

1474
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,240
Johnson.

1475
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,060
Otherwise it is the same voice actor.

1476
01:05:55,060 --> 01:06:01,200
And I don't remember if it's a different animatronic entirely or anyway my point is at least I

1477
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,260
know Mr.

1478
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,900
Johnson is John from Carousel of Progress.

1479
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,120
Peter Rennaday is who is here.

1480
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:08,780
Wait wait wait.

1481
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,980
Sorry sorry.

1482
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:14,460
Is in Mission to Mars and his name is third officer Collins.

1483
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:15,520
OK OK.

1484
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:21,000
Collins I believe is a callback to one of the characters in Flight to the Moon.

1485
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:21,360
Yeah.

1486
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,300
Let's get it straight.

1487
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,280
Two Collins different Collins.

1488
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:25,080
Sorry sorry.

1489
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,620
Morrow is not Johnson.

1490
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,160
OK.

1491
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:27,780
I got confused.

1492
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:28,480
Sorry.

1493
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,580
Tomorrowland I will give them credit.

1494
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:37,340
One thing they are good at is doing like comic book or professional wrestling callbacks or

1495
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,500
nods to previous continuities.

1496
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,140
Yeah.

1497
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:40,720
Yes.

1498
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,100
What I was saying was that John's the voice.

1499
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,460
They it's just the same animatronic.

1500
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:48,020
Yeah.

1501
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,400
I think that's what people thought.

1502
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:53,100
These people said he looks remarkably close to him.

1503
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,880
The other the other difference.

1504
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,760
But I don't think we said this was also there's a version of this in Disney World both Flight

1505
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:07,860
to the Moon and Mission to Mars and in Florida Mr.

1506
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,000
Johnson had a mustache.

1507
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,840
But in Disneyland he was clean shaven.

1508
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,440
Is everyone keeping this straight.

1509
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:15,000
Yeah.

1510
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,040
Get all these down.

1511
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,300
Make sure you know impress people at your next party.

1512
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,320
Maybe that's what they'll do with Hatbox Ghost.

1513
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,440
Then Florida.

1514
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,520
Mustache.

1515
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:23,940
Sure.

1516
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:24,560
Mustache.

1517
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,180
That's different.

1518
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:28,840
Does it travel with him or what are the physical properties of a mustache.

1519
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,660
Does it stay on your face when everything else goes?

1520
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,580
That would be cool if it hovered.

1521
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,160
Everything that way.

1522
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,660
Everything goes except the mustache.

1523
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:37,860
That'd be fun.

1524
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,620
But I also I think feel like it would mean that he has a fake mustache.

1525
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,860
Although do any of this ghosts have mustaches.

1526
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,440
Some of them have like facial hair.

1527
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:47,600
They like mutton chops.

1528
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,380
Mutton chops.

1529
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:48,720
Yeah.

1530
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,260
There might be handlebar mustache or two in the Haunted Mansion.

1531
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:51,680
Yeah.

1532
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,360
There's got to be.

1533
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,460
So I feel like the mustache would travel with him.

1534
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,700
But maybe that's the gag.

1535
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:56,720
That's the joke.

1536
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:57,600
That it just hovers there.

1537
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:57,860
Sure.

1538
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,420
I like that.

1539
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,620
Speaking of the Florida mission to Mars.

1540
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:08,760
There is a restored 19 like July 1992 mission to Mars.

1541
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:09,340
Oh yeah.

1542
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:09,600
Yeah.

1543
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,000
Watch that.

1544
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:14,100
The whole ride through and the sounds a little distorted.

1545
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,400
But the footage is very clear.

1546
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:16,680
Mm hmm.

1547
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:23,820
And you can see how that would become Alien Encounter and Stitch.

1548
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,740
But the the Mission Control Room.

1549
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:28,620
I was impressed.

1550
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:29,200
Mr.

1551
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,540
Johnson for 1992.

1552
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,760
He is moving a lot.

1553
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:34,200
Mm hmm.

1554
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,080
That animatronic.

1555
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,540
It's kind of a long like a long pre-show.

1556
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,680
It is a long pre-show.

1557
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,860
For what I would assume it would have been.

1558
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:39,940
Yeah.

1559
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,260
Almost feels equal to the ride.

1560
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,040
An albatross.

1561
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,020
An albatross.

1562
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,140
A big albatross.

1563
01:08:54,380 --> 01:09:00,440
I think if you grew up with this ride and you were fond of it the albatross was the was the big good part.

1564
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,060
Was the thing.

1565
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,820
And they retained it from the moon one to the Mars one.

1566
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,140
Got to keep albatross.

1567
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:05,580
Mm hmm.

1568
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:06,120
Yeah.

1569
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:13,060
The other thing that was interesting to me is like that footage is from mid-July 1992.

1570
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,000
This ride looks empty.

1571
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:16,840
Yeah.

1572
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:17,500
Yeah.

1573
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:23,000
That is wild to see because it would be shoulder to shoulder now I feel like in mid-July.

1574
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,340
Anything would be.

1575
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:24,740
Yeah.

1576
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,080
Yeah.

1577
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:29,500
In 92 there's no one going you want to go watch the movie on the floor.

1578
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:30,300
Like.

1579
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:31,560
Yeah.

1580
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,120
That's we've seen rides.

1581
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:42,760
And like okay so here's us before recording this is thinking mission to Mars once we I'm sure mission to Mars is kind of a radically different thing because Mars is way different.

1582
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:43,100
Yeah.

1583
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:48,980
So once we start and then realizing that the main difference is that one character has a mustache.

1584
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,120
I'm sorry.

1585
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,200
Wait wait.

1586
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,520
What are the main differences that Mr.

1587
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,660
Morrow is now Mr.

1588
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,160
Johnson.

1589
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,040
Otherwise almost the same ride.

1590
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,700
They repeated some stuff.

1591
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:01,480
Same structure same pre-show room.

1592
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:02,380
Yeah.

1593
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:06,600
So you know in my head I didn't I never knew what mission to Mars was.

1594
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:21,180
I don't maybe you like maybe you met an alien maybe some scary con type villain shows up and like sure he's big enough to grab your ship and he's going to shove it into the core of Mars and you're going to be sucking lava until you die.

1595
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,520
Well I don't know what happens.

1596
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,640
But instead you just land and that's it.

1597
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,420
The first part of the resistance is like this.

1598
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:33,780
That's the pre-show when you're on Lieutenant Beck ship there's a front and a back and it's making you see where you went and you think you're going there.

1599
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:34,120
True.

1600
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,520
But there's so much more action and so much stuff happens.

1601
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,020
Sure.

1602
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,000
Versus yeah watching the movie on the floor or the ceiling.

1603
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:42,060
So yeah 92.

1604
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,540
We're getting a little.

1605
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:44,360
This is a little.

1606
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:48,740
For unless you like well clearly the only move and what I was just saying.

1607
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:49,660
Star tour exists.

1608
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,980
Yes yeah that's the big thing right.

1609
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:52,520
Absolutely.

1610
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,540
That's weird that they overlapped.

1611
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,300
Yes it is.

1612
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,600
I hadn't thought about that at all.

1613
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:13,340
In both Disneyland and Disney World there is a very active ride with thrills and characters who you love from movies and you go to sci-fi worlds and then a couple feet away you leave that gift shop and then you can go right into one.

1614
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,320
It's like now we're going to ease off on the thrusters.

1615
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:17,400
It's the same premise basically too.

1616
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,680
It's like space tourism.

1617
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:20,360
Yes.

1618
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,460
Yeah so like.

1619
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,880
But they have they actually have jokes about how like.

1620
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:32,880
Doesn't this feel like an airport and it has the tropes of like it's like as familiar and kind of like mundane as an airport.

1621
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:38,180
They were doing like a comedy rocket to the moon basically or mission Mars.

1622
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,280
So I mean I'm sure imagineers are like this thing should go.

1623
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:46,260
We got to get like I'm sure it was just like well we don't have the money to replace it yet so.

1624
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:49,060
But yeah it is funny that they overlap for years.

1625
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:49,900
Wow.

1626
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:50,780
This.

1627
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,960
That cannot have been kind.

1628
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,760
No.

1629
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:55,460
You go on those back to back.

1630
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:00,500
Yeah.

1631
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:00,940
Yes.

1632
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:01,260
Yes.

1633
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,140
That's crazy.

1634
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,460
Well but yeah but you're moving less and it's air conditioned.

1635
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,420
So maybe you devote the time just to like get out of there.

1636
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:15,280
If we were doing this podcast back then Jason would be like you know what's a better ride than Star Tours.

1637
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:16,880
Mission to Mars.

1638
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:20,360
Longer you're in the air conditioning more doesn't jostle you around as much.

1639
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:20,960
Doesn't jostle you around.

1640
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,120
You get a little dozing.

1641
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,560
Nobody's yelling at you.

1642
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:26,760
Nobody's I don't like when the guy comes on and says Star Tours.

1643
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:27,560
What are you doing.

1644
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,380
I don't like getting scolded.

1645
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,040
Too loud.

1646
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,360
That's a punishment.

1647
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,920
I want I want a sleepy Mr.

1648
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,940
Collins to explain what he's doing while I relax.

1649
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:37,360
Mr.

1650
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,560
Collins is Jason's favorite character in fiction.

1651
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:49,620
Can I say I alluded to like a bad downgrade and this is the it's in Disneyland.

1652
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:50,380
Yeah.

1653
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:53,120
And it's Mission to Mars closes in 1992.

1654
01:12:53,880 --> 01:13:04,120
The building sits empty until part of it is used for something called Toy Story fun house which seems kind of like crappy.

1655
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:16,920
It seems like it was I think I never got to do this in either but this was like a interactive like an activation essentially that was next to the El Capitan when original Toy Story came out.

1656
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,720
So you see the movie and then you get to go into this whole Toy Story land.

1657
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:28,080
It's like this temporary carnival and I think it was pretty cool in that form like this extra thing and Hollywood on Hollywood Boulevard and I like Toy Story.

1658
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,080
I want to see real army men and whatever.

1659
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:40,920
But I think then you take then they thought well this went so well let's plop it into Disneyland for a minute and I don't think it was it didn't compare favorably to like the real permanent rides.

1660
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:45,200
You know yes it was meant to be a temporary thing so it was not there for very long.

1661
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:52,820
And then in Tomorrowland 98 the building eventually turned into Red Rockets Pizza Port.

1662
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:53,280
Yep.

1663
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:59,080
So that's where you are when you have your increasingly expensive pizza.

1664
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,620
Boy that just keeps rocketing up and up doesn't it.

1665
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:13,980
Yeah.

1666
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:25,200
But by that point Alien Encounter with some of that arc had already played out in Disney World where it was embattled and people thought it was too scary and too much trouble to put it and it's too expensive to put into.

1667
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:33,900
So the space that just sat empty while they wait while we waited for a ride to come ended up opening as a quick service pizza restaurant.

1668
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,600
And it's what it still is today.

1669
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,580
And if we're diagnosing the Tomorrowland problem this is a crucial one isn't it.

1670
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,420
Ride.

1671
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:50,180
The space that was essentially a ride from 55 to 92 becomes a pizza restaurant that's been there now for 25 years.

1672
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,740
That's how long it's been.

1673
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,240
Yeah 98 to 2023.

1674
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:55,960
Yeah.

1675
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,940
Food into I mean food in Tomorrowland has been a bad.

1676
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:03,360
That's been a food black hole for a long time.

1677
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:03,840
Yeah.

1678
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,840
Except for Mike Mitchell who loves pizza port.

1679
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,820
I don't know anyone else who's such a champion of it.

1680
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:13,080
There's no I can't see any sort of pizza riso fandom at the pizza port.

1681
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,240
I haven't felt it at least.

1682
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:14,900
Maybe there is.

1683
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:21,100
But yeah it's got to come with a lot of like well and but and I know qualifiers.

1684
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:24,700
Yeah a lot of qualifiers like I need to eat something.

1685
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,200
I wouldn't mind cafeteria pizza.

1686
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:35,300
Yeah and it's I like the exterior of the pizza port fine and it's got the rocket there and that's nice.

1687
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:40,340
Now it's yes now it's a little more Toy Story which is fine.

1688
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:47,160
But I don't you know what I I do like that as opposed to Red Rockets pizza port was always pretty ugly.

1689
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:53,160
Seeing aliens is a nice thing but that zone is just is chaos to me.

1690
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:53,520
Yeah.

1691
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:59,580
This is where the Tomorrowland all right if we're gonna go bronze let's stick with or whatever what did you call it like rusty.

1692
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,860
That corner chaos.

1693
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:13,620
Marble ball that's not like a whole fountain like it used to be when it opened because there was too much like pee and poop in there.

1694
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,180
So all right it's now it's just a marble ball and not a fountain gone.

1695
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:27,460
Rock Moonliners coming back the rocket and now it's going to be on top of a Coke cart weird ugly like transporting you away from thirst.

1696
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:32,080
I that thing's ugly it doesn't match the aesthetic of the rest and then it's just Star Wars junk.

1697
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,680
Now there's the aliens.

1698
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:40,020
I that Douglas aircraft thin is still kind of there.

1699
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:47,200
That's still yes the marquee that little swoop essentially is so where it says alien pizza planet that corner just junk to me.

1700
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:56,440
That is where like you should be in the heart of a cool aesthetic as you were when it that area ruled when it was Space Mountain with the ramps.

1701
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:02,420
The big neon logo the starcade the near me on Mickey.

1702
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:07,900
They destroy it now it's just like it's a like five things that don't all make sense together.

1703
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:08,540
It's a bummer.

1704
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,440
It's a disappointing pizza restaurant.

1705
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:15,040
It's an empty in inventions which is just a gift shop.

1706
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:19,800
It's an empty theater that plays previews for movies sometimes.

1707
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:26,420
Maybe I literally don't know what's there as we record this starcade that once in a while is like an event space.

1708
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:30,560
It doesn't have a second level like a two level arcade.

1709
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:32,160
No gone not anymore.

1710
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:40,020
And then if you really walk back you go to start Space Mountain and now we're back because I love that that big that that metal wall.

1711
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:46,780
You just you got to like yeah of course now it's just this like layer of awful aesthetic before I get to one of my favorite parts in any park.

1712
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:51,040
But that that layer that's a lot of brush to cut through.

1713
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:59,940
You're you're saying maybe one of your fixes go back to the past of the 70s like with the speed ramp.

1714
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:05,420
Yes and such don't go back to the past of the 90s chaos of like we're out of money.

1715
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:09,560
Just start re reuse the thin for the pizza place.

1716
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:14,700
Yeah well we will talk about it when we ever we figure out how to do our fix up.

1717
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,060
So but it's my opinion they need to like demolish almost everything except for Space Mountain.

1718
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:22,040
I think I think almost everything has to be leveled to the ground.

1719
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:36,640
Sure yeah yeah that's the way like I get I'm sure there are fixes but I bet there's a way to hollow out that carousel building and use it as like a waiting area or like the foundation of something if we had to cut them a little break.

1720
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:40,820
But ultimately hey utopia submarines blow it up gone.

1721
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:46,200
I know the massive environmental catastrophe that little yeah pocket there.

1722
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:56,020
But ultimately I was going to ultimately demolishing the interventions building can that be that much more money for going to build a giant other ride next to it.

1723
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,120
I don't think so.

1724
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,360
Yeah me as well.

1725
01:18:58,860 --> 01:18:59,700
Yeah true.

1726
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,920
I'm just trying to I'm trying to get my head start.

1727
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,460
Otherwise we don't get anything.

1728
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,340
It was as soon as demolition enters the picture.

1729
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,400
There's got to be a way to do Tron.

1730
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,340
Just figure it out.

1731
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:14,540
That's what they wanted to do.

1732
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:26,220
Hey by the way Douglas aircraft eventually absorbed by Boeing in much the same way that marquee got absorbed by the bad pizza restaurant.

1733
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,040
Sure.

1734
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:29,700
Two absorbings.

1735
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,020
Two absorbings.

1736
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,060
Two limping.

1737
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:34,600
And like I guess we'll use this.

1738
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,900
It's just OK.

1739
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:48,460
Well you know I think this helps to start like I think that's a bit that's a big tomorrow land juncture that that's a that's a path division where they could of course correct even like if they.

1740
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:54,780
I mean maybe they would have done alien encounter and then it just would have led to stitch and then it'd be nothing like Disney worlds.

1741
01:19:54,780 --> 01:20:04,620
But even if there had been a time where it was alien encounter something new and you just keep that space because that that that space is only going to keep being a restaurant.

1742
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:10,860
You don't go from restaurant back to the only way that happens is if there's a total demolition.

1743
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:11,180
Yeah.

1744
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:14,260
And you can easily build a restaurant near there somewhere else.

1745
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,100
So it's a it is a different.

1746
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:21,380
It all seems like one big structure but it is different than Space Mountain right.

1747
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,700
Which is it would have to be because that building existed before Space Mountain.

1748
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:32,960
Yeah.

1749
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:33,740
Then sure.

1750
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,840
But yeah I think that this this facility's got to go.

1751
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:43,900
Sorry Mitch but this this has to be for the for the sins of not just making it a new ride immediately.

1752
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:46,420
You know who could save it.

1753
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:50,700
Plek to you think Plecto's happening now.

1754
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:53,300
I think Plecto's Supper Club.

1755
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,720
I'm not against that idea.

1756
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:02,240
And for listener there was going to be this thing that replaced the Carousel of Progress called Plecto's Intergalactic Review or something.

1757
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:02,720
Yeah.

1758
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:08,660
There was this going to be this like crazy it's America Sings but a bunch of aliens all singing for you.

1759
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:09,180
Sure.

1760
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,180
But even that that was Carousel building.

1761
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:16,660
I don't think they're I don't think Carousel building could host a true Carousel show anymore.

1762
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:17,180
Yeah.

1763
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,760
Because of the demand or because it doesn't.

1764
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:25,800
I think I think they changed the building enough that you couldn't just make it even if they said let's just bring back original Carousel of Progress.

1765
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,240
We're taking it back from Florida.

1766
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,160
I don't think they could do it.

1767
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:33,040
You have to probably dismantle some of the spinning and gears and stuff.

1768
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:33,400
Yeah.

1769
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:33,620
Yeah.

1770
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:34,420
I'm not sure.

1771
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:34,920
Don't go man.

1772
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,540
But yeah you're probably right.

1773
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,240
I mean you probably just have to rebuild it.

1774
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:44,280
Of course I'd love they should try Plecto but yeah I don't we know one thing we're not getting is like an 80 animatronic show.

1775
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:49,680
That's part of like a thing that Tomorrowland 2055 sounded awesome.

1776
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:55,800
And Tomorrowland 98 I think will make for fun awesome episode of a podcast.

1777
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:57,860
But beyond that.

1778
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:58,980
It was a disaster in reality.

1779
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,740
It's its final use.

1780
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:00,720
Well that's something we'll get.

1781
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:07,200
We need to speaking of our subdivision we need there's like a bunch of Tomorrowlands we got to figure out how to handle.

1782
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:12,300
If there's ones you're particularly thirsting for audience let us know.

1783
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:17,420
We want to revive this Tomorrowland thing and commit to it more than Disney has.

1784
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:26,960
So please tell us what in Tomorrowland lore whether it's weird old 50s crap we missed or are you dying for 98 rocket rods.

1785
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:30,280
There's a lot of stuff that we got to start getting through.

1786
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:30,700
Yeah.

1787
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,520
We'll try to do it all without getting too sad.

1788
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:45,900
I know people are getting thrilled at the idea of comparing where the mission to Mars movie falls in Brian De Palma's filmography with Scarface and Untouchables.

1789
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,200
We are wondering.

1790
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:53,180
I am wondering like how did he how how did they what an odd.

1791
01:22:53,180 --> 01:23:00,660
Is it a director with a real stamp you know to do that to do some kind of forgotten Disney sci-fi.

1792
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:06,660
And what am I like is is it like his like Spielberg did Bridge of Spies.

1793
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:11,560
I like Bridge of Spies or other people like wild about Bridge of Spies.

1794
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,100
Why are you comparing those.

1795
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:22,340
Well I'm just saying it's kind of more like an in between genre a movie major work not a major work but there are known actors in it.

1796
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,800
This is a bizarre comparison to Bridge of Spies and Mission to Mars.

1797
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,960
Well is there another people saw Bridge of Spies.

1798
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,340
Yeah.

1799
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:31,400
And liked it.

1800
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:34,000
Didn't Rylance win an Oscar for it.

1801
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,660
I mean Rylance is terrific.

1802
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:36,300
Don't get me wrong.

1803
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:42,360
Well is there more of a Spielberg like you know Journeyman kind of terminal movie.

1804
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,520
Terminal terminal terminal probably probably terminals better.

1805
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:48,100
Yeah.

1806
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,440
Well we looked.

1807
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,860
Do people want us to watch this movie.

1808
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:56,920
Do people want us to just do water down blank check.

1809
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:58,860
That's a good question.

1810
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,200
People very good question.

1811
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:05,420
By the way Griffin Newman I think was starting to text us corrections on a recent episode.

1812
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,340
I saw a couple things pop in.

1813
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:14,460
He thinks I called wild old dogs wild hogs which I don't think I did but I don't know maybe I did.

1814
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,260
OK well let's just deal with it now.

1815
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,320
I hate to play corrections department Mike but wild hogs was 2007.

1816
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,140
You guessed way early on that for sure.

1817
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:24,760
I thought I said that on the episode too.

1818
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,340
You did I think.

1819
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:25,540
Yeah.

1820
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:30,040
I think I called it old dogs and then I started with like 2005 and then I said oh it's 2009.

1821
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:36,040
And John Travolta's every little step music video which we will cover more thoroughly.

1822
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,380
You're begging for it was for old dogs not wild hogs.

1823
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:45,400
But we could have called you look I could have made a mistake.

1824
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:51,440
Griffin I know Griffin that you are an expert in this area and in this genre of film and that director I forget his name.

1825
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:55,080
It's not Walter Becker he's from Steely Dan but it's a name like that.

1826
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,500
Well somebody look up who that director is.

1827
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,460
See if I'm right.

1828
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:02,060
But you know there are people out there myself included.

1829
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,980
I think we all get a little confused between wild hogs and old dogs.

1830
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:08,680
By the way I know where the video is from Griffin.

1831
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,980
I know that's not from wild hogs.

1832
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:11,820
I'm not crazy.

1833
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:14,220
But wait a minute but did you say it.

1834
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,420
If you said it in the episode.

1835
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:16,740
Maybe I said it but I did not.

1836
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,440
There's no way I meant to say that if I said it.

1837
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,540
Oh it is Walt Becker.

1838
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:21,500
Walt Becker is the man's name.

1839
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,180
That's confusing.

1840
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:22,620
Wow.

1841
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:23,680
Very confusing yeah.

1842
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:24,820
Two of the greats.

1843
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,780
Music equals in music and film the Walt Becker.

1844
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:32,080
I've never sat down and watched either of those movies.

1845
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,320
Maybe I should.

1846
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,300
They're bizarre.

1847
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,300
Does the audience want us to do that?

1848
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:36,680
I don't know.

1849
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,320
Well that's for sure watered down in Black Check.

1850
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:42,120
Has Black Check gotten to Walter Becker yet?

1851
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:43,020
Walt Becker.

1852
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,340
Walt Becker excuse me.

1853
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:46,420
They should.

1854
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,780
Well you know make sure they do.

1855
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:49,680
Oh he did.

1856
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,560
That is a good filmography.

1857
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,660
He did Van Wilder.

1858
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:57,680
Alvin and the Chipmunks the Road Ship and Clifford the recent Clifford where Clifford was not

1859
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:58,300
big enough.

1860
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:03,280
The awkward Clifford the awkwardly sized dog was Walt Becker.

1861
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:07,520
Scott is like popping a vein in his forehead while he's saying that.

1862
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,320
What he's upset?

1863
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,040
He's like that's his thing.

1864
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,180
The size of.

1865
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:11,660
It's like wow I've never seen this before.

1866
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:14,200
This is Scott's like line in the sand.

1867
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,680
Like Clifford needs to be really big.

1868
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:17,920
He's scared of that though.

1869
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,600
Look much like you saying yeah I know but I'm willing to be I'm willing.

1870
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:26,760
I probably am upset by I don't like that Clifford could fit into a house.

1871
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,460
Yeah right.

1872
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,340
Clifford look do a Google image of Clifford the dog.

1873
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,580
He's bigger than a barn.

1874
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:31,880
Right.

1875
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,580
That's the size of Clifford.

1876
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:33,960
Yes.

1877
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,300
They made it weird and too small.

1878
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,180
Awkwardly in between.

1879
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:40,180
Slightly bigger than Marmaduke in that movie.

1880
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:44,360
Just like people just like a lot of people are saying that Douglas Rockett looks like

1881
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:44,600
shit.

1882
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:49,040
I'm not the only person saying that Clifford was an awkwardly sized dog.

1883
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:49,860
That's true yeah.

1884
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:55,200
There's a growing growing more people that are saying you're hearing it more and more.

1885
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:55,800
Hearing it more and more.

1886
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:56,220
Yeah.

1887
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,540

1895
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,100
Like I don't.

1896
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:22,100
There's got to be some.

1897
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,660
There's got to be some.

1898
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:30,380
Real quick before we're done on the Wikipedia they have a picture which I really like which

1899
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,000
looks like they gave you some sort of certificate.

1900
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,240
Did you see this?

1901
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:34,280
Wait.

1902
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,240
For for.

1903
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:39,700
Oh for being on the ride for like on the ride like Mark Twain if you like you were the captain

1904
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:44,620
of Mark Twain or whatever and it's a really you wrote you wrote down who like your name

1905
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:49,520
to say that you've been to the moon and the one they have the picture they have says no

1906
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:56,000
all ye by these presents that Vice President Nixon has rocketed round trip to the moon

1907
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,500
from the Disneyland spaceport via TWA rocket ship and is hereby awarded this lunar flight

1908
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,180
certificate.

1909
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:06,800
And then it says how well how many miles it is and it's signed by Collins.

1910
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,600
It's signed by P something Collins.

1911
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,860
Nixon got of I'm a little rocket man certificate.

1912
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:14,520
Yes.

1913
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,100
Official little rocket man.

1914
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,220
Collins is one of the White House plumbers.

1915
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,080
8 11 50.

1916
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:22,180
Yeah 8 11 1955.

1917
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,200
Wow.

1918
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,080
He did it early.

1919
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,500
So that's the date on this thing.

1920
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:25,820
Geez.

1921
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,860
One of the first.

1922
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:27,280
Yes.

1923
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:27,780
One of our.

1924
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:31,400
Well you forget one of our first astronauts Richard Nixon.

1925
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:35,960
Collins is on the enemy list.

1926
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,400
He probably felt the same way that you feel Jason about your Mark Twain captain certificate.

1927
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:40,800
Oh yeah.

1928
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:42,720
I was a little rocket boy.

1929
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:45,960
I achieved much in this world but nothing better than being a little.

1930
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,560
Morrow is one of my few real friends.

1931
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,480
Collins dead to me.

1932
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:50,940
Mr.

1933
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:51,720
Tom Morrow.
