1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,540
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate where today we all together witness the special

3
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:33,540
moment in the life of any podcast when a runner on the show blossoms into a full podcast episode.

4
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,540
Oh.

5
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,540
It's beautiful, it's life-affirming.

6
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,140
Scott Gardner here to witness it, Mike Carlson as well.

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,140
I'm here too.

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,140
We're in the nursery looking at it admiringly.

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,140
Just like it's, I mean, look, we both have children, but this is on par with that.

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,140
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,500
It seems like not that long ago we were looking at the ultrasound and like, wow, I can't believe

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,980
we have a runner and soon that's going to be right.

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,980
Yes.

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,500
I mean, with this episode, this we were here back with Sebastian Jackal, admiring him in

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
our history as well.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Just boy, it goes so fast.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,620
Yeah, it does.

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,300
They grow up, they grow up and become content so fast.

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,140
And that's really, it makes you wistful.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,540
And also joining us fresh out of his stint in the hospital where he spent the night after

21
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,100
passing out in the Despicable Me splash area.

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,740
After drinking face down, after drinking a half a shot of sky vodka, we're glad he's

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,940
safe and here to record Jason Sheridan.

24
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,940
Hi.

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,940
Yes.

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,940
One minute.

27
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,940
Hold on one minute.

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,940
Yeah.

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,940
Should we talk?

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:46,020
I just want to, I want to set the scene for the authentic Irish pub in the, in the way

31
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,660
that our president did a blitzkrieg tour of Ireland.

32
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,860
Oh yeah, he did.

33
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,620
This is great timing.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
He did?

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,620
I'm not sure.

36
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,140
He came out on stage pretty much with a Wrestle media entrance to the dropkick Murphys shipping

37
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,500
off to Boston and the crowd is going, they love it.

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,540
It certainly conjures the excitement of our president.

39
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,540
Yeah.

40
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,540
Yeah.

41
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,540
Very exciting man in general.

42
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,540
Very exciting.

43
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
Dynamic and exciting.

44
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,060
Look we're here.

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:24,980
We are, we are, we are finally tackling at long last the Irish bar where you can get

46
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,980
hammered.

47
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,460
Get ready for a lot of those in this episode.

48
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,340
This has been looming for a little bit and we'll go into the backstory just to remind

49
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,420
everybody, but another little extra bit of backstory, which is great is that we determined

50
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,100
we should do this.

51
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,440
We locked in on the episode and then in the same hour that we made the official call separately

52
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:54,120
unrelatedly, there was a DM from a guest very politely asking, or you know what, calling

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,880
their shot to be part of this episode.

54
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,360
This episode itself, a cold shot, calling your shot to be part of it.

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,160
A very talented writer from vulture and a big supporter of the show, which we've always

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,920
appreciated that the Squires is here.

57
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Hello.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Aaron go bra boys.

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
That's right.

60
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Thank you guys.

61
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm delighted this came together.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,200
Did it just call to you when we, I think it wasn't that long ago we did an episode about

63
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,360
the Despicable Me, the super silly fun land and we said we wanted to do this episode and

64
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,640
that just like called you, that spoke to you somehow?

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,080
Yeah, I think it lit a fire under my ass.

66
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,560
When I sent the DM, I was in a bar writing about a different bar.

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,840
So I was like, I feel like maybe I need to bring my expertise here.

68
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

69
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,160
Well, and then you gave kind of a list of credentials, I would say.

70
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,760
If you look, list any of those if you want.

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,280
I don't want to embarrass, but I was impressed by the list in terms of your, I guess, drinking

72
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,000
content related prowess.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,880
Not just my drinking prowess, the content.

74
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
That's what we're talking about.

75
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
No, no, one step.

77
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:16,120
I have worked in bars both as a server and as like a booker for like shows.

78
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,560
Oh, gotcha.

79
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,000
I worked on the, canceled in the middle of making it season of Drunk History.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It was?

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, that's so, I didn't know that.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh my God.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We were one of those.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, great.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wonderful.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,040
And I had a podcast called Watching Movies at the Bar, which was about the movies that

87
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,000
are playing on a mute with subtitles at a bar and that specific cinematic experience.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, wow.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Wow.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,080
Did you then watch things only through that?

91
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,280
Were there movies that you saw only in that setting?

92
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,720
We didn't choose bars to go to and ask them to play a movie or anything.

93
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,520
I have watched a lot of movies at bars and I do keep a note in my head which bars give

94
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,040
me remote privileges.

95
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Okay.

96
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,840
That's like huge for me.

97
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,360
It's the Wi-Fi password and the remote privileges.

98
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,960
That's how you know you're actually in an establishment.

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,400
That's not something they give everyone.

100
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
No.

101
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Yeah.

102
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,320
So you know you have to know the owner to do that.

103
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Is there an etiquette?

104
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,280
Do you ask ever or do you like wait for them to kind of go, by the way, you can change

105
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,000
to the channel.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It kind of depends.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,720
I will ask often.

108
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,520
Sometimes the remote is like just sitting in the bar well and I'm like, do you need

109
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
a paper to put?

110
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
Can I get on there?

111
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Scooch on by?

112
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,440
Can I put on The Simpsons which isn't good on mute but whatever?

113
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
Sure.

114
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Sure.

115
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
It's visual.

116
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,160
I can do the lines to the guy next to me.

117
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
I think that will help.

118
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Yeah.

119
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
For sure.

120
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
And entertain everybody.

121
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Yeah.

122
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Everyone is going to love it.

123
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Do your mo voice.

124
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,040
It'll be better than the actual show.

125
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,640
In LA, I feel like it's not uncommon to have like Netflix playing or like the Criterion

126
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Channel.

127
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,280
I've been in LA's with black and white old bars in LA with black and white like old movies

128
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
on.

129
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Yeah.

130
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Jays on Sunset used to always have like.

131
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
That's the one I was going to say.

132
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,280
I was going to say Jason's talking about one bar and I try to figure out one bar.

133
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I've been to a lot.

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Okay.

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,800
They're doing a baffling move now.

136
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,360
They don't have the Criterion Collection or like TCM on anymore.

137
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:29,760
They play music and then they play live concert footage of a different artist on mute on the

138
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
TV.

139
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Wow.

140
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
That's interesting.

141
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Hard Rock Cafe style.

142
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,000
I feel like that was a lot of music videos, but also like, oh, here's some odd live performance

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,280
of probably Aerosmith, probably 70% Aerosmith.

144
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Yeah.

145
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Mostly Aerosmith.

146
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
That's very confusing.

147
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,600
Do you have a preferred type of entertainment or film then?

148
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,560
I think what works best is either like an action movie, something with like big stunts

149
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,360
that you don't need the dialogue for or a nature documentary as long as it's not one

150
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,200
where like baby animals die.

151
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Yes.

152
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,880
So something like aquarium footage where it's like, oh, this is just soothing.

153
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Yeah.

154
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
That's nice.

155
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,080
Hey, that was some of the appeal of Islands I feel.

156
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
I don't know how much they've kept.

157
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,000
Is it still the surf footage at Islands?

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Oh, that's the one in Burbank specifically.

159
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Any of them, I would say.

160
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,720
Oh, I don't even know if I've noticed the surf footage.

161
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,920
That was a big part of the early draw, I feel.

162
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,120
The fry basket is endless, is bottomless.

163
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,920
And that's really what I'm focused on.

164
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,280
So I guess I've missed that because like I'm very aware of TVs in general.

165
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,520
Obviously, Margaritaville TV, I'm paying attention to the TV mostly.

166
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,160
And being very judgmental about are they playing actual Jimmy music or is this just some like

167
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
pop-its channel?

168
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,960
Well, they have gone in waves.

169
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,080
When we were there initially, they were playing a lot more Jimmy Buffett.

170
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,520
And then I feel like the next year they switched to more like generic music.

171
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,640
And then I think they're back to mostly Jimmy.

172
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
OK, all right.

173
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Which is good.

174
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
That's what we're there for.

175
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,280
Well, do they want to close or not?

176
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,680
That's the question they have to ask themselves and keep the Jimmy coming.

177
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,240
They may not have a choice about closing.

178
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,040
We'll see.

179
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,280
So here's a question I have for you right off the bat.

180
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,800
You listen to the show and you're bringing all of this this bar knowledge, drinking knowledge

181
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,280
to it.

182
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:29,920
When we on the show talk about drinking, do we sound like a bunch of grandmas?

183
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
It's OK to say yes.

184
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
It's a loaded pause.

185
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
It's OK to say yes.

186
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
I'm assuming that's one of those.

187
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
No, no loaded pauses.

188
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
No, no, you know, you seem normal people.

189
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
You seem like you're not.

190
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
You seem like you're not.

191
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
You seem like you're not.

192
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
You seem like you're not.

193
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
You seem like you're not.

194
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
You seem like you're not.

195
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,200
Normal for LA, which is just a sober town.

196
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,520
OK, yeah, I see.

197
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,880
Like we show our cards if we are not constant drinkers.

198
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Is that what you're saying?

199
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,900
Yeah, or like or just like going like or just like I don't drink anymore is like a sentiment

200
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
that I hear a lot here.

201
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,580
Like, but not from like I can't drink anymore.

202
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,920
Just like a I'm sleepy all the time.

203
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
I hope.

204
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Yeah.

205
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,640
I think it's really bad for people who don't like LA specific content because that's all

206
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,160
that comes out of my mouth.

207
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,440
I have a theory that LA is really bad for like people following through with plans,

208
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,480
especially plans at night, because we're the only place in the world that gets enough sunlight

209
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,880
for like an actually regulated sleep cycle.

210
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Oh, interesting.

211
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,200
And I think that also affects the drinking culture here.

212
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,040
Yeah, that makes sense.

213
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
That makes sense.

214
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,920
We not get as weight.

215
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,600
Does that mean we have less night than other places?

216
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Or what is that?

217
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,440
The quality of light is better so that the vitamin D is in your body and it's affecting

218
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,920
the hormone production and you sleep like a person would before the light bulb fucked

219
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
everything up.

220
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Yeah.

221
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,880
New Yorkers don't sleep as well, so they're more likely to be in a bar at 2 a.m.

222
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Correct.

223
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Interesting.

224
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Really?

225
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
And I wonder if that's do you think that's influenced the law because the laws here are

226
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,920
such that most places can't be open till 4 a.m. like New York or like it's interesting too,

227
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,240
because I feel like that's also caught, stopped people from being out all night.

228
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,280
Although there are after hours places even here.

229
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Yes.

230
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Okay.

231
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Is there is that?

232
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Oh no, we know, we know.

233
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
I remember from doing it.

234
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Yeah, it's hard.

235
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,280
It's hard after the pandemic, you know, post worst days of the pandemic, a lot of places

236
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,680
not open super late.

237
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,800
Like even Bob's Big Boys closes at midnight now.

238
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,160
The 24 hour play, especially in Burbank.

239
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,560
There's like, I feel like three places left in Burbank that are 24 hours.

240
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Interesting.

241
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Is there an after hours place in Burbank?

242
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Do you know?

243
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,960
I don't know of one here now.

244
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Okay, that's interesting.

245
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,120
Okay, but because by the way, I could still party.

246
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,880
Oh, yeah, I was called upon to do it.

247
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm just saying, you just aren't getting the invites.

248
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,280
I'm not getting a little busy.

249
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,960
So but I could I could do it.

250
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I can still hang.

251
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,680
And I think my birthday party.

252
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,600
You know, weeks ago, yelling this at someone

253
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
very much aware of what I was doing.

254
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,840
When you say someone, do you mean the room?

255
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,720
No, I mean, Tim Chang, who I go to Comic Con with every year and like do four days of drinking

256
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,680
with him. And even though he's like seven years younger than me and I was just yelling,

257
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,400
we could still go, I could still do it.

258
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,320
And I think I could, honestly.

259
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,240
And I'm sorry, that was what you said, ending the night at a reasonable hour.

260
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,480
I was almost midnight.

261
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
Yeah, I had to go to sleep.

262
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
The place is closing up.

263
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,920
I had to go nighty night.

264
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,480
I guess I asked this this loaded question about us because of what brought us to this

265
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,520
episode is a very specific word and a very specific pronunciation of a specific word.

266
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,080
So let me just let me let me do the backstory that led us to.

267
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,200
OK, so what we are talking about is I'm not even going to say the real name yet.

268
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,000
We we know it as the Irish bar where you can get hammered.

269
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,480
And this came up on the show.

270
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,600
It if we're placing it in Universal Studios, it is in the streets of the world area.

271
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,200
We'll get back to that, Bethy.

272
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,240
And it's you know, a lot has changed in that area of Universal, but it basically has ended

273
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,080
up at the corner of the entrance of two kids rides.

274
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,000
Right. It's the secret life of pets and Despicable Me Minion Mayhem.

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,960
There was the one and now now there are two.

276
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,400
And then like it's it's kind of an unofficial little intersection.

277
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,520
And at the corner is a very narrow little Irish pub.

278
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,600
And this has come up on the show before in multiple settings where Mike, I don't know

279
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,080
if you want to try to flashback to how you brought it up before.

280
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,240
But basically, you just made you bringing up the point that it is there are these little

281
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,720
kid ride based on kid movies, but then there is this Irish bar where you can get hammered.

282
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,640
Yes. Yeah. I mean, that's the gist.

283
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,480
Was there something I'm missing or my memory?

284
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,880
No, I was I was making sure for my own.

285
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,400
I believe that's what it was.

286
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,920
It sticks out in my mind because I have walked by it multiple times, seeing people getting

287
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,080
like a draft beer or a tall boy and a shot at like 11 in the morning.

288
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,160
Gasp.

289
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,120
What? That's a little that's a little much next to the kids rides.

290
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,640
Like this is also when Universal Studios like needed some TLC.

291
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,800
It's it's you know, gussied itself up in recent years when they redid it.

292
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
People drank less.

293
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,680
Well, no.

294
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,680
The time we were there, what we observed, absolutely not.

295
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,680
But we were there during like the struggling hour.

296
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,360
We were there.

297
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,720
Wait, wait, wait.

298
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
OK, wait, wait.

299
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,960
We were there at happy hour on a rare night where the park was open till 10.

300
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,760
But you mean last night?

301
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,080
Yeah, no, no, no, no. Go back to this 11 a.m.

302
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,920
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

303
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,200
That's what we're talking about.

304
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,640
Well, look, some people, locals go to some not all go to Universal Studios,

305
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,240
Hollywood to get fucked up.

306
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,400
Sure. So are you are you mad about that?

307
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,000
You seem mad. No, no, no.

308
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,040
It was just it was just an observation.

309
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,640
And it was at the time, I think it was the empty Globe Theatre

310
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,720
and the Terminator also was not children's.

311
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,160
So it was a minute.

312
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,120
So we aren't even in a kids area.

313
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
I've seen both.

314
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,480
OK, so it was appropriate back then, honestly.

315
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,400
I mean, I guess it was kind of empty in that area

316
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,280
besides the Terminator queue before that.

317
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't even honestly.

318
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,320
This is going to be maybe blasphemous.

319
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,720
I don't even remember it being there back then.

320
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,520
It wasn't even on my radar.

321
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,040
It's been there for a while and that you can see two different drink menus

322
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,280
and two different like design styles inside. Right. Sure.

323
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,120
OK, but so but I would say to that, like people are on vacation

324
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,280
or they're having a fun like, you know, you can have a shot

325
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,960
and a beer does not seem like the most scandalous thing in the world to me.

326
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,760
It's called a Boilermaker. Yeah, it's called a Boilermaker.

327
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,240
Do it. But before lunch, it was in the kind of empty district.

328
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,400
Now very full.

329
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,440
Let me ask you this. Have you ever had a beer before lunch?

330
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah, I think it like a nasty improv festival or something.

331
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,960
Well, look at this.

332
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,240
Mr. Boilermaker is getting nasty over here.

333
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,440
I was in Las Vegas, Nevada once.

334
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,600
Oh, well, certainly in Las Vegas.

335
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,680
It was like 2009 and it was 10 a.m.

336
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,320
and somebody got a bucket of beers.

337
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
And I remember feeling like, Jason, what is this?

338
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,680
What hour of the day is this?

339
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,280
And then I had a beer and I went, I feel great. Yeah.

340
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,840
Can you see why I asked the grandma question earlier in the episode?

341
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,240
Just keep that question in your head.

342
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,440
Sure. There are most grandmas of drink

343
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,000
have had more alcohol in their bodies than us, I think.

344
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,200
So they're from a different time where it was.

345
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,960
That was the way you did it.

346
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,240
I do recommend drinking. Yes.

347
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,560
Oh, sure. Yeah, you will.

348
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,680
You do it first thing in the morning.

349
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,920
Also, I feel like I've been here before

350
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,920
or walked by it and it was just a hallway with no chairs.

351
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,960
There were chairs inside last night.

352
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,320
There were chairs.

353
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,240
So if you're looking to check this place out, they do have chairs.

354
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,480
They should put a sign out front now with chairs.

355
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,040
But to Jason's point, I do feel like that's why I think of it also as a bar.

356
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,160
You can get hammered is because it is

357
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,280
it's not a place where you're sitting down to have a nice time.

358
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,520
You're going in, you are getting the alcohol and you are

359
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,560
consuming it quickly on the go.

360
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,040
You're not savoring the experience necessarily.

361
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,520
Sure. Sure. It is set up sort of like, yeah, you're getting a slice of pizza

362
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,320
at like a quick service place.

363
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,680
It's not like you're going to lounge.

364
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,120
There's no Jurassic patio right there to sort of hang out.

365
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,840
True. True. So, yes, you're right.

366
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,320
Yeah, it does feel like there's a couple of tables, but it's not like

367
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,640
it's not a comfortable seating.

368
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,400
It's just people every with loud music, loud minions based music.

369
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,880
And then like it's not designed for you to hang out for 90 minutes.

370
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,480
Sure. Currently a construction wall outside the one door.

371
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,240
Oh, so you can't go into the little courtyard? No courtyard.

372
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,960
No, which is nice.

373
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,480
I like the streets over there.

374
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,440
I like the, you know, old universal like, look, this is like a set.

375
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,480
Like, I always like that. Sure. Sure.

376
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,320
Well, here I have this clip that Bethy provided.

377
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,720
Thank you.

378
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,800
This this is from 1989, some promotional video,

379
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,120
and it equates you to this area, which we've been picking apart

380
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,480
a bit at a time, the that they call the streets of the world.

381
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,560
And the idea was that we're going to have a backlot style settings.

382
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,120
It's everywhere in Europe and I guess in this case, New York

383
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,880
and that you can actually walk around the backlot area.

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
And you describe this as being very like

385
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,000
comforting, relaxing this this footage.

386
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,040
It felt very soothing.

387
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,920
It's like so Vaseline lensed.

388
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,280
And this guy is like calmly, like sonorously, like petting you down

389
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,680
like you're like a a techie horse.

390
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,360
That is how I use it, particularly videos with no

391
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,200
like real commentary about the theme park set, like self produced

392
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,760
internal kind of videos of the like, you know, the

393
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,320
well, what you watch in the resort TV channels and that kind of thing.

394
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,280
How soothing they are. Yes.

395
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
So here's this.

396
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,320
Cheeseburger fries, my wife named Shane, 45 to go.

397
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,280
I should have warned, though, that there is like 50s characters in doo wop,

398
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,920
but we described it as soothing and then it started with a loud 50s.

399
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,480
So anyway, it'll get more soothing as we go.

400
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,640
No, it's not a scene out of a movie from the famous 50s.

401
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
It's the.

402
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,760
The 50s are so famous.

403
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,920
You ever think of one of those famous decades?

404
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,720
They kind of are, though.

405
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,160
Well, they've been I guess because they've been like put on screen

406
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,080
in such a way many times like, yeah, and they're very like

407
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,800
they have specific like hallmarks or like the car.

408
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,160
I feel like the cars and happy days goes a long way as far as making the 50s.

409
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,000
They really popularized the film.

410
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,560
Yeah, so famous.

411
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,320
I mean, there's decades that are not, you know, I don't know what was going on

412
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,680
in the 13 tens, not famous, not famous.

413
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,600
Sorry, 13 tens.

414
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,400
Tollywood called the streets of the world.

415
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,560
This is the first time ever that the public has been allowed to wander

416
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,600
in and around the actual movie set streets, including 1950s America.

417
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,400
Sherlock Holmes Baker Street in London, the French Moulin Rouge nightclub

418
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,400
and a Parisian courtyard.

419
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,840
You're you're you're right on that footage of that, all of the Moulin Rouge.

420
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,920
The neck of the wood is so like gauzy, fuzzy,

421
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,640
and which I don't I don't recall like ever really seeing it lit up

422
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
and looking as nice as that.

423
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,080
Does this even look familiar to any of us who go to Universal?

424
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,920
Yeah, I don't think they've ever they they lit this up for one night of footage

425
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,440
and then never again. Yeah, it's never been turned on.

426
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,840
Yeah, it's gonna be open when it's dark.

427
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,640
That's true. Yeah, yeah, it very rarely is. Yeah.

428
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,200
So so that's kind of the and it's it's been like picked apart,

429
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,880
like not all not all of these areas are still there.

430
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,040
And this courtyard is not open right now.

431
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,200
But I think I was like, let me look at an old park map

432
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,680
and see if there was this pub or some other version of the pub.

433
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,560
And I think there was I think it opened as a London Baker Street kind of deal

434
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,880
that was called the Alpha in the pub.

435
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,320
So it's been there since at least

436
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,000
92, I think is when the the map is from that I saw

437
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,280
when it would have been very close to the Fievel area.

438
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,400
So, again, we're back to we are putting the alcohol next to the kids stuff.

439
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,080
Sure. This has been part of the rot of this bar.

440
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,760
Right. The beginning.

441
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,560
Mom, dad, you need a little break, you know?

442
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,760
Yeah, I guess maybe strategically. I don't know.

443
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,000
Like, yeah, you can like grab a beer, put it in your giant cargo shorts

444
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,720
and then go watch your kids.

445
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,240
Yeah. The hallmark of the 90s.

446
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,560
Some of your friends.

447
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,840
Well, you're on duty, Chaperone and your friends, Jack Daniels,

448
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,640
Evan Williams, Tillamore Doe, which is an

449
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,400
that is an acronym for the guy

450
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,840
who was the first general manager.

451
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,960
Say that again. We have segued into effect.

452
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,520
So to pre-prevent effect, Tellamore, Tellamore do the most second

453
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,760
most popular Irish whiskey in the world after Jameson.

454
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,640
Daniel E. Williams was a general manager

455
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,200
and one of the owners of the original distillery.

456
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,880
This is Tolomar. Tell them more.

457
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,000
So Tolomar do is his D.E.W.

458
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,880
is it? Yeah. OK.

459
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,120
There's a period after each one. Got it.

460
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,880
OK. Did not know that. All right.

461
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,880
I will look out for those periods when I see this bottle next time.

462
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,680
Interesting fact, number four Irish whiskey

463
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,280
recently has been Conor McGregor's line.

464
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Really? Yeah. Wow.

465
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,320
I haven't tried it yet.

466
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,200
What are you doing?

467
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
I still haven't opened the digits.

468
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,560
Scottie Pippen's digits sitting on my shelf.

469
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,760
You have a celebrity liquor queue.

470
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,800
Basically, yeah, I have tried the Terra Mana, which is good.

471
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,080
We've tried Casamigos, but my digits bottle is still sitting there.

472
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,040
Scottie Pippen's digits.

473
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,560
I don't know if they're making it anymore.

474
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,120
Mint in box.

475
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,760
Yeah, maybe it is a collector's item and I don't want to drink it.

476
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,160
I got sent a bottle of Terra Mana by

477
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,280
Applebee's, I think. What?

478
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,080
Why? Oh, the Jungle Cruise was coming out and there was a

479
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,080
The Rocks Margarita kit and it came with

480
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,400
an Applebee's gift card, which is annoying because I'm closer

481
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,080
to the Applebee's corporate location than a single fucking Applebee's.

482
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,800
And it's gone. I'm sinking down.

483
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,080
There are. They really are.

484
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,520
And you would think because we're look, Burbank has almost every chain.

485
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,160
We're not far from a lot, but chilies are rare.

486
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,480
Chilies is not an Applebee's are really rare.

487
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,240
I don't know why I'm saying this. Like, I'm mad.

488
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,920
I don't like Applebee's, but on your behalf, I'm.

489
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.

490
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,560
I see you. I don't want you to second guess yourself.

491
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,880
Are you sure it's not just a byproduct of the balance of power

492
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,840
shifting in the DC universe?

493
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,040
That could be why. Oh, OK. That could be why.

494
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,280
I thought it was because it was like the Rocks Jungle Margarita.

495
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,920
And it came with a bottle of Terra Mana.

496
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,680
That makes like a giant, like a really heavy

497
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,520
margarita glass that you could definitely bludgeon someone to death with.

498
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah. And now I use the box to store my Christmas ornaments.

499
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,120
End of anecdote. Thank you. Good.

500
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,520
Wow. Wow. That's nice.

501
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,240
Nice box with it, too. Yeah.

502
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,320
To keep going with the story and why this has come up a little bit.

503
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,520
So this bar has been referred to and I just noticed a couple of times in a row.

504
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,000
It happened in several episodes and I couldn't tell you when or where.

505
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,560
But the bar was brought up and the fact that it is a bar next to some kids,

506
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,320
things in a kids theme park.

507
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,960
And it was Mike who said, yeah, I mean, you can go to this place and get hammered.

508
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,600
And I noted it that it's the same.

509
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,480
There's this there's this like rise and fall.

510
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,000
This like this this elongated H that is the same every time.

511
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,520
They're like you have you do have this trademark way of saying it.

512
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,640
And then we were talking about something different.

513
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,200
And Jason said it the exact same way.

514
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,920
Hammer this big like launch, essentially.

515
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,120
And that was when I like I have to bring this up now.

516
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,400
What is this thing where they both say hammered the same way?

517
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,280
Who said it first?

518
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,640
I said it first, at least in on the show.

519
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,120
I want to say it was at least two times in reference to this bar.

520
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,320
And then Jason, you said it in reference to something else.

521
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,560
But this happens with Jason and I specifically because I probably mentioned this before.

522
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,600
My mom, when she listens to this podcast, she listens for the way in which I speak,

523
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,560
the quality of my voice, the way I'm pronouncing words.

524
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,680
Doesn't remember anything about any of the content, any of the guests, whatever.

525
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,000
Nothing doesn't matter.

526
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,360
But she'll say something like, you know, you and Jason, you're copying Jason and saying restaurants now.

527
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,280
I think I brought this up before.

528
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
And I go, oh, I am. And she's like, yeah, it's rest.

529
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,240
You should be saying rest. It's restaurant.

530
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,680
But you're all of a sudden you started copying Jason and you say restaurant.

531
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,960
I feel like I picked up one of your a number of your so I'm saying over the years.

532
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,200
Over. Yes. Over the years, Jason and I pick things up from each other.

533
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,320
And maybe he took hammer for me, I think.

534
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,640
And I've said this before, I believe this comes from Talladega Nights.

535
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,800
Oh, right. Wait, explain this again.

536
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,200
Why did this is the scene?

537
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,160
There's a long scene at the dinner table in Talladega Nights with

538
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,920
the little boys talking about throwing grandpa chips, war medals off the bridge.

539
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,280
It's my it's the best scene in the movie, I think.

540
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,040
And then there it's probably all like improv.

541
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,440
John C.

542
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,480
Riley then talks about how he likes to imagine Jesus in an like an angel band.

543
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,040
And he likes to imagine that he's in the front or the front row and he's hammered drunk.

544
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,240
Uh huh. So I think that's where it comes from, because I don't know that I even

545
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,120
said hammered before that movie.

546
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,400
You didn't use the word hammered necessarily.

547
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Not often, I don't think.

548
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,000
So I think the way he says it is I'm doing that.

549
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,080
Huh? That's where I think it comes from.

550
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,560
Kind of with some particular like an emphasis.

551
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,520
Yeah. He goes on. I'm hammered drunk.

552
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,640
I see. He puts a little something on it too.

553
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,960
A big old wind up.

554
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,600
And I bet that's where it's I bet that's where it's from.

555
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,840
And I guess you pointed out I had no I did not know this was the thing.

556
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,440
I'll never, by the way, never say it again.

557
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,520
But I know it has been picked on so thoroughly.

558
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,840
We'll switch to belligerent, belligerent drunk.

559
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,920
Great. Well, this is to that end.

560
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,280
This is what I let me ask.

561
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,400
And this could be a total miscommunication here.

562
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,320
Because if it really was a talladega night's quote,

563
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,960
I just I feel like when you referred to like, you know, in the next to these rides,

564
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,720
there's this bar and you can go in there and you can get hammered.

565
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,640
I viewed it as judgmental.

566
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,040
I view it as we are morally judging this place

567
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,440
that would serve the demon whiskey right next to where children are and pass by.

568
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,200
I never thought I thought the pass through nature of it.

569
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,000
Like the in literally in one door out the other.

570
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,960
What was more the thing than like children are around, you know?

571
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
I see. But what's the problem with that?

572
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,800
Like you would go to a beer cart and just get a beer, which you can get hammered with.

573
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,320
Sure. Right.

574
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,800
Funny to see the permutation of the Irish bar,

575
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,480
a place where you post up and hang out, you know,

576
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,440
turned into like a really quick experience.

577
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,960
Can I interject from a please perspective? Yes.

578
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,560
It seems like, yeah, you you guys are saying hammered

579
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,840
just as a point of emphasis.

580
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,760
But perhaps you're finding a moral judgment that's not present.

581
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,680
Like it's just emphasis, but you're taking that emphasis to be negative.

582
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,640
I think, yeah, maybe possibly.

583
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,760
Well, I might be on the lookout for it because I've talked on before about my distaste

584
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,040
for especially in a theme park podcast, dancing around,

585
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,320
having an alcoholic drink as if it is smuggling heroin.

586
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,520
Like we cannot possibly we're not going to go near the words that we would use.

587
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,560
And I guess by even saying hammered, you are not avoiding the subject.

588
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,800
So I think I might be on the lookout for that.

589
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,880
Like I'm viewing judgment in it.

590
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,520
Like, you know, they like that it seems more loaded than it is.

591
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,760
If you as an outsider feel like I'm pulling this out of nowhere,

592
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,400
then you know, then that's I'm glad we have your perspective here.

593
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,400
I'm not sure.

594
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,280
I think that if anything, it's just funny because the way it's laid out

595
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,960
is so classic universal where like there's no large plan to this.

596
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,040
Yeah, it's literally just like we're going to build this stuff.

597
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,840
And there's also just in the middle of it, a more adult looking bar

598
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,480
between kids rides.

599
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,560
So this is what it is.

600
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,120
This point is entirely kid stuff for sure.

601
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,040
Yeah. So that's what I think that's what it is.

602
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,720
Now, look, I've forgotten most things I've said or judged on this show.

603
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,280
So it's very possible I was judging it at the time.

604
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
I'm not going to deny that possibility.

605
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,520
So I'm just assuming that's probably what I meant, because I've had.

606
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:38,440
Look, I had three Manhattans at the Abracadabra outside of many years ago.

607
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,240
Once you mean, yes.

608
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,800
And that was that'll probably come up when we talk about what happened

609
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,280
at the Mulligans, too, because there was a similar situation.

610
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,800
Oh, yes. In a way, to what happened last night is so.

611
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,560
So, yeah, I don't think for somebody who's like, well, I'm judging this

612
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,920
because you had to walk like you should be able to walk

613
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,000
300 feet and find a bar, not 100.

614
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,400
Like, that's really it doesn't seem like I would be so judgy.

615
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,080
But I don't know. Maybe I was.

616
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,840
I think the context is just very funny.

617
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,080
Like, it's funny to watch people like

618
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,480
it head to Universal Hollywood when they live a few miles away and are like,

619
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,680
well, he took a taxi so I can get fucked up.

620
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,160
And then racking up, like buying three or four drinks

621
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,720
at Universal Studios Hollywood in the park and at most places in Citywalk,

622
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,920
you start getting towards the 60, 70 dollar tab.

623
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,560
Sure, sure.

624
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,920
But it's also a fun place to drive.

625
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,160
That's what you're paying for.

626
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,960
And then you're walking around and different.

627
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,840
Where were you saying?

628
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,000
I was just going to say, I think it's funny.

629
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,920
Jason's describing like Mardi Gras every morning at Universal.

630
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,560
Well, it was a lively crowd there at five o'clock on a Friday after.

631
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,120
Yeah. Yeah, yes, it was.

632
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,960
It was a lively crowd.

633
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,600
It was very much a mommy and daddy need their medicine kind of crowd

634
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,640
because there were a lot of kids like who had done their rides.

635
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,040
And it's like, oh, mommy and daddy are having their fun now.

636
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,720
Now, with daddy's what I'm saying, yeah, that's all.

637
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,480
Daddy's had our medicine last night.

638
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,000
I have several things to say to this.

639
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,680
Well, I said he's had our medicine.

640
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,040
And what's so wrong with that to you're describing, you know, yeah,

641
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,760
you get to get a cab and you go up there to get drunk at Universal.

642
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,120
You mean like you did? Yeah.

643
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,240
Yeah, well, I did. Yeah.

644
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,560
Safety first. I'll say this.

645
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,440
I'm glad you did.

646
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,200
Judgment is coming hard from Jason.

647
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
That's what I'm getting at.

648
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,320
I'm saying I thought the judgment was from Mike.

649
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,840
But what now I'm realizing is it's all been like daddy needs the medicine

650
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,880
and my hooch and 11 a.m.

651
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,960
Even in the desolate.

652
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,920
These two kids, I need to dull the pain of caring for a child.

653
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,600
I am the one of the three of us that is closest to.

654
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,000
Do you know the term California sober? Yeah.

655
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,640
I don't read. Is that we don't you?

656
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,800
You don't do our drugs.

657
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,240
You rarely drink if at all, but you smoke weed.

658
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,600
So, yeah, yeah, that I learned that at some point in the pandemic,

659
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,720
either in your California sober.

660
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,360
I mean, nowadays, kind of kind of.

661
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,720
Yeah. Right.

662
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,560
So you're judging because of that.

663
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,040
No, I'm not judging at all.

664
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,880
I think it's just.

665
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,240
Well, I don't know about that.

666
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,160
I know. Do you not feel what we're saying that you are?

667
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,600
I feel like it's it feels very prohibition from you right now.

668
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
No, I don't care.

669
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,280
I mean, I had a whiskey ginger beer and then I drank half of your Stella.

670
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,160
No, it was a great time there last night.

671
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,960
It was it was fun to sit at an outside table and just

672
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,840
it was a great people watching environment.

673
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,600
Absolutely. That's what I'm saying.

674
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,080
So we all went last night.

675
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,640
Bethy couldn't make it, unfortunately, but we went out and had a really nice time

676
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,520
with Jane and I feel like this was I wanted to explore.

677
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,160
I wanted to figure out, is this a seedy place

678
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,080
where you just hole up and drink your sorrows away, your child based sorrows away?

679
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,280
Or is it a place where the three hosts can cut loose

680
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,920
and have a little fun after doing a lot of recording late?

681
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
And I think we had a great time.

682
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,960
This is what I'm saying in the open air at a table.

683
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,200
It was a great time.

684
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,440
It was really fun.

685
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,840
Bethy, what do you what's your experience with this place?

686
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,640
I am an annual passholder

687
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,200
and I like my universal in a past more than when I had a Disney one.

688
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,640
Sure. That out there.

689
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,480
I go to Universal sometimes to write like when I'm stuck on an article.

690
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:35,040
Yeah. I'll go usually to the upstairs above the Krusty Burger.

691
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,280
The Krusty Lake Lounge. Oh, sure.

692
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,640
Oh, really? Yeah.

693
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,040
That's a great spot to write.

694
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,040
And then if it's open, yeah, I might stop by Mulligan's.

695
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,160
I'll try and get a gin and tonic, but sometimes I'm just like,

696
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,560
it's too fucking expensive. I'm not going to do it.

697
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,880
It's a bit much. Yeah, I've done it, but often I bulk at the price.

698
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,480
Yeah, I did consider I was trying to figure out the one

699
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,680
they had like a specialty cocktail that was like twenty five dollars.

700
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,800
I was like, what is this?

701
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,800
And it was like two or three kinds of single malts in one.

702
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,760
And yeah, I don't know that you're supposed to do that.

703
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,000
No, you're not.

704
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,520
That makes it it goes from being a single malt to a blended,

705
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,040
which is an objective.

706
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,960
Besides the word. Yeah, yeah.

707
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,120
But yeah, yeah.

708
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,880
Wait, if the bragging point is single malt, yeah.

709
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,840
Why would you counteract this and make it a multiple malt?

710
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,240
Bad. Wow. Yeah.

711
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,040
Yeah. In general.

712
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,840
Well, and a lot of we'll get into cocktails that are are just like

713
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,880
these unholy fusions of of different liquor.

714
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,400
Yeah, that is definitely a good point.

715
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:44,640
And that like especially boy beers are so expensive at Universal Studios

716
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,120
at this point. Yeah, it is.

717
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,320
You have you have two or three in a day.

718
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,480
And yeah, dear God, yeah, you are getting to that 60.

719
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,000
I feel like I know more about the layout of all of this at Disney.

720
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,440
Like, I'm pretty good about knowing everything.

721
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,600
And all this is a little more expensive as we can get this.

722
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,440
And I am a little bit in the dark at Universal

723
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,520
because I didn't even know like, oh, this is the only place

724
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,680
you can get hard liquor, which is not the case.

725
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,400
It's not true.

726
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,200
We in Universal proper, like obviously the hotels and the restaurants in City Walk.

727
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,320
But I'm a little bit like lost, I feel like, as far as like alcohol

728
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,960
at Universal and the area around it.

729
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,920
So do you feel like you know your way or you know what you're getting?

730
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,000
You there's like maybe it's a Mulligan's, maybe it's a

731
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,360
I don't know. Is that the only place you drink there?

732
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,200
No, I'll go to Island New Bar and get that passion fruit one.

733
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,240
Oh, OK. OK.

734
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,480
Wait, that's a beer passion fruit.

735
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,720
No, no, no. It's a cocktail.

736
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,600
I can't remember what it's called.

737
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,640
It's called like a something bird.

738
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,320
Mm hmm. Yellowbird, maybe.

739
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,680
Hmm. I should get that. I should try that.

740
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,640
Does it come on one of the mugs?

741
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,120
If you pay for it, you pay for it.

742
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah. But also the like non I took home my like throw away mug

743
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,960
because it was just like a plastic mug shaped like a tiki.

744
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,360
And I still use it. It's my water cup on my bed. It's nice.

745
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,360
Yeah, I have a whole yeah.

746
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,040
We have a whole like cabinet of theme park glasses,

747
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,680
many of them falling apart.

748
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,800
I'm just remembering this.

749
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,840
But the time that I got the the passenger drink

750
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,760
first at the Island New Bar was the day that Roe V.

751
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,240
Wade was revealed. Oh, my.

752
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,440
Because I've gone to Universal every day.

753
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,360
I want to avoid a news cycle.

754
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,440
Like when like certain justices were confirmed,

755
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,560
I like Instagram pictures with Lucy.

756
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,400
Were you talking to Lucy about like Brett Kavanaugh or?

757
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,320
Yeah, I think I was like smile and say, believe women.

758
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,440
Lucy, you fought for everything you fought for is crumbling.

759
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,240
She's a girl boss and we have to respect.

760
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,520
She is a girl. Yeah, in the famous 50s.

761
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,320
Unfortunately, when she smiles for photos,

762
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,880
she only says Ricky put me in the show.

763
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,160
She can comment.

764
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,440
That's kind of like a smile, but it's.

765
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,080
Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah.

766
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,520
That was how you felt the Kavanaugh day was the whole day.

767
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,080
You just felt it.

768
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,360
I understand where Lucy's coming from. Yeah.

769
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,480
Comforting, though.

770
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,000
That's a great plan also to especially because I think there's slivers

771
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,760
of that island new bar zone where like if you just can cut off

772
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,360
certain things in your periphery, if you can't see, you know,

773
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,920
a billboard for the fablums or like a.

774
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,120
Yeah, totally.

775
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,000
Or or the El Pollo logo, the El Pollo logo.

776
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,120
That is what I'm trying to say.

777
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,400
Oh, yeah. El Pollo logo logo.

778
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,800
If you can cut those things out, you can almost feel like you are

779
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,800
on a tropical vacation for a brief moment like

780
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,480
and not dealing with Supreme Court justice ors.

781
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,800
I wear my head with this.

782
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,560
But you have OK, you have been to to this place, which incidentally

783
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,200
is not called the Irish where you get hammered.

784
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,480
It is called Mulligan's Irish Pub. Correct.

785
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,720
OK, so you've been here regardless of all of our nonsense.

786
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,200
What were your feelings not tainted by any of this?

787
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,400
I think I really enjoyed the the fake back lot of it all.

788
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,760
Yeah, because every time you're like on and you see like all of these

789
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,120
like facades of bars and restaurants and stuff like,

790
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,560
I wish that you could just go in and be there.

791
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,640
And like they they knew that's what people wanted.

792
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,240
So they just put it in there. And I love it.

793
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,560
It's so I love anywhere that is just total artifice.

794
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,040
And like fake Irish bars are like all all Irish bars are like that.

795
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,160
It's like very sticky.

796
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,600
Like they have their things that they're going to do. Right.

797
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,960
And I think it's so cute and I salute it. Yeah.

798
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,120
Is there a do you like a pro?

799
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,120
I'm trying to think there's one in Vegas that's like it has all the trappings.

800
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,400
Oh, yeah, there's two in Vegas.

801
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,920
Yeah. I'm trying to remember which one I'm thinking.

802
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,000
There's nine fine Irishmen in New York, New York.

803
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,800
And then there's another one that's called like it's something in Gaelic

804
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,320
or in Irish.

805
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,560
I can't remember, but it's that's the ones in the shops at Mandalay.

806
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,360
OK, yeah, I think that's the one I'm thinking of.

807
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,000
They both claim to have like bought the interior of a bar in Ireland

808
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,320
and shipped it and built it in.

809
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,320
And yes, I've asked both of both barters like, did you really?

810
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,640
Like, no, we did not do that.

811
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,600
That is a go to marketing.

812
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,080
We ship the bar over from Ireland.

813
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,560
They don't say anything about shipping over all the tchotchkes that inevitably

814
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,920
actually not in Mulligans anymore.

815
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,400
This is like a photo of what it used to be like.

816
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,240
And there was a lot more like bottles and flags and like burn script pages.

817
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,480
It looks like postcards and stuff.

818
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,800
Way less today. Yeah.

819
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,040
More authentic. Yeah. More authentic.

820
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,960
And this is kind of what it is now.

821
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,240
The plexiglass they've taken down at this point.

822
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,880
Yeah. Somebody got tired of dusting.

823
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,520
That's I think so.

824
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,200
A lot of nooks and crannies.

825
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,320
They took down all the like beers from around the world or whatever it was

826
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,600
and just painted Irish proverbs

827
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,080
like really high up that are right next to the giant like

828
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,560
globe bulb lamps where I went back in to try and get a picture.

829
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,920
I was like, I can't see it.

830
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,200
And the camera is not working well with all this light.

831
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,520
So this this feels this place feels like the closest

832
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,760
thing to like a fake bar.

833
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,000
That's the minimum they've done to make it functioning.

834
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,160
Like like it's just I've seen.

835
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,920
Yeah. The Vegas versions I've seen.

836
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,720
I've never been to Ireland.

837
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,240
But this one is funny because it feels like they could just close the doors,

838
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,120
take away the real bottles and you look in and go, oh, that's they're just

839
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,360
putting up a little placeholder to make it look like this.

840
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,560
Like it's they're doing the bare minimum here.

841
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,400
Not to put it back to the Simpsons again, but in the episode where

842
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,000
Homer gets kidnapped and taken to the mysterious island,

843
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,760
he's briefly in a fake quickie mark that's just inflatable.

844
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,280
And it's actually like a fan that takes that vibe.

845
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,960
Like this is an inflatable bar.

846
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,400
Yes. Yes. It feels like they can easily move this anywhere in a day.

847
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,320
Yeah. Which then the bragging rights for a bar that we actually shipped

848
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,520
the interior of a real Irish bar from Universal Studios.

849
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,920
And then that would make sense.

850
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,680
You would believe that for like a David Fincher, the game kind of scenario.

851
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,400
Oh, yeah, boy. Yeah.

852
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,520
Or like the sting, we can pack it up.

853
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,680
You know, I hate to real quick,

854
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,560
because David Fincher's the game is an immersive.

855
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,560
Is that something we could cover on this show?

856
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,680
Yeah, I guess.

857
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,960
Well, you gave away the ending, but yes, I guess that's true.

858
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,600
I guess. But that's a different way to view it is to look is to go back,

859
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,480
knowing the ending and to view it just as we're not.

860
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,240
It's not the story we are looking at.

861
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,120
How does this function as an immersive theater experience?

862
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,720
Yeah, I think that's pretty funny.

863
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,600
Yeah. Like reviewing the game as an experience.

864
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,480
How good is the game?

865
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,200
The tough part is that one of the three of us will have to get the games.

866
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,680
Yeah. And it's revealed at the end of the episode.

867
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,520
Maybe one of us is already being gamed.

868
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,360
Oh, yeah. Oh, good. A great nightmare of my life.

869
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,320
Cool. Cool. Come to the garage door.

870
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,160
And then there's 50 people, you know, every day.

871
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,960
It is you, by the way.

872
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,120
Yeah. Oh, cool. Yeah. Inevitably.

873
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,520
Yeah. Of course. Sorry.

874
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,640
I'll cut that out. You won't forget.

875
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,560
I there were some touches last night that to me seemed inadvertently

876
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,920
like little nods to Irish bar, like a really energetic guy

877
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,160
saying just a little too loud.

878
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,560
I'm going to get another beer.

879
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,240
Do you want to Stella Stella?

880
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,240
OK, yeah, Stella.

881
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,960
And the sound of a crying child, but you can't see the crying child.

882
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,560
And then someone doing just a little just a little scam,

883
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,560
just a little a little scam going on.

884
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Mm hmm. Oh, you mean with me? Yeah.

885
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,680
We'll get into that.

886
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,000
Wait, Mike, you edit. You're you got you're loaded with some.

887
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,200
Well, I thought it was funny because Jason is describing a theme park also.

888
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,680
Yeah. People are young and a baby.

889
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,280
You're like it's things I've experienced at like Mavs residuals,

890
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,760
the bar where you bring your super cheap residual checks for free.

891
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,080
Residuals. I've seen kids like around like more like Irish bars

892
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,480
back where I grew up.

893
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,200
I feel like, you know, they inevitably had a catering room.

894
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,560
There is, you know, I was I'm trying to think of my

895
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,640
when I was at the Irish bar in Vegas, there was a guy on stage

896
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,880
playing a loud acoustic version of With or Without You by you two.

897
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,000
Oh, you're having which I do, by the way, I liked I enjoyed it.

898
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,880
It was like fast version to like really kind of changing it up as far as like,

899
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,160
well, your micro is your famous standards of I like music being played.

900
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,640
I absolutely it doesn't really matter.

901
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,840
Is there an instrument?

902
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,360
Is somebody manipulating it? Then I'm in.

903
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,560
Absolutely. So so, yeah.

904
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:11,280
So so I'm just saying like that just seems like normal theme park nonsense, too.

905
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,680
Oh, it is. Yeah. One of the things to share.

906
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,080
I will say this as far as the thing again, though, we're hyping this story.

907
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,920
So it's going to be a disappointment because I keep hyping it.

908
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,600
But the thing that happened to Scott is the most weird bar thing.

909
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,960
Yeah. That does not usually happen at a theme park.

910
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,800
That's the very specific thing I would say.

911
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,240
I think I was specifically thinking back to there was a bar in my hometown.

912
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,800
I think it was called Maximillians.

913
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,360
I think it's something else now.

914
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,080
And they have every Christmas Eve, like in the afternoon, they had a free buffet.

915
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,000
And I feel like my family would always go.

916
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,840
My parents would have one glass of beer, one glass of wine.

917
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,960
And everyone. Huh.

918
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,080
What time of day?

919
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,720
Between like three and six p.m.

920
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,560
Good. I will support you on this because I think

921
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,640
Philly area bars in general, the Irish bars do hit different.

922
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,520
Yeah. There's so many in Philadelphia are like in the ground

923
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,320
floor corner unit in a row house like, OK, it's either a bodega

924
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,440
or it's Patti McGillicutty's, you know.

925
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,520
I got married in Philly on Halloween.

926
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,120
And we our reception was just at our local bar.

927
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,800
And while we were there, children came in trick or treating. OK.

928
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,960
The regulars had candy on them like it wasn't the bars candy

929
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,360
and gave the kids candy and then the kids left.

930
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,680
Sounds totally normal to me.

931
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,680
OK. All right.

932
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,240
Ready for bar trick or treaters. That's amazing.

933
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,960
Must be common. Yeah.

934
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,760
I yeah, I always hear about the like parking lot

935
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,000
trick or treaters where people open like trunks and stuff.

936
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,200
And that is really more alien to me than like, oh, yeah.

937
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,680
And of course, you know, the bar at the end of the street

938
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,800
gives out candy.

939
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,480
I'm trying to think like in Chicago.

940
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,680
And I didn't spend a ton of time drinking in Chicago

941
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,600
because I'm from the suburbs and the city is a scary place.

942
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,640
So I'm not going to go there that much.

943
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,360
That's what I was raised to believe.

944
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,240
So but like Wrigleyville before you go to a Cubs game,

945
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,760
that there's probably a decent amount of kids watching as their dad

946
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,120
gets hammered before going across the street to the stadium,

947
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,880
the baseball stadium. Sure. Sure.

948
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,520
So that's probably the closest I can think of to like kids around.

949
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,280
But that's maybe one story I can think of in my way.

950
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,040
In the bar, you're saying? Yeah, because like you bring your

951
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,360
the dads are bringing the kids to the game, but you go to the bar

952
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,640
before going to the base.

953
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,080
They're going to drink a lot at the baseball game as well.

954
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,720
But you got to drink before as well.

955
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,360
To make sure that you're hammered before going in.

956
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,920
I don't know if I've ever seen a kid in a bar, maybe besides this place.

957
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,160
What is the general policy?

958
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,160
Illegal. Oh, OK. Yeah, but so.

959
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,640
So in these situations and what you're saying, this is just like it's

960
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,120
the legality is being a good.

961
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,440
This is this was also a time where like, you know, I'm bored.

962
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,000
I'm out of quarters for the arcade game.

963
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,520
I'm just going to pull on the cigarette vending machine.

964
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,400
Nobs are fun. Those are fun.

965
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,600
Those are fun. Yeah, those are very.

966
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,720
And the places I'm describing in Wrigleyville, probably that I'm thinking of

967
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,360
like their restaurant bars, too.

968
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,560
So it's not like kids shouldn't be in like kids can be in there

969
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,720
because they so they serve a kid's meal.

970
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,960
But dad can get a Long Island ice tea and he will.

971
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,200
This is let me take one more point about why like that.

972
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,400
This seems to have loomed as an odd thing, that there's this bar

973
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,280
in this theme park when I just like actually here.

974
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,360
I'm going to quote my my son's actual grandma

975
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,200
and say what I was describing, what this episode is and why we're doing it.

976
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,040
And she was like, you get hammered anywhere.

977
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,600
You get hammered at any every restaurant has hard liquor

978
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,560
and then children are in it. Right.

979
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,800
This is what I think this is why it doesn't necessarily land for me

980
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,080
that this is the strangest situation.

981
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,720
I don't know that I ever said it was the strangest situation.

982
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,960
I think it's just funny to see like

983
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,840
up top the hill at Universal Studios Hollywood, like everything.

984
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,200
Sorry. Oh, it's just in.

985
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,840
I swear it's happened multiple times in the morning before lunch.

986
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,040
The issue, I think, is just theming.

987
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,400
I want like Gru's drink stand and also Gru will give you

988
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,120
whatever the thing with the do whatever D.E.W.

989
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,480
Thank you.

990
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,560
Gru will give you his version of that.

991
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,000
And then I don't even bat an eyelash.

992
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,960
Gru could be selling weed up there.

993
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,280
And I wouldn't think it's as strange as long as it's themed to the eliminations area.

994
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,800
That's what I'm saying, which is a pretty enhanced banana daiquiri from great.

995
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,760
I love the CBD.

996
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,680
I love CBD. And he says that.

997
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,160
And then I go, yeah, great.

998
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,040
He's the bartender to the bartender, bartender. Right.

999
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,920
This doesn't sound good.

1000
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,320
And you know what? And that drink that you just described, the banana daiquiri,

1001
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,080
I think that they could justify charging twenty six dollars for.

1002
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,160
That's a CBD infused CBD infused is just a complicated way of saying expensive.

1003
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,960
And also does nothing in drink form.

1004
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,200
Oh, I was going to say I did drink a can of CBD seltzer once.

1005
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,720
And I started to really feel weird.

1006
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,320
I started to really freak out.

1007
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,040
Mm hmm. And I called Jane and she was like, that can't happen.

1008
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,760
And I'm like, it is happening that she said that can't happen.

1009
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,200
I don't think that's how it works.

1010
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,680
I don't think it had. And I was like, I don't know.

1011
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,200
I don't know. Gaming.

1012
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,680
It's he got gamed. Oh, no, I got gamed.

1013
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,960
That Jane was gaming. That was step one of the game.

1014
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,560
How much of it did you had?

1015
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,640
It was like a whole like 12 ounce can or whatever.

1016
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,040
OK, I don't know how many like milligrams that would be.

1017
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,440
Was it just that it was it had nothing to do with the CBD

1018
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,720
and everything to do with that? It was a shitty drink.

1019
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,080
No, I mean, I bought it at like a bougie liquor store in that water village.

1020
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,720
So it was high quality.

1021
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,520
I guess it was that good shit.

1022
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,840
It was that good shit. Yeah.

1023
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,800
Billy, what were you saying?

1024
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:30,040
Oh, I was going to say that like CBD cocktails often have CBD oil in it.

1025
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,800
Like that's it's like an upcharge.

1026
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,920
They'll put oil in it.

1027
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,120
So if you just want to drink with cold oil in it.

1028
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,720
I have an option for you.

1029
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,520
OK, Elish, I measure blends beautifully.

1030
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,400
Oh, yeah, it doesn't look like weird scum on the top at all.

1031
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,480
No, like seeing a puddle with like motor oil floating in the oil

1032
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,280
and water go together perfectly as the old saying goes.

1033
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,240
The famous BS, the snack you want.

1034
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,760
But that's what grew would serve.

1035
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,360
He would have like kind of a gross looking drink

1036
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,440
because he's a supervillain and he's in the experiments to the group.

1037
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,600
Are you like his laboratory?

1038
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,680
Essentially, that's really more the Russell Brand Doctor

1039
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,720
scientist character doing experiments that the shop is themed to him.

1040
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,560
OK, what's the name of the character's name?

1041
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,560
Do we know the truth?

1042
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,120
This doctor, that guy who's not running a cult.

1043
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,600
Don't worry about it.

1044
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,720
The best guest club, Random has, and that's saying a lot.

1045
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,200
Yeah. Oh, they just had Fred Durst on.

1046
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,680
What did you do?

1047
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,040
Director.

1048
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,640
Eva texted that to us and I think said, Mike, don't die.

1049
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,320
Let's let's talk about our our orders or in your case,

1050
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,320
just anything you you've had up there and when there and there's what you

1051
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,960
we took your recommendation and we'll get to that specific beverage.

1052
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,640
But well, if you haven't heard,

1053
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,760
I got to look up what the oh, here.

1054
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,960
No, I got it.

1055
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,760
My I got the Guinness old fashioned old Forrester Guinness

1056
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:14,240
stout spiced bitters, simple syrup, brandy, cherry, which was not in there.

1057
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,480
There was an orange slice instead.

1058
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,400
Wasn't sure I was going to feel about this.

1059
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,880
I tend to gravitate to old fashioned kind of stuff.

1060
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,960
But the Guinness infusion sounded weird to me.

1061
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,720
I liked this a lot. I really liked the drink.

1062
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,640
I was surprised. Yeah.

1063
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,560
I guess this is a question I had is, am I going to like the cocktails?

1064
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,520
In this kind of in this sort of small. Right.

1065
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,960
But I don't know. I dug it. OK. OK.

1066
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,200
Well, Jane had the

1067
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,560
it's very funny name Irishman on vacation,

1068
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,680
which is coconut rum, simple syrup, pineapple juice and lime.

1069
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,120
And I had the Irish mule, which is Tullamore Dew, Irish whiskey,

1070
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,640
ginger beer, lime juice and lime.

1071
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,560
Yeah, we both liked our drinks a lot.

1072
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,640
I was very surprised they were using a nice brand of ginger beer.

1073
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,720
It was kind of, you know,

1074
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,480
bitter, like you feel in the back of your throat.

1075
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,760
It wasn't like the super.

1076
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,200
There's some ginger beers that are really sweet. Yeah.

1077
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,120
But it was good.

1078
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:17,440
I mean, this is one Irish whiskey and ginger beer, ginger

1079
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,560
rails, kind of one of my go to drinks.

1080
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,440
And I thought it was really good.

1081
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,720
Hmm. I'm shocked so far by the the generally enjoying the beverages.

1082
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,800
I do think it's funny that they are like, OK,

1083
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,600
Irish pub, it's got a real traditional Irish pub.

1084
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,800
But we want to have my ties, right?

1085
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,200
We have to have my test. All right.

1086
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,440
Well, how do we justify Irishman on vacation?

1087
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,840
I guess it is.

1088
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,760
Look, people from Ireland go other places.

1089
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,640
They do. You tell me an Irish person has an Adamite tie.

1090
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,880
They're justified.

1091
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,040
That's what I was trying to figure out.

1092
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,520
What are those? I was like, wait, is that a run runner?

1093
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,040
Is that a my tie? Like, what is that traditionally?

1094
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,800
Because there is a preview.

1095
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,320
There's an older menu

1096
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,200
where all the drinks are not Irish blank.

1097
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,160
They're like their movie ones.

1098
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1099
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,560
So I'll read that.

1100
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,480
Mike, what tell us about your drink?

1101
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,400
Well, I had a drink called Jurassic Water.

1102
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,200
It is vodka, rum, tequila, gin, blue curacao,

1103
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,160
melon liqueur, raspberry liqueur, sweet and sour and soda.

1104
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,320
And it was disgusting.

1105
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,000
That's coming from a guy who likes a lot of colors in his drink.

1106
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,880
The fact that gin is one of them is so upsetting to me.

1107
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,920
Yeah, I know.

1108
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,880
I think I agree with you, but there's larger problems, too, I think.

1109
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,160
Structural problems with this drink.

1110
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,600
Foundation. The foundation, the concept of it.

1111
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,800
Because I look, I've talked many times about what I like.

1112
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,680
My grandma drink is the Mickey's Funwheel at Disney's

1113
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,760
California Adventure. It's off menu.

1114
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,160
I feel a little excitement when I order it like any off menu item.

1115
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,120
This is off menu as well.

1116
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,920
Yes, and I do.

1117
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,880
Becky made a point of saying you got to get that.

1118
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,280
You didn't call it the name.

1119
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,640
You called it like I think I call it the off menu blue thing.

1120
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,400
The blue thing. Yeah.

1121
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,360
And it sure was.

1122
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,560
And when it's layered, it kind of looks like blood in the water,

1123
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,320
which I think is supposed to be the Jurassic connection.

1124
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,800
Now, on the old menu.

1125
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,360
I didn't get that. That makes sense.

1126
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,160
That's good. But I didn't get that.

1127
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,920
But that's also that's there's a much better version of that at the Joe's

1128
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,200
Crab Shack. Oh, yeah.

1129
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,640
Called the Shark Bite, which is a big like almost chalice glass

1130
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,960
chalice, and it's like blue.

1131
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,200
And then they dump a little vial of red in it to make it look like blood.

1132
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,800
Now, that's a hell of a sugary drink.

1133
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,840
That's a good thing.

1134
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,080
This is why I'm fascinated that the Jurassic water is like

1135
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,520
notably bad, because I feel like everywhere has like a blue thing

1136
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,840
that is not optimal, but is at least potable.

1137
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,720
Like, yes, I assumed it would be the same as like an adios

1138
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,920
motherfucker or like a fish bowl, whatever the big blue thing is,

1139
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,760
wherever you are.

1140
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,800
But this is a special worse.

1141
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,320
It's one of the worst blue things I've ever had.

1142
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,800
I think for sure.

1143
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,160
And it's so close to a Long Island iced tea.

1144
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,720
But they also have a regular Long Island iced tea on the menu.

1145
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,840
Well, an Irish Long Island, an Irish Long Island.

1146
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,360
And don't forget, I just also have to name check the Shamrock Margarita.

1147
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,080
Oh, it's just a margarita.

1148
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,680
Yeah.

1149
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,000
Or as we might know by its other name, Margarita.

1150
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,200
Margarita. Yeah.

1151
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,280
The old menu was all movie themed like Creature from the Blue Lagoon,

1152
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,480
Frankenstein's Revival, Amity Island, Mytie.

1153
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,760
That was kind of a leap.

1154
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,560
And probably one of the more disgusting ones, Fast in the Fiery,

1155
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,600
Cinnamon Whiskey and Angry Orchard Cider.

1156
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,640
You can get that at Harry Potterland now.

1157
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,040
I don't know. That's not bad.

1158
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,800
I bet it's a little too sweet, but I bet that's one of the better ones.

1159
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,200
Honestly, we were discussing, Scott and I were discussing.

1160
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,560
I think that the Angry Orchard is maybe going to be too sweet with it.

1161
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,600
If it was like a more subtle apple taste, I bet that's good.

1162
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,600
But I could be wrong.

1163
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,840
The Pitch Perfect Martini is gin, dry vermouth and sweet vermouth.

1164
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,040
So I thought, oh, that kind of sounds interesting.

1165
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,000
Both kinds of vermouth in there.

1166
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,280
Hmm. Hmm. I'm not sure.

1167
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,200
We'll have to do obviously a part two of this episode.

1168
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,720
So yeah, I think some of us like to drink.

1169
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,720
Hi, I'm so sorry.

1170
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,160
Do you do you still make the pitch perfect martini?

1171
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,800
Do you? The bartenders are really nice, by the way.

1172
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1173
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,760
Wait, I have a quick bet that you did.

1174
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,880
You have had the Jurassic Water or were you just curious for us?

1175
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,280
Oh, OK, OK.

1176
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,160
I've just seen

1177
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,400
I saw that there was like this off menu drink.

1178
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,520
I've heard about it a bunch of times.

1179
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,680
I think I've seen like vloggers do it.

1180
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,400
And then when I was looking to like find the vlogs, I couldn't go with you.

1181
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,400
So I was like, well, might as well watch people like, hey, guys.

1182
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,520
Ask me about it.

1183
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,320
And every single vlog I found of the Jurassic Water was like.

1184
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:03,840
Just end of lockdown, still like fully masked talking to the camera.

1185
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,320
And it was just like so triggering.

1186
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,280
I had to turn it off. Yeah.

1187
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,720
It was all period pieces from twenty twenty one.

1188
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,760
When Scott mentioned it, I Googled it and immediately got like a very

1189
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:20,040
posed Pinterest photo and also a tick tock of someone like that.

1190
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,520
You got to go to this bar and Universal Hollywood

1191
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,960
and order the off menu item like.

1192
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,640
Yeah. And I think it was just because like

1193
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:33,080
it's all like spring twenty twenty one because the rides weren't open yet.

1194
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,080
So the only content they could film was an off menu.

1195
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,560
Right. Blue thing. Right. Right.

1196
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,920
Yeah. Did you did you even zoom forward to see them spit it out

1197
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,640
in the toilet or anything?

1198
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,080
I believe they said it was banging or perhaps busing.

1199
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,200
They liked it. OK. All right.

1200
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,240
Are we podcast the ride, the only theme park media that gets negative ever?

1201
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,080
We're in a there's a small percentile of it.

1202
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,520
And yeah, we're in there.

1203
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There are a few because usually there's a scale.

1204
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,040
If a theme park vlogger says like, oh, it's interesting.

1205
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,560
That means they hate it. Yeah.

1206
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,280
That's the last about as is.

1207
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,040
Yeah. Negative as they can get a very solemn layer like.

1208
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,280
Unfortunately, I have to rate this no cap.

1209
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,800
No cap. There was like.

1210
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,400
Mr. Morrow once like had some some Japanese candy or something,

1211
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,600
and he like looked like he wanted to like spit it out.

1212
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,680
And like that's the most negative ever seen.

1213
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,880
Like, I feel like, well, we didn't edit that out.

1214
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,240
Like, I was shocked.

1215
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,360
He's he's pretty good at like not go at like, oh, this is fucking dog.

1216
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,000
You know what? Mr. Morrow, I'll say this.

1217
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,480
He ate the food at the San Diego Convention Center.

1218
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,760
Big mistake. Big mistake.

1219
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,920
Oh, my gosh.

1220
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,160
And again, to be fair to him, this is one of the first big comic cons.

1221
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,760
You never eat the like hot dog at the convention center.

1222
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,680
And he was very negative about it.

1223
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,600
Except Anaheim is full of like decent food.

1224
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,880
Well, that's true. Yes.

1225
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,160
This is not this is if you've ever been to Comic Con,

1226
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,200
the San Diego specifically, but almost any comic con,

1227
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,640
the food they're selling inside the convention center.

1228
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,560
Yeah. No, no good.

1229
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,520
No good.

1230
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,600
I like why even get the food at the convention center,

1231
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,560
because there's always going to be like a weird free like food truck

1232
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,080
giving out like themed.

1233
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:14,800
Sure.

1234
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,920
To like primeval or something.

1235
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,760
Right. Anything NBC's newest show about an earthquake or something.

1236
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,280
Yeah. Quantico nachos.

1237
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,040
You've never heard of the show, but you'll eat the nachos from it.

1238
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:27,880
Yeah.

1239
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,200
I also got packages of beer nuts for the table.

1240
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,400
If anyone wants this unopened beer nuts.

1241
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,600
Wait, those were at the bar.

1242
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,080
At the bar. Yeah, they had beer nuts.

1243
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,120
And then they refilled the rack with Doritos.

1244
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,160
I think Jane said when she went back in.

1245
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,320
So that's a nice bar touch.

1246
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,560
I feel like Irish nachos, as they call them. Yeah.

1247
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,080
Slainte.

1248
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,000
Something else, something happened.

1249
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,720
I feel like, Mike, when you were enjoying it, not well,

1250
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,920
when you were not enjoying your dress, yeah, yeah.

1251
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,800
You were not happy with the taste.

1252
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,360
And then Jane pointed out, well, you need to mix it up.

1253
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,280
It doesn't taste good to you because you have to mix it up.

1254
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,400
Because like it is these disparate elements and you're only getting

1255
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,360
you're getting like too much of some.

1256
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,840
And your reaction, I've seen exactly this before

1257
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,200
with the Mickey's fun wheel, where that is a drink with five layers,

1258
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,760
bright, colorful layers. Yeah.

1259
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,600
And I was with you once where it was suggested that you mix it up

1260
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,680
because it would taste better.

1261
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:37,520
And you give this look that's just this very it's very pensive, vulnerable.

1262
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,440
If you feel you look like you are like lost on your first day of school

1263
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,480
or so, you just kind of like, um, um, like you're you're really unhappy

1264
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,600
about this suggestion. Yeah.

1265
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,320
Being that I mean, what are you is it that you're if you mix it up,

1266
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,880
it's not fun colors anymore. Of course.

1267
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,560
Why would you order a fun color drink? It's mostly visual.

1268
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,960
I love rainbow sprinkles for the same reason.

1269
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,520
If they were mashed up rainbow sprinkles

1270
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,720
and then it just turned into this brown color and it was a brown mash.

1271
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,720
What am I ordering rainbow sprinkles for?

1272
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:11,120
But can't you take it like as a lesson about impermanence?

1273
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,720
Like pretend it's like Tibetan sand art or something or just like,

1274
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,120
this was beautiful and now it's tasty.

1275
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,120
And those are two different experiences.

1276
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,680
And those are both.

1277
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,880
Well, you get and you have you have both.

1278
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,720
You have your moment with one and then the rest of the other.

1279
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,680
You know, I could take it like that once maybe.

1280
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,760
And then I would go revert right back to

1281
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,280
being a little boy and wanting to see all the colors of the rainbow on my food.

1282
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:43,480
You know, begrudgingly mix it up and it turned into a very kind of putrid color.

1283
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,480
Yes. Kind of nasty.

1284
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,160
I will say this did not make the taste any better.

1285
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,120
So I guess the lesson, I didn't learn it because it didn't.

1286
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,800
It didn't. Was it better?

1287
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,880
There was no tasty.

1288
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,800
And I think that's the same thing with Mickey's fun wheel,

1289
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,120
even though they say you should mix it up, because that's what the fun is.

1290
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:02,560
I think it's not when I'm having a, you know, a rocket pop or something,

1291
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:06,960
or I'm having one of my favorite Johnny pops with a rainbow Johnny pop, of course,

1292
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,840
with the Jason Sheridan mascot, Jason Johnny.

1293
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,960
Yeah, Jason Johnny.

1294
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,800
I'm not taking all five of the colors they have and the flavors

1295
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,240
and mixing them up in a bowl and drinking it.

1296
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,600
It's enjoyable to go color by color, flavor by flavor.

1297
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,680
Well, how do you eat M&Ms?

1298
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,600
Oh, well, those are the same flavor.

1299
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,160
So I don't. You're not a sorter.

1300
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,720
No, I take a handful and just joylessly shove them in my mouth.

1301
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,680
Yeah, I know the colors there.

1302
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,680
I don't. You know what?

1303
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,360
That's interesting, because I don't care about the colors of M&Ms.

1304
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,440
I don't. Oh, I do.

1305
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,480
The one that was spent.

1306
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,960
Interesting. It is.

1307
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,840
It is interesting.

1308
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:50,240
I do them one or two at a time, and I was excited to see what colors come out.

1309
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,360
I could care less about M&M colors.

1310
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,200
And that's interesting, isn't it?

1311
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,880
You know, very interesting.

1312
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,480
Highly interesting.

1313
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,640
Highly, highly.

1314
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,720
The difference with the pops, I would say, is that those taste good.

1315
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,080
People are making the this has happened twice.

1316
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,800
People have made these suggestions because your face looks unhappy.

1317
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,920
But now with the fun wheel, the fun wheel, I believe the different flavors

1318
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,960
taste distinctive and good.

1319
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,440
Uh huh.

1320
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,640
Was it that the hostess set or the server said maybe you're supposed to mix it up?

1321
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,200
And then she left and you're like, what was that about?

1322
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,440
That was that loon?

1323
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,160
Yeah, no, I went to the manager and I tried to get her fired.

1324
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,800
Yeah, I think that world view.

1325
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,320
That was the suggestion.

1326
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,880
But yes, I wanted to do it like a popsicle.

1327
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,040
I want to just go flavor by flavor by flavor.

1328
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,440
OK, OK. So that didn't taste bad to you necessarily.

1329
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,680
No, the fun wheel I've had many times and I think it's good.

1330
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,680
I think it tastes good.

1331
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,120
And I think it was fine.

1332
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,400
It was even better.

1333
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,920
I think I tried mixing it at one of the times,

1334
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,120
and I think it was much better than the Jurassic water mixed.

1335
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:58,840
Gotcha.

1336
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,440
I mean, I would buy that the Jurassic water.

1337
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,880
It didn't feel good to me going in.

1338
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,080
I only tried it briefly, just like the from the title to the pictures

1339
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:12,280
to the reality, no steps of this felt like they were going to be good.

1340
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:17,040
Do we know if Jurassic water is new in the last two?

1341
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,400
Do we think it's like two or three years old?

1342
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,880
Maybe. That's where I saw stuff about it.

1343
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,080
Because, yeah, I mean, it seems you were saying there's an old menu.

1344
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,040
Yeah, there's an old menu and it's just on there.

1345
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:33,360
And I also want to know what's the first alcohol to call itself something water?

1346
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,680
Because the first time I've ever heard of this is John Bon Jovi's wine,

1347
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,560
Hampton Water.

1348
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,320
Oh, that's his wine?

1349
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,560
I didn't know that. Yes, yes.

1350
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,640
Oh, I've seen Hampton Water. Wow.

1351
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:47,440
Hampton Water is John Bon Jovi's wine, which I have not tried.

1352
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,040
Well, I only hated it on one level.

1353
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,240
I think I've got two.

1354
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,200
I'm pretty sure I brought up Hampton Water, Scott.

1355
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,320
I think you've not you don't remember that I that I was very excited

1356
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,560
when I learned about his new alcoholic venture.

1357
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,920
I've seen the phrase ranch water a lot more recently.

1358
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,680
Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, I think, has a ranch water case.

1359
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,920
That's new. So I wonder, yeah, what's the first alcoholic

1360
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,320
called itself something water?

1361
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,840
I think vodka is Russian for little water.

1362
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,160
OK, OK. Interesting.

1363
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,120
So that's that's truly the first one.

1364
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,200
I could be wrong with that.

1365
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,600
Also in Hawaiian, alcohol has water in the name.

1366
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,720
It's a kōle hau, which I was told means butt water.

1367
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,880
Like it makes you fall on your ass.

1368
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,520
But a first later actually means like water that you have like on a little still.

1369
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,720
But I still like the idea of fall on your ass water.

1370
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,040
Water. Yeah, that's pretty good.

1371
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:39,800
That's pretty good.

1372
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:44,160
I mean, that feels appropriate for a bar adjacent to all the minions,

1373
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,960
because I feel like Bob and Kevin and company,

1374
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,720
they're often falling on their butts, are often falling down.

1375
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,080
But they're not drinking.

1376
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:56,280
Uh, it would explain a lot if they were just hammered the whole time.

1377
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,840
That's true. Right.

1378
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:02,480
Just take the minions are hammered and they're old, too.

1379
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,040
Ancient, even. Yeah, ancient.

1380
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,080
They're well of age.

1381
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,120
Right. So they're kind of elder gods situation, you know.

1382
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,160
OK, so they're hammered.

1383
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,160
Much like Cthulhu, they were hidden in the Antarctic for centuries.

1384
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,760
Right. Oh, yeah.

1385
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,320
And then an expedition, you know, unleashes it.

1386
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,320
The man does not know what it does.

1387
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,400
The dreaded others, the minions.

1388
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:30,800
When the polar ice caps melt, it's going to reveal all these minions

1389
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,480
that have been trapped for many years.

1390
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,560
Bob waits, you know, gazing upon them, dry drives you to madness.

1391
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:42,800
Just this year, trying to comprehend them at the minion of madness. Yeah.

1392
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,200
That's right. OK. Yes.

1393
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,200
Thank you.

1394
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,240
By the way, Hampton Water is John Bon Jovi and his son.

1395
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,480
This is so this is I said it and I thought it, but I wasn't sure.

1396
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,040
So I didn't say it, but I'm even more excited about it now.

1397
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,880
That's John Bon Jovi's son is involved.

1398
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,600
The one who just got engaged to Millie Bobby Brown or does he have?

1399
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,360
What? Really? I don't know.

1400
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,200
Jesse Bon Jovi.

1401
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:11,080
I didn't look into who Millie Bobby Brown is to be marrying into the Bon Jovi dynasty.

1402
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,160
Yes. Wow. Wow.

1403
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,040
All the little like empires are lining up.

1404
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:20,400
I well, Defector just had a great piece about the Bon Jovi.

1405
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:25,600
John Bon Jovi rest stop in New Jersey, which was filled with fake quotes

1406
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,000
like Ed Harris saying acting is like scoring a touchdown.

1407
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,000
And they even got as far as like asking his representatives that they got him.

1408
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,320
I think they got him to confirm.

1409
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,400
He's like, well, I gave an interview where I compared

1410
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,880
like when I played football in high school and the satisfaction

1411
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,400
of scoring a touchdown with like sometimes acting.

1412
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:53,960
But I have never said the phrase acting is like scoring a touchdown.

1413
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,360
Wow. They just did like a like a little word search

1414
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,280
essentially within a paragraph quote from him.

1415
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,000
Yeah. They found what they needed.

1416
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,120
They're paraphrasing. They were paraphrasing.

1417
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,680
I think there was like either a Plato or an Einstein quote.

1418
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,760
Einstein makes a little more sense because he was at Princeton

1419
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,080
for a long time and was Plato from New Jersey.

1420
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,920
Plato. It's like Plato, Aristotle and the third big philosopher.

1421
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,440
All Jersey. If he's a philosopher, he's from Jersey.

1422
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,720
Jake Bon Jovi.

1423
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,760
I'm so happy I'm learning all of the J Bon Jovi's that I know about.

1424
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,360
What a family tree to explore.

1425
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,280
All right. What have we not?

1426
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,640
Well, I mean, is it time to talk about which ones have you had?

1427
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,960
Oh, yeah. I haven't had any of the fancy drinks.

1428
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,840
But I've just gotten gin and tonics over there because I've been

1429
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,840
like pretending it's a real Irish pub and getting right.

1430
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,200
Right. If I was there.

1431
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,120
Got you. Uh huh.

1432
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,360
Which, yeah, you do not need to order from the specialty cocktail

1433
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,160
menu at this place.

1434
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,040
You can. It is a full service bar.

1435
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,640
I get well, to some extent.

1436
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,320
I don't know that like anything is available there.

1437
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,120
She the bartender made a point to go like, oh, yeah, we have a bunch of

1438
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,120
bottles like not above the bar.

1439
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,080
We have a bunch of different other stuff.

1440
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,720
So just ask. This is a very functional thing for Universal Studios.

1441
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,240
There is a bar you can get anything basically, and that is not like

1442
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,280
just if for some reason you don't want the passion fruit

1443
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,360
dilute new bar drink or whatever. Although that sounds horrible.

1444
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,080
Yeah, it has a Yelp page and it's got like four and a half stars.

1445
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,080
And most of the reviews are good, except a handful of assholes

1446
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,560
giving it one star and complaining about like

1447
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,280
turnaround time and taking so long for drinks.

1448
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,800
And it's like, I don't know, man, you're in a theme park.

1449
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,240
Why are your standards so that's going to come into play in this story, too?

1450
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,320
Oh, OK. Yeah.

1451
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,680
Let me here. I'll head towards it.

1452
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:59,920
I did look I did see a Yelp review was four stars here.

1453
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,200
Let me and it's relevant to what we're talking about.

1454
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,240
The smallest pub in Universal and honestly, one of the least theme

1455
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,000
parky places here.

1456
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,320
Once again, the prices are out the yang.

1457
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,600
I saw out the yang too.

1458
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,760
I didn't know what it meant, so I didn't want to say I like out the yang.

1459
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,280
Yeah. But the drinks are clever and filled with a shit ton of alcohol.

1460
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,560
Basically come here to get hammered.

1461
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:28,320
Nice. So look, it is the theory is being corroborated left and right.

1462
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,240
Yeah, it was it said by this by this reviewer.

1463
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,320
And this takes me up to when I was ordering my drink,

1464
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,600
where I had a few questions for the bartender.

1465
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,080
One was, is this the only place where you can get hard liquor?

1466
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,200
Mike, this was your theory.

1467
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,800
Yeah, there are four at Universal all told.

1468
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,880
And then I had a very important question for her, which was, hey, really quick.

1469
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,640
Do people ever come in here and just get like hammered?

1470
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,360
And she said, oh, yeah, yes, all the time.

1471
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,320
Yeah, no, because we do doubles and yours is a double.

1472
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,920
Yeah, I didn't know, actually.

1473
01:11:58,920 --> 01:11:59,960
Yes, you'll see people.

1474
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:04,200
I didn't know. You'll see people in here getting, you know, pretty crazy.

1475
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,920
So I'm like, well, all right.

1476
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,760
I mean, I guess, you know, I guess I wasn't arguing the thesis of it.

1477
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,040
It was just such a particular way to frame it.

1478
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,440
Yeah, that is correct.

1479
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,520
It is correct. Confirmed by employee.

1480
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,360
Jason was saying mom and dad in the morning getting hammered.

1481
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,400
Yeah. So it's what? Yeah.

1482
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,960
Confirmed by the bartenders. Yeah.

1483
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,400
Whole family, whole family has expressed passes, but mommy and daddy.

1484
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,760
Well, they've got another ticket to paradise, you know.

1485
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,600
I had a point, but it doesn't matter.

1486
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,040
I couldn't beat that.

1487
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,280
Doesn't matter.

1488
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:47,640
OK, so then the real experience to to talk about,

1489
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,200
I am I am asking these questions of the bartender.

1490
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:54,080
And then all of a sudden I feel a presence next to me.

1491
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,000
I feel like brushing shoulders with me, basically.

1492
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,400
And I hear hi.

1493
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:03,040
And I turn and I see this woman.

1494
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,840
She is on the older side of things.

1495
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,640
I would suggest, you know, a good degree older than me, I would say.

1496
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,640
She is wearing a black tracksuit

1497
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:20,120
and she has the workiest lip I've seen in person, maybe ever.

1498
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:25,600
And I say hi back and she says, what are you buying me?

1499
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,880
And I go, ha, hey, oh, hi.

1500
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,160
Well, we're going to have to sort that out, I guess.

1501
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:37,080
And she says, hey, listen, I cut in line with you, so I'll buy you a drink.

1502
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,160
My oh, wait a minute.

1503
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,800
This is a pretty good deal here.

1504
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,040
I'm being a little judgy of this person, but now I'm the victor.

1505
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,360
I get a free drink out of breaking these rules.

1506
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,400
I feel you have a question already.

1507
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,640
No, you're just taking it in.

1508
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,000
Just this, by the way.

1509
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,920
I was so tired yesterday, just in general.

1510
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,560
And I just like I couldn't believe this was happening immediately

1511
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,800
because this is an in and out place.

1512
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,760
This is not really it's not a hive of activity inside.

1513
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,720
So the idea that this is happening

1514
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,680
on our expedition to do an episode blew my mind.

1515
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,760
I was just like beside myself.

1516
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,680
The presence of an authentic barfly in the hallway bar.

1517
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,960
Unbelievable. Yeah.

1518
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,400
Just like a like boozy widow energy.

1519
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,080
Yeah, that's kind of it. Yeah.

1520
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,480
Well, and like and definitely

1521
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,080
rich for some reason that is probably not fueled by her.

1522
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,840
Just a guess.

1523
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,760
Felt a little like a real housewifey.

1524
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,480
I don't know.

1525
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,680
Boozy widow who they have not ruled out as a suspect.

1526
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,920
She can't leave the state right now.

1527
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,840
She can't leave the stuff.

1528
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:55,360
We're not accusing you of anything, but we'd prefer you stay in town.

1529
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,120
Drinking, drinking a lot of universal to forget the memory

1530
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,640
of when she killed someone, meaning her husband.

1531
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:06,680
The energy when I eventually got in there reminded me of The Simpsons,

1532
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:10,720
where Kathleen Turner is the creator of Malibu, Stacey.

1533
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,320
And at one point, Lisa's like, let's do it now.

1534
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,360
And and they cut to Kathleen Turner's character and she's like,

1535
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,520
oh, she's like swaying about to fall over.

1536
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,440
A little loss. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

1537
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:30,120
This is this is all accurate, but I'm very excited to have met a new friend

1538
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,080
and we could have cut off this interaction here.

1539
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,040
She buys me to drink with the what a pro.

1540
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,720
Oh, my God. I have a benefactor now.

1541
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,360
I'm delighted and a character, a character has just.

1542
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,200
Hello, I'm here to be content for your show.

1543
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,920
Yes, that is what it felt like.

1544
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,960
But I don't I don't want to be done with this.

1545
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:53,880
So she gets her like really healthy pour of red wine and a little plastic cup.

1546
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:59,240
Oh, boy. Great. And and I get my old fashioned.

1547
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,200
And then I'm like, well, I got to go. I got to fall.

1548
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,600
I got to chat it up a little bit, see what brought her to this point.

1549
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,840
And so we go off to the core. She's like, hold up in the corner.

1550
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,480
She got one of the five chairs with a friend of hers.

1551
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,000
And I go up to start start talking.

1552
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
But then we're interrupted by the bartender saying,

1553
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,080
did somebody leave a vape pen?

1554
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,560
Which pays off in a matter of moments.

1555
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,960
And you can. Yes, I'll let you guess if that was me or her.

1556
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,600
But I start asking, so what's what's going on as your as your day at Universal going

1557
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,280
miserable?

1558
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,040
Oh, wait, how could that be?

1559
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,440
You're at the entertainment capital of L.A.

1560
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,760
You should be a great.

1561
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,960
I'm here. I'm here with four 13 year olds.

1562
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,720
So you guess how it's going.

1563
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,160
Bitter sip. Oh, geez.

1564
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,600
Well, hey, where are they now?

1565
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,000
I don't know. And I don't want to know.

1566
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,360
Then, you know, I'm taking pictures of things on the wall to talk about

1567
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,160
for this episode.

1568
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,760
So I kind of lean past her and I take a picture as some sign that was nothing.

1569
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,360
It was not content at the end of the day, except that then she said,

1570
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,600
are you taking a picture of me?

1571
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,760
Because you're taking a picture of me.

1572
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,720
You have to fucking delete it.

1573
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,480
You have to do it in front of me right now.

1574
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,320
No, no, not a no.

1575
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,440
You're good. No, I would ask permission.

1576
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,920
Don't worry about it.

1577
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,120
You know what, though, we and around this time, Mike is

1578
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,320
finishing getting his delicious, drastic water.

1579
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,680
And I say, well, you actually will you take a picture of my friend and I?

1580
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,280
And and I hand out my phone and she takes it.

1581
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,400
And then just eyelids drop

1582
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,600
like what goes on a window of shades.

1583
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,840
There you go. Shades. Yeah.

1584
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:47,400
So I can place that word shades.

1585
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,720
She just like totally droops and then she stares at me.

1586
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,320
I get you a drink and then you ask a favor of me.

1587
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,800
I'm I'm keeping this and she pockets.

1588
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,840
My phone goes into the tracksuit pocket.

1589
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,000
And I go, well, what's the way out of this?

1590
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,680
And she says, do you have any money?

1591
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,040
I check my wallet.

1592
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:14,840
I have one one hundred dollar bill, which I am not intending to give to this person,

1593
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,480
whether she got me a drink or not.

1594
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,880
And I was like, I can.

1595
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,040
Well, maybe somebody does.

1596
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,560
You give me a dollar and I'll give you I'll take your picture

1597
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,000
and I'll give you your phone back.

1598
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,760
Mike, you got a dollar, please.

1599
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,400
I hope you have a dollar. I didn't.

1600
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,600
Oh, and Mike does not.

1601
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,760
OK, so now we have to reach out to Jason and Jane, who I wonder.

1602
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,160
I wonder if you're even catching what is going on.

1603
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,480
No, I didn't know.

1604
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:42,360
I thought, oh, maybe someone's doing a trick inside or showing like a fun bar.

1605
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:46,440
Another like I feel like Irish bar like go to.

1606
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,480
Right. People like to do that magic.

1607
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,720
Yeah, like, you're always going to see screen here.

1608
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:58,000
Screaming babies you can't see and see magicians or quarters or like some sort of thing.

1609
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,920
No, no, this is now this is bail money.

1610
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,120
We're trying to bust my phone out of tracksuit jail.

1611
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,440
What did you say when you went?

1612
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,840
How did you explain the situation?

1613
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,120
You just said you have a dollar.

1614
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,480
I thought maybe you just a dollar.

1615
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,640
Wanted to give more of a tip and didn't.

1616
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,120
And then I said something something funny is going on that I don't even know fully

1617
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,440
what it is, but you need to get up and go over with me.

1618
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,760
Oh, yes, because I want to Jason in the picture.

1619
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,200
Right. Right. So yeah, definitely.

1620
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,080
But you need to be part.

1621
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,160
I think I said something like you need to be part of this.

1622
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1623
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,840
So I was I was glad you went over for multiple reasons.

1624
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,640
When you when you had the dollar, when I saw it coming through the window,

1625
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,840
thank God, I really thought this could be that I might not get this phone back.

1626
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,840
It was the angry.

1627
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,280
I mean, I there's no other way in my mind to interpret it.

1628
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:50,800
It was the angriest flirting I've ever seen, essentially, because like there was a

1629
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,880
flirty air. Yes.

1630
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,720
Teenager like I got your phone and I'm not getting it back unless you could.

1631
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,000
This is money.

1632
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,840
I assume you need a dollar.

1633
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:02,600
So this is a this is a 13 year old drumming off on her.

1634
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,240
That's yes, they.

1635
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,840
I hope not.

1636
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:10,240
That is figuratively, figuratively.

1637
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,680
That is the best way to deal with four 13 year olds.

1638
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:19,640
I feel like at Universal Hollywood, you unleash them and you just post up somewhere.

1639
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,120
Oh, man. Jason. Back in a few hours.

1640
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,800
Jason got along with this lady like I tell me about those 13 year old lady.

1641
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,280
Boy, how they on unload your

1642
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,480
same tracks, both wearing the same tracksuits.

1643
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,680
I'm here to listen.

1644
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,600
But then when you're done talking, I'm here to do some close up magic.

1645
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,600
So thank God the dollar arrives.

1646
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,120
And Jason, here is your dollar.

1647
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,080
Thank you. Thank you for sorry.

1648
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,880
I'll make you get it off the ground later.

1649
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,760
I just want to make sure it went in your direction.

1650
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:54,240
And which because in during this hostage time,

1651
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,200
she goes outside and starts vaping aggressively.

1652
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:02,120
The longest pole I have ever seen in in like kind of an indoor

1653
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:06,400
like kind of leaning out the door, but also there's construction walls.

1654
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,160
So it's like very narrow space.

1655
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,640
Yes, not a relaxing plate.

1656
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,000
No, no, no. She's there to do business.

1657
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,720
Are you even technically allowed to vape on park property?

1658
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,120
I'm not sure. Is there?

1659
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,240
Yeah. Are there vaping areas, smoking areas?

1660
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,040
I think. Yeah, I think.

1661
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,520
Well, because they were they were announcing that in Universal in Florida,

1662
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,440
the two universal parks were down to one smoking area each,

1663
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:33,000
which was news to me that you could still smoke inside of those parks.

1664
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,280
So there must be.

1665
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:37,760
So they're probably doing it in an unauthorized area.

1666
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1667
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,480
I think the official vape area might have been the one foot space

1668
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:47,320
between the the Irish bar and the construction zone.

1669
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:47,840
It's possible.

1670
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,720
She obviously operates by her own code.

1671
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:53,760
So whatever universal's law are doesn't matter to her.

1672
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,760
And you know, and you know what?

1673
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,000
I admire it and I salute her for it.

1674
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,240
I had a great time in her presence.

1675
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,320
I celebrate her.

1676
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,080
So, yes.

1677
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,600
So Scott, right before he's because he gets the he's this starts happening

1678
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,160
at the bar, he turns to me at a certain point early on and he goes, get a photo,

1679
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,360
get a picture of us.

1680
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:16,120
And I'm like trying to take like a covert little picture of this happening.

1681
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,600
And the guy behind me couldn't have been more of like

1682
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,680
stereotypical theme park dad trying to get a beer desperately.

1683
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,040
Mad about the line.

1684
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,200
That's the loud guy.

1685
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,160
That's the loud guy.

1686
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,400
And he was usually in pretty good spirits, but you can turn real quick.

1687
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,600
But those guys I'm trying to do this, but I'm also not trying to like

1688
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,200
frame it up here.

1689
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,680
So people go, this guy's just taking pictures like it looks creepy or looks weird.

1690
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,040
So I'm kind of trying to do like almost like a covert one.

1691
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,520
I don't really know.

1692
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,080
This guy's like peering over my shoulder a lot

1693
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,360
because he wants to figure out what's going on, not because he gives a shit

1694
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,480
about what I'm doing, but to me, it feels very intrusive.

1695
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,560
So it's making me feel very self-conscious about taking a photo.

1696
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,880
So I'm lining it up and I take two bad ones and I'm lining up the third one.

1697
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,000
And there were two bartenders.

1698
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,480
So the second bartender also became free.

1699
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,520
The guy smacks me on the back and goes, hey, bud, you're up.

1700
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,960
Yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

1701
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:16,400
So I don't like the like, I'm in the middle of taking a photo.

1702
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,360
He hits me on the back.

1703
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:21,000
I go, well, whatever. So I went to go, hey, do your fucking job.

1704
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,720
What are those tree trunks? Are they legs?

1705
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,800
Start walking.

1706
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,320
But, you know, he physically made contact with me to get me to move

1707
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,920
because he was so impatient about getting a beer or whatever.

1708
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,680
Either guy really wants to belly up to the bar

1709
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:38,800
or like you're too aggressive little league coach, like, hey, you're up.

1710
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,880
Come on. Well, I know this guy for sure coached little league.

1711
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,920
This guy got into this guy had the energy of like getting into a fight

1712
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,960
with another kid's dad.

1713
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,120
This guy made it to eyewitness news.

1714
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,040
The the middle of the hour. Yeah.

1715
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,480
Yeah. So I did not. I didn't get a great photo.

1716
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,480
I have a photo of you, too.

1717
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,640
You just you can't see exactly what's happening.

1718
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:00,920
Geez. Well, and I you know, all right, this guy's violent with you, my friend.

1719
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,440
And then he's trying to judge a nice connection that two adults are having.

1720
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,760
What do you mean trying to figure out what's happening here?

1721
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:11,800
Two adults are having a moment at the Irish bar where you can get hammered.

1722
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,840
Yeah. And my friend is trying to preserve this moment. Right.

1723
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,360
Forever. Yeah. Yeah.

1724
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,640
That's all that's happening.

1725
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:22,960
So the the dollar shows up, thus enabling the photograph.

1726
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,360
Jason is in this photograph, not knowing the story or why this aggressive woman

1727
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,960
is taking pictures. I came up.

1728
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,480
Yeah. And enjoying the photo.

1729
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,560
Jane also has some photos.

1730
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,560
Oh, she sent me. I am.

1731
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,880
And she adds some of them are live photos.

1732
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,480
So you can just see me smiling and going, huh?

1733
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,400
I was going, I don't know.

1734
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,560
Is that Scott's food coming out of that pocket?

1735
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,120
I feel like I've seen that phone before.

1736
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,600
Yeah. Wait a minute. Why is Scott's phone in a truck?

1737
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,520
There's a version of that, though, that didn't end there

1738
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:58,000
in the sense that I was like, I'm not sure this lady's giving the phone away

1739
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,280
for a dollar.

1740
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,720
We are released very quickly.

1741
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,600
Like it didn't it was not overstaying our welcome kind of thing.

1742
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,840
No, she took she took the photo.

1743
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,480
You know how sometimes you have somebody you hand somebody your phone

1744
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,240
and we take a quick picture and they go here.

1745
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,280
I took a few. Not this person.

1746
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,240
Nope. That was that is a one and done.

1747
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,360
The photo is bad.

1748
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,640
I hope I will post it and you'll see a bad photo of us.

1749
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,840
The cost of dollar in true theme park fashion.

1750
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,560
The only way to make it more theme park is that it cost nine dollars. Yeah.

1751
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,520
And and we were released.

1752
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,240
Oh, but on the way to that, it was like, OK, so we're ready.

1753
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,920
And I can get my you take that picture and get my phone back.

1754
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:40,600
And she's and then she's pulling it out of her pocket and going like, whoops.

1755
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,080
I can't seem to get it out.

1756
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,680
That's what I'm saying. There's like an angry flirting happening.

1757
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:51,240
Can't seem to pull it like and I like, I think you're a bad actress, ma'am.

1758
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:55,200
No offense. Yeah, that's like you have to do it energy.

1759
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,640
She's like, touch me in pant area. Oh, no.

1760
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,760
Was that the idea? Yeah, I was supposed to get it out.

1761
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,520
I feel like I feel so naive that you knew this the next day,

1762
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,880
but then I couldn't realize it in the moment.

1763
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:13,200
Well, anyway, I mean, long, long story short,

1764
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,520
we did it. We had sex.

1765
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,400
We went back to the Sheridan.

1766
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:22,560
We got the the Telly Savalas room at the Sheridan and yeah,

1767
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:28,200
where we're recording the sweet and, you know, they did things get sloppy.

1768
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:30,040
I'm not going to go there.

1769
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,400
That part's not not for content.

1770
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:34,680
And that's where this episode is being put on tape right now.

1771
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:38,720
Israel, the real his authentic 70s real machine.

1772
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,040
Wait a minute.

1773
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,160
Telly left his he left his old camera.

1774
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,400
Yeah, I know as many.

1775
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,600
It was in his will. Yeah.

1776
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,240
He left his old camera is real, real machine and his many rings and gold chains

1777
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,360
that he has always photographed and lollipops.

1778
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,920
If anybody's getting sloppy,

1779
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,560
sloppy, tellies, what Jane and I discovered, by the way,

1780
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:07,800
because if you call a lift Universal Studios Hollywood, it's yes.

1781
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,840
Do you want to be dropped off at the gate at the back lot

1782
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:18,720
at the end of City Walk by like Bucca and then or in the Frankenstein garage

1783
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:23,320
where they have established the Frankenstein Ride app lounge.

1784
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,640
These are four benches,

1785
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:30,760
four benches next to some pillars where they have put up a lot of

1786
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:33,080
there's a lot of giant Frankenstein

1787
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,040
photos from the movie and also this this little

1788
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,440
cartoon Frankenstein who did some shopping.

1789
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,520
Oh, yeah, cool. I like that.

1790
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:49,560
That's good. Yeah, no, we well, we look we stopped there for a second, too.

1791
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,600
We did it under the bench.

1792
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,400
We couldn't make it all the way to the to the Jarratton to,

1793
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:56,920
you know, the passion was your six is when the podcast

1794
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,600
or guys started talking about their affairs.

1795
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,640
They were having women at theme parks.

1796
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:05,360
Well, this is yeah. Look, Erin, sorry, this is how you're finding out.

1797
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:10,400
But, you know, you understand, you know, that my hall pass is

1798
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:14,560
any aggressively drunk woman in a black tracksuit.

1799
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,240
Yeah. So you were just you were just hoping it wouldn't come to pass.

1800
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,320
It's in your story. We made a deal. It's in your pre no.

1801
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,480
What lip fillers you were saying? Yeah.

1802
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:27,720
Yeah. With a with a very truly gigantic lip.

1803
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,080
Yeah. Mm hmm.

1804
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1805
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,440
So look, you meet some characters.

1806
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:37,800
Yeah. At this place, it's a real it's an old fashioned watering hole.

1807
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,720
You meet some people who are a little different from you.

1808
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,400
But you make sure you have a good time.

1809
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,160
I think you have a story like this.

1810
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:47,320
Is there a version of this where you met a universal character?

1811
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,760
I don't have that, but I did have one more clip.

1812
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,040
Oh, yeah. Text to you.

1813
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,480
Yes, sure. Mm hmm.

1814
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:00,560
That we.

1815
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,360
We talked about how this is like a place where

1816
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,880
they made it look like a back lot, but it's not a back lot.

1817
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,600
And those people don't film there.

1818
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,920
There is one thing. Yeah. Yeah.

1819
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:15,960
That films at that went past mulligans.

1820
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,800
What? While they were shooting. Really?

1821
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,320
Oh, OK. Oh, my God. OK.

1822
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:24,560
The we Britain part of Arrested Development is the Baker Street.

1823
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,320
Oh, right. I remember that. Yeah. Yeah.

1824
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,840
And they go there's a shot that goes right by Mulligan's.

1825
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,120
Oh, geez. OK, OK.

1826
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,440
Here we go.

1827
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,840
Um, is it early on?

1828
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,960
Think it just like the first thing that happens.

1829
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,640
Wait, I'm going to missed it there.

1830
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,840
Yeah, it's at the very beginning.

1831
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,640
The steering just goes past Mulligan's. Wow.

1832
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:53,000
That's more like grab a screenshot for later.

1833
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,440
But yeah, yeah. Oh, great. Great. Oh, there it is.

1834
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,240
You know what?

1835
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:01,960
It was so like blended into the environment perfectly that I didn't even think.

1836
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:05,600
And it says Mulligan's on it even. Wow. Look at that.

1837
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:10,880
That's some risky logistics trying to get the stair car.

1838
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,520
It's kind of narrow the pathways and streets up there.

1839
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,640
And obviously, like they go in the scene, they go to a pub,

1840
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:20,440
but it's obviously not Mulligan's because you couldn't fit like one camera

1841
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:23,200
inside there, let alone like lighting and stuff.

1842
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,520
Wow. So it's famous.

1843
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,200
It's preserved as famous as the 50s, would you say?

1844
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:32,560
Well, no. OK, sorry. No, no, no, no, no.

1845
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,960
Come on. Nothing's more famous than the 50s.

1846
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,120
Jukeboxes. Come on.

1847
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,480
Sock up. Iconic.

1848
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,400
Both iconic.

1849
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,560
Well, I mean, if we're winding down here, the closing thoughts.

1850
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:51,800
Look, I mean, I'm really glad that we got to meditate on this for a while

1851
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,880
and go up there and have a good old time.

1852
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,560
I think we needed it. I think we needed to.

1853
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,680
You know, he needed his medicine.

1854
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,680
Daddy needed it. The two daddies.

1855
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:04,520
And then the other daddy.

1856
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,160
And the little wooden boy. Yeah.

1857
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,120
Little other little wooden daddy. Little wooden daddy.

1858
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:14,360
Needed his medicine. No, it was it was the energy was pretty fun up there.

1859
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:19,600
I do want to revisit it, like head up there at like 11 a.m. on a Tuesday.

1860
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,680
Why is the crowd so low?

1861
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,120
It's for work. Sunday.

1862
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:27,760
No, I mean, I want to see what the chill.

1863
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,920
See what the chill like hours.

1864
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,800
Yeah. Well, as I said, the part two of this episode coming soon.

1865
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,440
So we need to.

1866
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:37,200
Is this your way? And then part three and four and five.

1867
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:42,000
But what we're saying is we are going to go drink aggressively at 11 a.m.

1868
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,600
at the Irish bar.

1869
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,960
We're going to shed this gram.

1870
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,560
Image of podcast. Yeah, that's right.

1871
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:51,080
I think drinking a fair haven, guys.

1872
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:55,120
We've already got an outline mapped out.

1873
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:58,960
You take a vodka drink, you take a whiskey drink, you take a cider drink,

1874
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,280
you take a lager drink.

1875
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,200
Yeah. And then you sing to songs that remind you of the good times.

1876
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,360
And then you sing songs that remind you of the better times.

1877
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,760
Absolutely. Yeah.

1878
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,320
Well, oh, track suit.

1879
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:12,400
Yeah. Let's go.

1880
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:15,160
13 year old.

1881
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,480
And my.

1882
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,200
Ironically, they are at one of the bars down, down like.

1883
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,480
They are at one of the bars.

1884
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,720
He's gone.

1885
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:31,200
Their allowance only that goes a lot farther on Ventura Boulevard.

1886
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,200
Well, I think we're there.

1887
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,880
But these guys, you survived podcast, the ride.

1888
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,440
What a blast. Thank you for joining us.

1889
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,800
Sorry you couldn't make it last night, too.

1890
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,880
We got we should find a time we should we got to go.

1891
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,480
Let's say let's let's get it doesn't have to be over.

1892
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,920
Let's go get let's go get hammered.

1893
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,200
Get hammered. Yeah. Yeah.

1894
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,280
Let's exit through the gift shop.

1895
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,680
Anything you'd like to plug?

1896
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,680
Yeah, I've got some stories for Vulture coming up soon that I'm excited about

1897
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,000
that I feel like the PTR second gate audience will like.

1898
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,720
I'm going to be doing a list, a ranked list of the DILFs of DECOM,

1899
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,160
the channel original movie.

1900
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,720
Oh, OK. All right.

1901
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,920
Oh, my God. Wait, can you get I don't want to give away any rankings,

1902
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,720
but can you give away an example of who you made the list?

1903
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,680
Oh, yeah. Patrick Fabian is the dad in like five movies.

1904
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,960
That's Howard on Better Call Saul. Oh, right. Yeah.

1905
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,240
Who was also he was on.

1906
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,400
He was like a hunky professor on Saved by the Bell, the college years.

1907
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,120
He was who dated a student, which is gross now.

1908
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,200
Oh, that's right. He dated Kelly.

1909
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,440
Was it not gross on the show?

1910
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:39,040
No, it was like it was like Zach was weird for being jealous.

1911
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,880
So it's like, oh, really? Wow.

1912
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:45,000
OK. Perfectly natural.

1913
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,400
Well, hey, I'm glad they fit it in before before it became gross.

1914
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,200
And of course, I'm going to put on their congressman

1915
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:55,600
Dellums from The Color of Friendship, a perfect movie about

1916
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,040
that taught me what the South African apartheid was when I was a kid.

1917
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,880
Whoa. OK.

1918
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,680
Is Mickey Rooney in Phantom of the Megaplex too old?

1919
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:07,440
Does he not make the running? Not an actual parent.

1920
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:10,080
That's true. We don't know much about his home life.

1921
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:13,560
Yeah, it's not father figure. I'd like to fuck it is dead.

1922
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,960
Got it. Got it. Stepdads are in play.

1923
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:20,080
Is the dad from Fuzzbucket in the mix?

1924
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,320
I'm trying to remember who that was.

1925
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:24,520
It doesn't count because it was a that was a magical world.

1926
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:25,480
Yes. Disney.

1927
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,200
That's not a channel.

1928
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,400
Original. I got it. I got it. I'm sorry.

1929
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,960
Or else Vulture will kill me.

1930
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,120
Oh, gosh. Yeah.

1931
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,400
I'm going to edit that part out just so I don't look stupid.

1932
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:41,200
Do any of the in analyzing the activities of the the Dilfs in any of the movies?

1933
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,920
Do any of the Dilfees need their medicine?

1934
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,320
Oh, a lot of the Dilfs need their medicine for sure.

1935
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:51,280
And that medicine is learning that their son can do something

1936
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,600
that's not hyper masculine. All of them. It's like.

1937
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,560
They can cook, they can dance, they can do things that aren't just football.

1938
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,760
A lot of the Dilfs are also the coach of the team that the guy

1939
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,800
teen is like ambivalent about being on.

1940
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,720
Dilfs and Kilfs.

1941
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,240
All in one.

1942
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:14,200
And then the other story that I was writing when I sent

1943
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:17,400
when I called my shot on the called shot. Yes.

1944
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:22,960
Is I went to every Lisa Vanderpump bar

1945
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:27,120
in L.A. just to see how they're doing post scandal.

1946
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,600
And business is fucking booming, my boys.

1947
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,520
Wow. Crazy in there.

1948
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,840
Uh huh. How many are there?

1949
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,760
There's three in WeHo.

1950
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,240
There's like a triangle. Really?

1951
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,440
And then there's Schwartz and Sandys, which is by UCB.

1952
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,080
It's like by birds. Oh, yes.

1953
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,040
On Franklin.

1954
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,400
No, it's the old deli around the corner.

1955
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:50,680
Yeah, that was the Cantina and the Cantina moves.

1956
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:52,800
Right, right, right. Wow. I haven't been over there.

1957
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,880
Which one's the best?

1958
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,760
Schwartz and Sandys has really good cocktails.

1959
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,760
They had a Thai tea Manhattan, which sounds kind of similar to the Guinness one.

1960
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,320
But it was like very subtle and cute.

1961
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,680
Oh, interesting. Wow.

1962
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,920
But they're it's more like a theme park than a restaurant.

1963
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:10,880
All of them.

1964
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,360
That's the energy people call it, like not gay Disneyland,

1965
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,080
because Disneyland's already gay Disneyland.

1966
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,480
But you get it. OK. Interesting.

1967
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:22,920
This seems like possibly a place where I can meet my black track

1968
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,960
suited friend again. Right.

1969
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,400
Doesn't it? For a private assignation.

1970
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:30,520
Yeah, because as as we discussed or not, we've discussed,

1971
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,120
but I've discussed frequently.

1972
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,480
Yeah, Vanne Pemper Rolls is all about people cheating.

1973
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,360
That's the whole point of the show.

1974
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:39,360
So that's where you should go to have an affair. Great. Great.

1975
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:43,160
Well, finally, step one, I need a track suit.

1976
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:46,240
You need a track suit and then you got a Google map.

1977
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:49,560
The best way to sir and pump and, you know,

1978
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,840
Schwartz and Sandy.

1979
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,280
No, I don't know.

1980
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,680
I've been outside them.

1981
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,760
No, I haven't dined in them.

1982
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,400
I know people who have. What's the last one? Tom Tom.

1983
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,920
Tom Tom. Can't believe Tom Tom.

1984
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:05,240
So you're saying this is theme park enough to warrant an episode, maybe.

1985
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,160
OK. Well, all right. All right.

1986
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,960
Well, folks, sound like it sounds like we're not getting.

1987
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,120
Call. Yeah.

1988
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,560
You're giving me you.

1989
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,800
I've been doing them all. You need to give me one for the end, Mike.

1990
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,080
Completely devoid of a sentence.

1991
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:22,240
I don't know. Whatever.

1992
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,440
Whatever context you want to put it like a podcast.

1993
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:27,360
The Ride Boys are going to do a couple more episodes about getting

1994
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,000
hammered.

1995
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,360
Yeah. And also affairs.
