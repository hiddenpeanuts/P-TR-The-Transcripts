1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,280
Warning, the following podcasts may contain 80s health food, blood and space, extremely

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,960
important science lessons, and the return of an old friend named Topsy.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,000
It's Body Wars on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three vaccinated men in their

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,360
thirties.

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,440
We can officially say I'm Scott Gardner, joined in person by Jason Sheridan.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,120
Yes, that's right.

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
Yes indeed.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
I am Scott Carlson.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,280
Unless somebody was lying, then I think we're all set.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,120
That would be messed up if we were lying.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Why is it?

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
Why?

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,920
I guess I just want to give somebody COVID and a two hour podcast is the most clear-cut

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
way.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,320
That would be really odd, especially if I was going to give someone.

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,440
Man, what a nefarious plot.

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,120
You would really have to rethink who I was or Jason was if that was actually what we're

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
doing.

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
I think so.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
There's trust here.

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,280
I trust both of you not to give me a virus on purpose.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,280
I will say that.

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Accidents, who knows.

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Accidents, who knows.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,280
But yeah, I do trust you to do that.

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,000
Not just COVID either, any.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm not like there's no virus on a list that I would like to give any of you.

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,000
Like yeah, I mean if there's like ever like an Islands of Adventure flu or something that

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,760
happens and Jason catches it, like he would only give it to me accidentally.

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,880
I don't think he would do it on purpose.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,960
He certainly gets Islands of Adventure fever every time he goes down to Islands of Adventure.

36
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,640
I'm so excited to live the adventure.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,960
Just hearing me say it, I think if I had a thermometer, like an old school.

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,200
And it's shocking to me you don't have the gun, the thermometer gun that everyone's been

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,680
pointing at our foreheads for 14 months.

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,080
I just saw an ad for one.

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Lindsay actually has one.

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,840
I wonder if I should just have it with me at all times to take a stranger's temperatures

43
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
just for fun.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,440
Like at a restaurant or somewhere and you do it, like you walk into a bar or like a

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,080
bank and scan the person as opposed to them scanning you.

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,160
Yeah, although at a bank maybe they would think I was robbing it with the temperature

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
gun.

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,760
Oh yeah, yeah, probably best to not have anything resembling a gun.

49
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,200
I slip a note to the teller.

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,840
I have a temperature gun in my bag and I'm going to take your temperature.

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,520
I'm not afraid to use it because I'm very afraid of getting COVID.

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
I am not.

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm not robbing you.

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,560
I'm just going to quietly take your temperature.

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,200
I just want to know everyone in here has a normal around 98.6 temperature vaccinated.

56
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
We are.

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
We did it.

58
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Yeah.

59
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,840
And not only that, but it's we're past the well, let's invoke the phrase that was invented

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,400
on the second gate, which is after second shot or ass.

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,760
We are two weeks asked.

62
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Yes.

63
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,120
So now we can we can do this.

64
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,880
We're back in person.

65
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Back in the yard.

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Still yard.

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,400
Yeah, I was going to say we're stepping it back.

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
It's a phased reopening.

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Yeah.

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,440
To use theme park parlance.

71
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,960
Did you guys see on our Reddit someone did what we asked and got the vaccine while wearing

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,600
a pot tannic shirt?

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Oh, wait, I was tagged in something.

74
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Or was that all on Reddit?

75
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Wow.

77
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Wow.

78
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,960
Ribbit King 17 here is getting his vaccine with the pot tannic shirt on.

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Damn.

80
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
And very funny.

81
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,200
If you don't know what we're talking about, one of our original characters is a version

82
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,040
of E.T.'s teacher from the Green Planet, who appears on the E.T. Riot Universal.

83
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,840
But Tanikis is his the real character's name.

84
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,400
And our version is called Pot Tannic Kush because he loves getting high.

85
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
He's a real...

86
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,680
Like a shady bootleg Bart version.

87
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,640
And wow, I don't remember why we asked for it.

88
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,080
I barely remember that we asked for it.

89
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,040
But he remembered.

90
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
That's the important thing.

91
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Yeah, yeah, he did it.

92
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
He followed the assignment.

93
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
And I hope it was great.

94
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,600
I hope it made the experience better for him in some intangible way.

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,040
Yeah, I don't know where this gentleman lives.

96
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,120
If it was at Magic Mountain, I think he would have probably pointed it out because that

97
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,320
would have been the ultimate Magic Mountain and the Pot Tannic Kush shirt.

98
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Yeah.

99
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Yeah, right.

100
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Hey, this, you know, it's a sad time as much as it's great that things are reopening.

101
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,520
It is sad that all of the theme park parking lot vaccination sites are closing.

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Yes.

103
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,000
We didn't get to experience, I'd say any of them.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Yeah, I just ended up, you know, doing it as like a medical facility.

105
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
A place.

106
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Yeah, sorry.

107
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,440
We all we bombed on the content front.

108
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,960
We didn't do it at silly places typically.

109
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,800
Yeah, it seemed important to do.

110
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,000
So maybe just do it at the place you can get one.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,960
Also, I'm not sure it was it.

112
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,400
It just would have been like, there's a roller coaster in my rear view and my arm hurts a

113
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
little.

114
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,720
Yeah, it wasn't like on the lift hill.

115
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,320
There was like a Valencia teen with syringe and he jabbed you and the way and then on

116
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,600
the way down, you'd be like, I'm vaccinated.

117
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,680
And you have to wait 15 minutes.

118
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,000
So they just keep running a ride.

119
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Yeah, going on.

120
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,320
Yeah, Viper over and over.

121
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,040
I had the very L.A. experience of like after I got in the 15 minute waiting room, they're

122
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,400
like, would you like a Voss water?

123
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,280
And they were giving out giant canisters, the big tubes of Voss water.

124
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,760
And I was like, L.A., baby.

125
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,160
Nothing like it.

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeah.

127
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,320
Did you pocket some for home for later?

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:08,880
I drank it and it did not help me getting fucking hosed by the side of it.

129
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,800
Just getting fucking wrecked by the second shot.

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Yeah.

131
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,840
This lined up pretty much as you would expect within the podcast, The Ride World, that I

132
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
don't really know.

133
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,520
Mike, seems like you were pretty OK.

134
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
I was pretty OK.

135
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
Jason knocked on his ass.

136
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,880
I didn't feel great after the first one, but it was by the next morning.

137
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
It was fine.

138
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:37,680
But the second one, it was like, well, but still preferable to the virus.

139
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
I'd say so.

140
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Yeah.

141
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Don't use that as an excuse.

142
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Go get vaccinated.

143
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,000
The first one was fine.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I didn't feel anything.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,880
The second shot, I will say, like I was in, I was like very tired for the first half of

146
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
the day after I got it.

147
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,080
And then like at night, I was still tired, but I played video games.

148
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Like it was fine.

149
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,120
I could have done something if I had to, but you know.

150
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
I felt fine.

151
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,480
I kept turning all kinds of different shades and colors and stripes, like a Heffa-Lumps

152
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
and Woozles montage.

153
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
I was going to say, like a Heffa-Lumps and Woozles.

154
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

155
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,680
It was sort of akin to that.

156
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:18,600
I'd look in the mirror one second and I have bright red spots and then big yellow stripes

157
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,360
and then just like half black, half white right down the middle.

158
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,880
But besides that, I mean that was, and that's cool.

159
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
That's fun, yeah.

160
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
It was trippy.

161
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
That's good.

162
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Yeah.

163
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,080
So Jason was incapacitated.

164
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,720
Although was there something you had done on the same day as the Pfizer, you used the

165
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Pfizer, right?

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Yeah.

167
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,760
There wasn't like an activity, I don't know, a laundry of some kind.

168
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
Oh, no, no.

169
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,680
I should have hydrated more.

170
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,880
I knew I was just like, but I didn't want to get caught in like the drive through like

171
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,160
vaccine, like get stuck there and go like there's nowhere to use a bathroom, you know?

172
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,720
So I was like weighing my options.

173
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,280
So I guess, I don't know.

174
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,280
That's what a lot of people, people who are like pounding water in the days leading up

175
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,400
to it seem to be doing very well.

176
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,520
But go, yeah, if you're out there and you're hesitant, get it, get the vaccine.

177
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,600
With us as an example, look what you get to do.

178
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,480
Talk about an old Epcot ride, but not on zoom.

179
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,360
This is the kinds of dreams you'll be living.

180
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,240
If you, I assume, what is the percentage?

181
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
What possibly, it could literally be like one listener.

182
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
Oh, who hasn't, maybe, I don't know.

183
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,920
I think there's still, I think a lot of folks are just like, maybe like, oh, is it open

184
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
yet?

185
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Okay, I'll go get it.

186
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Like, you know.

187
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
It's not malicious.

188
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,680
It's not like some backwards point of view.

189
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,880
It's just like, yeah, I'll get around to it.

190
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
So I think, yeah, like you probably can get it now.

191
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Go get it.

192
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Why not?

193
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,480
There's a few people I've talked to who are like, yeah, I just got mine last, like the

194
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,160
first one, like two days ago.

195
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,480
And I'm like, oh, okay, just got around to it, huh?

196
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
All right.

197
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
There's some of that.

198
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Yeah, yeah.

199
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,800
Well, wait, because not everybody's like us applying Galaxy's Edge opening morning logic

200
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,520
of like, well, we need to be stalking this.

201
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,080
We need to be on a complicated website.

202
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,840
We need to have some satisfaction from getting it done very slightly earlier than other people.

203
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,400
I mean, also, let's say, you know, California had like, you know, was really rationing it

204
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:29,400
and then just opened the doors and you can just get it at like Burger King now.

205
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,080
But the other states have had rockier rollouts.

206
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
Yeah, that's true.

207
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,360
And depending on where you live and everything.

208
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Yeah.

209
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,800
You know, they're not all as like put together as a miniaturized exploration technologies

210
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,400
organization.

211
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,640
The fictional company and organization in today's show.

212
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,680
And that brings up, that might be a good future fake Final Four is fake acronyms for fake

213
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,040
organizations within the world.

214
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Oh, absolutely.

215
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,360
Worldwide Engineering Brigade, the upcoming Spider-Man.

216
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,880
This was reminding me of web.

217
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:10,360
I know as we enter the era of web, let's flash back to the era of Met.

218
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,520
Which is off of MetLife, the sponsor that almost didn't occur to me.

219
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,320
Yes, I think I started to dislike it more when I put that together.

220
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,360
I was like, oh, man, that's pretty good.

221
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
It's pretty clean.

222
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,760
And I was like, oh, MetLife.

223
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Yeah.

224
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Yeah, yeah.

225
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,400
Much more eye rolly when you realize why they why they did it.

226
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Yeah.

227
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,600
Hey, you know what?

228
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,660
This is a topic I feel like we were saving for this moment when we're when we're back

229
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,660
open for business.

230
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,580
We're back in person because we we won the body war.

231
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,260
The three of us did.

232
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,780
The world's starting to win it.

233
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,320
Some of the world covid's over.

234
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
It's done.

235
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
There's no more covid.

236
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,060
And we won the body war.

237
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,460
We're as victorious as Dr. Cynthia Lair.

238
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460
Right.

239
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,180
Well, we certainly all feel like Dr. Cynthia Lair right now.

240
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,940
I do like to think of the Moderna going through my bloodstream like a little vehicle of some

241
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
kind.

242
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,140
I think it's like a violent white blood cell attacking Elizabeth Shue at like the height

243
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,140
of her powers.

244
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,140
Real run of hits.

245
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,020
I just started watching the boys and I would argue Elizabeth Shue still at the height of

246
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
her power.

247
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
I think she's really great on that show.

248
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,020
Oh, I forgot she was in.

249
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,020
I haven't done that yet.

250
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
Yeah.

251
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,500
But this is like, yeah, I was looking in the filmography how right before the two credits

252
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,500
before on IMDB are adventures in babysitting and cocktail.

253
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,780
And then right after is Back to the Future 2 and 3.

254
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,380
Thankless role in 2 and 3, I'd say so.

255
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,900
But it's still cool.

256
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
She looks cool.

257
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
She's in a cool vest.

258
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,300
Cocktail is a pretty ridiculous movie, but I had a really fun time watching it.

259
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,700
That's all great to me.

260
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,840
And then this ride, which is, you know, it's weird, but it's still great.

261
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,200
On her end, it is an awesome body of work of weird stuff.

262
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Tim Matheson in it too.

263
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,800
So both her and Matheson and of course, director Leonard Nimoy.

264
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,440
That's a big get coming off of directing the hit Three Men and a Baby, the Touchstone film.

265
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,640
Which I believe is how they were able to, I forget, it's not in the Disney war book.

266
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,920
It might've been in a Disney dish episode where they're like, oh, they were able to

267
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,760
glass him into doing this because they already had him around.

268
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,800
Like they were like, hey, what else you want to do?

269
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,440
Three Men and a Baby, big hit.

270
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
What else you want to do?

271
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:37,080
And it's so Star Trek-y and it's crew and the way they speak on the thing.

272
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,560
So they're like, well, this guy, this guy.

273
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,440
And he's probably, he had two of the Star Trek movies under his belt, including the

274
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
whale one.

275
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,240
He did three and four.

276
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,480
Yeah, three is fine.

277
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Four is good.

278
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Yeah.

279
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
You've seen the whale one?

280
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Yeah, that's the only one I've seen.

281
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Is that true?

282
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,640
You've only seen one Star Trek movie and it's the whale one?

283
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,040
That's off of my wife, Erin's POV.

285
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,480
She's like, I don't know anything about any of Star Trek.

286
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,800
I just liked the San Francisco 80s whale movie.

287
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,880
To her, it's like these are all new characters who never returned or did anything before.

288
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,080
It is, it is good.

289
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,560
I haven't watched it in a little while.

290
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,600
Two, the original Star Trek movies, it's like two, four and six are good.

291
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,280
One is fine, but boring.

292
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,680
Three is fine.

293
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,440
Five is the one that Shatner directed and it's awful.

294
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,600
It is awful.

295
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,560
It's by far the worst one, but it does start out with the three main guys with Bones, Spock

296
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,240
and Kirk all like vacationing in like a national park together.

297
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,080
And I forget who, I think it's Kirk falls off a mountain and then like somebody has

298
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,280
like wrote like rocket shoes that shoots up.

299
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,520
I think it's Nimoy and catches him and it looks real bad.

300
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,480
The whole thing is, it's worth a watch.

301
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,080
But I think all of them are worth a watch.

302
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,840
I'm a big fan of all those movies.

303
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,320
I think the only one I have seen is the first JJ Abrams.

304
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Really?

305
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Yeah, I used to watch the original original Star Trek in syndication a lot.

306
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:14,240
And then I have watched pieces of Next Generation and then I guess random episodes of like DS9

307
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,360
and Enterprise.

308
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,840
And yeah, I don't know if I've ever sat down and watched one of the movies all the way

309
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
through besides the first.

310
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,360
I think these are not regarded as like, you're not exactly seeing lists say the top hundred

311
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
films of all time.

312
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,640
Wrath of Khan makes some of a list once in a while.

313
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,000
Wrath of Khan does make lists like that.

314
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,040
There's the 90s ones that for sure got a lot of ads in comic books, but he is surprising.

315
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,880
Oh yeah, my beloved Star Trek Generations where Captain Kirk meets Captain Picard and

316
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,880
they are, they go horse race or like horse riding together.

317
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,960
I think as a kid I was like, oh I get that.

318
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

319
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
It's a very goofy movie, but I've watched that a million times.

320
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,600
Anyway, it is not a Star Trek podcast, but it is exciting.

321
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,840
But there's a Star Trek guy, one of the major people is behind the camera of simulator footage.

322
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,000
I have one more thing about him, which is then I was like, what else is, because that's

323
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,960
a pretty strong run.

324
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,800
Three Men and a Baby, big hit.

325
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,000
Star Trek movie is very visible and he's taking the reins of his own franchise.

326
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Disney Ride, cool.

327
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And what do you do after?

328
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,600
And then it's kind of like a, there's a Gene Wilder movie that didn't do very well.

329
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,120
There's a Diane Keaton movie that didn't do very well.

330
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,920
And then a movie I've never ever heard of in my life.

331
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,960
And I think the glare outdoors will make it difficult to show you this, but I'll just

332
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
describe it.

333
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,280
There's a poster for a movie called Holy Matrimony.

334
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,120
Does anyone know Holy Matrimony?

335
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
That's familiar.

336
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:45,560
It's Patricia Arquette is in like, you know, shorts and a denim shirt and she's Anna Bridal.

337
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,600
And so she's getting married, but her beau, the person she's marrying is a young Joseph

338
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,800
Gordon Levitt, like a very young, right around Angels in the Outfield looking at the camera

339
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,960
like, huh?

340
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,320
And he's, it's not Amish, but it's like a similar, very like strict sect.

341
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Oh, Mennonite?

342
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,280
No, still not Mennonite.

343
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
What is the word?

344
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Quakers?

345
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,160
Hutterite is what it is.

346
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,280
And it's some, she's like a schemer and she ends up having a like, her husband dies and

347
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,520
it's the older brother of kid Joseph Gordon Levitt and they have to get married and they

348
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,120
kiss in it apparently.

349
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Yeah.

350
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,740
If you can imagine, if all of these details, if you're not surprised that these did not

351
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,600
propel the box office above $1 million.

352
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,880
And I think the Nehemiah directing career kind of sputtered out after Holy Matrimony.

353
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,740
There's no other movie after 94.

354
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
That just is the end.

355
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
But.

356
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,580
He released a number of photo books.

357
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,060
I believe he was an avid photographer.

358
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
Yes, he was a photographer.

359
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,780
He had many like showings, gallery showings.

360
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:54,140
The last directing credit he has is another thing that comes up on podcasts a lot.

361
00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:01,220
It is a TV episode of the TV show Deadly Games, the show that Christopher Lloyd plays Sebastian

362
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
Jackle.

363
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,220
Oh, it's that.

364
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,580
I was staring right at it probably on the day that we recorded an episode where we talked

365
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,860
about Sebastian Jackle again.

366
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,660
And somehow the phrase Deadly Games is so undistinct it didn't even jump out of the

367
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,660
website at me.

368
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
Sebastian Jackle, yes.

369
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,660
Wow.

370
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,660
So, yeah.

371
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,020
We're going to have to, that's all going to have to culminate in something at some point.

372
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,500
We're going to have to watch some of this show or discuss it.

373
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Maybe that'll be, that will be to us as Holy Matrimony was to Nimoy's directing career.

374
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,340
That's where it all takes a nose to.

375
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,340
Yes.

376
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,900
Or we just find like a really great lost thing, you know?

377
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
Yeah.

378
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,140
There could be a real gem in there.

379
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,820
Well, we'll go digging.

380
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,100
We'll go piloting our ship around episodes of Deadly Game.

381
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,380
But the basics of this that we haven't said, this is Epcot.

382
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,740
Epcot, 1989 opening day, not opening day attraction for Epcot, but opening day for the Wonders

383
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,420
of Life pavilion.

384
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,700
We have discussed several other things in this pavilion.

385
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,580
We've discussed Cranium Command.

386
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:13,860
We recently, unpleasantly discussed the making of me on the second gate.

387
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:19,260
I was trying to find if there were TV ads for body wars and there's ones that kind of

388
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,820
split the, they say it's the Wonders of Life pavilion where this happens.

389
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,700
And one of them is saying there's this ride where you get miniaturized and go into the

390
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,700
human body.

391
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,260
But the other one was watch a human birth every 20 minutes.

392
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,900
And then it's the footage that we discussed of like the pretty realistic right out of

393
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,220
the womb baby.

394
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:45,900
And then it cuts to a little girl watching it like, hooray, like thrilled, smiling her

395
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,140
biggest Disney world smile.

396
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,300
And this is how they advertise the Wonders of Life pavilion when it opened in 89.

397
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,820
Well, this is what I remember.

398
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,100
If you can see this image.

399
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,100
Yes.

400
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:03,420
Every brochure, Disney magazine, Disney adventures, like, and it is very similar to the one they

401
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:09,260
would use for Star Tours, which use the same simulator technology and open two months later.

402
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:15,820
And this is your, it's like, yeah, very similar where it's the ship and you see through the

403
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,780
windshield and the ship, but in this case, the ship is being piloted through a blood

404
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,780
stream.

405
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
Yes.

406
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,940
Big bulbous blood cells that the ship's avoiding.

407
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,580
My personal memories of this ride.

408
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,140
I liked this ride a lot.

409
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,500
Like, I was always excited for this.

410
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,100
I mean, Star Tours has wrecks and my family loved MGM studios.

411
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,160
So obviously had the lead on that front.

412
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,600
But Body Wars had that allure of being nowhere.

413
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,300
It was one of those theme park things.

414
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,400
You couldn't see it anywhere else.

415
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,160
You know, you could rent it at the video store.

416
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,360
So I think I was always excited to go to the Wonders of Life pavilion and do that and

417
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Cranium Command.

418
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:05,680
I also have a very clear memory of eating at the restaurant, the counter service restaurant,

419
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
which I did.

420
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,560
Oh, I can't find the name of it now.

421
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,080
I don't know the name of that offhand.

422
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,560
I found it online.

423
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
I'll look it up.

424
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,800
Was it like it was healthier food because this was a health pavilion?

425
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,480
In theory, an 80s version of it.

426
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,680
90s or 80s version of healthy food.

427
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Yeah.

428
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,120
So I found the rough descriptions of the menu.

429
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,040
When it closed, that healthy restaurant was resorting to hot dogs and potato chips.

430
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,640
When it opened, it was, you know, healthy things like wraps and Caesar salads and bran

431
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,260
waffles.

432
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:43,600
My memory is eating a bagel with cream cheese that you could then customize at a station

433
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,200
where you could put bananas and strawberries on it.

434
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Oh, okay.

435
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,200
Well, it's a little carb heavy and fat.

436
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,120
It's like, oh, by the way, the bananas and strawberries are sitting in simple syrup.

437
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,520
So it's like pie filling.

438
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
So health.

439
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,560
Enjoy your health.

440
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,600
Bagel cream cheese with pie filling on top.

441
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
On a bagel, yes.

442
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,400
All the healthiest components.

443
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Yeah.

444
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,800
It's very healthy goo that this fruit has been marinating in.

445
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah.

446
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,720
Is there like that's still, we've talked about this before.

447
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,640
Like when you were like this big bowl of iceberg lettuce I'm eating is very healthy.

448
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,840
This is good for me.

449
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,040
It's got blue cheese smothered on it.

450
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
But yes.

451
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Mmm.

452
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Iceberg lettuce.

453
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,920
Well, and mixed with like, you know, we're going to have to get into like the bizarre,

454
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:38,720
like if we could just find like a lot of menus from 1971 when Disney World opened, like what

455
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,840
the fancy dinners were across Disney World.

456
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Oh yeah.

457
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
Cookbook, I think you can find scans of online.

458
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,760
I think there's a cookbook.

459
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,920
And man, if you like chicken a la king, this is your vacation destination.

460
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,960
If you like chicken and various cream sauces and a side and a little cup of brandy to sip

461
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,360
on you're set, man.

462
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,280
Every restaurant had that you think?

463
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,400
I think so.

464
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,360
The name of the restaurant in Wonders of Life was called Pure and Simple.

465
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,040
And I don't know that it was either.

466
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,040
It's called Ice Cold Waffles.

467
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,800
That's what that means.

468
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,760
Ice Cold Wrap.

469
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,160
Ice Cold Damp Wrap is probably what they should have called it.

470
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Wraps are damp.

471
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
I know that's that like squishy.

472
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Yeah, boy.

473
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm so glad that I didn't I don't even like looking at them like a cut up wrap.

474
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,080
If you if you determine that's the catering for something you're at or the meal on a shoot

475
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,560
or something, it's such a like shot to the morale.

476
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,960
Oh no.

477
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,040
If you can get it made and watch them slice it and hand it to you and get it done in 10

478
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
minutes.

479
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Delicious.

480
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,560
But on a platter or like in a box at the airport?

481
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
No.

482
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,360
Oh, they had times ahead.

483
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,560
Togos like wrap.

484
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,280
I remember eating that a lot.

485
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,480
I think we like we've talked about wraps before.

486
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,160
We were fooled by wraps.

487
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Tricked by wraps.

488
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,160
I've been eating awful food for years.

489
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, just get the bread.

490
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't know.

491
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Like I guess.

492
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,240
Just eat a club sandwich at that point.

493
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,360
Or yeah, or just like get a real go get some real food, like just get protein and some

494
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
vegetables.

495
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Yeah, yeah.

496
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,760
I yeah, I think I must have went when there were when they switched to hot dogs.

497
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,280
And I think I thought, oh, is it like somehow like a healthier hot dog?

498
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,720
And now looking back like, no, I think it was not.

499
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,440
I think that is just a hot dog.

500
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,040
No, this pavilion is open seasonally if you're if at all.

501
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,360
So yeah, mostly not these days.

502
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:45,560
So I think something to underline that that you said already, if people don't know this

503
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,080
ride and some people might not know this ride.

504
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,880
So it is you are miniaturized in a little ship.

505
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,040
You take a trip through the bloodstream.

506
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,080
You're supposed to just see something just beneath the skin.

507
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,640
And then you wander all around the body.

508
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,200
Things go haywire and you go everywhere in the body.

509
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,440
And that's the vague part of the ride.

510
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,680
Sounds cool, right?

511
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,600
And it was cool.

512
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,720
I like some components of this for sure.

513
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,920
But the big thing is that it is Star Tours.

514
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,840
It is completely Star Tours.

515
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,080
The format is the same.

516
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,840
The line is the same where you see videos, pre-ride videos are the same and those are

517
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,800
the same videos.

518
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,040
And then you get into the same cabin.

519
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,800
It's the same molding.

520
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,640
The thing comes down at the same time.

521
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,920
There's a monitor over on the right and sometimes there's a guy on it.

522
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,920
And sometimes there's some text on a smaller monitor.

523
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,040
There's warps.

524
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
The moves all feel similar.

525
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,720
Uh huh.

526
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,960
And just as a timeline, original Star Tours Disneyland opens 87.

527
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,480
This is up in 89.

528
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,560
And then as Jason said, two months later, real Star Tours opens down the street at

529
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,080
Disney MGM Studios.

530
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,920
Yes.

531
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,960
I feel like they would never like muck things up like that today.

532
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,800
Where like two, like the same.

533
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,560
Like they didn't even like do a paint job that would trick you.

534
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,040
It just is exactly like you walk in, oh I see it's Star Tours.

535
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,200
And they open two months apart.

536
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,040
Yeah.

537
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,280
Like when they open Star Tours, the adventure continues.

538
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,560
They on the same day, they open that in Disneyland over in California Adventure.

539
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
They open the Little Mermaid ride.

540
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,440
Very different experiences.

541
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,520
Yeah.

542
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,280
So not the same.

543
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,040
So they've opened different attractions and different parks simultaneously or within a

544
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,680
few days or weeks of each other.

545
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,320
But yeah, exactly the same.

546
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,280
Like the same technology is weird.

547
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,640
With like characters around.

548
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,360
Like with R2D2 and C3PO hanging out in the line.

549
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
It's weird.

550
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,040
Like when they did, when Transformers came to Hollywood and Universal, I remember thinking

551
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,680
oh it's the same exact ride system.

552
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,120
But now that I'm remembering this, it's not nearly as egregious.

553
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,440
Because it is absolutely, because you get in the vehicle, you're like oh it's exactly

554
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Spider-Man.

555
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
It's exactly the same thing.

556
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,400
But then you're like it's just different disorienting videos.

557
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Yeah.

558
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
And they didn't have a Spider-Man kind of thing out here.

559
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Right.

560
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
I mean eventually they put Transformers in.

561
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,760
So like I would think like if you were in Florida, you're like oh it's kind of the same

562
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
ride.

563
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,960
But it's varied enough and you see so much different imagery that it's like, yeah whatever,

564
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
it's fine.

565
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,000
It doesn't even feel as egregious as Indiana Jones and Dinosaur.

566
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
No.

567
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,080
Which we've determined, it's very well hidden.

568
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,280
The fact that it is the same track layout and kind of the same moves throughout.

569
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,240
But you just go, I see, they used a vehicle inspired by, it's like in the family of Indiana

570
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Jones.

571
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,560
As opposed to, there's something about walking in a room and it's the same room.

572
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,960
It just feels lazy or something.

573
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,120
Yeah it does.

574
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,800
I would think they would have dressed up because like you look at the ceiling on it and as

575
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,760
a kid I don't, it didn't register with me.

576
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,280
I didn't care I guess.

577
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,680
But when you look at the videos now and I go yeah it's the same exact thing where it's

578
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,320
like mimicking like sitting in an airplane and it's got the air vent things that you

579
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,800
can't touch or whatever.

580
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,560
Or the lights and the air vents that you would have over you, whatever you call them on a

581
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
plane.

582
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,360
But it's like wouldn't they just like change that?

583
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,000
Like wouldn't they change something about the cabin to make it look different?

584
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,080
Because in Star Tours you're on it is like an equivalent of a flight.

585
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Yeah right.

586
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,040
But this is only framed to us as you're on a mission, you're going into skin.

587
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Right.

588
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
You're going in.

589
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,040
So like I don't expect to have like a button I can press for a flight attendant.

590
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,600
Yeah or like a button you would press to read a book in there.

591
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
You're on a mission.

592
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,240
We're on doing something very important.

593
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,920
Like I don't know why it would just be, you would change the ceiling or something.

594
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Yeah.

595
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:55,360
I mean I think this, like so many Epcot attractions, the story is, okay we started really big and

596
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,480
we scaled back to what was feasible and what was affordable and what the sponsor would

597
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,800
fork up money to.

598
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,920
Although I have to say, unlike some of the other like older Epcot attractions that we've

599
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,760
covered before, the thing that's surprised me about this is reading across multiple websites,

600
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,560
multiple videos about this attraction, the narrative, everyone agrees it's exactly this.

601
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,440
There's no, like Horizons is so many different like, oh and then they thought about this

602
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,520
and they thought about this.

603
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,000
Living Seas has a lot of like, well they considered this and someone else hones in on this.

604
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:36,760
This it's just like, okay was this, this, you know, this is why it was closed and this

605
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,440
is why this happened.

606
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,560
Like I was shocked at like how, because the narrative is never the same.

607
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:48,200
If you try to look up how many people does Disneyland hold, you will find like 20 different

608
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,160
blogs with 20 different answers, you know?

609
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:57,040
Or rides are always accused of like, well that closed because it like, you know, jerked

610
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,560
seven people into the sky and they never came down.

611
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,680
Or the ride fell into a hole.

612
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,040
People are always trying to find some reason.

613
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:11,200
There's legends of things, but this is not so legendary is what you're saying maybe.

614
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,640
Yeah, pretty cut and dry.

615
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,720
It was a little too out of the way.

616
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,560
Sponsor dropped out a few years before and yeah, I don't know.

617
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
We're just not feeling it.

618
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
It's just not worth it.

619
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Lazyness.

620
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Oh.

621
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,080
Not wanting to put a human being over there is why they didn't keep it open.

622
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,080
And the big thing that kept coming up, which I had no idea this is something everyone agreed

623
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,320
on about this ride, it made people queasy?

624
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Yeah.

625
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Yeah.

626
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Okay.

627
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,720
I fall into the stereotype on that maybe.

628
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,440
I liked aspects of this.

629
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,360
I remember looking forward to it a lot whenever I went on it.

630
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,780
But like, I'm sure the last time I went on it, I felt it.

631
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:54,200
Even though it is so similar to Star Tours, which I've never had a problem with, there's

632
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,160
something about, it's the blood component.

633
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,760
I think that you're in blood.

634
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,280
You know where it happens for me and we'll step through what happens in the ride, but

635
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,840
you like, you know, you start in a general bloodstream and then you end up in different

636
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,120
body parts and you end up in the lungs.

637
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:17,600
Something about seeing like, there's just the icky, ethereal, it all just looks like,

638
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,720
you know, it's various goo's that you're floating in and it's a little creepy.

639
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,480
And then the tissue opening and closing of the lung and then mixed with, there's not

640
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,560
like score in this that's fine.

641
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,400
You're just hearing gasping and that freaks me out.

642
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Just like, oh.

643
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
That's interesting.

644
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
I'm trying to think.

645
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:42,200
My friend, his whole life, he would, in health class, like if there was blood talk or certain

646
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,000
things like that, he would feel very lightheaded.

647
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,640
Once in a while would pass out.

648
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Were we nice about it?

649
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,040
Did we, we were like, aha, you're going to pass out?

650
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Probably.

651
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Probably.

652
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
We were mean.

653
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
I will say that.

654
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,480
That's certainly the nature sometimes of growing up.

655
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,200
People were mean to me about things too.

656
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,840
But anyway, so I would see that.

657
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,940
And I remember that like the blood stuff wouldn't really make me lightheaded.

658
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,040
But anytime we were in health class, and I apologize, this is very, this is body, this

659
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,560
is going to be body talk.

660
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,600
There were diagrams of what a circumcision looked like.

661
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,120
And I remember feeling like I might pass out.

662
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,340
So I feel like everyone has their own level of like the realities of like the body and

663
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,920
certain things.

664
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,440
Being reminded that you're like a machine.

665
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,040
Everyone's got a different thing probably that makes them go, oh, oh God.

666
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,560
Now circumcision is like cutting.

667
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,560
So I get that.

668
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,000
But like, you know, that makes sense to me.

669
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,120
But I actually hadn't even thought of it because I never had that reaction to the ride when

670
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
I was on it.

671
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Yeah.

672
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:48,160
Well, I think too, the detail that kept coming up, again, same details kept coming up, but

673
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:54,360
that an Imagineer went in with a joystick and programmed two like moments in the footage

674
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,960
of like, okay, and in this point, you're kind of floating in the bloodstream.

675
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,680
So the ride's going to be rocking a little.

676
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,600
And this point, yeah, the lungs are like breath in, breath out.

677
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,400
So the ride will be like going back and forth.

678
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,120
And I was like, oh yeah, it did kind of do that in a way that Star Tours did not.

679
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,240
You know, it's, I mean, years later, they would sort of simulate breath.

680
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,320
Of course, on Flight of Passage, the Avatar ride where you feel the great beast breathe

681
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
between your legs.

682
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Which you pointed out.

683
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,600
I might have missed it.

684
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,880
Yeah, no, I'm just saying.

685
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,000
So like, yes, that's interesting because I think as a kid, I don't have a strong memory

686
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,800
of that, but watching it again, I'm like, oh yeah, okay, that makes sense that you can

687
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,520
feel like lungs breathing.

688
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,440
And that's got to be, that's both cool and it is a little unnerving.

689
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,360
It is a little unnerving and that the probably, I'm sure some people, it helped that the footage

690
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,800
is so CG and abstract and then other people, it's just like, I am in blood.

691
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
I am in lungs.

692
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,760
I am in blood.

693
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
This is weird.

694
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Yeah, it is weird.

695
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
I mean, I, yeah, that is interesting.

696
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,560
I'm trying to remember if I was scared of this because I was scared so much, but this

697
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:11,440
ride more than even like Horizons and almost any, like other than Spaceship Earth, I remember

698
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,560
this ride and I liked this ride a lot.

699
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,320
For whatever reason, I enjoyed being in the blood.

700
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,680
I enjoyed flying through blood, I guess.

701
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Sure.

702
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
I think I just simplified it.

703
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,920
It's like, oh, at MGM Studios, the simulator is Star Tours, at Epcot, it's Body Wars and

704
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,320
we'll do one, one day, one the other day.

705
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,400
I like it in the themes.

706
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,520
I like flying through space.

707
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
I like flying through blood.

708
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,520
Both equally good.

709
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
Everyone's dreams.

710
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,600
I like the art rest and I like the way the doors open.

711
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Yeah, yes.

712
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
Yeah, I know.

713
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
That's, you bring up a good point.

714
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,040
I don't know if we talked with Star Tours before.

715
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,160
I do just like nestling my hands in there.

716
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Hopefully soon.

717
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,040
I think I'll be there soon and I'll really dig them in.

718
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,400
It'll feel good to feel those things again.

719
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,560
Those little lips.

720
00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:00,640
But yeah, I don't, and I don't think I have the squeamishness and maybe it's like the

721
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,840
blood, when you're in the blood and you're looking at the splinter, I don't feel anything.

722
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,520
I think the lungs creep me out.

723
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,800
And the lungs, I guess you're not even in, there just isn't fluid.

724
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,400
The lungs are just, it's just weird.

725
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,840
It feels gassy or a little, it's hazy in the lungs.

726
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Whatever's going on in there is just a room I do not want to experience.

727
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
Yeah.

728
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Well, the body is horrifying.

729
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
I mean, it's horrifying.

730
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,120
It's worse than any Cronenberg movie or any body horror movie.

731
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,480
It's like when you watch any videos of surgery or anything, you really, it just feels like

732
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,720
an alien and it feels really bizarre.

733
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,560
I don't like thinking about everything that's in here.

734
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,920
It's weird too when you have a kid, when you start, you go like, he was not around.

735
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,200
He didn't exist and there's a heart and we made the heart, this heart exists because

736
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
we, yeah, yeah.

737
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,720
How did you do that?

738
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
It doesn't make any sense.

739
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
It's a trick, man.

740
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
I'll tell you.

741
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
You have a liver.

742
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,280
Where'd that even come from?

743
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
Yeah.

744
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,640
It's like, what did you, where were you guys smoking before you even did that?

745
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,640
It's crazy.

746
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Yeah.

747
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,760
So you have like, you have three nostrils.

748
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
That's so weird.

749
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,680
Do other babies not have three nostrils?

750
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,920
Is that very uncommon?

751
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Yeah.

752
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
He's got like a, like monsterism.

753
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
He's got a problem.

754
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,920
I'm trying not to talk about him.

755
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Yeah.

756
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,480
So I would imagine that like, I would be interested to know like, are the only people that would

757
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,600
go on it and be fine, like doctors, would doctor, a whole car full of doctors be fine

758
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,120
on it because they were used to seeing stuff like this.

759
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:54,360
And I kind of get like the examples that like Theme Park Tourist or Mouse Planet, I think,

760
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,160
had big write-ups about this ride.

761
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Okay.

762
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,320
Well, there was this movie, Fantastic Voyage that was a big hit and that was about being

763
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,080
shrinking a ship down and going in the bloodstream adventures into inner space.

764
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,760
Adventures through inner space.

765
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,920
I'm messing it up off the cuff.

766
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,840
I was just thinking how I get, I think whatever I thought it was is not what it is.

767
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:20,760
And there is a movie called Inner Space 2, but like those well received like concepts,

768
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,920
people can wrap their head around, but through inner space, Disneyland.

769
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Yes.

770
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,880
Wait, I think is it plural or is it, I think it might be adventure singular and that is

771
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
what I was getting wrong.

772
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,880
Oh yeah, you're right.

773
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
No, it is adventure through inner space.

774
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Yeah, yeah.

775
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,520
I think I've made that mistake my whole life and I regret it very much.

776
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,400
I am working on learning the Pixar bar that used to be the cove bar is called the Lamplight

777
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Lounge.

778
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Not Lamplighter.

779
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Not Lamplighter.

780
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Oh, I do that one too.

781
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,480
Even though Disney has had multiple movies featuring Lamplighter characters and you know

782
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Disney Lamplighter.

783
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,160
Jack the Lamplighter from Mary Poppins Returns.

784
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
That's right.

785
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Yes.

786
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
That's what he is.

787
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
He's a Lamplighter.

788
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,720
He's not a chimney sweep, he's a Lamplighter.

789
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,480
Yeah, see his costume at the Bowers Museum, Southern California, till the end of June.

790
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,280
Jack, Jack's Lamplighter costume?

791
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Jack's Lamplighter costume.

792
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,960
Well it's a Disney archive, I think it was an exhibit they've either had for a while

793
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,360
or they had to push for a while, but it's got Dick Tracy's coat.

794
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
It's got a Rex.

795
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Carly was just there.

796
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
I just saw that in her feed.

797
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Yeah, I didn't know there was a Rex.

798
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
And the Lamplighter.

799
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
What am I doing here?

800
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Time to go.

801
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Yeah.

802
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
And the Lamplighter.

803
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,720
And his name is Jack, not Fake Burt.

804
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,440
No, he's not called Fake Burt.

805
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,360
Mary Poppins doesn't keep calling him Fake Burt within scenes.

806
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
Is that so?

807
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Fake Burt.

808
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,640
No, I think, I mean maybe that was early in the shoot, but then they changed it later.

809
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,000
Meryl Streep's character though is called, what is this?

810
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
What's going on?

811
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,640
You know Meryl Streep's character's name.

812
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
Her name is Topsy.

813
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,160
Oh yeah, we had all Topsy run.

814
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Yeah, Topsy.

815
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Jason loves Topsy.

816
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,520
I don't think Jason laughs harder than when I say the word Topsy.

817
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,840
I think it's that you're saying Topsy and you add it fast.

818
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,520
Like you add, no.

819
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,760
She's turning turtle.

820
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Her name is Topsy.

821
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
What?

822
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,280
I'm just saying things that happen in the movie and you're laughing.

823
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,480
Topsy.

824
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,880
It's just the wonderful tales that Rob Marshall spins just make me smile.

825
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,520
It's when stuff gets turned on its head, you say you're turning turtle.

826
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,080
For the future part of this episode, if I take a normal convention and I turn it on

827
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,880
its head, you can tell me I'm turning turtle.

828
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Call each other out.

829
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,440
If I'm starting an exciting new business venture, I say I'm turning turtle.

830
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,600
Yeah, if you're trying to disrupt, say you're going to do a rap business and you're going

831
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,160
to disrupt the normal rap business.

832
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,480
Say you've got Saigon on, or you've got his phone number, you've got a relationship with

833
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
him.

834
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
With who?

835
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Isn't that the character in Entourage?

836
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Isn't that the rapper?

837
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Oh, yes.

838
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Saigon?

839
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
Yes.

840
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Thank you.

841
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,040
Now I will say I did not have that reference right away.

842
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,440
You have Topsy, I have Saigon.

843
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,080
But you're right, that is a character on Entourage.

844
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
That is correct.

845
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Scott looks confused.

846
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,880
Yeah, I did get lost in there.

847
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,760
Jason pulled the 30th most popular Entourage character out.

848
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,760
Turning turtle.

849
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,880
Turtle had a lot of failed business ventures.

850
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,040
If anybody gets cast, is lucky enough to get cast in an Entourage reboot, then you might

851
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
be turning turtle.

852
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
Yes, you might be turning turtle.

853
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,080
We've got the best break of our careers, turning turtle.

854
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:36,760
I keep getting emails from Jerry Farrar, is that the gentleman's name who played turtle?

855
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,040
His restaurant, Fat Sal's.

856
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,940
I keep getting coupons for it.

857
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,880
But I haven't been down there in many years, actually.

858
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
So yes.

859
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,880
Unused coupons?

860
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
What a tale.

861
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,440
That turned my head turtle.

862
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,800
A restaurant I don't think I've ever patronized before midnight.

863
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,240
So I don't know that I'm remembering the coupon.

864
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,760
Maybe I'm remembering the coupon.

865
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,480
I don't know that others are remembering the coupon.

866
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,200
It's like one of those places where they put fries on the hamburger.

867
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,400
It's like they'll load up.

868
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
It's excessive.

869
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,000
That defies my expectations.

870
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,280
And you know what that means.

871
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
Turning turtle.

872
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,800
Turning turtle, yeah.

873
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,800
That is true.

874
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
Where did we get on?

875
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,200
Where did the splinter off from?

876
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,560
Well, we were trying to clarify.

877
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,720
We try to be accurate.

878
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
We try to be accurate.

879
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,840
Sometimes you're pulling a reference off the top of your head.

880
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
Yeah.

881
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,680
So adventure through inner space?

882
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
Oh, it's because of that.

883
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,040
Adventure through inner space.

884
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
Inner space.

885
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
Not interspace.

886
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Not interspace.

887
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,040
No.

888
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Yeah.

889
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,960
So a number of things have explored this.

890
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,200
And interspace kind of like had recently explored this.

891
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
So it's in the consciousness.

892
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,960
People really miss adventure through inner space.

893
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Replaced by StarTurret.

894
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
Replaced by StarTurret.

895
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,240
It's really strange how that all lines up.

896
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,880
So this was in the air to happen, I suppose.

897
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,440
The other piece of the history of it is that they wanted to do a dark ride that was going

898
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,760
through the human body.

899
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,480
The title was going to be The Incredible Journey Within.

900
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,400
But there's a quote you can find a bunch from Marty Sklar about how making a 30-foot heart

901
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,640
is going to be super complicated.

902
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,120
Is that really going to maintain and be worth the...

903
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,400
You're going to put in all that effort and then it's just going to end up looking kind

904
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,680
of cruddy anyway.

905
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,360
So once StarTours comes around, oh, here, this is how we can do it.

906
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,920
With the magic of ILM, Industrial Light and Magic.

907
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,600
The other unbuilt thing, I feel like we could do a whole unbuilt Epcot thing.

908
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,280
There's so much fascinating stuff.

909
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,800
In Futureworld alone, it's interesting.

910
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,600
And then you add in World Showcase, all the unbuilt countries.

911
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,680
But they were thinking about doing a Carousel of Progress-style revolving theater called

912
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,280
Good Health Habits.

913
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,000
About how life is a fun carnival.

914
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Life is fun.

915
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,040
Nothing is more dynamic than the phrase Good Health Habits.

916
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,800
Wait, it was about fun, but it was also going to be like how you should live?

917
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,840
Well, it was about good health habits.

918
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,840
But the whole...

919
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:30,920
The original concept art for the Wonders of Life pavilion is very midway carnival-y.

920
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,720
Right, right, right.

921
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:39,280
And it did have some of that in the center area, and it had little touches of that.

922
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,920
But then it had very spare areas, like undecorated stuff too.

923
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,920
Right.

924
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,920
That would be interesting.

925
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,560
Yeah, so like in the 80s, what did they think was living good?

926
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,080
What would have been good health habits?

927
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
Tab.

928
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,080
Tab.

929
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
You have your daily tabs.

930
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,080
That would have been number one, probably.

931
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,840
Jello, that's an easy way to get your fruit and your vitamins.

932
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Jello mold.

933
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Yeah.

934
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,840
Tab.

935
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Coke?

936
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
What?

937
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,840
Coke?

938
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
Cocaine?

939
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Both new and booger sugar?

940
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,840
Yes, cocaine was good still in the 80s.

941
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,840
Ludes?

942
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
I guess ludes.

943
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,600
Wolf of Wall Street is to be believed.

944
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Iceberg lettuce.

945
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,840
Oh, iceberg lettuce with cream-based dressings.

946
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:25,960
Yeah, just pour a bunch of cocaine on a bunch of iceberg lettuce, take a hit of that.

947
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,960
Mixed with...

948
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,840
Kind of cut it with some ranch dressing.

949
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,840
Right.

950
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,440
And it all gives me one big wrap.

951
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,680
The biggest wrap you can find.

952
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,680
Mixed with jello and NutriSweet.

953
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,240
Just shake it up.

954
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,520
And John from the Carousel of Progress presents all of that to you.

955
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,920
We're doing cocaine now.

956
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,560
And then do eat that thing and then mouser size.

957
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
Yeah, right.

958
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
Mouser size.

959
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,320
Put it on your daily dose of mouser size.

960
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,880
And look to your left, look to your right.

961
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,880
Who is it?

962
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,560
Why, it's Ronald and Nancy Reagan joining you.

963
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Mm-hmm.

964
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,560
And McGruff.

965
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,560
And McGruff.

966
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,560
Stay healthy or else.

967
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
I'll bite ya.

968
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
It threatens you into being healthy.

969
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Put blue cheese on everything.

970
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,440
It makes it easier to eat.

971
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,440
Choke down that garbage lettuce newspaper that we have to eat.

972
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,440
I just need newspaper, but you shouldn't.

973
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,440
I tried putting blue cheese on grass once and ate it and then took a shit on it and

974
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
it was fine.

975
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
It was good.

976
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,440
Whether you call it Thousand Island dressing or Russian dressing, it's an important part

977
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,440
of the food pyramid.

978
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:44,320
Speaking of Ronald Reagan, a thing I found out about researching this is that Tim Matheson

979
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:52,120
played Ronald Reagan in National Geographic Channel's adaptation of Bill O'Reilly's book

980
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,120
Killing Reagan.

981
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,120
Wow.

982
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,120
And that's kind of, there is a child screened.

983
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,120
It's not my child.

984
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,120
Let me be clear about that.

985
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,800
I was going to say he is well behaved, but that's actually just behind glass.

986
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
He's in a glass box right now.

987
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
Not in a cube.

988
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,800
I mean a window.

989
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
You put him in the Magneto.

990
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
Plastic prison, yeah.

991
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
All right, fine.

992
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,800
I have a miniature Magneto prison where I sort of freeze my son until our important podcast

993
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,800
work is done.

994
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800
He's playing chess in there.

995
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
That is a weird thing.

996
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
That is a weird thing.

997
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:33,680
I guess because Fox at the time and now Disney-Fox owns National Geographic, but they adapted

998
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,680
those Bill O'Reilly killing books as prestige TV made for TV movies.

999
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,680
With Cynthia Nixon as Nancy.

1000
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,680
So strange.

1001
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,680
So is that movie about the attempted assassination of Reagan?

1002
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,680
I think so.

1003
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,560
I think that's how the naming of his books started.

1004
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,560
He's attempted assassinated presidents.

1005
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,560
Then I think by the end he was just...

1006
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,560
Killing Lincoln.

1007
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
Which happened.

1008
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
Which happened.

1009
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,560
Kennedy happened.

1010
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,560
But Reagan did not happen.

1011
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,560
But does Bill O'Reilly do a Tarantino thing where he does kill Reagan at the end?

1012
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Is there a twist on it?

1013
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,560
I don't think so.

1014
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,560
Did he kill Teddy Roosevelt?

1015
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,560
I don't know.

1016
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,440
It was just a weird thing I came across.

1017
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,440
McGruff saved Reagan at the end of the book.

1018
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,440
No.

1019
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,440
You dove in front of the bullet.

1020
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,440
Yeah.

1021
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,440
Killing McGruff.

1022
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,440
Also, I was picturing for... until I looked at a picture of him, I was picturing Timothy

1023
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,440
Busfeld, not Timothy Matheson.

1024
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,440
Both on the West Wing as different characters.

1025
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,440
Oh, that's right.

1026
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,440
Yeah.

1027
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,440
Those solid actors.

1028
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,440
And that's a solid confusion.

1029
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,320
That makes sense to me.

1030
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,320
Yeah.

1031
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,320
Both him.

1032
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,320
Throw Timothy Dalton in there and then there's a whole mess of confusion you can have.

1033
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
Yeah.

1034
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
But a different type.

1035
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,320
You probably wouldn't.

1036
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
And Matheson's good.

1037
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,320
He's good in this.

1038
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,320
Yes.

1039
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
I feel.

1040
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Braddock.

1041
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
It's Captain Braddock.

1042
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Captain Braddock.

1043
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,320
Captain Braddock.

1044
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,320
Who some literature I saw said was a former fighter pilot.

1045
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,200
And now he pilots little ships that get miniaturized into the human body.

1046
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,240
I don't know where they convey the fighter pilot.

1047
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,400
Is that made up?

1048
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,400
I don't know.

1049
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
He's sort of po-Dameron-esque.

1050
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,360
He is very Dameron-esque, I agree.

1051
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,720
Did they say, maybe I missed this, did they say, is it in the future year or is it current

1052
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,720
day on this ride?

1053
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,720
I don't know if it's current day, right?

1054
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,720
They say a year.

1055
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:35,240
They just imagine that there is technology up to this speed, but this isn't 2088.

1056
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,200
I think that's right, because I didn't come across anything, but I'm thinking of that

1057
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,200
now.

1058
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
I'm wondering if that's what they were doing.

1059
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,720
But yeah, so I was just trying to figure out what war he may have served in as an Air

1060
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,720
Force pilot.

1061
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,040
Oh yeah.

1062
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,040
So they made this in what, 89?

1063
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,040
89 came out.

1064
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,320
Yeah, so he's what, he's like 30 something.

1065
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,000
Fictional alternate universe war that killed Reagan.

1066
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Oh yeah, good point.

1067
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,920
It was like a war against aliens and he had to fly a plane himself like in Independence

1068
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,360
Day and the aliens killed Reagan.

1069
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,680
It was when Reagan was governor of California.

1070
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,600
He fought, it was an alien attack specific to California.

1071
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,600
Yeah, it was California versus aliens.

1072
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,480
He led the California military.

1073
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
Right.

1074
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,240
There's a lot of those big old sounds now.

1075
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,520
The perils of outdoor recording.

1076
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,960
Yeah, there's a big car drove by.

1077
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,840
Of course, we've warned you before if there's a car that sounds old, probably jail.

1078
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:34,080
Yeah, the child has been sated by like wailing on a like old like car with a baseball bat.

1079
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:39,680
Someone's doing the street fighter bonus level where they beat up a car.

1080
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,400
He Honda beats up a car for bonus points.

1081
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,080
You talk about health.

1082
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,160
I think this is a good, this is what can be like a hearing test for the audio.

1083
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,240
How good is your hearing?

1084
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,920
Can you hear the things happening around my yard?

1085
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,600
Or are we referring to things that we didn't even need to address?

1086
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,040
Probably didn't need to address most of them.

1087
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,760
Some of them I bet, I really don't know.

1088
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,760
Not sure.

1089
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,560
We'll never, you know, we'll never know.

1090
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,840
Yeah, but we might as well look, it fills time to talk about the sounds.

1091
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,600
It's just nice to talk to each other and see each other in person.

1092
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,480
And also I was startled a couple times, so I felt like I had to acknowledge it.

1093
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,600
Just so I didn't go like, oh.

1094
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,200
The audience would have noticed maybe that you seemed like you were scared a little bit.

1095
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,480
So you had to make it known why.

1096
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:31,360
Well, if I kept talking, yeah, I wouldn't make like, I was also thinking, you know,

1097
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,640
we're learning today, Ellen is ending her talk show, but I was thinking today, should

1098
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,200
I get some sort of an actor to scare you during the record like Ellen might do during

1099
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,200
her show?

1100
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,840
Oh, yes, she would have.

1101
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,480
She made people go into haunted houses and stuff.

1102
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,400
Yeah, but she would have like a person.

1103
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,680
She would have a person in a box.

1104
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,920
Have you ever seen like she would have a person sitting?

1105
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,080
No, no, out on the show live when they were doing an interview, there'd be like a box

1106
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,800
next to the person they wouldn't notice because it looked like just a piece of furniture.

1107
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,880
And a person would jump out of the box mid interview and scare the guest.

1108
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,880
Yikes.

1109
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,680
Like, and she would just do it for her own sick pleasure.

1110
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,200
And you know, that's what happens.

1111
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,120
You know, you didn't have to make that stuff up.

1112
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:15,480
Like in the 80s, you had luge, you had cocaine that would just naturally happen on a talk

1113
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,600
show on like late period.

1114
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
Insane enough.

1115
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,720
You didn't have to contrive stuff like that.

1116
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,360
You just fell asleep in a box and didn't know why.

1117
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,880
But yes, and of course, Ellen, of course, Epcot celebrity Ellen DeGeneres.

1118
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
That's right.

1119
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Yeah, yeah.

1120
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1121
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,880
Yeah.

1122
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,960
How did did her show run longer than the ride did?

1123
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:44,360
I believe 19 years, I think, is the show and the ride just shy of 18.

1124
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,360
Oh, wow.

1125
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
Okay.

1126
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,120
So that must be she was that's probably why she was riding it out, like probably tempted

1127
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,840
to leave because everybody started saying she's mean.

1128
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,840
But like, I got to get the stats up.

1129
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,880
This has to go longer than my bad ride.

1130
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,880
Right.

1131
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
Yes, that's probably right.

1132
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,440
Oh, I thought you meant this ride.

1133
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,800
She was like, I'm outlasting body wars.

1134
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,800
Oh, yeah.

1135
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,360
She was trying to be body wars.

1136
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,360
Definitely.

1137
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,680
But going forward, especially if we're at my apartment, Jason, watch out, because if

1138
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,080
there's a big box around you, I've hired an actor to scare you mid record.

1139
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,080
Okay.

1140
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,880
I want to keep you on your toes.

1141
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,920
But following proper current actor protocols where they'll have a mask and a face shield.

1142
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,440
Well, as we said, I have my temperature gun from earlier.

1143
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,440
You have your temperature gun.

1144
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,800
I will not allow them inside if they have a temperature.

1145
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:34,280
If I see you constantly zapping the box, a cardboard box, I will keep it.

1146
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,360
Sometimes a cough comes out of when we're inside.

1147
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,120
I will continue to take both of your temperatures during record to make sure you haven't had

1148
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,520
any sort of elevation over and over.

1149
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,160
So when that yeah, when you hear a beep every minute, you'll know that we moved and you

1150
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,720
stop hearing children yelling.

1151
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,720
Yes.

1152
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
Yes, exactly.

1153
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,720
That's what happened.

1154
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,720
Exactly.

1155
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,720
Where were we?

1156
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,720
Oh, my God.

1157
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,720
I don't know.

1158
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,360
Okay, we're talking Braddock a little bit.

1159
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,560
Actually, I forgot there's another little Star Wars tie in with Braddock.

1160
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:11,680
Did you notice that he, much like Han Solo's dice, has a little lungs dangling from his

1161
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,680
dash?

1162
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,680
I did notice that.

1163
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,680
I like that.

1164
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,680
Yeah, I feel like the merchandise offering in Wonders of Life is that kiosk storefront

1165
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,160
was pretty small.

1166
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,760
So I doubt you could buy the dangling lungs.

1167
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,760
I wish you could.

1168
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,800
Yeah, that would have been great.

1169
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:33,880
But obviously, I'd love to see like a long backstory of what the dangling lungs and where

1170
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,880
they came from.

1171
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,600
I mean, Braddock, the Disney Plus spinoff series would be great.

1172
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,760
How do you transition from how do you get the name Braddock, first of all?

1173
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:50,540
How do you transition from being a fighter pilot in a California alien war to being a

1174
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:55,520
miniaturized vessel pilot for MetLife?

1175
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,440
When we looked at it, there's a lot of story to tell is what they'll say in the press release.

1176
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,440
Yeah.

1177
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,880
So a lot more story left to tell.

1178
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,480
So yeah, I think that Ronald D. Moore is really going to be, it's all on his shoulders here.

1179
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,640
If he can get this sea off the ground, then we get all of it.

1180
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,640
We get all of it.

1181
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,720
Because if it doesn't work, it's all going to be back to the drawing board for years,

1182
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,840
I'm afraid.

1183
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:25,120
But if he can get like Braddock in sea somehow, this is truly not that far fetched.

1184
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,720
Yeah.

1185
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,720
Yeah.

1186
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,760
I think Matheson's still gettable.

1187
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,200
I think he'd step into the famous jumpsuit again.

1188
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,200
Is that what he wears?

1189
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,200
I don't quite recall.

1190
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,200
Brannox famous jumpsuit?

1191
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,200
He's got a jacket.

1192
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,480
He's got kind of like a futurey.

1193
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,080
It's like a white outfit.

1194
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,080
Yeah, jacket.

1195
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,480
Kind of like Han Solo too.

1196
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,800
This ride has a Han Solo.

1197
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:53,120
So maybe you got to give it points over Star Tours, none of which have ever had a Han Solo.

1198
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,120
Right.

1199
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,120
He's never appeared.

1200
00:53:55,120 --> 00:54:00,120
Poe appears on Star Tours now.

1201
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,360
And Finn as well.

1202
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,640
But yeah, they've never, for some reason, they can't get Harrison Ford to do a cameo.

1203
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,680
I mean, as a kid, I was like, where's the gang?

1204
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,680
Where are the keywords?

1205
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,680
Yeah.

1206
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,280
Well, and with Rise of the Resistance now, like it's part of the design of it.

1207
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,280
The gang will be there.

1208
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,280
Yes.

1209
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,280
And the contracts is the other thing it's a part of.

1210
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,280
Yeah.

1211
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,240
The gang showed up for like premieres and stuff.

1212
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:33,800
Those photos of Disney and James Studios where like very awkwardly styled Mark Hamill and

1213
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,280
Carrie Fisher show.

1214
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,520
Like, Mark Hamill looks like it's like a weird like buzz cut.

1215
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,000
He looks like full metal jacket.

1216
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,520
He looks like really agitated.

1217
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,320
He had some interesting 90s looks, I feel like, when you go and watch Mark Hamill on

1218
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,320
like talk shows.

1219
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,320
Yeah.

1220
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,240
Sometimes, yeah, you go, oh, he's really going for like a cool like kind of look here.

1221
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,240
Yeah.

1222
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,240
Like Harrison is never really.

1223
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
Doesn't experiment.

1224
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,240
Doesn't experiment as much.

1225
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,240
Yeah.

1226
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,000
With cool looks or with being part of things if he doesn't have to.

1227
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
That's true.

1228
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah.

1229
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Which is good.

1230
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It's cool.

1231
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Calista.

1232
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
There's a new ride we got to go to.

1233
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I got a bang on his ship.

1234
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Got to go to Anaheim.

1235
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,520
Well, he saves all his energy.

1236
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,480
He saves up his energy for their big couples costumes.

1237
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,480
If you've seen their Halloween.

1238
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,480
Yeah, that's right.

1239
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,480
They're always something silly at Halloween.

1240
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,480
Yeah, they're always.

1241
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,280
Yeah, they have couples costumes and they're always bringing like two bottles of nice wine.

1242
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,560
And it's like, you know what?

1243
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,560
I bet they're fun.

1244
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,760
I bet they're fun to hang out with.

1245
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,120
I hope they're back at it.

1246
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,120
That'll be also a sign that things are on the mend.

1247
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,080
I want to see their costume this year.

1248
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,000
Indiana Jones 5 starts recording.

1249
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,480
Goes behind the lens, whatever they call it.

1250
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,840
Lensing, lensing soon.

1251
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,840
So hopefully he'll...

1252
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,840
The variety languages.

1253
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,840
He can come back.

1254
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,840
Yeah.

1255
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:59,000
But we have these characters on Body Wars have not been remembered as fondly.

1256
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,640
There's not a, there's a fan culture surrounding Buzzy.

1257
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,480
There's obviously the robot butler horizons, all that stuff.

1258
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,480
These characters, I don't, I've never seen a single person online like mythologizing

1259
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,680
them or mourning the loss.

1260
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,680
Yeah.

1261
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,680
Yeah.

1262
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,680
One of them doesn't really have a name.

1263
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,320
One of them's just Mission Control Officer.

1264
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,320
Yeah.

1265
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,320
So nobody's really thinking about Mission Control Officer.

1266
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,320
Yeah.

1267
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,400
I mean, like, I mean, dinosaur's still around, but I've seen people talk about dinos, the

1268
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,840
characters on dinosaur and all, like I'm trying to think, is there, is there another big ride

1269
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:37,880
that has been like, there's no affection for it ever anywhere online in the sense that

1270
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,200
like people are not like, oh, I like, I like those characters in the, in the pre-show.

1271
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,280
I don't think you get to know them.

1272
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,920
I don't think there's really like a moment that tells you who they are.

1273
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,320
Braddock is confident.

1274
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,160
Cynthia Lair is also confident.

1275
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,160
Yes, sure.

1276
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,160
Professional.

1277
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,880
But similarly, but different.

1278
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,800
She's professional.

1279
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,800
Can these two ever make this expedition work?

1280
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,800
It's missing.

1281
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,360
I guess, I guess maybe what I'm getting is like there's missing, there's missing some

1282
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,600
Disney fun with the characters.

1283
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Yeah.

1284
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,600
Very clinical, right?

1285
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,600
Very clinical.

1286
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,280
The actors are all doing a good job.

1287
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
Yeah, yeah.

1288
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,160
What their characters need to do.

1289
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,320
And I don't know if that's a Nimoy choice, because Nimoy, you know, the cast of Star

1290
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,760
Trek were all very specific characters, you know, like, I don't know.

1291
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,280
I don't know if Nimoy choice, maybe you just wanted to get this thing done.

1292
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,480
Everybody just would deliver the lie.

1293
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,560
I don't know what exactly, because like a lot of stuff, you know, is weird as Epcot is

1294
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:42,040
and was more so was, there's still always like little pieces of fun, but this, this

1295
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,800
is missing like that fun thing in it.

1296
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,320
Little bit.

1297
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,320
Yeah, yeah.

1298
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:53,040
And it doesn't maybe compare too favorably to the similar ride Star Tours that would

1299
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,400
open two months later.

1300
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,280
You know, Jason, you said the gang's not there, but hey, C3PO and R2D2R, you get, you know,

1301
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,120
I think there's a really like strong contrast when you look at the pre-ride videos where

1302
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,440
they take you through almost all the same steps that you can't smoke and you can't

1303
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,480
take pictures and you know, how to buckle in your seatbelt.

1304
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,160
In the Star Tours pre-ride video, there's a bunch of kooky creatures and even if it's

1305
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,360
just a human, they're wearing a weird cloak.

1306
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,360
Yes.

1307
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,480
There's like, there's even characters you know, right?

1308
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,840
Chewbacca's in there.

1309
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,280
Yeah, there's one robot in the pre-show when they're loading in.

1310
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,800
There's like a metal thing that gets loaded into the, on the pre-show in the back.

1311
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,040
Well, I looked, I rewatched that a couple of times.

1312
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,040
That looks like someone wearing Wayne Zelinski's hat from Honey, I Shrunk the Kid.

1313
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,640
Oh yeah, weird.

1314
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:47,200
They put it under the chair and I'm like, is that an Easter egg or were they just like...

1315
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Oh, interesting.

1316
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,400
Okay, so I thought that was some, maybe some like hybrid android character, but no, it

1317
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,400
was not nearly as fun.

1318
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,280
It was just a man wearing a metal hat.

1319
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,640
I don't, I think they were a little canny about like referencing stuff back then, but

1320
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,560
that feels like a very modern thing to put in like a nod or an Easter egg.

1321
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:09,320
Because I mean, the kid puts an Epcot like souvenir bag under his seat and then that

1322
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,120
you see the helmet with arms.

1323
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,400
Which shows you that it's modern times, I guess, or that it was in 89.

1324
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,400
Yeah.

1325
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,040
Because the current, and that this lab is at Epcot.

1326
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,080
You're not going to another world.

1327
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,080
Right.

1328
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:27,240
It's really, like if this was a ride and they like, where we were just like at an observation

1329
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,000
deck during a surgery, I get the clinicalness of it.

1330
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,120
But this doesn't, being shrunk does not exist.

1331
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,120
It's not real.

1332
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,160
I don't even think anyone's working on it to be fair, to be honest.

1333
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:43,720
I don't think this is, I think we'll be, I don't think anyone's thinking about shrinking

1334
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,720
things right now.

1335
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:51,320
I think we're, I'm sure there are people working on teleportation, going to other dimensions,

1336
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,320
fast space travel.

1337
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,520
I don't think anyone's working on shrinking experiments.

1338
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:02,440
So it is weird that it's lacking the fun whimsy of a goofy premise like this.

1339
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,120
Or like a, you know, that like a biff comes in and like knocks over something and then

1340
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,200
ends up shrunken and we got to go rescue him.

1341
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:18,120
There's basically no fun or problem until midway through the actual ride, you know?

1342
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,240
Like the conflict doesn't set in for a little bit.

1343
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:27,400
And even then it's charging a tiny ship battery.

1344
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,680
Like a microscopic battery.

1345
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:34,320
And like what she's investigating that like the patient, like everyone's very calm because

1346
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:40,920
it's like, well, I guess the worst that could happen is the ship expands inside, when it's

1347
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,040
inside this guy.

1348
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,280
And then you get into like Cronenberg and body horror.

1349
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,440
But like he's pretty calm because they're just kind of checking out a splinter.

1350
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,120
Yeah, they don't even put the guy under.

1351
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:58,480
This is a kind of, the processes they do, because it's not like, again, if you haven't

1352
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,600
been on this ride, we're not saving a life.

1353
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:07,360
We're not going in to like do heart surgery with like guns in the front of the ship.

1354
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,040
It is just to check out stuff.

1355
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,040
We're just going to see.

1356
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,600
So like they don't have to put, the guy doesn't go down.

1357
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,400
He's just awake while tiny ship is beamed into his arm.

1358
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,640
Yeah, like I would, it would make more sense.

1359
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,720
I have not watched it yet.

1360
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,240
Scott mentioned a King Kong movie where he has open heart surgery.

1361
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,240
Oh yeah, yeah.

1362
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,240
He has a heart transplant.

1363
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,440
They put a big mechanical heart.

1364
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,480
That makes sense.

1365
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,560
If we were trying to operate on a giant ape and it was like, you know what, we have a

1366
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,320
ship, let's just send a ship in his bloodstream and let's like go that way.

1367
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:42,160
That makes more sense to me than the logic of let's figure out shrinking technology to

1368
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,440
go into the body.

1369
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,920
Like that doesn't, it's so crazy that it should be fun.

1370
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,280
I guess really, I guess I'm restating what I'm saying.

1371
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,280
Yeah.

1372
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,320
Well, I think the thing that's missing from this that that Kong movie may have had, that's

1373
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,920
not the Jeff Bridges one.

1374
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,920
That's the one.

1375
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,920
It's a follow up.

1376
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,360
It's like probably the same suit is being used.

1377
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:02,280
So it's still Dino De Laurentiis, I think still had the right.

1378
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,280
And that's what's missing.

1379
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,280
You don't have Dino going nuts.

1380
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:10,280
Well, Kong gets a, can I, spoiler alert, Godzilla Kong.

1381
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,280
Have you guys seen it?

1382
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,280
I have, and I have a lot to say.

1383
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,280
Oh, you haven't watched it?

1384
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,280
Am I allowed to spoil a little something?

1385
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,280
Yeah, I probably will not.

1386
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,280
Oh, you should watch it.

1387
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,280
It's very fun.

1388
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,280
Okay.

1389
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,280
It's like a big, it's a big wrestling match.

1390
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,280
It's pretty fun.

1391
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,280
Rebecca Hall, is that who the one scientist was?

1392
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,280
I don't know.

1393
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,280
I don't know a single actor in it.

1394
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,200
I thought she was terrific.

1395
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,200
Kyle Chandler's in it.

1396
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,200
Kyle Chandler's in it.

1397
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,520
I was there for the fights, for the animal fights, but there's a scene where Kong, they

1398
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,200
have to get Kong's heart working again.

1399
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,200
Oh, great.

1400
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,200
Yes.

1401
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,960
And, and I, watching Kong Godzilla, I was like, this, whoever put this together knows

1402
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,160
how to play with toys.

1403
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,960
This is, this was my thought processes or put together like fights.

1404
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,240
There's a lot of like wrestling style moves between the two of them that are fun.

1405
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,800
And then I saw a guy named, what is it, Adam Wingard?

1406
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,800
Wingward?

1407
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,320
I forget exactly how to, that's close.

1408
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,320
I'm like 80%.

1409
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:05,760
And then in HBO Max, it says like, which, which movies were inspiring Adam to like,

1410
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,760
what are his favorite movies?

1411
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,320
And the first two were like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Behind the Candle Abra.

1412
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,080
And I was like, this is my guy.

1413
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,080
Oh yeah.

1414
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,080
Yeah.

1415
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,080
I know you might be getting me on board now.

1416
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,560
And that one shot from Back to the Future, the Ride.

1417
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,560
I think we were talking about a lot.

1418
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,560
Yes.

1419
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,560
And yes.

1420
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,440
And he also mentions in an interview that the ride vehicle is very much Back to the

1421
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,240
Future, the ride, like inspired.

1422
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,240
That's cool.

1423
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,240
Okay.

1424
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:34,040
So the whole thing feels like Martin Scorsese was talking about theme park rides as movies.

1425
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,880
And I totally agree with him, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.

1426
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,960
No, that's where I lose.

1427
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,560
I get what he's saying, but it's like, how's that an insult?

1428
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,040
You're saying the best comparison.

1429
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,040
Yeah.

1430
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,000
If he's right, like there should be more like different movies and interesting movies.

1431
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm totally for that.

1432
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,040
Also theme park rides are usually like tight, you know what I mean?

1433
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,040
In and out.

1434
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,480
Not two hours, 20 minutes.

1435
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,480
Yes, exactly.

1436
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,840
I wish the movies he's complaining about were tight like rides.

1437
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,640
But one of the two stars of this movie, one of the two name stars in this movie gets a

1438
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,920
magical McGuffin halfway through.

1439
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,920
And that's kind of important.

1440
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,920
Oh, there's so much fun.

1441
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,920
I really like it.

1442
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,840
There's a whole spoiler alert, Hollow Earth section where there's like, he's jumping around

1443
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,640
and it seems like Mario Galaxy Kong has jumped.

1444
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,440
And I was like, the whole thing, you don't think too much about it.

1445
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,620
It's real fun.

1446
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,720
It feels just like you're playing with toys.

1447
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,200
I like the Monarch organ.

1448
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,840
Did you like it?

1449
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
Huh?

1450
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,840
I did like it.

1451
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,200
But I was like, oh, they even the playing field because one of these guys, one of these

1452
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:35,080
guys has more innate abilities and the other one gets a damn weapon.

1453
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,240
Well, I think what happens is I don't want to get a whole thing.

1454
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:44,160
I think because they have to make a deal between the company that owns Godzilla and Kong.

1455
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,160
So they have to make...

1456
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,160
Companies own them?

1457
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,040
Well, Legendary has like the rights to make them in America.

1458
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,040
Oh, not in the real movie.

1459
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,480
I don't even know if they're in the film.

1460
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,480
They're owned by the company, the Monsters.

1461
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,480
Well, kind of.

1462
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,560
There's a little bit of like creepy startup guy.

1463
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:04,600
I mean, the real, the lesson of the movie is the real winner is the friends we made

1464
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,600
along the way.

1465
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,040
There's a lot of movies.

1466
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:13,240
But I think there's a negotiation along the lines of like, you know, when two big famous

1467
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,640
action heroes are in a movie and they can't lose.

1468
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:19,440
You've heard rumors of like the Rock can't lose in a movie or like...

1469
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:20,840
Oh, yes.

1470
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,200
And the other people, other actors, I've heard for sure that's the case.

1471
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,720
I can't look bad in a movie.

1472
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,520
So I think there's a negotiation of like who could look better, which monster could look

1473
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,840
better.

1474
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,200
So I won't spoil any more past this, but I think you watching and I go, OK, I see what

1475
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,640
happened here.

1476
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:43,560
They let that one win basically, but this one got to do a cool thing at the end.

1477
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,760
There's some very fun stuff in the movie and multiple people have called out like within

1478
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:53,480
the first 15 minutes, a character just with with no shaken confidence just goes like,

1479
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:58,200
well, there can only only one alpha Titan can can be at any given time.

1480
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,600
And it's like, of course, I agree.

1481
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
We all know this.

1482
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,600
Only one alpha Titan.

1483
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,600
Sure.

1484
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,600
Yes.

1485
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,600
The rules.

1486
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,600
Yeah.

1487
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,600
Guys, we're not talking about things.

1488
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,440
We're talking about the tiniest things.

1489
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,760
We're not the tiniest chips.

1490
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,080
But we want like Mr. DNA or something to show up like we would.

1491
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,080
That would help.

1492
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,080
Yeah.

1493
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:22,280
A talking white blood, a talking red blood cell, white blood cell that like are taking

1494
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,320
us on the journey or something.

1495
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,320
What is that?

1496
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,760
I didn't say we were talking about like when you imagine the star tours pre ride, we're

1497
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,200
like, here comes the monsters.

1498
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,480
They're walking into the ship in this one.

1499
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,960
It's a bunch of scientists.

1500
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,960
Yeah.

1501
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,200
Which has its own joy to it.

1502
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:43,680
But like, wow, 40 scientists, scientists and a handful of tourists.

1503
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,680
Yeah.

1504
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,680
Yeah.

1505
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,680
One figment hat, which is nice.

1506
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,280
Nice to see that figment hat.

1507
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,280
Right.

1508
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,640
But yeah, it would be I mean, I don't think when the pandemic started, I don't think any

1509
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,960
of the people's solution was like, let's shrink things and go into each person's body and

1510
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,800
get rid of that spiked protein that attaches itself.

1511
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,960
Sounds like a quadrant that's wide open for disruption.

1512
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,960
Am I right?

1513
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,960
Yeah, you're going to turn it turtle.

1514
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,960
Turning it turtle.

1515
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:14,760
Well, why would this all could have been happened sooner, I think, if we'd just gotten a little

1516
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,480
ship in there and gotten our Cynthia layers.

1517
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,480
Yeah.

1518
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:25,080
Gotten Fauci and the like the less good, the one who didn't object to the bleach strongly

1519
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,080
enough.

1520
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,080
But she's fine still.

1521
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,080
Yeah.

1522
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,080
Yeah.

1523
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,080
Dr. Birx.

1524
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,080
Yeah.

1525
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,080
Get them all on a ship.

1526
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,080
Load up a ship.

1527
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,080
It's got to be 40 scientists.

1528
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,080
You definitely cannot just have one or two.

1529
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,960
You need 40 scientists all to be shrunk and a couple of tourists for fun.

1530
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,000
I would like to start a QAnon conspiracy theory that that is actually what the vaccine is.

1531
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,320
That sends a little vehicle into your bloodstream.

1532
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,680
I don't think you'd have to reach very far to convince some people.

1533
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,680
That is the case.

1534
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,680
Oh my God.

1535
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,480
You could like take footage from this ride.

1536
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,600
Like still like, look, look, the ship.

1537
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,600
You could see it.

1538
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,940
And they're sending it right into the elbow.

1539
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:06,080
And that's what and then look, here's POV of it swimming around and it's in the lungs.

1540
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,080
Now it's in the brain.

1541
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,080
This is what's happening.

1542
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:14,740
They're putting, they just laid the, it just shot a tracker into that spine.

1543
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,740
It's not yet.

1544
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,740
It's not a microchip.

1545
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:20,280
It's a little vehicle with a man named Braddock and they're sending that into each person.

1546
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,640
And they're sending it in and Hollywood's in on it.

1547
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:27,480
You know, there's this first off, Nimoy's in on it.

1548
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,140
This goes very deep.

1549
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,880
That doctor is not a doctor.

1550
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,520
It's acclaimed actor, Academy Award winner Elizabeth Shue.

1551
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,800
And now she's on an Amazon show called The Boys.

1552
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,400
Jeff Bezos knows Bill Gates.

1553
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,240
Divorced club.

1554
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,240
It's all connected.

1555
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,760
Disney, Iger, they're all in it together.

1556
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,040
Disney knows new Steve Jobs.

1557
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,920
They're all, it's all combining.

1558
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,560
When Leonard Nimoy was dying, Bill Gates was at his bedside.

1559
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,720
Nimoy put his hands on Bill Gates' face and said, remember.

1560
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,120
And he mind melded with Bill Gates and put his consciousness like at the end of Star

1561
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,440
Trek Wrath of Khan.

1562
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,920
So Bill Gates has the information in his head that Nimoy gave him.

1563
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,320
So that's exactly how this whole thing got together.

1564
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,720
That's a very good reference to Star Trek movie.

1565
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,600
I just want to put that out there in case you don't know.

1566
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,800
And the Bezos, you can see it, it's right in front of us now.

1567
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:21,320
The Bezos super yacht with the second yacht that's a support yacht.

1568
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,440
They shrink the support yacht goes in his body when he gets sick.

1569
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,440
That's right.

1570
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,280
There's all of these yachts and those can be off at sea.

1571
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,520
I think that maybe they do the shrinking at sea.

1572
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,680
You maybe don't notice like a yacht going off the grid.

1573
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,960
Like it's off on an expedition and when it's off it shrinks and then it ends up in a body.

1574
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,040
Now look at the yacht.

1575
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:46,200
Now look at the footage of this body wars and they show you four maquettes of the unmanned

1576
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:51,040
early iterations of the shrinking ships.

1577
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,040
They do have maquettes.

1578
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,760
They do have cool looking maquettes, which I don't think they really monetize because

1579
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,280
I did look on eBay and there's not a lot of body wars merch besides some pins.

1580
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:06,240
It probably doesn't help there was a toy line called body wars from the mid 90s.

1581
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,240
Oh no.

1582
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,240
That took it out and muddied the waters?

1583
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,000
Yeah kind of like was it mad balls or like kind of.

1584
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Mad balls yeah.

1585
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah kind of.

1586
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,440
An unrelated toy line?

1587
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,200
An unrelated toy line.

1588
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,360
But it wasn't a TV show?

1589
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,040
I don't know if it was a TV show.

1590
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,920
It seems mostly sat around like gruesome looking cartoony eyes.

1591
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:32,720
That was an 80s and 90s like craze of like gruesome eyes you could buy for your children.

1592
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,040
Gross pussy eyes.

1593
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:38,680
It's in the realm of like Nickelodeon gack and slime and then companies were like kids

1594
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,280
like this make it uglier make it extreme.

1595
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,680
Yeah gross kids love gross.

1596
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:46,200
Which again maybe so maybe this ride you got to lean into the grossness like what it should

1597
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:51,480
be is going to see like the grossest things in the body going to see the spleen or anything

1598
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,360
that's like I don't know what would be gross to look at.

1599
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,400
If you went to see if you could see an appendix burst.

1600
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,040
Oh yeah that would be gross.

1601
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,040
Yeah sure.

1602
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:06,200
It might be upsetting potentially but maybe the young boys at Disney World are excited.

1603
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,200
They love that.

1604
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,200
Ew.

1605
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:13,120
A thing I was terrified of as a child often used as a plot device in television movies.

1606
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,120
Oh appendicitis.

1607
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,120
Appendicitis appendix bursting.

1608
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,120
Yes I was too.

1609
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:22,600
Consoles I was waiting for like well your tonsils are gonna they're toast they're gonna put

1610
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,880
you under slice you open and then you will get to eat ice cream for a few days.

1611
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,880
I was like oh okay well.

1612
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,880
And you were like praying for to get your tonsils out.

1613
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,480
Kind of but I was also like well I do that already anyway why is this such a treat.

1614
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,680
I don't pay for my ice cream it just shows up when I need it.

1615
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,320
So yeah I need to be in a room that's not my room to have it.

1616
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,720
Yeah in reality children's television like anything is usually written by 30 and 40 year

1617
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:51,280
olds who were like remembering their childhoods and it's like well ice cream used to be much

1618
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,760
rarer back in the day.

1619
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,760
Sad to think about huh.

1620
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,760
Don't get me started.

1621
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:05,280
But no well you also you know over at Cranium Command you're getting some gross out you're

1622
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,760
seeing George Wint operating the stomach.

1623
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,760
Right.

1624
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,000
You know like it's all building up like bile and you got some you know some stuff he doesn't

1625
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,440
know how to process.

1626
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,800
This is it focuses they had to pick different things.

1627
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:22,400
So we end up in the brain again but this is a realistic brain it's not a brain with a

1628
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,840
John Lovitz and a Charles Groton.

1629
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,960
Yes right and it's weird it's just I would think when you were designing it you would

1630
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,680
be like let the brain talk or something like let's get a little something in there but

1631
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,960
yeah you end up.

1632
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:39,840
It may be I'm trying to think of like what's the both of the benefits of the you know it

1633
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,560
is in keeping with Epcot the more educational nature of things.

1634
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,640
And I feel like this did at least lay out for me.

1635
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:49,120
No I think I now I get the concept of white blood cells.

1636
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:54,040
Right I see that they are like they're kind of like I was going to say the storm troopers

1637
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,760
except those are bad.

1638
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,200
They're like X-wings.

1639
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:04,160
Yes yeah they're like little X-wings that go it's swooping to solve problems in the

1640
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,680
body.

1641
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:10,440
Like it is interesting to see because so again the whole premise like this guy's got a splinter

1642
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,560
pretty harmless thing.

1643
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,920
Let's go check it out and see what that's like if you're very small and how the white

1644
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,560
blood cells respond to it.

1645
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,560
And that's kind of interesting.

1646
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,120
I don't think I did realize that about my body something that's in there that shouldn't

1647
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:26,280
be and here are these little these little hero helpers come in and swoop in and start

1648
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,800
and just kind of then I don't really get what they do.

1649
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,400
They just kind of start like gooing onto the wood and somehow that eventually makes the

1650
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
wood go away.

1651
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,920
I agree with what you're saying.

1652
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,920
I just you know I can't can't they talk to me.

1653
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,520
Let them talk to me and tell like that's all I'm like little I was going to say like what

1654
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:51,200
would be a name like like Whitey I guess like like that seems weird but there's bloody

1655
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:56,400
bloody like little bloody is going to tell you what's going to come on.

1656
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,960
I want to get this water out of here.

1657
01:13:58,960 --> 01:13:59,960
Follow me.

1658
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,120
And you're like yeah now I'm learning and I have a new friend.

1659
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,280
Yeah yeah no bloody.

1660
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,280
That's Dr. Elizabeth layer.

1661
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:13,240
Cynthia layers is the layer you're thinking of the shoe the actress portraying her Jason.

1662
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,320
What are you.

1663
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,120
She was she's an unknown entity in this body.

1664
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,120
I'm sorry.

1665
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,120
Yeah.

1666
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,120
What else.

1667
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,120
Let's go find something else to fuck up.

1668
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,120
Let's go.

1669
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,120
What can I kill today.

1670
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,120
I'm bloody.

1671
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,120
My name's bloody.

1672
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,120
Num num num.

1673
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:31,280
I'm the I'm the vandal of the body.

1674
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,280
I messed stuff up.

1675
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:39,320
Marty's player was very clearly concerned about this pavilion so he didn't need a bloody on

1676
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,400
it so you didn't need to worry about bloody getting up to this.

1677
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,200
He was concerned about like you can tell the way he talks about it.

1678
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:50,520
He was very excited to make this pavilion and kind of spearheaded but also like we don't

1679
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,880
want people coming after us for our choices in this pavilion.

1680
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:01,440
Yeah yeah they were even they were being careful I guess for a lot of reasons.

1681
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:05,880
It would if this was done now would it be more of like a Millennium Falcon situation

1682
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,120
where we could control it.

1683
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,880
You know we're like it was more like.

1684
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,440
Well but then you just immediately create like if you let an anti-vaxxer pilot it they

1685
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:18,360
just like don't touch the controls.

1686
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,160
I'm not going to be any part of this.

1687
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,360
I'm not getting any coaxium.

1688
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,920
I'm not getting that splinter out.

1689
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,120
I'm not.

1690
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,480
Get the white blood cells.

1691
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,440
God is going to take care of it not us.

1692
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,160
God wants me to have this splinter.

1693
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,640
There's a reason it's in here.

1694
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,080
I let all my splinters stay inside me.

1695
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:42,520
The apple cider vinegar cannon is doing nothing.

1696
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:49,080
It is really funny so the whole the mission is to see what white blood cells do and how

1697
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,160
they help when there is a problem in the body.

1698
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:58,320
But then what is it that like it's that Elizabeth Shue gets pulled into the bloodstream like

1699
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,240
she's just floating calmly.

1700
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,720
The splinter cracks.

1701
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,200
Oh that's why.

1702
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,040
Like there's like a change in the flow of everything.

1703
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,720
It kind of knocks her off and then the white blood cells go after her.

1704
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,280
Okay okay and assume that she's a problem.

1705
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,560
She's a foreign object which she is.

1706
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,560
As are we the ship.

1707
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,560
I mean they could be.

1708
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,560
Why don't they attack us?

1709
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:24,400
That's a good point too because they do go after her.

1710
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:29,640
And also one of the other big things you're going to observe the white blood cells and

1711
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,920
you also got to give her a ride.

1712
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,360
Like hey man can you pick me up from the splinter site in the bloodstream?

1713
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:43,320
I guess while I'm in the neighborhood.

1714
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,060
You owe me one layer.

1715
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:48,680
Also in canon there's four other three other vehicles.

1716
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:54,680
Zulu 174, Sierra 657, Foxtrot 817, Charlie 218.

1717
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,760
Couldn't one of them gone in and given you a jump?

1718
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,520
Oh yeah sure.

1719
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,840
Oh yeah just beam one of those in quickly.

1720
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,840
Yeah.

1721
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,880
Yeah and bump you.

1722
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,080
Like just get to that before back to the future.

1723
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,160
I guess it's like you know the right stuff kind of.

1724
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:18,000
The pilots who are pushing the limits of fighter jets and the sound barrier and stuff.

1725
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Experimenting yeah.

1726
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,520
This is a new area of science so let's be bold.

1727
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,600
So she gets yanked.

1728
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:29,400
I think she yells I'm getting pulled into a capillary.

1729
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,120
And then you got to follow her around.

1730
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:36,760
I think that's like maybe that's a stressful in terms of the nausea that like everything's

1731
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,760
pulsing.

1732
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,800
I think the sound design doesn't help things.

1733
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,320
The pulsing and the lungs.

1734
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:47,760
And it's all chaotic and you don't there's no like architecture you know.

1735
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,560
There's things in Star Tours where there's danger but you see there's a wall over here

1736
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,560
and a wall over here.

1737
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,000
But this is like gravity where it's you know the nausea that you're spinning and I don't

1738
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,160
know how to stop it or what will stop it.

1739
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:04,360
Yeah and it's all just like living like living matter.

1740
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:09,120
Like matter it's just it's not it's unnerving as well.

1741
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,040
Obviously like you're saying spinning out of control is like not good for nausea.

1742
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,840
But I do feel like you know it's nothing's like a hard line.

1743
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:16,840
Nothing's a straight line.

1744
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,320
There's something about that.

1745
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,320
Right.

1746
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,320
That makes it horrifying.

1747
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,080
It's very disorienting.

1748
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,640
I guess exciting.

1749
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:29,040
But again you know again Star Tours has the one of the most iconic scores of all time.

1750
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,040
This has no score.

1751
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,040
It has heavy breathing.

1752
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,680
It's a little tad creepy.

1753
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:34,920
Oh you love to hear it.

1754
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,520
Oh someone comes up behind you.

1755
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,520
You're not expecting it.

1756
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,520
They're breathing real heavy.

1757
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,520
Oh yeah.

1758
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:44,800
Oh man we all just did it into the microphone into our listeners AirPods.

1759
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,680
Let's do a little ASMR real quick.

1760
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,480
All three of us are going to breathe heavy into the mic.

1761
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,480
All right.

1762
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,480
For forty five seconds.

1763
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:57,280
Well it's a twenty seconds in order of the twenty seconds of footage.

1764
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,280
Twenty nine seconds.

1765
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,280
I agree to disagree.

1766
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,280
Help I'm sitting in the air I'm stuck.

1767
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:05,280
Hey I'm bloody.

1768
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,560
My name's Bloody.

1769
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,060
Come along with me.

1770
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,860
Stay away from me Bloody.

1771
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:17,900
I'm just doing a science experiment.

1772
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,900
Follow me.

1773
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,260
I'm gonna go fuck some shit up in here.

1774
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:25,020
And I'm Captain Braddock and I just love piloting.

1775
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,020
Captain Braddock you piece of shit.

1776
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,460
I'm a simple man I love my ship and I love a cold one.

1777
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,460
You don't belong here.

1778
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:34,460
You don't belong here you piece of shit.

1779
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:38,140
Let me on Braddock don't just brag about your interests.

1780
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,140
You fight me one on one.

1781
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,140
You work here to pick me up.

1782
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,140
Fight me one on one like a man.

1783
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:46,980
As a fighter pilot I was the one American plane sent to the Falklands conflict.

1784
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,740
I flew over the island a couple times and that was it.

1785
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:53,140
I don't give a shit I've been in your fighting wars my whole life.

1786
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,740
Alright fair enough I didn't think it was a contest.

1787
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:58,740
Every day is hell for me.

1788
01:19:58,740 --> 01:19:59,740
Every day is hell.

1789
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:04,740
That was the breathing and it's very realistic and I think very relaxing.

1790
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:09,260
I think we might have put people to sleep during that.

1791
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:13,060
The cutting twenty seconds of footage and putting in some quick fades.

1792
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,060
I don't know.

1793
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:18,700
I'm vaguely aware of it but yeah there were parts that were too nausea inducing and they

1794
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,700
killed it.

1795
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:26,260
They were like okay maybe if we cut some of the parts where people get the most uneasy

1796
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:34,020
and they just fade it between shots and even as a kid I was like did we go through along?

1797
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,020
Like what?

1798
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,940
I was like I don't get that.

1799
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:41,000
That doesn't happen in Star Tours but did we black out?

1800
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,600
It almost seems like you black out for a second.

1801
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,840
Like when you go into the Hollow Earth in God's Hours.

1802
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,240
Exactly yes that happens in the Hollow Earth scenes for sure.

1803
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,480
Yeah it's odd.

1804
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,480
It doesn't make sense.

1805
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,760
I'm trying to remember if I can remember a thought about it.

1806
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:01,760
I don't have a...

1807
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,640
There was a mistake in the YouTube video when I saw it but no.

1808
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,660
When rides have to be so seamless and so much effort is put into like how do we make sure

1809
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:13,900
you just move from one place to another effortlessly.

1810
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,180
Here they just put fades in.

1811
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:16,180
Yeah it just doesn't...

1812
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:21,660
I'm trying to think of another ride, modern day screen ride that has anything like that

1813
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:23,260
and I cannot come up with one.

1814
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,900
Sort of Soren in a way.

1815
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:25,900
Okay you're right Soren does.

1816
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,320
That's a choice.

1817
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,340
Even the hard cut was a choice.

1818
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,340
Yes.

1819
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:33,260
But that's early on you sort of just get used to that.

1820
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,380
So I guess yeah Soren is the one but there's no...

1821
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:39,440
None of the other ones I can think like teleport you.

1822
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,440
It is...

1823
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:46,280
Sincerely, and I did not remember this from being a kid at all how funny and confusing

1824
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,280
it is when...

1825
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,840
Sorry so we've introduced white blood cells.

1826
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,840
They're helpers.

1827
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:54,060
If there's a problem they swarm and fix the problem.

1828
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:57,120
But then yeah they think that Elizabeth's shoe is a problem.

1829
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:04,600
So then you find her cornered in a lung and then she's like trying to bat one off of her

1830
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:09,760
squid gnawing at her leg and there's kind of tentacles.

1831
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:15,840
She's being consumed by a giant white blood cell and then your ship fires lasers at it

1832
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,360
and it just sparkles away.

1833
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:22,520
Again the ride that has been very realistic and no we have to show what a cell looks like

1834
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,840
in the lung.

1835
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:29,480
Suddenly lasers zap a monster cell that's like rabid.

1836
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:33,560
You know what those lasers could have zapped?

1837
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:36,800
This big ass splinter my dad told me about.

1838
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,800
You remember that big splinter?

1839
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:43,560
Yeah wait why didn't it blast the splinter apart?

1840
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,920
If we can do that then just go do that.

1841
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,680
I guess well no it's to observe.

1842
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,520
We need to let the white blood cells do their thing.

1843
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,800
Yeah I guess there's still so much unknown.

1844
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,760
The revelation that the ship has guns.

1845
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,680
There are guns on the ship.

1846
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,520
And that would ever be a solution to an issue would be to shoot it.

1847
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:04,400
That seems a little silly too.

1848
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,680
What could be solved in the body?

1849
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:13,560
I mean in theory like boy if Met could get their act together and like shoot a tumor

1850
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:19,520
with a laser and the cure for cancer becomes little lasers then great but I don't think

1851
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,800
they're there yet.

1852
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,800
That's different.

1853
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:28,920
Yes that now if it's like a precise laser beam that could be used to slice.

1854
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,000
Now we're talking about it.

1855
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,840
But something that's going to shoot phasers like on the Starship Enterprise that seems

1856
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,840
less right.

1857
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,520
That doesn't seem exactly the correct way to do this.

1858
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,160
I get the artistic choice but.

1859
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:48,240
I just find it so funny you were told like good guys good they're good.

1860
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:52,080
The white blood cells we're going to go see how good they are being and then one is like

1861
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:57,680
one is a monster eating this like pretty movie star who we like from other things.

1862
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:00,640
And then it gets killed.

1863
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,640
There's mixed messages here.

1864
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,640
She's the invader.

1865
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,640
It's doing its job.

1866
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,560
Yeah yeah yeah no it's true.

1867
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,720
So they should have like figured out a way to get her out of there without harming the

1868
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,720
body.

1869
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:12,720
Harming the white blood cells.

1870
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,200
I know you have a lot of white blood cells but still.

1871
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,000
But now that body has one less.

1872
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:21,520
There should have been like a another foreign entity in there like another virus or something

1873
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,400
that was attacking her.

1874
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,840
And she got mixed up into that.

1875
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,840
Sure because then you're not.

1876
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:32,920
One of the socialist you know Central American presidents that Captain Braddock likely was

1877
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,960
helping to coo with this.

1878
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,960
Violate his previous career.

1879
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,280
Put some geopolitical politics.

1880
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,800
Yeah yeah right as well.

1881
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,960
You could have had another tiny ship in maybe that you were having a battle against.

1882
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:52,560
America has a miniaturization unit but then like our enemies.

1883
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,720
There's China and Russia.

1884
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,200
The Falklands have it too.

1885
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,200
I knew they'd be back.

1886
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,520
This motherfucking Falklands.

1887
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,960
But yeah it doesn't make sense.

1888
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:09,000
You're attacking the good cells but they've just made the good cells look scary.

1889
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,600
Now of course sometimes the good cells do attack our bodies and that's a problem.

1890
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,560
That's when it's malfunctioning but that's not what they're trying to showcase here.

1891
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:21,040
Well that's what I was trying to remember with this as our first post-COVID episode.

1892
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,840
Our first episode now that COVID is done.

1893
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,960
And I was trying to think of like oh yeah it's so over.

1894
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:34,760
I was trying to think like what is the crossover between things that happen in body wars and

1895
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,200
what we were all worried about happening to us.

1896
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,440
Like what is the real and I'm no scientist and I probably I think I'll screw up even

1897
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:48,520
reading my cliff notes but it is sort of like there's anyone who's a doctor or anything

1898
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,560
will think I'm being an idiot by saying any of this but like some of what happens with

1899
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:58,040
a virus like the coronavirus is turning some of our own white blood cells against us and

1900
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:04,240
sending that like sending them signals that like tell them to go attack things that are

1901
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:10,440
healthy like to go start eating up our lungs and thus we have no recourse against the virus.

1902
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:16,060
So white blood cells are like these drones that can be reprogrammed by evil entities

1903
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:19,000
like that like the coronavirus.

1904
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:25,600
Like one of those big scary with its many crowns Bowser-esque character.

1905
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,920
Right so that yes that is possible but that is not what's happening in body wars.

1906
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:36,480
Um yeah huh no because we like because we like somehow they just aren't smart enough.

1907
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:40,160
They're just trained to kill and so we see this splinter we're gonna kill it and we see

1908
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,920
it with a shoe we're gonna kill her.

1909
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:45,160
Right they're just that's a foreign as I said that foreign entity and I'm talking about

1910
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:51,400
it in medical terms that that yeah they would be getting they would be doing that they would

1911
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:56,080
be taking care of her but it feels yeah it feels like it's it's counterproductive from

1912
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,800
the lesson we're trying to learn.

1913
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,800
Yeah I think so.

1914
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:07,480
I was gonna say there's one big you know thing we haven't touched on Mike you of course have

1915
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:11,440
heard this a million times in professional wrestling there you know the term people keep

1916
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,560
using is forbidden door.

1917
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,560
Forbidden doors are open.

1918
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:20,240
I feel like the forbidden door with MetLife in the 1980s was our friend Snoopy.

1919
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,560
Oh right.

1920
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:25,120
Long time like you know who they had a relationship with.

1921
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,120
Yeah the mascot.

1922
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:31,520
Snoopy and the Peanuts gang as a mascot but Disney can't use Snoopy.

1923
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,720
Snoopy's elsewhere Snoopy's occupied at like other parks.

1924
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,320
So you're saying forbidden door.

1925
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,360
The forbidden door.

1926
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,760
For what people don't know if you don't know what's going on in wrestling Jason talking

1927
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:48,420
about the fact that the company AW is working with like the company New Japan and Impact

1928
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:54,720
Wrestling and I think believe I believe this phrase was coined by Tanahashi in New Japan

1929
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:59,080
where like the forbidden door will be open and all the companies can work together.

1930
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:03,560
And it's kind of like if like well not Marvel and DC meeting that's already happened but

1931
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:09,080
that would be like WWE and AW working together but if like DC comics started working with

1932
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:13,680
Image Comics and Fanta graphics comics and OD comics like and everyone's getting in the

1933
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,440
mix together.

1934
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:21,720
So Disney did not have that opportunity like if Snoopy was piloting your Met vehicle.

1935
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,720
Oh.

1936
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,720
Like the Red Baron.

1937
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,720
A new ship saves you.

1938
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,720
Oh the Red Baron.

1939
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:26,720
Braddock fails.

1940
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:31,160
Braddock's too busy having war flashbacks and then he did like somebody's guy and the

1941
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:35,880
ship goes down and then we get a jolt from a second ship and who's in there?

1942
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:36,880
Snoopy.

1943
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,880
Snoopy and Woodstock.

1944
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,480
Whoa yes co-pilot hopping around on a little lever.

1945
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,680
The World War One flying ace.

1946
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:46,680
That's right he was made to also a veteran Snoopy.

1947
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:47,680
Wow.

1948
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,240
Well this would have been the way to save it.

1949
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,360
Yeah open the forbidden door.

1950
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:56,280
And who is on the conveyor belt?

1951
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:57,440
Who's the patient?

1952
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,840
Why it's Spike.

1953
01:28:58,840 --> 01:28:59,840
Snoopy's.

1954
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,840
Snoopy's cousin.

1955
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:08,240
We're in Spike's disgusting body whatever he's putting into himself.

1956
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:13,480
Yeah his mustache does conduct electricity so they could have jumped it on there.

1957
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:16,840
Yeah no I mean I obviously who would have been mad at this?

1958
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,960
This would have solved it.

1959
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,400
This would have I think extended its life probably and made it much more popular.

1960
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,400
Yeah.

1961
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:29,080
Well like what I mean this might be a good candidate to plus it up which we don't always

1962
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:34,880
do but that's one and then I like I think you know it does make me wish that it was

1963
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:41,020
still there and could be reprogrammed with new missions because imagine now you go back

1964
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:45,980
to Disney World and there is a ride where you go it defeat the coronavirus and blow

1965
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:52,600
it up with lasers and stop it from from reprogramming the simple minds of white blood cells.

1966
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,600
Yes.

1967
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,540
I mean see if you could see one like sometimes you'll see like a like a silly sign at a testing

1968
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,620
place with one of those you know and they'll do it bright red and there's all the crowns.

1969
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:08,820
The amount of hate that I have for that virus and its dumb crowns those don't look good

1970
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,660
on you they're disgusting.

1971
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:16,660
If you watch that thing roll up and then you put in like a sound cue to rival the Imperial

1972
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:21,420
March like you know because that's exciting when you see the Death Star in Star Tours

1973
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:25,640
like you you John Williams does a theme for the coronavirus.

1974
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:29,920
There it is and he thinks he can destroy our ship but we're not going to let him.

1975
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:34,160
Yes I think that he would have been able to yeah adjust it to anything that's going on

1976
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,000
any different virus.

1977
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,040
Any topical virus I think that'd be very sensitive of them to any time that there's something

1978
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:45,360
raging bird flu.

1979
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:49,640
Whenever something kills half a million people or more.

1980
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:54,100
I think that as long as there's a cute character people would be on board with anything so

1981
01:30:54,560 --> 01:31:00,300
I would say yeah keep keep put bloody on on the ride and that like yeah you could do

1982
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:04,020
all sorts of weird topical stuff on body wars for sure.

1983
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:10,500
So always bloody but and then like okay so maybe coronavirus is like very realistic and

1984
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:18,720
like oozing and but it's like Tim Curry and Fern Gully like kind of like like a scary

1985
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:23,660
villain with a message and he looks disgusting but then cute little bloody is always the

1986
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:24,720
solution.

1987
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:28,220
He's rendered much more adorably than the gross coronavirus.

1988
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:35,020
Yeah yes I think you could yeah and then you could sell bloody dolls for sure that would

1989
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:40,180
that would be good and then he would be like the Shandu of the ride as well.

1990
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:42,580
And you could go eat bloody tails.

1991
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:43,580
You could.

1992
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,860
Or the nearest snack place.

1993
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:49,860
There's a new bloody cupcake.

1994
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:50,860
Fight into me.

1995
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:51,860
Fight me.

1996
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:55,060
I've got a new goo.

1997
01:31:55,060 --> 01:32:01,260
Yeah that would be yes I think that all of that would be make it much more flexible and

1998
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:06,260
make it much more appealing to children and would make it less you wouldn't want to pass

1999
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:08,140
out on the ride anymore you know.

2000
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:15,500
Would there be like but the Mortal Kombat like more moral panic of like there's blood

2001
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,500
in this game.

2002
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:19,860
It's like well Disney has introduced this bloody you know.

2003
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:23,460
Oh because of bloody the mascot or because of flying through blood.

2004
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:30,860
Do you think blood removed from violent entertainment but like blood on its own is fine.

2005
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:36,900
Like a scamp like a mysterious scamp blood is different from Mortal Kombat punch blood.

2006
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:39,300
Well I mean there were decapitations in Mortal Kombat.

2007
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:40,500
I mean I suppose that's true.

2008
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:44,860
So I think probably more clinical blood or cute blood if that's what you're asking is

2009
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:48,300
okay I think but I don't know.

2010
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,900
And then we're highlighted bloody is a white blood cell right.

2011
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:53,420
So there's a different vibe.

2012
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:55,540
He's a yeah he's a defender.

2013
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:56,860
Yeah.

2014
01:32:56,860 --> 01:33:00,100
He never sleeps.

2015
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,100
That's why his life is hell.

2016
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,540
Yeah he's been fighting an internal war.

2017
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:05,200
I don't get any breaks.

2018
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,980
My work shifts are 24 7.

2019
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:10,420
Yeah it's like you yeah he works for Amazon or something.

2020
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:11,900
It's the same thing.

2021
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:12,900
Or Tesla.

2022
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,740
Don't let me pee.

2023
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:15,740
Yeah.

2024
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:18,860
Our body look our body are their anti-union.

2025
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:19,860
Let's be honest.

2026
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,940
Really in these cells like crazy.

2027
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:25,420
Even we sleep and the body's still doing stuff.

2028
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:30,260
Yeah I guess we should take responsibility for it but yeah I can control it.

2029
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:32,420
So it's the market.

2030
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:34,220
It's just the market market is fine enough.

2031
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:39,100
Hey find another job guys.

2032
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:41,060
You don't like what being a white blood cell.

2033
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:45,700
Yeah go go work somewhere else then I guess.

2034
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:47,660
What happened to this ride.

2035
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:48,660
I mean Jason you kind of said it.

2036
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:49,660
Oh.

2037
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:51,460
They just sort of well there maybe wasn't.

2038
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:56,660
I think it came out of the gate strong and then start to a similar better ride proven

2039
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,660
ride opens.

2040
01:33:58,660 --> 01:33:59,660
Immediately deflates it.

2041
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:00,860
They have to cut parts of it.

2042
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:01,860
That's weird.

2043
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:05,060
And the whole pavilion this is a very cursed pavilion.

2044
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:11,780
What with people stealing Buzzy's clothes and and it only being only operating seasonally

2045
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:14,460
and you know a lot of people just.

2046
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:17,740
It seems like they stop running this right and you can just like walk back there whenever

2047
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:18,740
you wanted.

2048
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:21,620
There's so many YouTube videos is like so there I am.

2049
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:22,620
No one stop it.

2050
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:23,620
They don't.

2051
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:27,700
They're seeing me on the camera and they don't care like I let him screw with body wars.

2052
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:32,660
Well and then even right after it closed pretty quickly they started using as festival center

2053
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:36,700
for like the different festivals they do at Epcot.

2054
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,820
And for the first little bit they were using it.

2055
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:41,180
They hadn't taken down signage and stuff.

2056
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:45,540
There is still like the ghost remnants of this pavilion.

2057
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:49,900
But I think this is the best example because I feel like a thing that's come up when we've

2058
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:55,460
talked about the a lot of late Epcot attractions.

2059
01:34:55,460 --> 01:35:00,060
Universe of Energy horizons that sort of thing is like well you kind of got to keep updating

2060
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:02,800
the future if it's going to be the future park.

2061
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:07,860
And I think this one when we were writing about it people nailed that like well yeah

2062
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:14,820
Disney knew that but they were counting on the sponsors to fork up the money for them

2063
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:16,060
to update it.

2064
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:22,060
And I don't know if it was just naive the executives or if it was just like the post

2065
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:26,580
war like vibes of like the money trains never going to stop.

2066
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:32,300
And the companies will do what's right and fair for the things they do and their employees

2067
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,300
and they'll help us update these attractions.

2068
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:39,180
And in reality they go the contracts ending and the economy is changing.

2069
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:44,220
I think we're not going to pump thousands if not millions into these pavilions.

2070
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:46,140
Oh no no no we're done.

2071
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,460
The shrinking ride.

2072
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,460
Did we do that.

2073
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:49,460
No.

2074
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:52,740
All different people work at the company at this point and they're like what did we do.

2075
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:58,080
No the way of the 21st century is dividends and keeping shareholders happy.

2076
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,080
That's what's important.

2077
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,080
Yeah.

2078
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:06,200
Like whoever like approved the MetLife messaging in this ride was fired years ago.

2079
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,200
Like there's been many changeover.

2080
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,200
Right.

2081
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,720
Disney doesn't even have anyone's phone number at MetLife anymore.

2082
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,840
Who is our contact?

2083
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,360
Yeah they're gone.

2084
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:19,440
Yeah MetLife has torched their own blimp for like a little like well we had a line

2085
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:24,800
item on an Excel sheet that we had to fix that column.

2086
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,600
Yeah it's such like a whimper of a thing.

2087
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,320
There was no like controlled demolition of the ride.

2088
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,840
It's just like it closes.

2089
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:34,840
It's been sitting there.

2090
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,160
It's still kind of sitting there.

2091
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,240
The simulators have been taken apart.

2092
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:44,280
Yeah the rumor that's out there is that these are just this is just a scrap yard for Star

2093
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,960
Tours simulators.

2094
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,760
So something breaks in one of those simulators.

2095
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,080
Hey head over to Body Wars go grab a Russell.

2096
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,080
Just yank it off.

2097
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:56,080
Well in a warehouse too because the rooms are empty.

2098
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,400
Yeah the simulators have been moved.

2099
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:03,200
But yes their simulators yes the rumor is that just like the pieces have come off each

2100
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,200
one.

2101
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,200
Yeah.

2102
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,200
Wow.

2103
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,280
And it's like yeah it's such a it would be so much better if it was like yeah they demolished

2104
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:16,400
the whole thing and a thing and sprung up in its place but it's just such a much sadder

2105
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,400
boring.

2106
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,160
It's going to be the play pavilion.

2107
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,400
We know that.

2108
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,160
But is that off or is that still on?

2109
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,640
No I think it's still happening.

2110
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:24,640
Okay.

2111
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:25,640
I think it is still happening.

2112
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:29,880
I've been really wondering if the concept of play will be something I can explore when

2113
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:30,880
I get to Epcot next time.

2114
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,320
I'm just making sure that it's going to be there.

2115
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:36,240
I love talking about play and gamifying things.

2116
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,760
It all sounds very human and natural.

2117
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:44,360
What I want to do now after the year we've had is go look at as many screens as possible.

2118
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,360
Yeah yeah.

2119
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,960
How many screens can I go stare at on my vacation?

2120
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,960
Characters I can see on my telephone.

2121
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,400
Their entire library on my telephone.

2122
01:37:54,440 --> 01:38:02,920
I want to see them on a TV screen that will be out of date in eight months.

2123
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:05,800
You could buy down the street for $150.

2124
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,800
Yeah.

2125
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,480
That doesn't have that sort of like zest that Turtle Talk with Crush has.

2126
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:15,360
I'm not as good Turtle Talk.

2127
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:16,360
If we're wrong.

2128
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:17,360
Less character.

2129
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,360
Maybe play will be good.

2130
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,120
It's just funny to me that it's like we're celebrating play.

2131
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:22,120
The concept of play.

2132
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,320
It's time to finally give play its due.

2133
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:32,120
I just love seeing my favorite siloed IP in the same space that satisfies multiple quadrants.

2134
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,520
That's what I love.

2135
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,280
I do think.

2136
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:41,680
One of my favorite things about going to the parks is that all my quadrants are satisfied.

2137
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:45,680
That's a number one thing that I find when I'm accessing a ride or an experience.

2138
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:46,680
And they're all protected.

2139
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:50,320
Were my quadrants protected and were they satisfied?

2140
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,360
All four of them.

2141
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:57,360
Something I love more than a person making six to seven figures telling me they are protecting brands.

2142
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,360
One of Mike's quadrants is failing.

2143
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:02,360
Oh no.

2144
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:03,360
Send in Captain Braddock.

2145
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,360
Send in Captain Braddock.

2146
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:07,800
Fire lasers around until the quadrant reactivates.

2147
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,400
Restart my quadrant.

2148
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,400
Jumpstart my quadrant.

2149
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,760
Like a shock paddle.

2150
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:15,760
Do we miss anything?

2151
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:20,080
So closes in 2007 and then like and it just sits there and it's weird.

2152
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,080
You know, it's a fun one to think about.

2153
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,560
Certainly we could not have done this.

2154
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:30,240
It would have been so insensitive of us to do it during the pandemic.

2155
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,320
We had to wait.

2156
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,200
I feel like something like that was in our heads.

2157
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,560
Like, well, it's a lot with doctors right now.

2158
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,760
And we can't.

2159
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,040
That would be.

2160
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,080
How many dumb rules did we have about anything?

2161
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,680
We were like, I guess we could have done this then.

2162
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:43,040
I don't know.

2163
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:46,560
We built up a lot of dumb rules around April last year.

2164
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,240
I don't remember.

2165
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:51,000
We've also talked about so many different like, oh, we should do this next.

2166
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,320
And then just have pivoted because we'll certainly do this next.

2167
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,360
We should do this next.

2168
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,360
We should do this next.

2169
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,000
Their Mortal Kombat movie is coming out.

2170
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,880
What a good tie in as if anyone cares.

2171
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,640
Everybody's thinking about Mortal Kombat.

2172
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,960
Yeah, it's Mortal Kombat mania out there.

2173
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,120
Yeah, we better.

2174
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:08,440
So now is the time to talk about a canceled stunt show.

2175
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:11,480
Yeah, I wasn't going to subscribe to their Patreon, but Mortal Kombat.

2176
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:13,960
I have Mortal Kombat fever right now.

2177
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:16,800
And I see that they've done a 90 minute episode on their Patreon.

2178
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:20,320
Now there is free testing for Mortal Kombat fever as well.

2179
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,320
Insurance or not, you know.

2180
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,080
So why not get out there and do it?

2181
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:24,400
Yeah.

2182
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:28,120
I think like, well, you know, there was a lot.

2183
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,080
You remember also in the beginning of all this, how it was like

2184
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:36,640
doctors, heroes, the medical our medical community and thank God for them.

2185
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:40,120
And if it wasn't and then quickly was like, all right, hurry up, doctors.

2186
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,240
Come on, get that vaccine to us.

2187
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:44,800
Everybody got really the hero talk style.

2188
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,040
It got very insensitive.

2189
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,040
Like people could only handle being nice for three weeks.

2190
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:52,320
There was a couple of weeks of niceness about everything and about everyone.

2191
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,720
Then it got so mean.

2192
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,280
It got like the meanest.

2193
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,080
The president went from like, I could argue the president had a better role in it.

2194
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:01,880
The president went from like empathetically saying

2195
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:05,000
we all lost a year to like you hogs take any job.

2196
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,720
OK, that's the current one.

2197
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:08,760
Yeah, the current president.

2198
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,280
Yeah. It's like, look, the company that has the presidency

2199
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,920
in both houses of Congress just got their asses worked

2200
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:19,960
by a bunch of sunburned boat guys who own failing Texas Roadhouse franchises.

2201
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,840
You hogs need to take jobs.

2202
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,720
People don't want it to work for eight dollars an hour.

2203
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:26,920
Yeah. Or like you get anyone to be a white blood cell.

2204
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,000
Yeah. And Biden had to get on TV and be like, you take your take.

2205
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,760
Actually, white blood cells like in and out.

2206
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,080
They pay very well. They get insurance.

2207
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,240
Oh, good. I'm glad. Yeah.

2208
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:37,960
But yeah, I don't know.

2209
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:39,320
But that's what we do.

2210
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:42,320
I think we wanted to wait until the job was done.

2211
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,240
The deed was done, which it's done.

2212
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:45,360
Covid's over.

2213
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,520
And now we can properly tribute the heroes like Dr.

2214
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:52,120
Cynthia Laird. Just in case anyone's listening to this after the fact

2215
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,760
that not Covid is not over.

2216
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:57,040
Yeah. What are you talking about?

2217
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,600
Just in case someone's listening. Please still be cautious.

2218
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:03,360
I got two needles in my arm, so therefore it's over.

2219
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,640
I hate it as far as I know.

2220
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:08,040
I'm trying not to think about the phrase triple mutation too much.

2221
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,720
Careful. And other countries struggling, falling apart.

2222
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:12,840
Patent law.

2223
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:16,240
Patent law. Hopefully we can get people the patents and we can waive

2224
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:18,240
those things for other countries.

2225
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:22,520
And also, there are far flung comedians that we wanted to have on the show

2226
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,480
that may require some zooming at some point.

2227
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,080
Oh, yeah, that's true. No, we're not done.

2228
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:28,320
We're not promising that.

2229
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:31,400
Yeah. But hopefully this is the shift where it is mostly.

2230
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:33,400
Yeah. Yeah. Right now, yes.

2231
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:36,520
We will be we will be together going forward,

2232
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:40,440
barring, I don't know, like, yes, somebody on Zoom.

2233
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:42,880
Here's a good question. We could we could really hash out here.

2234
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:47,280
If somebody's on Zoom in another state, will we all get together here

2235
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:50,960
or will we do the old thing and all get on Zoom?

2236
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,560
What makes more sense?

2237
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,120
Probably maybe easier to just.

2238
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:55,280
I think I agree with you.

2239
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:58,800
I think it's probably easier because like if you set up one computer

2240
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,840
and then like headphones going out and then we're all sitting on a couch

2241
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,360
like right next to each other, we look like dweebs.

2242
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:08,240
And we will look like dweebs, which believe me,

2243
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,840
that's never happened on the podcast before.

2244
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:10,880
Yeah, otherwise.

2245
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,560
Yeah. Any of the pictures we've posted.

2246
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,360
Pretty cool.

2247
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:17,280
So maybe that will have to happen if we have a guest via satellite.

2248
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,640
But yeah, but otherwise, we will be together in some fashion.

2249
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:23,280
I think this is I think this is a turn here.

2250
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:27,000
Yes. And you know, to that here, you know, talk amongst yourselves.

2251
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,360
There's something I think this is the time to do this.

2252
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:32,360
I have a little treat to celebrate being back together here.

2253
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,560
Give me one sec. Oh, sure.

2254
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,920
OK, let's quickly guess on what he's going to do.

2255
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,840
I think he's going to get in a white blood cell costume

2256
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:42,520
and come out of the house and do the voice.

2257
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:46,200
I think he doodled some storyboards or concept art for like

2258
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,800
Disney Plus series called The Doctors, where Dr.

2259
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,760
Cynthia Layar leads.

2260
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,760
Is he going to bring Ronald D.

2261
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:56,080
Moore out and say, I'm now working with him on this pitch?

2262
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:57,800
Oh, maybe.

2263
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:58,280
Is Ronald D.

2264
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:03,040
Morbin inside Scott's house for the Avatar doctors and Dr.

2265
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,280
Cynthia Layar and Ronald D.

2266
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,880
Moore is overseeing it all.

2267
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:07,760
He's kind of an advisor.

2268
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,680
You know, he's kind of the

2269
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:13,280
Ronald Moore has been babysitting Scott's child while we've been inside.

2270
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:17,240
Oh, I think it's a no, I wasn't seeing the kid, obviously.

2271
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,640
This is this is a treat.

2272
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:22,440
And it's a treat.

2273
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:25,080
Well, it is courtesy of me, but really courtesy of Jason.

2274
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:26,800
I think this seems like the place to open this.

2275
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,800
Jason was nice enough a while ago and brought over a little bit of the bubbly.

2276
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,120
And that's not just a random phrase I'm saying.

2277
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:36,520
That is the official brand of Chris Jericho's champagne.

2278
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,720
Yeah, right. Yes.

2279
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:39,560
This is the tie in.

2280
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,840
You mentioned AEW, Allie Wrestling.

2281
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,560
They are a brand.

2282
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,560
They're a sponsor of this.

2283
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,520
They made this.

2284
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,840
So, yeah, to celebrate the return.

2285
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,080
And I think the audience could feel the difference.

2286
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,440
I mean, and also to be maskless.

2287
01:44:56,440 --> 01:45:00,400
We are doing this maskless now and like, boy, to see your mouths again.

2288
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,160
This thing's popping off.

2289
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:05,000
There's as much as this this bottle is going to pop off.

2290
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:08,080
You can feel electricity.

2291
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:12,880
Chris Jericho's wife, when she was doing whatever she was doing on January 6th.

2292
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:13,960
Don't look into it.

2293
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:14,880
Don't look at it.

2294
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,160
Oh, no.

2295
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,960
I had already placed an order.

2296
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:20,320
Don't look into it.

2297
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,040
Don't look into it.

2298
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:22,760
That's all I have to say.

2299
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:23,880
Between now and then.

2300
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:29,320
Well, no, look, the important thing is the taste and the pop here.

2301
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:30,760
I'll get this right next to the mic.

2302
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:31,600
Here we go.

2303
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,840
And yeah.

2304
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:34,400
Wow.

2305
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,640
You actually know how to do that.

2306
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:37,760
I was surprised.

2307
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,080
I was worried I was going to have to work that for a while.

2308
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:46,840
And then it would be this long, boring process on the podcast, which pouring this might be.

2309
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,680
But I mean, we don't have to pour it right now, I guess.

2310
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,440
But why not?

2311
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:54,440
Sure. I mean, if you want to do some ASMR.

2312
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,640
We're doing those breathing sounds.

2313
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,640
People are going to want to hear a sip, right?

2314
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:58,680
Yeah.

2315
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:00,440
They want to hear a sip.

2316
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:02,120
Yeah, yeah.

2317
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:05,560
Yeah, Jason actually got me the same gift.

2318
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,520
I've been waiting.

2319
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:10,000
You both have gotten me bottles that I've not popped off yet.

2320
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:10,520
Oh, right.

2321
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:13,800
For saving for some sort of special occasion.

2322
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,160
But wait, I do Terra Mana, right?

2323
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:17,120
Yours is Terra Mana.

2324
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,080
I still have not had it.

2325
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,120
Rock Tequila.

2326
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:23,200
A likely future Republican candidate for president.

2327
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,600
No, no, he's a centrist, a Democrat.

2328
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,720
He's been all the road.

2329
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:30,600
Despite the fact that he spoke at the Republican Convention in 2000.

2330
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,080
Different time.

2331
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,720
The different time, Jason.

2332
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:35,640
A different time.

2333
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:36,840
Wasting a lot of time here.

2334
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:37,840
What else can we do?

2335
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:38,480
Yeah.

2336
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:42,680
Well, people are you could be patient, right?

2337
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:44,440
Yeah, they can hear they can kind of hear that bubble.

2338
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:47,880
They can hear the sounds of Jay Leno driving back and forth down the street,

2339
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,720
hoping he can get a guest spot on the show.

2340
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:50,880
Sure. Thank you.

2341
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:51,560
Thank you.

2342
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,360
I mean, I'd love to.

2343
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,480
Yeah, give a toast to Jay.

2344
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:58,400
I'd love to find the Big Dog Garage and like.

2345
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,200
We got to do an episode of the Big Dog Garage.

2346
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:01,480
Can we email somebody?

2347
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,360
We got to do that.

2348
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:03,520
It's got to be. Oh, yeah.

2349
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,240
Jay Leno's garage is an episode.

2350
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:06,480
Boy, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2351
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:07,960
No, we'll get in there.

2352
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,320
Well, lots to look forward to.

2353
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:11,080
Cheers. You survived podcast, right?

2354
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:13,360
And we survived the mostly Zoom era.

2355
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,520
That's the that's the big thing to do.

2356
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,720
Hey, we can't clink and it wouldn't anyway because they're plastic.

2357
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:24,160
But yeah, made from the same material your son is encased in right now.

2358
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2359
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:28,800
He'll be fine. He's got like another half hour of air at least.

2360
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,240
So so he'll be fine.

2361
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,040
So that gives me time to well, first of all, taste test this.

2362
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:36,040
What do we what do we think of Chris Jericho's bubbly?

2363
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,320
Well, it's not bad. It's pretty crisp.

2364
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,200
Yeah, I like it. Yeah, actually.

2365
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,200
Yeah, I don't I don't like sweet.

2366
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:47,600
It's a little apple juicy almost for me. Sure.

2367
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:50,200
For sure. Yeah, this is a little more middle of the road.

2368
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,440
So I like that. Yeah. Yeah.

2369
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:52,640
Great. Great.

2370
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:56,680
Endorse him and everything that he and his family do officially.

2371
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:04,720
I'm going to Google this later and be horrified by whatever I've said.

2372
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:12,080
But OK, so keep it tuned to this feed for more in person episodes.

2373
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:16,280
I think this is the turn and more, of course, also on the second gate

2374
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:20,600
where we've got three bonus episodes every month at Patreon.com slash podcast.

2375
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:21,440
The ride.

2376
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:23,400
Well, we did it.

2377
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:27,360
And these little bubbles will now miniaturize into our stomach.

2378
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,480
Be a fun process to watch.

2379
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:31,040
That's also a way to plus it up.

2380
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:35,640
Like, what does it look like physically to watch the inebriation process take place?

2381
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:39,440
That seems like a fun that should be at some more of an adult park or so.

2382
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,560
There should be some. That's the Epcot Festival.

2383
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:45,400
Oh, that's for the people wearing the kooky T-shirts.

2384
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:48,200
Oh, right. The drunk, the drunken shirts. Yeah.

2385
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,240
Yeah. That's for food and wine.

2386
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:53,120
And for the Food and Wine Festival should have a specific ride

2387
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,720
that would certainly plus that up. Oh, my gosh. Yeah.

2388
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,800
Or they should like on a boat, one of the boat rides, they should just like die.

2389
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:02,480
And the why can't I think of the living with the land?

2390
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:06,000
They should die the water like alcohol colored

2391
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:08,560
or just dump alcohol in there.

2392
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:11,040
And you can take a scoop out of it as you're driving.

2393
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,640
Well, you got me. I'm in now living with the land.

2394
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:16,760
Scott's favorite ride suddenly jumps from last to first.

2395
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:19,960
And in the halfway through the ride, some guys jump out.

2396
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,880
And need your help.

2397
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,840
And it's Robert Mondavi, Charles Shutter and Josh of Josh Wine.

2398
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:28,040
Oh, yeah. Josh of Josh Wine.

2399
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:30,440
Oh, I got to help Josh. I can't leave Josh hanging.

2400
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:33,240
Josh. We got to talk more about Josh.

2401
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:37,760
And I will help any any winemaker in need.

2402
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:41,600
I will be there Braddock for everyone listening.

2403
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:44,400
Be a Braddock to somebody in your life.

2404
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:48,040
If that means getting the vaccine to keep everybody safe and do it.

2405
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,880
Yes, be a Braddock and get vaccinated.

2406
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:51,800
Be a Braddock.

2407
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:53,600
Yeah. Have a Braddocky week, everyone.

2408
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,480
Bye. Goodbye.

2409
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,600
Forever.
