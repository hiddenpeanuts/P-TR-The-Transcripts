1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,000
Alrighty then, it's Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,240
My name is Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,720
Joining me as always, Scott Gardner.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,000
Smokin'.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,360
Yeah, and joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,520
Do not go in there, right?

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,600
Well, Scott said smokin', you know,

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,640
which is a mask reference.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,080
So I guess to play the pattern,

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,320
you should have done another Jim Carrey movie.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,960
God, you know what?

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,200
My brain has also been retrained to be broken in that way,

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,400
Michael, where I was doing those calculations in my head

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,520
of like, okay, should it be what?

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,800
Should it be the same Jim Carrey movie?

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,960
Should it be a different Jim Carrey movie?

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,200
Like, said, what are you gonna do?

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,520
It obviously, if I'd gone third

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,760
and had to think of a different one,

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,400
I would have said, it's okay, don't worry, Simon Birch.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,840
Everything will be fine.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I would have said, welcome to the majestic.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,560
All right.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
I have never, I don't know what,

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,600
I don't know one second of what happens in that movie.

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,160
I believe it is a blacklist, a Hollywood blacklist movie

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,760
where a man has to retreat to like a small town.

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,360
Is that Jim Carrey, he has to open up the theater,

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,200
the majestic?

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,440
I think maybe he starts working there

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,480
and he falls in love with movies all over again.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,840
That would be my guess.

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,640
So a movie that's a love letter to movies.

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,920
Pretty cool.

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,720
Usually the best, usually the best ones.

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,240
Okay.

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,120
Today is a love letter to what I think we can regard

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,280
as one of the great shows in theme park history.

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,320
We all know it.

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,440
If you're listening to this, you definitely know it

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,640
and you've been wondering when are they gonna get to it.

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,080
It's just like, how many more months do we have to wait

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,120
before they do Ace Ventura Pet Detective live in action?

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,280
Really a love letter to licensing

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,040
because Ace Ventura, not at Disney movie,

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
not a Touchstone movie, a Warner Brothers movie.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
Yes.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,040
Why was this here?

50
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
Why did it happen?

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,960
They just reached out and was like,

52
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,920
would you guys wanna do this?

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,280
Cause it opened day and date with,

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,360
well, when nature calls came out,

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,560
which was only a year after the first Ace Ventura movie.

56
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,360
Yeah, so I guess for the listeners

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,480
who might be a bit younger, Jim Carrey was a big movie star.

58
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,360
He played Dr. Robotnik in the new Sonic the Hedgehog movies

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
and he made a movie called Ace Ventura Pet Detective.

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,800
You know him as Dr. Robotnik

61
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,320
and you know him from his satirical paintings

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,840
that are saving our democracy one at a time.

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,040
Yes, you know those probably the best,

64
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,800
but he also had a bunch of movies in the nineties.

65
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
He was the biggest movie star.

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,400
We all, I assume loved him.

67
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
America loved him.

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,600
I didn't remember that

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,880
cause I watched a lot of these movies on VHS

70
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,400
because I was not allowed to see them in theaters,

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,200
but Dumb and Dumber, The Mask and Ace Ventura Pet Detective

72
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,600
all came out in the same year, 1994.

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
That's insane.

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,400
That's insane that one man had three massive hits like that

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,600
in one year.

76
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,560
Yeah, I don't know that you ever get

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,440
such an all star year ever again.

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,680
Not out of nowhere, obviously,

79
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,560
cause we knew him from living color,

80
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,160
but he had not like,

81
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,360
well, anyway, he had starred in movies secondly,

82
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,760
but they were kind of like smaller shadier movies.

83
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,520
He was in Earth Girls Are Easy,

84
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,640
which Jeff Goldblum was in.

85
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,480
Yes.

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,400
Which he played like an alien.

87
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,240
And then he was in,

88
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,720
like he played the bad guy in that Clint Eastwood,

89
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,080
is it called the Deadpool?

90
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,800
The Clint Eastwood movie called the Deadpool?

91
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,640
Right.

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,160
Oh, I don't know this at all.

93
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,760
I believe this is right.

94
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Let me just double check that.

95
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,720
It's not Deadpool.

96
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,080
It's not the Merc with the mouth.

97
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,560
It is Deadpool.

98
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,880
I got it in front of me.

99
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Yeah.

100
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,040
It's a Dirty Harry movie.

101
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,880
Yes.

102
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,720
Yes.

103
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,400
There were so many of those.

104
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
And Jim Carrey is the bad guy in it.

105
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,800
Wow.

106
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,640
Wow.

107
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,480
I believe maybe not,

108
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,400
maybe not the main bad guy,

109
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,920
but a bad guy.

110
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,720
And it's where the phrase opinions are like assholes.

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,960
Everybody has one initiated.

112
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,800
Wow.

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,640
Famous.

114
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,840
Famous line.

115
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,680
Yeah.

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,520
I don't think I knew that was a,

117
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,640
that was Clint Eastwood.

118
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,560
Hmm.

119
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,280
So yeah, Jim Carrey,

120
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,640
legendary career.

121
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,480
Yes.

122
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,760
But that's sort of in a way,

123
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,880
neither here nor there

124
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,800
cause he wasn't part of this in any way.

125
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,640
No.

126
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,480
I'm not sure he was made aware of it.

127
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,320
Yeah.

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
He is not, yeah.

129
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,400
There's no like kind of voiceover from him.

130
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,560
There's no like video before the thing even saying,

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,760
Hey, it's Jim Carrey here.

132
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,840
I'd like to welcome you to the Ace Ventura Experience

133
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,880
at Disney's Hollywood Studios.

134
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
There's none of that.

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,000
It's no, it's very lo-fi.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is very, it's like as barely there as a show can be.

137
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,080
Yeah.

138
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,920
So yeah.

139
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,080
So was there any,

140
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,720
I didn't find any like evidence that this was advertised

141
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,480
cause you would think that their idea would be,

142
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,640
okay, we need to bring in like the hottest property we can,

143
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,400
Ace Ventura.

144
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,720
But like, did they have it in commercials?

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,760
Was there a commercial saying,

146
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,320
come to Hollywood Studios to see three minutes

147
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
of an Ace Ventura show?

148
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,400
I don't think so.

149
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,240
I think this was-

150
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,160
I don't think so either.

151
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,760
I think this was just on their run of licensing stuff,

152
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,760
like the Ninja Turtles and I mean, the big ones,

153
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,560
Star Wars and the Muppets stuck around forever,

154
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,200
but the Ninja Turtles hung out for a little while.

155
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,760
I was just texting you guys about,

156
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,480
I didn't know about the Goosebumps.

157
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,240
There was a short run Goosebumps thing,

158
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,800
which is crazy that I missed that like as a kid

159
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,600
because I loved the Goosebumps books.

160
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,240
Yes, I did too.

161
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
And I had no idea.

162
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,880
There was like a little show

163
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,120
and a little walkthrough fun house.

164
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,440
That's crazy.

165
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,280
Yeah, this is hard.

166
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,120
We gotta get to that one.

167
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,640
Yeah, I think I'm only aware of that

168
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,080
because I watch all these parades all the time,

169
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,360
which I was watching one last night

170
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,880
from that era where the Ninja Turtles were around

171
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,040
and Aaron turned to me during it and was like,

172
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,000
I really hate that the Turtles are there.

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,960
Like she's a fan of the Turtles overall.

174
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,840
It's just like, I don't know,

175
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,840
them being in Disney World just bothers me.

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,080
I don't know what it is.

177
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,280
I know what she means.

178
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,080
That's certainly not my favorite iteration of Turtles anywhere.

179
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,600
All of these are sort of strange.

180
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
Then none of them feel right.

181
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,120
Was she more okay with the Universal Turtles?

182
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,280
Does she seem familiar with that?

183
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,320
Because there's not a lot of documentation of it,

184
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,880
but the like Turtle Lair that they built

185
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,160
in the parking garage at Universal?

186
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,720
I think if I had to ask her,

187
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,880
I think there's something about Universal

188
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,200
where the properties all feel like free for alls more.

189
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,040
Yeah.

190
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,880
Like you know, it's just kind of,

191
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,160
if you want to see your Disney characters,

192
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,200
you go to Disneyland.

193
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,560
If you want to see a grab bag of all the other characters

194
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,040
besides the Looney Tunes, then they'll all be at Universal.

195
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,800
Yeah, no, that makes sense.

196
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,560
I think maybe part of it is the juxtaposition

197
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,440
of the not, I guess pandering might be the word

198
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,680
of like the golden age of Hollywood, you know,

199
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,680
MGM, Disney MGM studios, Hollywood, how movies are made.

200
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,840
And then pandering stuff that we know kids like

201
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,440
the dinosaur TV show, the Turtles, Goosebumps,

202
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,520
a few years later, the Power Rangers,

203
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,680
but well after the peak.

204
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,960
Really?

205
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,240
Yeah, there were Power Rangers.

206
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,760
Because Disney owned and still,

207
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,880
I think they may have sold it.

208
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,200
Disney bought the full Saban library

209
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,720
and owned it at some point

210
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,360
because they aired on ABC family for a little while.

211
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,280
Oh, that's right.

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Right, right, right.

213
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,040
Have you guys seen the new Power Rangers?

214
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,920
Well, still still.

215
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,520
The Brian Cranston, the Brian Cranston.

216
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,280
Oh, I have not seen it.

217
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,880
I can't, I just got this check of like,

218
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,000
do I bring this up or not?

219
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,040
I have to, there's parts of it where like,

220
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,720
everybody speaks in a weird alien language.

221
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,960
Like Brian Cranston's barely in it

222
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,640
and just kind of in like weird hologram ways.

223
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,080
But he's Zordon, right?

224
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,520
He's Zordon, yeah.

225
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,120
It was just kind of this bad effect

226
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
in a tube in the TV show.

227
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,040
But now it's this really intricate,

228
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,680
but still boring CGI gloop kind of way of doing it.

229
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,600
And he does most of his dialogue in the movie

230
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,520
is not in English,

231
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,760
but through whatever alien dialect he speaks,

232
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,760
which sounds basically like,

233
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,560
ock, knock, bug, glock, ock, galock.

234
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,880
These are like deadly serious scenes in the movie

235
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,640
where all the Power Rangers are acting like they might die.

236
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,280
And then the dialogue is,

237
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,280
g'donk, glock, bug, glock, rita, balonk.

238
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,200
It's just, I don't know how this movie feels.

239
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,560
I feel like I made it up.

240
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,400
I feel like I hallucinated

241
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,240
these several years ago Power Rangers.

242
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,920
I gotta see this.

243
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,320
I can't believe I haven't watched this yet, honestly.

244
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,840
I like the first Power Rangers movie

245
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,760
because of Ivan Ooze, of course.

246
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,200
Well, and that song,

247
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,520
the Uh-Oh, We're in Trouble song rocked.

248
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,200
Yes, I like that song too.

249
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,360
Scott, you know Ivan Ooze, right?

250
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,440
I don't, I wasn't really a Power Rangers kid, so no.

251
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,680
But do you even know what he looks like?

252
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,960
No, I'll look it up now.

253
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,960
Ivan Ooze.

254
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,680
Ivan Ooze.

255
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,480
Ooh, well, yes, I'm sold pretty fast.

256
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,600
And he's like a kind of a like

257
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,440
eccentric British character actor.

258
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,320
It's like a piece of purple green goblin.

259
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,160
Yeah, exactly.

260
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,080
Very much so.

261
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,280
And then sometimes he becomes bad CGI.

262
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,040
Oh.

263
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,800
Yeah, you gotta, the Power Rangers movie

264
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,360
looks pretty good except the like

265
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,440
five minutes of like CGI stuff

266
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,600
that clearly cost a fortune and looks very rudimentary.

267
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,880
Oh, hell yes.

268
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,400
I'm seeing pictures of it.

269
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,560
Oh my God, it's so lawnmower, man.

270
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,640
It's very, it looks really a lot like Xavier Renegade Angel.

271
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,480
Yeah. Yes.

272
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,640
I've sent you a picture of Ivan Ooze and Goldar

273
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,160
with Ivan Ooze drinking like some sort of drink

274
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,360
with like steam coming out of it.

275
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,720
And then it's a signed photo from the actor,

276
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,360
Paul Freeman, who played Ivan Ooze.

277
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,520
This is great.

278
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,840
That looks like a good beverage.

279
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,320
He looks, he's got a crazy straw coming out of it.

280
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,160
Yeah.

281
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,000
So. Wow.

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,840
All right.

283
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
I love to check out Ivan Ooze.

284
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,080
I stan Ivan Ooze.

285
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,000
All right.

286
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,160
Well, probably that's the safe to say Ivan Ooze episode

287
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,760
coming once I do my homework.

288
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,120
There's in a, he's in here.

289
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,200
I'll send you another photo.

290
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,600
He dresses up.

291
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
He dresses up and he sells his Ooze at a carnival.

292
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,200
So that's like a perfect podcast to ride synergy.

293
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,280
This is him in a wizard costume.

294
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,960
He's like put some white powder over his face

295
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,080
as if in like a white chick's manner

296
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,840
to look like a regular, like a Caucasian person.

297
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,680
Yes.

298
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,520
But he didn't put enough on.

299
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,560
So it's still kind of a purple tint.

300
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,400
Yes.

301
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,520
This is amazing.

302
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,640
He sells his Ooze to children at a carnival.

303
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,680
Yeah.

304
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,640
For whatever reason in the movie,

305
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,760
like in the TV show, all of the robots,

306
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
the Megazords that the Power Rangers use

307
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,320
are all like models and costumes.

308
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,840
But in the movie, they're like, let's make these CGI.

309
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,040
And it looks, it's aged.

310
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,000
I think it looked bad a year later.

311
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,160
The designs are still fun,

312
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,200
but I have seen little clips

313
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,920
of all the Power Rangers and stuff.

314
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,760
Because when I worked at a post-production house,

315
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,280
they had all of the Saban shows in,

316
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,960
that was another thing in like six different languages.

317
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,120
Right.

318
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,940
Yeah, sure.

319
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,840
I mean, those, there's like 30 Power Rangers TV shows.

320
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,680
Yeah.

321
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,240
And I imagine that they're just repackaged

322
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,200
every single place they can be.

323
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,040
Well, they are.

324
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,480
I mean, what they do is they make a season in Japan,

325
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,000
and then they reuse a lot of that footage

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,960
and then shoot stuff.

327
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,080
I think production is in Australia or New Zealand now.

328
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,940
And then they cobble together a different storyline,

329
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,940
but still trying to make the fight footage make sense.

330
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,540
And then they make those episodes in English,

331
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,080
and then they redub those in like other languages

332
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,680
and resell those to other markets.

333
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,520
It's true.

334
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,140
Well, we'll investigate this on the I have a news episode.

335
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,980
Yeah.

336
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,340
We'll correct the process.

337
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,180
Yeah.

338
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,060
Well, it just makes you appreciate that here for America,

339
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,460
that they filmed, they didn't do it in this lazy way.

340
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,780
They gave us Cranston, they gave us Bill Hader

341
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,420
as the little stressed out robot.

342
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,900
We all know it.

343
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,980
Yeah.

344
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,900
Well, I'm actually blanking on the character's name,

345
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,840
but I do know it.

346
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,260
Yeah.

347
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,140
It's one of the great franchises.

348
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,820
I'm like hypnotized now by these CGI.

349
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,620
I can't wait to watch this.

350
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,460
Oh boy.

351
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,660
Oh, he turns, he's like, he's a bug and then turns.

352
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,500
Oh my God.

353
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,320
I can't wait.

354
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,160
Okay.

355
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay.

356
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,820
Focus on the task at hand,

357
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,780
talking about one of the worst shows.

358
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,920
I mean, this is,

359
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,940
this will be a major case of our episode length ratio

360
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,300
extending way beyond the show.

361
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,060
Cause the show is like seven minutes long, I feel like.

362
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,660
It is not a long show.

363
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,780
It is.

364
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,740
I will, you know, they do pack a few things in

365
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
that might be worth going to see, but yes,

366
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,540
it is very, very short.

367
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,180
I don't know.

368
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,220
I would say like the character of Ace Ventura

369
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,220
is pretty faithful to the Jim Carrey version

370
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,300
from the video I saw.

371
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,060
Yeah.

372
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,180
I will say that I've never seen Ace Ventura

373
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,620
look so jacked.

374
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,020
I think it's a stunt man first

375
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,420
who learned an Ace Ventura impression, I would say.

376
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,780
That's probably right.

377
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,620
Yeah.

378
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,260
It seems to be.

379
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,100
I don't know.

380
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,980
Ace is like tall and built

381
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,860
and I assume very handsome, I assume.

382
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,100
Yeah. Yeah.

383
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,340
And yeah, which is odd to see somebody,

384
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,840
like this was before all the best comedians

385
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,660
were fucking jacked.

386
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,220
Like now this is very common.

387
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,420
Of course everyone's in perfect physical condition.

388
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,140
The funniest and the most jacked at once.

389
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,140
But yeah, at the time Jim Carrey was kind of way fish

390
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,340
and sort of see this like lunk of a six foot six man

391
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,900
play Ace is a little jarring.

392
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,660
If they were, yeah, if they were to do the office again

393
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,300
today with the same cast, Rainn Wilson would be

394
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,820
about 250 pounds of pure muscle.

395
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,140
Which he might be anyway.

396
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,980
I don't know.

397
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,800
Maybe he's gotten like that.

398
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,720
I haven't seen him in a little while.

399
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,560
Well.

400
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,800
I think everyone's.

401
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,640
He's good.

402
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,560
He's very zen.

403
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,520
He harnessed the power of his mind to shape his body.

404
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah.

405
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,360
So the office, yeah, the office, I would,

406
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,520
one of the, the office is a perfect sitcom,

407
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,400
but I wish everyone was jacked.

408
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,480
I wish Stanley was jacked.

409
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,200
I wish Toby was jacked.

410
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,680
I wish they all were jacked.

411
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,320
You make a new show now and kind of the schlubby character

412
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,760
is someone who, you know, has like 3% body fat.

413
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,600
Yeah, right.

414
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,080
Yeah, exactly.

415
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,920
Yes.

416
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,680
And they can't look foolish.

417
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,200
They don't look foolish anymore

418
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
cause they're very handsome and jacked,

419
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
but every now and then they do something

420
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,600
slightly embarrassing or they say that's not even a thing.

421
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,880
And that's how you make comedy.

422
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,640
Unlike Ace Ventura kind of doing more like three stooges,

423
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,000
rework three stooges physicality.

424
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,920
Yeah.

425
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,760
No, no, no.

426
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,600
That's no good.

427
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,960
A bunch of hot people standing around and asking

428
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,680
if whatever has happened just happened.

429
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,800
Yep.

430
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,000
This is the way we let the ridiculousness,

431
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,160
when Ace put on a tutu and a Hawaiian shirt

432
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,240
and like this, that Ace Ventura was ridiculous.

433
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,800
It was random.

434
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,360
I don't get it.

435
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,200
Get it out.

436
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,200
This is not for me, previous generation comedy.

437
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,680
So I guess we should say, okay,

438
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,800
so let's give a quick brief setup of the show.

439
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,880
So there's a back lot or there used to be a back lot.

440
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,720
I don't know.

441
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,560
Is this part of the back lot still there

442
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,160
at Hollywood studios in Florida?

443
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,440
No, this is in the streets of America.

444
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,000
The facades you could walk through and around.

445
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,960
Oh, right, right.

446
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,800
Yeah.

447
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,080
And they bulldozed that pretty quickly

448
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,120
for a giant Star Wars attraction.

449
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,160
Right.

450
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah.

451
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,840
So it was basically, you know,

452
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,040
like a set with like the exterior of an apartment building

453
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,080
or whatever with fire escapes and some other things.

454
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,920
As if you were-

455
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,080
You go into an alley,

456
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,600
an alley where Ace Ventura has set up a temporary office

457
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,760
and a shed.

458
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,480
Yes, with a slide nearby.

459
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,200
With a slide, yes.

460
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,920
With a very short playground slide, yes.

461
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,600
The office shed looks pretty good.

462
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,840
That looks all right.

463
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,960
Like they built a themed shed for this.

464
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,440
So they built two whole walls for this show.

465
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,280
Two whole walls.

466
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,120
They built some photo backdrops.

467
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,720
And then they built and they put like,

468
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,760
they got like a riser and two sets of stairs

469
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,240
as the main stage.

470
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,440
They got a man, a very wide tie.

471
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,320
They got the MC, a very wide tie and a very blousy shirt.

472
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,880
How would we,

473
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,200
because Mike, as you're trying to say,

474
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,840
just the premise of the show where we got this far

475
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
that Ace Ventura has an office

476
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,240
and we're getting all this information from,

477
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,280
what is he?

478
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,440
Who is the host?

479
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,160
Why is he talking to us?

480
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,720
That's a good question.

481
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,680
He talks like a random theme park character

482
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,880
that would be on a street.

483
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,560
And that's really all I can associate him with.

484
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Maybe is it sort of creating the universe of,

485
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,040
it's like the NBC pages kind of scenario

486
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,560
where there's studio helpers around

487
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,520
and they're experts and they know everything.

488
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,960
They know what movies are filming and they can say,

489
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,920
we, they're part of the grand we.

490
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,000
Like we've been working on a lot of new productions.

491
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,560
And I guess he's kind of in that world.

492
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,400
I think that's right.

493
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,760
Ace Ventura calls him Ron right towards the end.

494
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,240
Oh, so we got a name.

495
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,160
He's Ron.

496
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,000
Ron, Ronny.

497
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,400
So Ron, the headset mic'd man tells us

498
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,840
that Ace Ventura has graciously agreed to stop by

499
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,960
and talk about his movie career.

500
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,800
Yes, which is okay.

501
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,320
So we've talked a lot about this.

502
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,280
Okay, so, but this reality is not,

503
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,200
we're shooting something for a new Ace Ventura.

504
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,920
Ace Ventura is real, but he's also an actor

505
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,240
that's in the movies, Ace Ventura.

506
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,440
So it's like he's playing himself

507
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,000
in the movies in this reality.

508
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,240
Yes.

509
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,560
Yeah, so this reality has no Jim Carrey in it.

510
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,960
Right.

511
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,360
Or it's kind of a, as he would later explore

512
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,040
a Andy Hoffman, Tony Clifton scenario

513
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,280
where the lines are blurred.

514
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,720
Is there a real Tony Clifton?

515
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,280
Is there a real Ace Ventura?

516
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,040
I see.

517
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,720
That's true.

518
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,960
I mean, if you would have kept going with this show

519
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,600
and maybe made different versions,

520
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,680
I mean, I guess there wasn't another version,

521
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
but if you made different versions,

522
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,720
they could have explored that.

523
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
But I'm not sure that was in the plan.

524
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,120
That was in the grand plan here.

525
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,000
Do you think that the six foot six stunt man

526
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,720
lived as Ace Ventura for the three straight months,

527
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,480
maybe one month?

528
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,960
How long did the show run?

529
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,920
It's unclear, I believe, how long this ran.

530
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,480
For five weeks, he lived and breathed Ace Ventura.

531
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,520
I have to imagine.

532
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,760
Yeah, he was method.

533
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,400
How else are you gonna do it?

534
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,600
How else are you gonna really know

535
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,200
to tell people to not go in there?

536
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,880
I saw on, and I don't have this source backed up

537
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,360
or anything, but I saw on WDW Magic,

538
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,920
people said that this actor was Robbie

539
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,560
from the Adventurers Club.

540
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,960
And also one of the hosts of the Hyperspace Hoopla.

541
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,680
Oh, interesting.

542
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,840
So I think he's been around a long time, if that's true.

543
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,080
And he probably is method when he's playing

544
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,440
any of these characters.

545
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,120
Whether it be Ace Ventura or Snig.

546
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Snig, he might, yeah, when he's playing Snig,

547
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,800
he's just Snig for those five weeks.

548
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,840
Yeah, I knew that Snig had to come back

549
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
and do his Hyperspace Hoopla.

550
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,600
Yeah, there should be like a making of documentary

551
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
about him getting into character as Snig

552
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,760
and how he acts when he's Snig.

553
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,960
And yes, presumably Hyperspace Hoopla,

554
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,200
like Man on the Moon,

555
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,720
is directed by a beleaguered Eastern European man.

556
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,840
I don't know what to do, I cannot deal with Snig.

557
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,680
Can you talk to Snig?

558
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,960
Please, what's his name?

559
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,080
Larry, what was the guy's name?

560
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,320
Which guy?

561
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,560
The act, do we know the name of the stunt man?

562
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,680
Or this performer?

563
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,160
Let me see, I think I had it actually.

564
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,000
I feel like you said it.

565
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,320
I have to think there.

566
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,040
Robbie, Robbie, Robbie, Robbie, you must talk to Snig.

567
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,880
I cannot deal with Snig.

568
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,320
It is Milos Forman.

569
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,200
Milos Forman direct comes,

570
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,240
he directed every Hyperspace Hoopla before his passing.

571
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,520
Yeah.

572
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,360
Robbie.

573
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,200
You did a great job.

574
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,880
Robbie, let me ask you, is Snig here with us right now?

575
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,720
Is he here, is Ace here with us?

576
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
Is that his James Lipton interview?

577
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,400
Well, yeah, they're doing a retrospective

578
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,480
of the golden years of MGM Studios.

579
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,720
It would, honestly, you just stumbled on a fantastic idea

580
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
of James Lipton interviewing some of these actors

581
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
who've played like 30 different theme park roles.

582
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,560
Oh yeah.

583
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,120
Yeah, so can you summon, you know,

584
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,120
like the silly Waterworld guy whose pants fall down?

585
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,960
Right.

586
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,800
Is he here?

587
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,200
Can we speak to him?

588
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,560
Can his pants fall down?

589
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,000
Is a recording engineer in the rock and roller coaster here,

590
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,240
the one that ushers people in and out of the recording studio?

591
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
The one that says you're going to need a bigger limo?

592
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,680
Can we talk to them, to that person?

593
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,240
One of the most challenging roles to play

594
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,880
in theme park world, absolutely.

595
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,080
Maybe we'll, yeah, we'll do that.

596
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,640
We'll have Jason host a show like that.

597
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,600
Yeah.

598
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,120
I know there's a, because you know, we've talked about,

599
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,840
there's like a scene, there's a circuit down in Orlando,

600
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,960
if people make a living just doing all these shows and stuff.

601
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,960
But I'm blanking now, Jamie Denbow,

602
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,480
I talked to her once a little about,

603
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,760
she was a citizen of Hollywood and did,

604
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,960
not adventurous club, I think did Comedy Warehouse

605
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,280
in Pleasure Island, but she said that like,

606
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,520
they had a term for people who would join the shows

607
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,640
but also did the Renaissance Fairs,

608
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,600
like in the area, like there was like,

609
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,520
not like dirt munchers, but there was a teasing term

610
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,560
they had for the people who branched out

611
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
and also did the Renaissance Fair,

612
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,440
like the dirty outdoor Renaissance Fair shows in Orlando,

613
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,040
in the Florida area.

614
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,680
Well, we got a, well, when you,

615
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,120
when she's on that version of the show I was describing,

616
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,400
we'll have to find out. Sure.

617
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,240
Yeah, yeah.

618
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,600
So, okay. Dirt munchers.

619
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,640
Dirt munchers, geez.

620
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,520
I got a, I can't remember the term, it was very funny.

621
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,800
But like, it's like anything else where you're like,

622
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,480
oh, I don't want to do improv over there.

623
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,720
I do improv over here.

624
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,520
Like, you know, that sort of

625
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,960
packing water happens everywhere.

626
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,080
I mean, I would always prefer to do anything where

627
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,000
I don't have to munch dirt.

628
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,840
Yeah.

629
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,600
And I prefer to do improv everywhere.

630
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,720
Well, right now you are allowed to do a crazy happening

631
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,720
in your living room, in your bedroom, in your bathroom.

632
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,240
Oh yeah, yeah, don't worry.

633
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,080
Yeah.

634
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,360
Wearing no pants has less of an effect

635
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,840
when you're just in your, your dwelling.

636
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,040
So, okay.

637
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,600
So have we set the scene for you vividly enough at this point?

638
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,080
There's a man on a step and he says Ace Ventura is coming.

639
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,000
And he asks if we,

640
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,360
there's any Ace Ventura fans here today?

641
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,840
And people, the 20 people go,

642
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,040
sure.

643
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,240
Okay.

644
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,440
And then he asks Ace to come out and then he doesn't.

645
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,040
So then he asks everyone to shout Ace.

646
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,080
Then you hear a crowd all go Ace.

647
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,680
And then he, and then he does come out.

648
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,920
And when, once he lands,

649
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,680
you can still hear somebody next to the camera say,

650
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,080
everybody goes, yay.

651
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,400
But one person still says Ace.

652
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,120
That's just a specific detail from the one video available.

653
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,320
Which, you know, if you want to watch it,

654
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,760
you don't really, you really don't have to.

655
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,320
I'm not sure that I recommend it,

656
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,160
but if you want to know what we're talking about,

657
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,240
wait, what is the name?

658
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,720
It's called, I mean, I guess if you just search

659
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,800
Ace Ventura Disney MGM Studios,

660
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,800
I think it's called like Ace Ventura Visits Disney MGMs.

661
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,560
Yes, Ace Ventura Visits Disney's Hollywood Studios.

662
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,720
It is nine minutes long.

663
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,800
Maybe less.

664
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,440
It's very quick.

665
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,840
It's a real easy go.

666
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,000
I would like to one day repel down a building like that.

667
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,680
That looks very fun.

668
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,520
Really?

669
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,960
You don't think that looks fun?

670
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,800
That looks fun.

671
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,620
No, I'm not saying it doesn't look fun,

672
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,440
but I don't picture you being comfortable enough

673
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,080
to repel down a building.

674
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,480
Oh, I think that many carabiners

675
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,280
and like strong cord and glute.

676
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,560
I would want some proper training first.

677
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,000
I wouldn't just do it willy nilly.

678
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,600
Wow, that's, I mean, I'd love to make this happen

679
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,320
if we have anyone out there who knows why,

680
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,000
like is into wire work and can get Jason

681
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,200
on the top of a building to repel down it.

682
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,200
You know, I like, I love heights.

683
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,040
I'm like a goat.

684
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,720
I like to be on the highest point.

685
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,220
I like to be high up.

686
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,340
Do you love heights?

687
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,360
I do, yeah.

688
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Huh.

689
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,480
You're a real height muncher.

690
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,320
Yeah.

691
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,160
You're a real.

692
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,000
You're a height.

693
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,540
Hashtag height muncher.

694
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,460
Wow, I guess I kind of knew that, but I don't know.

695
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,640
I just pictured that being such kind of an intense thing

696
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,240
that I wouldn't think that you would want to do it,

697
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,360
but all right, let's make it happen.

698
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,240
I love heights and I love enclosed spaces,

699
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,920
like little tight little, like I find it very cozy.

700
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,400
All these, these very common fears.

701
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,740
I'm like, yeah, sign me up.

702
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,120
You want to be like, your dream would be to be in a,

703
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,720
like in a giant burrito.

704
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,920
Oh, that sounds nice.

705
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,040
A burrito. Tucked away in a giant tortilla.

706
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,120
Yeah.

707
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,720
On a very high shelf.

708
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
All right, so, okay, let's make this happen.

709
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,960
Let's get you in either a tortilla costume

710
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,080
or an Ace Ventura costume and get like

711
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,160
on the Warner Brothers lot where they still have

712
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,840
these type of backlots and let's hook,

713
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
let's figure this out.

714
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,200
Getting you to repel down the side of a fake building.

715
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,600
I think we can make this happen.

716
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,440
That sounds good.

717
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,040
Once we're out of our apartments.

718
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,640
I mean, we got to, yeah, when we do a live show again,

719
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,880
we got to come out with a bang.

720
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,200
So Jason, yeah, Jason doing wire work

721
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,960
is a hell of a way to come back.

722
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,720
It sounds better than this.

723
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,240
Like there's like a trend now of like climbing gyms

724
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,060
where people are just climbing rock walls inside

725
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,440
for exercise, but with no ropes or anything.

726
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,960
So I've just seen videos of people I know

727
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,340
just falling like 10 feet onto mats.

728
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,560
I'm not into that.

729
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,680
Huh.

730
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,920
Yeah, I would want a rope if I was climbing.

731
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,760
Yeah.

732
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,800
I'm not going to do a Tom Cruise Mission Impossible 2,

733
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,400
no rope climb.

734
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,880
No, he did that so we didn't have to.

735
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,480
We did that for our sins.

736
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,320
He suffers for our sins.

737
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,400
I think it's possible, I think it's possible Tom had a rope

738
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,160
but Ethan in the movie didn't.

739
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,000
Right.

740
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,360
If Ethan were, if Ethan Hunt were real,

741
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,120
he would like swallow all the coronavirus and sacrifice.

742
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,600
So he'd like somehow get everyone to cough into his mouth

743
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,520
and then he'd have all of it.

744
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,320
And then, and he would like,

745
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,160
he's like suicide bombing himself

746
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,640
with all of the world's coronavirus,

747
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,680
but then he'd like still survive somehow.

748
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,280
The way that I've read that Tom Cruise

749
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,400
and Christopher McQuarrie make these movies,

750
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,880
like on the fly, I don't think that's out of the realm

751
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,240
of possibility that they add that

752
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,080
into Mission Impossible 7.

753
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,840
He fixes the virus by getting all of it.

754
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,960
They've shot a little of it,

755
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,120
I think then they had to shut down,

756
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,400
but I feel like they just have to adapt now

757
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,280
and put something ripped from today's headlines

758
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,800
in the new movie.

759
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,840
Yeah, and you're right that Tom,

760
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,440
well, yeah, Tom would do it too.

761
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,760
So I'm getting the virus.

762
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,800
I'm the first person electing to get it.

763
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,360
Like it only makes him stronger.

764
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,680
I was having this discussion with Lindsay and she,

765
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,040
I was saying, if you were, say you were like shooting

766
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,200
a movie or involved in a movie and John Travolta said,

767
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,200
hey, I'll fly you back to LA on my plane, would you go?

768
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,520
And she's like, no, I don't think so.

769
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,760
I go, well, what if Tom Cruise said that?

770
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,400
She goes, oh yeah, I would do it for sure.

771
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,800
That's it, I could not agree with this statement more.

772
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,440
Yeah, but Travolta is a good pilot.

773
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,560
That's not why I'm not getting on a plane with him.

774
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,360
There's some baggage.

775
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,920
There's some baggage.

776
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,200
You think this has to do with the plane part?

777
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
He's gonna be very friendly.

778
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,280
He's gonna be nice.

779
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,480
He's a nice guy.

780
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,800
All right, all righty then.

781
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,560
Let's just go, let's just propel.

782
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Let's just fast forward, can we do this?

783
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,400
All right, yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go.

784
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,920
All right, so yeah, he comes down on a rope

785
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920
and he's not really miked in the video

786
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,640
and the host has to mic him.

787
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,760
That's really funny.

788
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,080
He's got a really funny line

789
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,320
cause a spider appears, right?

790
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,600
That's what happens.

791
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,120
That's the impetus for him to do his antics.

792
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,280
Yeah, he's gonna come talk about the movie

793
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,240
and then he just evades all the questions

794
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,240
and says, nonsense, poopy pants and spank you very much.

795
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,560
And he refuses all of his responsibilities

796
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,520
to the filmmaking curious audience of the show.

797
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,000
And then a weird puppet bug appears on the roof.

798
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,360
This is a weird, by the way,

799
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,040
I don't know if we've explained so much.

800
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,320
The show's taking place in an alley,

801
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,880
but it really is like a pop-up.

802
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,680
There's no seats.

803
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,880
It's just kinda, you're just like

804
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,560
craning your head everywhere.

805
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,480
Yeah, it's like extremely, not unorganized,

806
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,720
but I think Aaron said,

807
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,160
it feels like they rehearsed this once

808
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,320
and then like, okay, close enough, let's go.

809
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,840
It's a happening man.

810
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,920
That's a great way to put it.

811
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,400
Much like improv everywhere.

812
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,640
Yeah, it's just suddenly occurring

813
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,040
and people have to react.

814
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,720
Yeah, there's a weird bug.

815
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,040
He has to go back up the, he's propelled down a rope

816
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,160
and then he's gotta go back up the rope.

817
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,280
I also, in my head, this was a stunt show

818
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,160
and it is a stunt show.

819
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,680
What he's doing are stunt, but I,

820
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,120
is it though, maybe this is where it's important

821
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,080
to have words like stuntacular.

822
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,120
Because while this is a stunt show,

823
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,280
I would certainly not call it a stuntacular.

824
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,720
So that vocabulary is helpful.

825
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,120
Yeah, it's no stuntacular,

826
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,320
but there are like, the repelling is cool

827
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,800
because it's a high up place.

828
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,920
It's not two stories.

829
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,120
It feels like it's what, four stories?

830
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,240
Am I wrong?

831
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,480
Looks about, yeah.

832
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,080
Four or five stories maybe.

833
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,320
There's a zip line.

834
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,160
Yes.

835
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,120
Across two big build, like two high up places.

836
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,200
That's not nothing.

837
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,120
I think legally they have to classify this performer

838
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,280
as stunt work because he has to repel the zip line for sure.

839
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,000
It certainly is stunt work.

840
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,440
It's just funny how it's like, it's one person

841
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,440
and it's stunt work that's all being done very slowly.

842
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,120
I mean, I guess the Alice would you do it,

843
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,960
but it just feels especially, it was belabored.

844
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,400
I don't know.

845
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,120
Everything takes a while, I feel like.

846
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,800
Yeah, him crossing, he goes up a wire

847
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,320
and then like walks across a fence

848
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,040
and he stops in the middle to talk out of his butt.

849
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,680
So I appreciate that.

850
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,480
That kind of ups the butt talking that he does it

851
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,760
on kind of a high wire situation.

852
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,400
Here's my question about the butt talking.

853
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,560
Do you think, cause it's a very brief

854
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,680
and it feels like that would be off limits

855
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,920
for a Disney environment cause that's very crude

856
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,720
when Ace Ventura talks out of his butt.

857
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,760
Now again, if you're a younger listener,

858
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,440
Ace would sometimes for no reason bend over,

859
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,440
grab his own butt with his hands

860
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,400
and open up his butt to make it talk.

861
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,320
Now he's not naked, but I'm just describing

862
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,800
what happened in the movie.

863
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,920
And the stunt performer does a little bit of it,

864
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,280
but not a ton.

865
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,720
Do you think, do you, yeah, sorry.

866
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
That's me.

867
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,680
Well, in the movies, Ace Ventura is at like a nine or 10.

868
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,920
In this like street show, he is at a one or two.

869
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,320
It's very tamped down, it's very tame comparably.

870
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,160
But that's what I'm saying.

871
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,400
Do you think there was a conversation

872
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,800
when they were putting this together

873
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,880
where there was a longer butt talking segment

874
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,440
and the powers that be were like, all right,

875
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,400
we know that's one of his signature moves.

876
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,880
You can do it for exactly 1.5 seconds or two seconds,

877
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,040
but no longer.

878
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Oh, for sure.

879
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,320
I'm sure that happened.

880
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,760
I mean, there was an Ace Ventura Saturday morning cartoon

881
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,800
very briefly too.

882
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,240
So like they just took the cartoony stuff

883
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,760
and took out like him covered in shit

884
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,160
and being very horny.

885
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,440
Like there's no horny stuff in this.

886
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,080
Yes.

887
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,920
I just, I would love to have heard them

888
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,800
of like timing the butt talking.

889
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,640
Yeah.

890
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,480
You can do the butt talking as long as it's very lazy

891
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,080
and half committed to.

892
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,600
Right.

893
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,120
You can't actually make your butt move with your own hands.

894
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,920
You can't be as, you can't grasp it as firmly

895
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,560
as Jim Carrey grasped his own butt.

896
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,600
It's about inches.

897
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,280
It's about, you know, yeah, how close do you get

898
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,640
to the actual center?

899
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,440
This is one of those times where I do wish

900
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,320
Walt Disney was alive to have signed off

901
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,000
or not signed off on this.

902
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,480
Where like this would have had to come across his desk

903
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,680
and he would have had to approve Ace Ventura

904
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,400
talking out of his butt at Disney's Hollywood studios.

905
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,520
And how would he, was Walt moralist enough

906
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,400
to not approve of this?

907
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,280
Well, here's the thing.

908
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,400
Here's my impression of Walt.

909
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,240
My impression of Walt is that he was, yes,

910
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,560
kind of a stodgy uptight guy

911
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,040
when it came to any sort of crudities.

912
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,840
But he was also, if you could convince him

913
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,440
that it was like good for business

914
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,840
or if like times were changing, he could be swayed.

915
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,640
So perhaps a younger executive could have explained to him

916
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,560
why butt talking was so popular at the time.

917
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,680
Yes, now the butt talking in this was not good for business.

918
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,120
This had no effect on business.

919
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,640
Because as we said, they did not advertise the show

920
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,360
in any way, no one came to the park to see this.

921
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,400
I guess if maybe butt talking,

922
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,800
maybe it was good for business because people saw it

923
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,720
and were like, I don't want to watch this anymore.

924
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,120
And then went and got a soda.

925
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,480
Right.

926
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,840
So it could have been good for business in that way.

927
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,280
Made them thirsty.

928
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
Mm-hmm.

929
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,240
There are some real animals, you know,

930
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,840
that's Ace Ventura's bread and butter.

931
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,040
That's true.

932
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,720
Some birds fly out when it's implied Ace Ventura

933
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,440
goes into his office to take a shit real quick.

934
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,640
Yes, another crude moment.

935
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,280
Yeah.

936
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,000
Another moment you'd have to convince a 90 year old

937
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,640
Walt Disney to allow in his park.

938
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,080
Implied pooping.

939
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:28,200
So Ace Ventura, this establishes that not just in the one scenario.

940
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,240
Well, first of all, in the in the context of the film,

941
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,800
he didn't poop.

942
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
That's a cover.

943
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,880
Right. Right. Yeah.

944
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,040
So in this case, this actually is maybe the first scenario

945
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,160
of Ace Ventura taking a big shit and then saying,

946
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,160
do not go in there.

947
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,120
Woo. Right.

948
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,160
So this is adding to the yeah, this is this is adding to the canon, I guess.

949
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,520
He really did take a big dump now in a way we didn't get to see him do

950
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,800
in the first movie.

951
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,480
Unless that's interesting.

952
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,600
Unless the birds made a big mess.

953
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,920
Unless it's like, oh, don't go in there.

954
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,120
The birds made a big mess in there and they're getting out of here.

955
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,520
There's a flushing sound, though.

956
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,160
So unless and this is birds are aces, pets, by and large, are kind of smart.

957
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,280
So maybe the maybe the birds did poop in the toilet

958
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,400
and then flush it and then which in that case, saying, do not go in there

959
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,240
is I don't know if I agree.

960
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,480
It sounds like it's probably kind of clean.

961
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,320
Do go in there.

962
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:41,000
You should have said be impressed by these doves that know how to use toilets.

963
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Please go in here.

964
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,960
Woo. And then the woo is a happy woo.

965
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,240
Yeah, happy woo.

966
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,160
Did OK to eyes their head to approve this, though.

967
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,320
Maybe I this is low stakes enough.

968
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,080
You might not have known.

969
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,400
You think this could have snuck by him?

970
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,960
This is we have to we have obviously a big list of questions.

971
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,680
Someone write this down when we get the interview with him,

972
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,920
which I'm sure we will,

973
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,200
that we have to ask him about Ace Ventura at Hollywood Studios.

974
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,560
If he remembers it, if he remembers approving the length

975
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,280
that Ace could talk out of his butt and the shit joke.

976
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,800
This is where it's all because this is 95, though, and it's all unraveling a little.

977
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,400
And he's dealing with Frank Wells' death in the movies or maybe his play.

978
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,960
He might have been like

979
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,600
he might have been recovering from the heart attack while this.

980
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,560
Maybe that's why this happened, because he was asleep at the wheel.

981
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,280
And they were like, well, just get I don't know, get something in here.

982
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,800
Maybe without his poor health, this show wouldn't have occurred at all.

983
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,240
Is this is there a chance that like when he was in the hospital,

984
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,560
they tried to force this through, like they had him sign off on him in there.

985
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,160
Like when they did during the Bush administration,

986
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,120
when John Ashcroft was in the hospital

987
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,000
and they tried to get him to sign off on things while he was like under anesthesia.

988
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,080
Oh, yeah.

989
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,040
Do you think that's pretty much what happened here?

990
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,680
That's the way the entire

991
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,360
paramount Viacom world has been run for many years.

992
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,040
OK, it's some of the redstone.

993
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Like if he drools on a piece of paper, that means it's approved.

994
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,600
We got some of the rest still alive, right?

995
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,680
Yeah. Yeah. As of recording.

996
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,920
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

997
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,840
I think it feels like it could change any second.

998
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,920
Do you think he would do the show?

999
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,320
Again, if if the right person asks

1000
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,400
and if like if a moan from him is interpreted in the right way, then,

1001
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,320
yeah, I suppose so.

1002
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,080
Hmm. Well, we'll work out. We'll get our booker on that.

1003
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,960
And then we only ask him questions about like the.

1004
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,760
So why did you drop the Kings Island branding?

1005
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:07,280
I'm sure he's I'm sure he'll have some way to signal us with answers.

1006
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
I all right. So that's on the to do list.

1007
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,400
We'll get some nerve.

1008
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,520
But I think we figured it out.

1009
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,640
Eisner was in poor health and this happened in like the,

1010
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,560
you know, the couple of days where he was dealing with it.

1011
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,440
And that's so this thing was like a this.

1012
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,120
This was a huge health related accident. Yeah.

1013
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,800
Yeah, that's a good way to think of it.

1014
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,320
But so, yeah, so, OK,

1015
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,880
ace, whatever you can not covered, ace takes a shit.

1016
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,360
He talks out of his butt.

1017
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,760
But he fire escape.

1018
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,680
Yeah. And then the the bug that he's trying to rescue.

1019
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,160
It's a big like wiggly puppet bug.

1020
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,600
And it ends up on his face and then he rips it off of his face.

1021
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,040
And he says, I think I just got engaged. Yes.

1022
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,040
And then the spider

1023
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,880
or whatever it is, ends up on his back.

1024
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,920
And there's some like classic I think Park hijinks of where where is it?

1025
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,680
It's on your back.

1026
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,960
Hey, so you're back.

1027
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,920
And he doesn't believe them.

1028
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,800
Ace is a real jerk throughout this.

1029
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,040
He doesn't trust the audience.

1030
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,840
He refuses to do almost everything that's asked of him.

1031
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,160
Well, he does.

1032
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,600
He gives him what he wants, what they want.

1033
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,200
He does say all righty then, like 20 times and nine.

1034
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,480
A lot of times, a lot of times.

1035
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,360
I do have to say I did like the line.

1036
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,800
I don't know. It's probably in the movie.

1037
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,720
If I'm not back in five minutes, just wait longer.

1038
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,360
I think that's a solid line.

1039
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,520
I did like that. Yes. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1040
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,640
Yeah, I was.

1041
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,120
Does a good job.

1042
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,120
The actor does a good job. Yeah.

1043
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,560
I wasn't crazy about the bit where the host says,

1044
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,960
could you give us some some of your impressions of Africa?

1045
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,800
And he just makes animal noises and then they play a Tarzan yell.

1046
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,840
I that was a little bit of a reach.

1047
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,640
The audience didn't understand.

1048
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,680
I think they were just like, yeah, impressions of Africa.

1049
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,480
And then he does impressions of animal like that didn't think the wordplay was lost.

1050
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,840
They were just like, this is a reasonable answer to this question.

1051
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,440
Yeah, I don't think there's not a ton of like there were.

1052
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,440
There were two versions of the show overall,

1053
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,520
and there's not a lot to see if maybe they had tweaked some of these jokes.

1054
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,000
It's not a lot of documentation.

1055
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,040
Apparently, sometimes Ace Ventura, in lieu of repelling down a building,

1056
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,320
would just get out of a car like a car would drive up

1057
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,040
and he would get out of the backseat.

1058
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,800
And in that version, it was going after a white bat like he was in the second movie.

1059
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,200
Like Chicago. Yes. Yes.

1060
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,280
Oh, it was just the plot of the second movie. Right.

1061
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,200
So they they changed that at a certain point

1062
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,520
because of because people would people were just confused, I'm sure,

1063
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,160
unless he was doing exactly what he did in the movie.

1064
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,160
They do play the rock and roll Chicago song from the movie.

1065
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,440
That's what that's what a music cue is.

1066
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,840
This is an original song about the bat named Chicago.

1067
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,600
Yeah, it's just some rock and roll guitar.

1068
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,280
And then occasionally a voice goes, Chicago.

1069
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,720
That's the song.

1070
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,000
You know, speaking of people being confused about this show,

1071
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,240
I don't know if you guys came across this, but I saw a post somewhere

1072
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,240
from someone who was an employee

1073
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,720
or like a like a helper with this show was like part of the crew of this show,

1074
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,560
probably among other theme park duties over several years.

1075
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,080
And he kind of like corralled the audience for this show for a little while.

1076
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,600
Did you guys run into this?

1077
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,120
No, no, I didn't.

1078
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,360
I forget the website.

1079
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,560
Apologies for not sourcing it.

1080
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,440
But the yeah, somebody talks about the brief

1081
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,480
summer that this occurred.

1082
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,600
And he kind of alludes to the low budget,

1083
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,720
low effort nature of the show.

1084
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,240
And I'll I'll, you know, synopsize this.

1085
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,280
But he he says the following is my recreation

1086
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,240
of the sort of conversation I'd end up having with a guest

1087
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,360
just about every show.

1088
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,880
Excuse me, but what time will he be here?

1089
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,120
The A's Ventura show begins at 2 p.m.

1090
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,720
Oh, will he do photos and autographs or is he just doing the show?

1091
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,840
Ace will be available after the show for pictures and autographs.

1092
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,840
Wow. So how did they get him to do this?

1093
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,360
I mean, it's really him, right?

1094
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,240
Guy. Well, Ace is very busy.

1095
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,440
And he decided to set up a temporary office here at Disney MGM Studios.

1096
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,720
No, no, no. I mean, Jim Carrey.

1097
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,520
I'm so excited to meet him.

1098
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,000
Well, Jim Carrey portrayed Ace Ventura,

1099
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,680
and we really wish he could be here to meet Ace.

1100
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,000
Wait, so Jim Carrey's not here.

1101
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,040
You said you just said he was going to be here at 2 p.m.

1102
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,240
No, sir. I said he's been to it will be here at two base.

1103
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,120
Ventura would be here to be. I'm not Jim Carrey.

1104
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,320
That is not what you said. Kids, let's go.

1105
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,760
Jim Carrey is not here.

1106
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,360
They'd walk away and not see the show.

1107
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,960
Wow. I mean, you got to get you got to get that training.

1108
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,320
You got to be able to answer those questions.

1109
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,600
I mean, this is a tradition that is, you know, still alive at the galaxy's edge

1110
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,960
that replaced this setting in this very park.

1111
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,120
People having to use bizarre phrases

1112
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,920
that don't allude to what's actually going on.

1113
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,080
Tortured employees having to play these little games.

1114
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,760
Like when I like when we went to the Mickey meet and greet on Main Street

1115
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,920
in Florida and he didn't talk and I had to go.

1116
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,600
I went to City Hall to complain and they said, you know, Mickey,

1117
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,200
Mickey's not feeling very talkative sometimes.

1118
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,680
And then I was like, right, but he talks, right?

1119
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,200
Why didn't he talk? And they're like, he's not always feeling so well.

1120
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,960
I'm like, wait, wait a minute.

1121
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,840
Some heads, I go, so like some heads talk and some don't

1122
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,160
because there are multiple rooms and they're like,

1123
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,760
you could maybe just ask in line if Mickey's feeling talkative.

1124
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,680
And that might help you out.

1125
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,640
And I'm like, what is this game we're playing?

1126
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,680
You fucking freak. Get out of here.

1127
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,920
All right. In my version, that's the line about this in my version of this.

1128
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,600
Well, I got a fast pass for it.

1129
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,680
And that's one of the, you know, I used a fast pass up,

1130
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,680
but I'm going to better get my talking Mickey head.

1131
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
But did it say it was going to be talking?

1132
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,880
Well, if you go on YouTube and it's not happening anymore,

1133
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,200
but if you go on YouTube to this meet and greet,

1134
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,520
there's so many videos of Mickey talking to people.

1135
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,240
And apparently the head malfunctions a lot and it's not always talking.

1136
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,240
And they only have one out of three.

1137
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,520
Like there's three different rooms I think you can go into.

1138
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,200
And only one of the rooms has a talking Mickey.

1139
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,360
Like always. Well, at least at the time I was going, I don't know.

1140
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,920
I think it's done. I think I don't. It is done right now.

1141
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,840
Yeah. Because the head is too, too.

1142
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,360
The technology is not there yet to make Mickey talk.

1143
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,040
Well, this is a real Russian roulette then.

1144
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,960
You're going to use a fast pass on a, what is one out of three,

1145
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,640
two out of three chances, not a talking Mickey head.

1146
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,880
Well, to be fair to me, I didn't know it wasn't,

1147
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,920
I thought it was like sort of an advertised thing because I had seen so many of

1148
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,600
these videos.

1149
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,400
So I just thought it was a foregone conclusion that Mickey would talk.

1150
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,080
I didn't realize it was sort of a random thing and it was still in testing mode.

1151
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,920
So that's why I was so confused after we had done it,

1152
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,640
because I just thought it was common knowledge that Mickey talked.

1153
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,040
But so you use the fast pass to save time.

1154
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,360
And then you were mad that a fast pass was used on this thing.

1155
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,960
So then you took time to stand in a line and complain about

1156
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,240
how your time was not being valued.

1157
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,080
That's right. Well, I didn't, I mean, I didn't say something like that in a funny way.

1158
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,440
Sure.

1159
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,160
But then I got, I did get a fast pass back for the same attraction.

1160
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,760
And they told me the secret code to basically say,

1161
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,440
and then we did see talking Mickey.

1162
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,560
OK, all right. So it's a happy ending.

1163
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,080
Yeah. But he really mostly talked to Lindsay and he didn't address me as much as I'd

1164
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:15,800
like him to.

1165
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,120
Well, they can't all be Minnie grabbing your ass.

1166
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,800
I would I would have liked a little more attention is all I'm saying here.

1167
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,680
I guess he's mad at me.

1168
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,360
Minnie's all over you like you're on a flight with John Travolta.

1169
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:38,960
Anyway, it's a.

1170
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,960
It's a.

1171
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,920
So the very end, he does catch the spider and then they say is ventura will be down

1172
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,600
in a second and he falls through the roof like there's a crashing sound effect

1173
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,680
and a puff of smoke.

1174
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,960
And then is it a flock of birds gets released or a flock of bats?

1175
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,720
I don't think it's bad.

1176
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,640
It's not that you can't trade bats for a theme park show.

1177
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,200
I hope not.

1178
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,840
I think so. It's like I just be confetti or something.

1179
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,480
It's like a plume of like black birds kind of flies.

1180
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,080
At least I think it was.

1181
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,000
It's hard to tell. It's not the best.

1182
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,240
I got to go back and watch this.

1183
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,480
Have they released bats?

1184
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,520
Go back and watch it.

1185
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:26,600
The camera catches the smoke smoke puff and then like very quickly tries to whip up

1186
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,680
and like and there's a bunch of stuff like looks like birds flying, you know,

1187
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,280
another batch of birds released, I think, unless it just happened to be a bunch of

1188
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,280
birds or bats passing by at the perfect moment.

1189
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,120
I'm going to try to check this out here.

1190
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,080
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1191
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,880
It's yeah, it does feel like.

1192
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,480
But I can't imagine that they're releasing.

1193
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,800
I don't know that bats can be trained to that extent.

1194
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,680
Yeah, I don't think so.

1195
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,680
Also, I've heard that sometimes when they release birds, they all just die.

1196
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,240
Is that you heard this like when you release certain birds, like they like it's

1197
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,120
they don't go back anywhere, they just like end up dying because they're not trained.

1198
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,960
I think some of them are trained to go back.

1199
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,440
But I got to think the it's not 100 percent

1200
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,760
return rate, you know. Yeah.

1201
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,080
Anyway, I don't know. We have to we'll do a whole bird episode, I guess.

1202
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,520
I keep I'm watching it over and over and it is very tough to do.

1203
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,360
They do. It does look black, but I think it might just be it's either.

1204
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,680
I think it's either black birds or just black confetti.

1205
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,400
It could be a wind drift, maybe.

1206
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,360
It's all kind of going the same direction.

1207
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,360
It's very hard to tell. Hmm.

1208
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,120
Yeah, I'll I'll look.

1209
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,600
I don't want to get too distracted now.

1210
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,040
We're wrapping this hopefully wrapping this up.

1211
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,920
I guess I certainly hope so.

1212
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,080
I think I literally this never happens.

1213
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,200
I think I've hit every one of my notes.

1214
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,160
Yes, it's quite easy, pretty tidy to do.

1215
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,360
Still had time to talk about Ivan.

1216
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,280
Ivan News and Brian Cranston.

1217
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,720
And yeah, we've one of my favorite a lot in

1218
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,400
my my last thought really about this is that

1219
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,680
it is a shame that that Ace Ventura didn't line up with the opening of Animal Kingdom.

1220
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,480
Oh, yeah.

1221
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,640
Because wouldn't that have been great if we could have had like a Joe

1222
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:28,640
Rody created Ace Ventura attraction or show at Animal Kingdom,

1223
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,040
which is obviously a place Ace would love the most. Sure.

1224
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,320
So I was thinking, like, where do you put

1225
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,200
where would you put a sin animal kingdom to do a show like this?

1226
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,000
Would he be on the tree of life?

1227
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,880
You know, in the 90s, would he?

1228
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,640
I'm trying to think, because, you know, like obviously Pandora wasn't there yet.

1229
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,600
Dinosaur.

1230
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,000
It'd be a whole area, probably.

1231
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,920
It's Camp Ace Ventura.

1232
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,400
Oh, OK, that's good.

1233
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,360
And then he I mean, also, maybe maybe you'd actually you know what?

1234
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,960
Maybe you'd want him sort of goofing around on the safari.

1235
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,880
Yeah, well, if he could be born out of a hippo, like in the movie,

1236
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,000
you're on that. Yeah, that's the perfect one.

1237
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,800
Perfect one.

1238
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,800
So obviously they put if you've never seen Ace Ventura to

1239
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,560
he is in a like robot rhino naked.

1240
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,920
I think or easy to take his clothes off in there.

1241
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,560
He may take his clothes off in the robot rhino because it's too hot.

1242
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,120
And then to try to get out of the rhino, it's like malfunctioning or something.

1243
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,800
And then he has to like squirm his way out of the rhinos.

1244
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,000
But essentially, and it looks like the rhino is shitting a naked Ace Ventura out.

1245
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,840
So I think Scott's hit on the perfect situation here.

1246
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,280
Solution is on the safari.

1247
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,120
You see in the distance a robotic rhino

1248
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,520
shitting out Robbie, the stunt performer

1249
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,360
once every tour.

1250
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,400
Yeah, he's got he's got to reset the lot.

1251
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,160
And they're going to go through a lot of prosthetic hippos.

1252
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,280
So maybe a couple a couple different performers, maybe.

1253
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,320
So you can you can quickly reset like you can quickly

1254
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,080
like there'll be like three different rhinos with three different naked

1255
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,000
Ace Ventura's.

1256
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,240
Yeah, obviously, this should have happened.

1257
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,520
And then, you know, probably one out every four times.

1258
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,400
Then a real hippo stomps the stunt man.

1259
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,720
And that he's out of commission in the early days of animal

1260
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,080
animal kingdom when things were going wrong more often.

1261
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,320
Yes, that might have been a more dangerous thing to do.

1262
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,080
Yeah, yeah.

1263
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:47,440
And that's serious stuff and harder to laugh off with a with an all righty then.

1264
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,760
Right. But the audience still would have appreciated it.

1265
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,560
Yeah, so they missed out.

1266
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,640
They this this tie in was waiting.

1267
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,840
I don't know if they should have bought the rights for more than three weeks.

1268
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,480
Yeah, that's.

1269
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,520
Yeah, I don't know.

1270
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,520
Maybe, you know, maybe there's a chance it'll come back.

1271
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,560
Well, obviously, you know, if it was going to happen,

1272
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:18,000
it would have happened to celebrate the release of Ace Ventura, Jr.

1273
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,560
Yeah. How many years ago is that?

1274
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,440
That was surprisingly long.

1275
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,440
I think it was like two thousand nine.

1276
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,400
Wow. I was shocked that it was that long ago.

1277
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:34,000
If you've never seen it, there's a they made a kid version of Ace Ventura

1278
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,320
called Ace Ventura, Jr.

1279
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,520
It was about his son and you know how somebody somebody's son always acts

1280
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,400
exactly to a T like their dad

1281
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,280
and dresses exactly like them,

1282
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,160
even though their dad is not around and will not be around.

1283
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,160
They still behave exactly like.

1284
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,400
And the thing that I didn't remember about that movie

1285
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,080
is that the official name of the movie is Ace Ventura.

1286
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,760
Pet Detect. No, wait.

1287
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,480
It's Ace Ventura, Jr.

1288
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,920
Pet Detective.

1289
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,080
It's it's not they didn't like think of a new like a pun

1290
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,960
in the way that from from Dumber to Dumber did whatever that was called.

1291
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,440
It's just Ace Ventura, Jr.

1292
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,120
Pet Detective.

1293
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,520
Like they didn't like no joke.

1294
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,480
You're not going to add anything there.

1295
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,480
I say that makes me suspect that Ace Ventura, Jr.

1296
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,400
Pet Detective is not a quality film.

1297
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,000
Huh? I'm not some.

1298
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,800
I really go and sequels for these.

1299
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,040
Ace Ventura, Jr.

1300
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,000
Son of the Mask, Dumb and Dumber.

1301
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Or we end.

1302
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,720
I would I sadly would have to say Dumb and Dumber, too.

1303
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,320
Yeah, it went dumb and Dumber, Dumb and Dumber.

1304
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,920
Er, and then just Dumb and Dumber, too.

1305
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,720
Is that the sequence? OK.

1306
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,720
Kind of disavowing Dumb and Dumber a little bit.

1307
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,760
And then Cableboy also, of course,

1308
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,400
direct DVD Cableboy, the cable guy.

1309
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,880
So Simon Burch, Jr., even littler.

1310
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,040
The Truman Web series.

1311
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,600
That's well, yeah, that's Quibi.

1312
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,240
That's that's been out for a little while.

1313
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,280
Yeah, that's true.

1314
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,560
And the Truman Jr.

1315
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,960
show where his son gets trapped in, they they've like been like,

1316
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,040
we've got this giant sound stage.

1317
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,840
All these people are out of work.

1318
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,720
We got to get his kid and drag him back in here.

1319
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,080
Right. And then it's about

1320
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,840
not Jim.

1321
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,920
He's you hear phone call your off screen phone calls

1322
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,800
that are probably original Truman.

1323
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,640
But he of course, Jim is not in it.

1324
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,040
Right, of course. Right.

1325
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,680
And the kids, the kids web,

1326
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,240
the kids thing is a streaming it airs on a streaming platform

1327
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,400
that the kid cannot access.

1328
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,240
Yeah, I like that.

1329
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,880
But they had to make up like other streaming platforms

1330
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,240
to replace it, like there's entire other things

1331
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,520
just to complete the ruse for Truman Jr.

1332
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,160
They should team up all.

1333
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,560
There should be a big crossover between all of these little Jim Carrey's.

1334
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,240
The Avengers of all of all the little Jims. Yeah.

1335
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,720
Oh, I've got another one.

1336
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,920
The the number 24, the sequel to the number 23.

1337
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,640
That will know it should be prequel.

1338
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,200
It should be before you think it should be 22.

1339
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,480
Yeah. Yeah. Let's keep let's keep blue.

1340
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,200
So it should be like it should be like eight.

1341
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,360
It should just be called eight.

1342
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,600
Hmm.

1343
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,560
Well, he was literally really little.

1344
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,440
Like 15 years earlier, he was obsessed with the number eight.

1345
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,680
Just call it eight.

1346
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,240
Well, but then people might be confused.

1347
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,960
People might think that's the prequel to the Fellini movie Eight and a Half,

1348
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,000
which itself inspired the musical and movie musical Nine.

1349
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,240
You know.

1350
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,480
And how does it and both of those are related to the movie Ten, right?

1351
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,760
With Derek. Yes.

1352
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,040
I assume all the numbers are.

1353
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:10,800
Oh, my God.

1354
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,200
The numbers.

1355
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,720
Ocean's 11, of course, then is next.

1356
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,760
Yes. And before all of it, lucky numbers, Levin, of course,

1357
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,120
still counts even with a misspell. Right.

1358
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,840
13, 13.

1359
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,280
The shocking your teens are having sex movie 13.

1360
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,520
I don't know if it might stop after that.

1361
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,000
I'm not sure.

1362
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,760
No, it's not.

1363
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,800
Aerosmith Nine Lives album.

1364
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,240
The sequel to 13, of course, is 13 going on 30.

1365
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,600
Oh, yeah.

1366
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,360
That's right. Yes.

1367
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:51,400
And don't forget our pal Kevin Spacey in nine lives.

1368
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Oh, yeah.

1369
01:00:53,560 --> 01:01:00,040
It's all if you watch all these in the correct numerical order,

1370
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,360
they are it's all one big story.

1371
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,160
The number of the number verse.

1372
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,560
Yeah, the number verse.

1373
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,800
If you can make all the connections, you get into like a number

1374
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:13,560
23 type of psychosis of like that is showing up everywhere.

1375
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,520
Don't you see it's all the same, man?

1376
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,160
It's one thing, man. 24 hour party people.

1377
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's one movie.

1378
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,480
Well, that's good.

1379
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,240
Hey, we left people with a good theory to investigate.

1380
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,200
You know, when you're as you're bored in quarantine times,

1381
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,640
if it's still quarantine times, when you're hearing this.

1382
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,760
Yeah. Watch all the watch the watch the full number verse. Yeah.

1383
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,080
And, you know, I guess watch a video of this Ace Ventura

1384
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,280
stunt show if you want, maybe.

1385
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,000
But we might have we might have done it for you.

1386
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,080
Just watch and see if you think it's bats.

1387
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,120
Let us know.

1388
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,920
Hashtag is it bats? Hashtag is it bats?

1389
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,720
And then just you know what?

1390
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,000
Everyone watched I've news clips online.

1391
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,960
Yeah. Do your homework, as well.

1392
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,720
I for the probably soon to come, I have a news episode. Yeah.

1393
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,280
Yeah. All right. That in the next 24 hours.

1394
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,760
All right.

1395
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,080
Yeah. All righty, then.

1396
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,000
That'll do it.

1397
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,760
Yeah. And does wait, does he have a goodbye catchphrase?

1398
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,600
I don't know that he does really.

1399
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,560
Huh?

1400
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,000
I mean, what if I don't see you?

1401
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,600
Good afternoon, good evening and good night.

1402
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,320
Perfect. All right. All right.

1403
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,600
All right. So long.
