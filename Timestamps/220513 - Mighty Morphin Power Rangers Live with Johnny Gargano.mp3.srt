1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Forever, dog.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Warning, the following podcast contains the origin of cosplay.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Lord Zed worship, toy vendor stalking, and Jason saying the name of a company that makes sweet pickles.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All that plus Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Live with guest Johnny Gargano.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's podcasting time on Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who if they were Power Rangers would all have giant swords that resemble wet fish.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I guess I would also say like mackerel or something when I was doing that. Jason Sheridan joining me as always.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Explain yourself please.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well here's the thing, I was thinking about what's like a lame animal that we would have when, you know when they say like mastodon, pterodactyl, those are dinosaurs obviously.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But they've changed you know so many times during Power Rangers and I figured what would be our animals that our zords would look like.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I thought wet fish makes the most sense.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Jason Sheridan here.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hi, yes I'm here. Yeah I understand it now.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I understand it now. I mean I think a lot of fish are pretty you know majestic and cool.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But that's probably why my fish, that's why my animal would be a wet fish.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay fair enough. Scott Gargano here.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well first off what other way would a fish be?

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's their natural habitat so it's no slam on a fish to say the fish is wet. If they are wet they are living their best life.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah it's a good point.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So are we.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Dry fish actually would be more embarrassing and would more play into the joke that I was trying to make that we're three losers.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah but also maybe more sad because of dry fish you were thinking about their mortality.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And while we might die in the face of a Power Rangers type battle, I don't regard ourselves to that degree of depression that we hear fish choking on the deck of a boat.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That said I also there is some I don't totally disagree with the metaphor and I think within it we would still pick like are we who's a cod and who's a trout.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah. There's one with like a really harsh like scrod or it's not scrad.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Scrod is something Jason definitely ate growing up.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Scrod? The scrod guy?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I've not actively ordered scrod but I've likely sampled scrod.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But that is like a mundane like when they're not when we're maybe not serving the top of the line fish maybe scrod is what we're looking at.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah isn't it like a bottom feeder is what they would call it? Like that's the that's like a real like cheap dirty fish.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can't speak to that. I think it's definitely a fish where you're getting like a salad and a drink and a dessert with it. You're getting it on a platter with two sides.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A lot of support like as with forming the big mega ranger needs help things added to it. What's the when they all form what's it called?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh it's a Megazord or a Megazord or a Megascrod is helped out by mashed potatoes and a beverage.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Jason's version of a Megazord is when a soup and salad combine to make a meal.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
When you get both. Yeah.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's a big transfer. It's like going into his stomach.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Iceberg lettuce go!

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Blue cheese go!

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And that's the salad that is most of the salad you have described right now at these sorts of family restaurants.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Two ingredients the ultimate salad ready for battle.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The electricity soloing. We have a guest though we have to bring him we have so much to talk about here.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Folks you know him from WWE NXT pro wrestling in general because he's Johnny Wrestling.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ladies and gentlemen it's Johnny Gargano.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hi guys how are you? Hi Johnny.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We're doing fine we're talking salads here on podcast.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I heard you did. I like the idea of I appreciate now that I'm here to kind of be the power ranger export as well.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Because you had a mix up between Megazord or Dragonzord.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Megazord would be the correct answer. Yes.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That you were looking for by the way but yeah I get it.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
First of many. My knowledge is not so great.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So you already you've proven your knowledge vastly beyond mine.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sure it'll keep up.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So are you guys were you guys did you guys watch Power Rangers at all?

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes. Oh yeah.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay. Did you? Okay.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Not me. I explained this on the show once when Power Rangers came up before.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We did a little like small component of Power Rangers once before.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I said that I was really into the Ninja Turtles and then Power Rangers came around and I started telling my parents about it.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And there's a bunch of them and there's a red one a yellow one and they're all different types of animals.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And my mom just said hey what if you skipped this one?

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And I was like yeah I can see that. I can see the logic in that.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah then we save the money on the toys. Okay all right not doing it.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And that was the end of that.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So where did you go from? You went from Ninja Turtles to where? What was your next?

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Probably like reading Entertainment Weekly.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh no.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I was reading Owen Gleiberman reviews.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Because I went through the natural progression of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to Power Rangers.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Like those were the next step in evolution for me.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, then pro wrestling.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That was like my evolution.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It would have been mine I think if that was the only missing component.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'd be right there with you.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We'd be in the ring together I think.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah. Oh guaranteed.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Johnny, any X-Men in there? X-Men between Ninja Turtles and Power Rangers?

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah so I was a big X-Men the animated series person.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A big Spider-Man the animated series person as you can tell from my back wall over here.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I have many many a superhero toy and whatnot.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So yeah that was like my I think I started at like Sesame Street.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Because I saw Sesame Street Live growing up.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And then obviously went to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Then like there was a pits off of like Spider-Man, X-Men, Power Rangers, all the superhero stuff.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Batman the animated series and then ultimately pro wrestling.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And I always felt like I had like a weird thing in my head where I could only like one thing at a time.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know what it was. I felt like I was cheating on something if I liked something too much.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Right.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know why that was my weird bugaboo when I was little.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But that was apparently a thing that I did.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh I tried to like everything at once and just permanently damaged my brain for ever basically.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Power Rangers I like you're a little younger than I am.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But Power Rangers I like knew is maybe not something I should like because I was so sophisticated.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But I did like it regardless.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And would like I remember I did get the Dragon Zords when I said that like I'm really embarrassed that because I know what the difference is.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Sorry for calling you out.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No, no, it's OK.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was sitting here as a Power Rangers fan like what is he doing?

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're a bigger Power Rangers fan than I am for sure.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But I did drag my like 9 p.m.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
My mom like or 855 Toys R Us called us and they were like you know with that Dragon Zord you have on hold.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We have it in stock and I begged my mom to go that moment.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
She's like we can go tomorrow can't we?

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And I was like we cannot go tomorrow.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So we like bolted to Toys R Us to get that Dragon Zord.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So like the Dragon Zord to me was like if I had to pick one present one Christmas present as a child as the one that was like the height of my happiness.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It would probably be the Dragon Zord because my parents Christmas storied me.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If you understand that reference.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I wanted the Dragon Zord so much.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That was like the number one thing I wanted on my Christmas list that year.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And I opened all my presents and it wasn't there.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And I was heartbroken only for my dad to be like is there something behind the tree and then for it to be behind the tree.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So but that was like a thing that my parents did after that.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They saw how well it worked out.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They did it like every single year then after that.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But they did it in like new unique ways where it'd be like okay the Dragon Zord was behind the tree.

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What can we do next?

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay we're going to leave this pinball set on his bunk bed and say that Santa fell asleep in the middle.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And while he was delivering the presents he had to take a nap.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And he left it there like hey Johnny go let the dog outside.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh the presents at the bottom of the steps now.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I say I say all the time now looking back on it as an adult.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm like my parents really should have just sucked it up and been like we're going to have a bad Christmas this year.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Because after that I kind of expected like where is the big present going to be like what's going to where's it where's it going to end up.

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
One year they should have just been like you didn't get it.

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So then the years after that there's always that little hint of danger where it's like maybe maybe it's not going to be there this year.

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So that's that's my parenting tip for anyone else out there that I will eventually probably do to my son now.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah so you have a new son very new.

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And so you're saying every three or four Christmases you're going to really let him down.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah hopefully he's just a bad person that year so I can kind of justify it.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh sure yeah.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We'll see we'll see.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
When he's four and he's really bad.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Life lesson.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Life lesson.

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:19,000
My parents I also got the Dragon's Sword for Christmas one year and it was out of the box with like everything put together and any like stickers or decals put on it.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So it was ready to go.

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And I think that was the last year my parents went that far because those were so complicated.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I think maybe one year I got an N64 like some sort of video game system where it was like set up and ready to go.

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're saying that's the last time they put like some hard effort into assembling.

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well no but like in addition to wrapping then having to assemble these plastic toys that honestly are pretty easy to break.

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah my mom put my mom and dad assumed my dad was there put together the Ninja Turtle sewer for me so it was out of the box.

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh yeah.

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Christmas morning and that's probably the most like that's the best Christmas memory of seeing the sewer which fell apart immediately and never stayed together.

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I had this I had this you either sewer too but I get I got weird presents in weird ways.

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So my parents said I couldn't get the sewer for some strange reason but my grandma at the time got it for me and put it underneath like my dad as a restaurant and she used to sit at like the desk at the restaurant and answer phones.

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
She'd be like Johnny go underneath the desk and I crawled underneath the desk and the sewer was just sitting underneath the desk and like she didn't tell my parents.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
She got me this tour.

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So I had a little surprise like secret sewer underneath the desk at my parents restaurant.

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You were constantly on guard for presents.

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I know you just never knew what could happen.

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah I know.

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You were worried not being well like being scared or something of like I'm going to turn the corner and there'll be a present there.

159
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah I kind of miss that that little bit of like danger now because back then especially with like the Dragon's Order the sewer or these hot toys at the time where like you couldn't find them like there was a very real risk where like the movie Jingle All the

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Way is real like that was based on Power Rangers obviously because there's a very real risk where like a parent couldn't provide that toy for their child for Christmas and I kind of miss that now because like with eBay and like thing in the internet like

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
something's always going to be available if you're willing to pay an astronomical price for it.

162
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But like I missed like the danger of I want I'm a psychopath.

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I want to like go to Toys R Us if those still existed and wait at midnight and try to get this toy for my kid.

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I feel like that'd be fun.

165
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Maybe I would hate it after a while but at least once I want to try it.

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well guess what the danger of not getting things you want is back.

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What would the supply chain issues.

168
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let's go Brandon right.

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You got your wish.

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Not now.

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Not on the theme park.

172
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You said I could start doing it on this one.

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Not this one.

174
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Not this one.

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Not my podcast I do under a pseudonym.

176
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah let people find that one on their own.

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah well the so I want to talk real quick about toy collecting in general before because we have a lot of talk about Power Rangers Live today but a couple topics real quick.

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So we're talking about toys because there's doing a lot of retro toys now you see you have some also to the listener who might be listening.

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This is a video we're doing a little video now so if you go to I assume Brett forever dog YouTube will probably put this up there.

180
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Or YouTube.

181
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Or YouTube whatever works.

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Or it's just part sword or no one sees it or it goes into a vault and you don't see it till we die.

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's possible.

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Any amount of options.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We have a prince like vault that we're putting a lot of video content into.

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Johnny Power Rangers episode.

187
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Our 20th for our state will release it posthumously and it'll be very exciting but you'll be able to see what we're talking about is what I'm saying.

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're at the forever dog studios by the way.

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

190
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Where there are lights on us and we don't look ashen gray as we usually do on camera.

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But these lights are hitting my massive forehead and I am trying not to be self conscious about it.

192
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Now you know.

193
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You need that for next time.

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We'll fix it in post.

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah.

196
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Johnny yeah you have a ton of of vintage toys and I believe yeah retro like new retro packaging toys.

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And there's so much stuff like Ninja Turtle stuff I've talked about on the show before.

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Some of the Ninja Turtle stuff is what you're describing where I have to drive to targets to try to find it.

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I think it's actually the ones right.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes.

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The NECA cartoon line specifically because the movie line is only at Walmart.

203
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The cartoon line is only at Target.

204
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Of course we all know that.

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So so there is some yes I completely agree with you that there's some like old school thrill now I get when I'm like dry like oh you think targets got it and like I have a couple buddies and we're all like in different parts of town.

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So we're calling each other and like oh I got the one on Sepulveda they don't have anything.

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh I ran into the NECA rep which is a guy who comes and stocks the shelves and then I'm just like lingering around him while he's on stock like taking the box stuff out of the box.

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You run into the guy who stocks for that company.

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It is like running into a celebrity if you ever run into a NECA rep because Target cannot stock NECA products themselves.

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
They need a third party to stock.

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So there's a NECA rep that comes in with boxes and he comes into and he goes into the back and he grabs the boxes.

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Excuse me.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And then he stocks them.

214
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And he has to grab them.

215
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It can't just be a touch.

216
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
He has to grab them.

217
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes.

218
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He's got to sink his claws into it.

219
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Just legally.

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Same rules.

221
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He has to touch all four sides of the box.

222
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Have you tried bribing?

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Hey buddy there's an up and up tramex in it for you if you give me a heads up.

224
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I say the most embarrassing things.

225
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm like oh so is this like sort of your normal time when you do that?

226
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And you can tell he's just like oh get away from me old man.

227
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
There's a Starbucks refresher in it for you if you give me a heads up next time you're here.

228
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So I've only had this happen once running into the NECA rep which is just a very fun time.

229
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's like seeing Santa under the putting things under the tree.

230
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So I completely agree with that.

231
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And there are still little pockets.

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But yes by and large you can get stuff on eBay for just like maybe ten dollars twenty dollars over retail.

233
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But real quick.

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So we see Johnny you have like a great setup.

235
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I have a question just in general because I am what an out of box collector in general and you're an in box collector.

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I'm fascinated by the display because I think you have recreated almost a toy store shell like shells of a toy store.

237
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is that what it is?

238
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I did. Yes.

239
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And also to kind of I guess for the people that are watching I did this on purpose as well.

240
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If you look up here there's also a Toys R Us logo.

241
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh wow.

242
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

243
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So we really recreate it.

244
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It goes to the ceiling.

245
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If you're watching you can kind of see all this.

246
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But yeah so this was very purposely done.

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I miss Toys R Us very very much.

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And Candice and I went to Ikea and we found these shelves that with pegboards and whatnot that you can kind of recreate your childhood in an essence.

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And like you said I am an in box collector.

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I believe the artwork on the box is some of the fun in the nostalgia as well.

251
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Like seeing like the Spider-Man the animated series logo and like the X-Men logo like that sort of thing.

252
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Like I don't know.

253
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It just warms my heart.

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And also I feel like they're easier to display for me because if they were out of the box and I'd have to like put them on shelves and like display them and I'm bad at posing and things like that.

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So this way like I can just have pegboards and kind of stack them like three deep and kind of collect more in itself.

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And I actually have the only NECA product I have.

257
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I have the NECA Toka and Razor down there because I'm a big TGP Ninja Turtles movie guy as well.

258
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
As my first movie I saw in theaters.

259
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But yeah.

260
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But to be fair I do have a out of the box.

261
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
All my Hasbro collection my wrestling Hasbro's are out of the box because that's just that's an astronomical price to pay.

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sure you can talk to Matt Cardona about that.

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's the astronomical price to pay for in box WWF Hasbro's.

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And those are vintage.

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Those are.

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes.

267
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah.

268
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah.

269
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So makes sense.

270
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Do you feel like he's missing out by not for you like in your case that you set up jam sessions between the Ninja Turtles and Doc Brown and Marty.

271
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Is Johnny missing out on.

272
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't think he's missing out because I really have like tried in my older years to really appreciate everyone's philosophy about it because I do get that going into a Toys R Us aisle was the most exciting thing in the world.

273
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And that's the thing is you're stimulating that old memory in your child brain of when you'd round the corner you'd go past all the Barbies and everything and you'd round the corner for the action figure aisle and you didn't know what was in there.

274
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So anytime you go in there there's that much stuff all in boxes.

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You're getting that surge of serotonin or whatever it is.

276
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I should tell Candace to just buy me a new toy every week and just put it on the ceiling.

277
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So every time I walk in I'm like oh what's in here this time.

278
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah.

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You could.

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You could stock like an end cap display of something new too.

281
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I have enough weird things with my childhood that like Candace puts up with like another another weird thing I have that she deals with all the time which this year we didn't do it but I did all the time where I have a weird thing about Christmas to where the presents can't go underneath the tree until I go to sleep.

282
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So she has to like.

283
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Wake up in the middle of the night and put the presents underneath the tree.

284
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We do that for you.

285
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We do that.

286
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's for me.

287
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
My family does that as well.

288
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't see a problem with that.

289
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh that's you too.

290
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You still have to do.

291
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You go to sleep there's no presents.

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Everyone goes to sleep and then my mom I think has resorted to just getting up early.

293
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I think used to stay up late.

294
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Wow.

295
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah.

296
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Which she can't imagine would not usually like so has to for one night of the year push herself to the limit.

297
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I think it's as much her as me at this point.

298
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So yeah.

299
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well that's nice.

300
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

301
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
One magical night.

302
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You get one magical night a year.

303
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Come on.

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah I get I understand that.

305
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I think we've gotten lazy about it.

306
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We used to be like that but now in my mid to late 30s we've stopped doing it.

307
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Well you were mentioning your wife Candace LeRae who has been on podcasts right before and I also wanted to check in on something because she told us a story to a couple of years ago about an idea you would have.

308
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
An idea you had.

309
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'll let you tell it.

310
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
An idea you had for the birth of a child.

311
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh right.

312
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I want to know if anything like that happened.

313
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No.

314
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay.

315
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I think I can.

316
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I was looking at it from an outsider's perspective of obviously like Candace said my idea was to kind of recreate the Lion King.

317
00:19:44,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't know if she went full deep into what my pitch was but I wanted to get like a Rafiki ass monkey to come into the delivery room and I kind of wanted to you know maybe spread the news to the people waiting in the way.

318
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Obviously with COVID and stuff as well it was a little harder to sneak a monkey in the delivery room.

319
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It used to be 2019.

320
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This is this cake.

321
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I definitely could have done it back then but now it's so many restrictions.

322
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I was going to kind of pitch kind of put it out there that maybe it's not going that well to kind of bring the mood down in the waiting room for the family.

323
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's what people want to hear what your closest relatives in the family want to hear.

324
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Maybe it's not going well and then like I come out and my head's down I'm like oh no it didn't go well.

325
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Then like the monkey busts out and like he holds up the baby and a big like big moment happens where everyone's losing it because Rafiki monkey shows up.

326
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He does a Lion King thing with the baby and the baby is presented to the family.

327
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Obviously now that we had the baby and seeing everything that it goes through that that did not happen.

328
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Nothing like that happened.

329
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Taking you through the process lets you know that immediately it's instantly handing a new a frightened newborn over to a monkey who you have just met for the first time as if like knowing the monkey would help.

330
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But a stranger monkey.

331
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah maybe a stranger monkey.

332
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Not a friend monkey a stranger monkey.

333
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Well they're famously reliable creatures you can predict what they're going to do moment to moment.

334
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Lion King is based on real life right?

335
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Based on true events.

336
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There's also a detail of that that I liked.

337
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I guess like any logistics of getting a monkey is crazy for sure but I like your detail of a Rafiki-esque monkey.

338
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I couldn't tell you what type of monkey that is but it seems like it's not one that I've just you know they're not just like sitting around they aren't at the theme park shows at the zoo.

339
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah that seems like a very specific varietal.

340
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So like no no no this monkey won't do no but they're trained they'll be nice to the baby don't care it's about the look.

341
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Rafiki.

342
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Candace of course asked me how we would sneak the monkey into the delivery room and I said well obviously we dress him up like a doctor.

343
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I mean that's obviously what we do right?

344
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah.

345
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Dress him up like a doctor.

346
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Sneak the monkey in.

347
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Monkeys don't look cool.

348
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
He told the children to wait for this baby to come out just hanging out.

349
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is great this is like something that would happen in Disorderly's the Fat Boys movie.

350
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This is like this is hijinks.

351
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Then we got to dress up the monkey like a doctor.

352
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Rafiki is a mandrill which I am not a hundred percent on but I believe might be an especially violent kind of monkey.

353
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Traditionally.

354
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I think he'd be cool.

355
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We understand the gravity of the situation.

356
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He's nice.

357
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm doing the birth thing right?

358
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You want me to do the birth thing like the movie?

359
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah.

360
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I got it.

361
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Some things are sacred.

362
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Even to mandrills.

363
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Again.

364
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So there were no hijinks during the what's probably good.

365
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
No hijinks during the birth.

366
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Especially good because I made the mistake of I don't know if you guys are aware of it but the movie Fatherhood on Netflix.

367
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You guys know what that is starring Kevin Hart.

368
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh I've heard of it but I haven't seen it.

369
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Based on true events to where everything goes well in the delivery room.

370
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
They have the baby.

371
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's all great.

372
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And then Kevin Hart's wife dies due to a pulmonary embolism which I googled it.

373
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I googled it immediately after watching this movie.

374
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So Kevin Hart has to raise the baby by himself.

375
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So I made the mistake of watching that movie on Netflix.

376
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Candace went to go get her hair done.

377
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We just found out she was pregnant.

378
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Went to go get her hair done.

379
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And I was like I'm going to sit down with my dog and watch a movie on Netflix for the heck of it.

380
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I watched this movie.

381
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm like Fatherhood this should be great.

382
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And then I watched this movie.

383
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm like oh my god.

384
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Like this is a very real thing that could happen now.

385
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So the whole time that was my number one thing in my head was like pulmonary embolism.

386
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You got to move.

387
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Can't have blood clots in the legs.

388
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So I became that guy where I was like learning everything I possibly could to make sure this doesn't happen.

389
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Because if I have to raise this baby by myself.

390
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Boy oh boy.

391
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Boy oh boy.

392
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And also I told her I think if something happened where Candace went down during the pregnancy and I had the baby I would kind of dislike the baby a little bit.

393
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That's immediately.

394
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That's a victim.

395
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That's one victim.

396
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Right over in the very beginning.

397
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
He's got one down already.

398
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
One down.

399
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Who knows how many more to go.

400
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Candace said if like there was a thing going on in the room where there was a decision to be made between her and the baby who would you pick.

401
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I said well I'm going to pick you because I don't know the baby.

402
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Like the baby could be a murderer.

403
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Like the baby could have turned out bad.

404
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I could be saving people right now.

405
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This is such a like a roller coaster ride between like monkey prank and then like the worst reality possibly.

406
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You really went you really went on both sides like.

407
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I did.

408
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah.

409
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Getting a little peek behind the curtain a little bit.

410
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
How my brain works.

411
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Sure.

412
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You took it dark by the way.

413
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm not I'm not wishing ill on Candace or anyone involved.

414
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But if something actually bad happens.

415
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Baby's great.

416
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That's great.

417
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Well yeah that's one.

418
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We're not in the dark the monkey reality.

419
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We're in the happy timeline.

420
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
If you if something had gone wrong and then you still had the monkey thing loaded up.

421
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Oh now is it just like hey can you exit through the window.

422
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I have some actual bad news to report.

423
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah we definitely I don't think that like this I guess one way of thinking would be the monkey would kind of if the monkey delivered the news it'd be a little like I don't know.

424
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Like would it be better.

425
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I don't think it'd be better right.

426
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
One and it's in might seem insensitive but it might kind of brighten the mood as well because everyone got to see a mandrill.

427
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah.

428
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Right.

429
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And roll is cool.

430
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah.

431
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I guess it depends on if the monkey delivers the news before or after he rips some faces off.

432
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That's true.

433
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That is true.

434
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It could just be a real bad day in that room.

435
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
But no no luckily everything turned out great.

436
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
He's an adorable little guy.

437
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And yeah no monkeys were were utilized.

438
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
No people were harmed by monkeys.

439
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
No in the making of this baby.

440
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It was a fairly regular delivery for the most part.

441
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It went it went a week but I mean it was a fairly regular delivery.

442
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Sure is a while.

443
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And we were just talking before I had seen that like I think you were trying to induce pregnancy by like doing like an eight hour.

444
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Were you waiting for figment popcorn bucket that day.

445
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
No no that was a different day.

446
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Oh my god.

447
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That was a different day.

448
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But like that that's a perfect example of pregnant Candice.

449
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Pregnant Candice.

450
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:32,000
We have serious FOMO and well I do in particular and I abide by one Disney rule and that's if you see something and you have the opportunity to get it you better get it because it's going to sell out and it's going to be on eBay and it's going to be a million dollars.

451
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So if you have the chance you got to get it.

452
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So we went to Epcot that day to where the popcorn bucket was on sale and the line got down to about four hours three to four hours.

453
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And the rumor the rumor online was it was like seven hours.

454
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So hearing three to four hours when you've been hearing seven hours it was kind of like man like three to four hours ain't bad if we went in this line.

455
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So and when you're pregnant wife how pregnant was as pregnant as you can get I think at that point.

456
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You can be the most pregnant you can be.

457
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Wow.

458
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Most pregnant you can be without a baby coming out.

459
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Like if your pregnant wife is like I'm OK waiting in this line.

460
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
What are you going to say.

461
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You're going to say like no I'm tired I want to go home.

462
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's like you're OK doing it.

463
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So of course I'm going to do it.

464
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So we definitely waited in line for the figment popcorn bucket.

465
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It was only like three to four hours.

466
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So it wasn't that bad.

467
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It wasn't bad at all.

468
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Three to four.

469
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'd be complaining about it after 10 minutes and I don't have the ability to get pregnant.

470
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah.

471
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Yeah. Yeah. But then like you said like Candice had the idea to walk around Disney to induce labor.

472
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So we walked around Disney Springs the night before and the morning that we were supposed to go and get induced because Candice was hoping we'd be able to walk and it would help induction.

473
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So the morning that we were going to induce we actually had breakfast reservations to get Tonga toast.

474
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So like Candice booked it.

475
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
She's like let's go Ohana.

476
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
No not Ohana.

477
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's Kona Cafe.

478
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah.

479
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
He's got it.

480
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah Kona Cafe.

481
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Let's go to Kona Cafe and let's get Tonga toast and eat breakfast.

482
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So we drove out to Disney and morning of the induction drove out to Disney ate Tonga toast had a great morning.

483
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And to be fair that's one of Candice's favorite memories because she would always she says now she was hoping to walk around Disney and she just or she'd imagine it'd be like a TV show to where the water would break.

484
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You'd be like my water broke.

485
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
We got to go to the hospital like one of those fun little instances.

486
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Well when her water broke the next day two days later at like four in the morning she said it was like a cartoon cartoony pop that happens like a real cartoony pop right right and then like liquid just doesn't stop coming.

487
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So she's like in hindsight I'm really glad my water didn't break at Disney.

488
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's kind of awful.

489
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
She was thinking it was going to be a TV thing not a TV thing.

490
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I was with the Lion King thing as well.

491
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Not like that at all.

492
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Because then the park has to put up signs that say you may get wet.

493
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yeah.

494
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What is what's different about Tonga toast than I know it's different than regular toast but what is what what is Tonga toast specifically compressed you never had Tonga toast.

495
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm not a Tonga and where is the Kona Cafe that's Disney.

496
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's in the Polynesia Polynesia Polynesian.

497
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
What makes it is also in the Polynesian which I also recommend very highly great stuff, especially the noodles, if they're back, but I think they're back.

498
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
They are back.

499
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So he knows so much about this.

500
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
He knows.

501
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
He knows.

502
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
He knows.

503
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I've stayed there.

504
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But not recently.

505
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
No not since 1991.

506
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That's what I'm saying.

507
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yes.

508
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Somebody ever stayed since 1991 and you're up on their current menu items.

509
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I keep up on what the you know fans the real heads are talking about.

510
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The noodle thing was a thing for a hot minute.

511
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
People were real mad about the noodles.

512
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Real mad about the noodles.

513
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I knew about the noodles too.

514
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It was a hot thing online.

515
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The Tonga toast is basically like it's like a brick like a brick of toast filled with bananas.

516
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:21,000
They like it's like French toast but they like roll it in cinnamon sugar and it's stuffed with bananas and you pour like strawberry syrup on top of it.

517
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's delicious.

518
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
My number one if I had to pick one Disney World breakfast I think I would go Tonga toast.

519
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I think that would be my choice there.

520
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I don't know.

521
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I wasn't looking at what anybody's feeds were doing but with the video ability we have currently was there just.

522
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Did Jason's eyes get glazed like donut glade.

523
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Did you just like tear up to the street doing a clay only the listener can tell us.

524
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I mean I just usually have a certain level of donut glaze on me at any given time.

525
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I just naturally secrete it.

526
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah I have not had it either.

527
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I will I will have it next time though.

528
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's great.

529
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Highly high recommendation.

530
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's probably one of my highest recommendations I can give is Tonga toast.

531
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah.

532
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
All right.

533
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Well on that note today's toast pick.

534
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Today's toast pick is Tonga toast.

535
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Let's I think OK let's get to the main course here.

536
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Power Rangers Live.

537
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I think let's get titles correct.

538
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh yes.

539
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
There are a few of them.

540
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
There are a few.

541
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah.

542
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
What I saw of the video that we watched I think is Mighty Morphin Power Rangers World Tour live on stage.

543
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But what does everyone else have?

544
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That sounds about right.

545
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I don't remember but it sounds about right.

546
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I think the shorter one was just Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Alive.

547
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Sure.

548
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Gets the job done.

549
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah.

550
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
There is currently a placeholder website for a Power Rangers live show.

551
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes.

552
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It is a WordPress.

553
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It is one page.

554
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
There is a video play button that is just a PNG file.

555
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It does not play anything.

556
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But I did sign up to find out if it's coming to my area and it is there are tickets for sale in Philadelphia in November.

557
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
There was a stunt show in Japan Power Rangers show in Japan when we were there a couple of years.

558
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We didn't see it but they there.

559
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
At the Tokyo Dome.

560
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Tokyo Dome.

561
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah.

562
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Tokyo Dome city at least.

563
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I don't know if it was in the Tokyo Dome itself.

564
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But yes.

565
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So there's been versions of it but we're talking today about the first version.

566
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
The 90s at the height of Power Rangers Mania live tour that went around the country.

567
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Right.

568
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And it is like it's documented pretty well.

569
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
This is like we've talked on the show about the Ninja Turtles coming out of their shells tour.

570
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
There was a this was a thing people were doing at the time.

571
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Obviously Sesame Street Live.

572
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
He-Man was predated that.

573
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
We talked about He-Man.

574
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We've talked about.

575
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah.

576
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So this was their version of it which I would say this is like almost maybe the biggest budget version.

577
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'd say so.

578
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
This thing is pretty impressive.

579
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
From the video.

580
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
When you look at it.

581
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Who all of the people here today experienced this live in person?

582
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Johnny.

583
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Johnny did.

584
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yep.

585
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I did it.

586
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yes.

587
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Did you do it or no?

588
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I saw it.

589
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I saw it.

590
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Not me.

591
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I have specific memories.

592
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I saw it at Philadelphia's Convention Hall which was an old venue down by the University

593
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
of Pennsylvania.

594
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It used to be called the Philadelphia Civic Center.

595
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
This is where the Jackson Five did their first concert for Motown Records.

596
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Wow.

597
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
A lot of NCAA games were there.

598
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:22,000
WCW programed their 1989 and 1992 Halloween Havoc pay per views and the 94 Slammery there.

599
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And it is long since bulldozed.

600
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh wow.

601
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
How could they?

602
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
One of my biggest memories of the show.

603
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
This was just forever glued in my memory.

604
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It doesn't have anything to do with the show itself.

605
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I was sitting next to someone who smelled so strongly of gherkin pickles.

606
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
This is a childhood like eight or nine year old memory.

607
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Gherkin.

608
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Specifically the sweet pickle.

609
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Very specific memory.

610
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Gherkins.

611
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And it just haunted me.

612
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
The whole show was so distracting because I was like their coat is bleeding over into

613
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
my skin.

614
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Am I going to smell like gherkin pickles?

615
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Why does this person smell like gherkin pickles?

616
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What is happening?

617
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Gherkin.

618
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Which has pulled my attention so many times during this show.

619
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Questions.

620
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
How do you know gherkin as opposed to other pickles?

621
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Well I was a nasty little pickle kid Scott.

622
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Ow.

623
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Ow my ears.

624
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You didn't say pickle boy though.

625
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I didn't.

626
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I didn't.

627
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Thankfully.

628
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
No.

629
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But nasty.

630
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
That's really the crazy word there.

631
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I think I had been really into gherkin pickles as a kid and then for a while I could not

632
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
eat them because I was so haunted by this memory.

633
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't even know if I said anything to my family.

634
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
My family might be learning about this very glued in my memory instance.

635
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
How could you not tell us?

636
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You've lived with this for decades?

637
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah.

638
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Wow.

639
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Maybe they worked at the factory?

640
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I mean it could be.

641
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Was it nearby?

642
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
There was a lot of larger factory food production factories in Philadelphia at the time.

643
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I think also one of my memories of the show is there not being, I mean there was plenty

644
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
of Power Rangers merchandise for sale at the time.

645
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
At the show I don't remember really coming back with a souvenir.

646
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And that was a real souvenir kid.

647
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I had, watching, it rehashed my memory watching YouTube video.

648
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I definitely bought one of the weird sword things that they show in the crowd that people

649
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
have, like the weird rainbow sword thing, but had nothing to do with Power Rangers.

650
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I don't know why it was for sale.

651
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Obviously they just had them left over from something.

652
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
They were like hey we're going to sell them for a Power Rangers show.

653
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
General events.

654
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And I looked online, so me and Candice looked, and the only merchandise we could find was

655
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
a denim jacket with Power Rangers World Tour and a denim vest with Power Rangers World

656
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Tour.

657
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I don't know why if those were on sale at the show.

658
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It felt like they would be.

659
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But what a weird particular choice of souvenir to have is a denim vest or jacket to sell

660
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
for children.

661
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yeah, that, the children.

662
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But they also had a program.

663
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I did have a program as well.

664
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So that was.

665
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You can find the program online.

666
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We did, we did a, we just, in February we did a lot of celebrity restaurants for Celebruary

667
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and almost every restaurant had a denim jacket or vest.

668
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So it feels like that was a 90s thing that like business people were like well we gotta

669
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
sell a denim vest.

670
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We have to sell that.

671
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Leno had only been on tonight's show for a couple years, so everybody, and everyone was

672
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
taking their cues from him, comedically and stylistically.

673
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Of course.

674
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
He was our America's fashion voice.

675
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
That's right.

676
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So what other choice did you have?

677
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
He had to use denim.

678
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Johnny, where'd you, where did you see, what were the circumstances of Power Rangers Live?

679
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Okay, so I saw mine in Cleveland, Ohio, where I grew up and where I frequent very often.

680
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's my hometown.

681
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And I remember I went there with, it was me, my mom, my dad, and my friends and their mom.

682
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I also remember, especially during that time period, my mom used to make me costumes all

683
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the time.

684
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Used to make, there's pictures of me as a child dressed like the Green Ranger, dressed

685
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
like the White Ranger, dressed like Shawn Michaels when I got into my wrestling phase.

686
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So I remember I dressed like the White Ranger to go to this Power Rangers Live.

687
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And I'm not going to say I invented cosplay, but it was one of the first incarnations of

688
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
cosplay because a lot of parents and people were stopping me just to try to take pictures

689
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
of me in my sweet White Ranger outfit.

690
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So they'd be like, hey, you hit a pose.

691
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And I'd do a pose.

692
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And so people on their disposable cameras have pictures of young Johnny.

693
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
If you live in Cleveland, Ohio, and went to Power Rangers Live, you might have a little

694
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
White Ranger kid posing on your disposable camera somewhere and it'd be me.

695
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So yeah, I remember that in particular.

696
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I also remember, so I was a very shy, socially awkward kid growing up.

697
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So like I didn't want to get picked on.

698
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Like I had a weird thing.

699
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Like don't pick on me.

700
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Like don't call me on stage, which is weird, obviously what my job ended up being.

701
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But don't call me on stage.

702
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Don't like call me out in the crowd.

703
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Like on the video, as you'll see, like when the putties run the crowd, I'm horrified.

704
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm like, don't I don't want to hit like a putty to grab me and pull me up on stage.

705
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
That was my worst fear as a child for some reason was being pulled up on stage at any point

706
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and being like, look at this kid.

707
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I thought that wouldn't happen.

708
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Just look at him.

709
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The part of the, you remember the part of the Power Rangers Live when they brought a random kid on stage.

710
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Everyone look at this kid.

711
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We don't usually do this, but when a kid's dorky enough.

712
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Bring him up.

713
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Man, yeah, I yeah, I said that's because I saw the Turtles Tour and I had a similar thing,

714
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
but they did not have as many bad guys in the audience.

715
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
They didn't really even have many foot soldiers.

716
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But this thing had putty like tons of putties.

717
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Putties are like the goons of Power Rangers.

718
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
If you don't know.

719
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And it was the second generation putties with the little putty like Lord Zed logo, which if you hit, make them explode.

720
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It made them easier to beat.

721
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't know why they upgraded to an easier to beat thing,

722
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
but they all of a sudden had like light gray with a little like target on their chest essentially.

723
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And if you just punched it, it would destroy them.

724
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah, it's pride, I guess.

725
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah, Zed came first.

726
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I was not. I did not like the putties on the show.

727
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I was happy when they died.

728
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But I don't know any other way to put it.

729
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
They make this Scott.

730
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
They make this horrible noise that's like, like, yeah, I did not like that.

731
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Can I say that a lot of why I didn't mind when my mom just plainly said, don't get into the Power Rangers.

732
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And I agreed.

733
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Some of it was because in rewatching it, I go right back there that I do find so much of the show like nails on a chalkboard.

734
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
The putty sounds is one of the things.

735
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And then the helmet head, Alpha Five.

736
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Alpha Five.

737
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I hate the I so thoroughly.

738
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I didn't like it.

739
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Then I know it hit the same register as like baby bop on Barney.

740
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That was kind of around the same time.

741
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Just like too irritating, too irritating.

742
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And my crit did everybody love Alpha Five?

743
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Am I a monster?

744
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Kids like the Alpha Five.

745
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yeah, I like a little fair.

746
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I watched I just watched the YouTube clip back.

747
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
My mom was in town for Mother's Day.

748
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So we watched it together to prepare for this.

749
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
She was there when I was a kid.

750
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And she even said, like, man, he said, I a lot.

751
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Like, so she even got like a weird head where she was like, I hate Alpha Five.

752
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So I didn't be like an adult thing now where we hate Alpha Five.

753
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
But I think I remember kids probably loved him.

754
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
He seemed like he would be loved.

755
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But yeah, I think a little bit of slapstick in like a, you know, half hour show goes is pretty good in an hour and 10 minute stage show.

756
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
There is like a lot of slapstick.

757
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
There's a lot of hijinks in this.

758
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I was not I don't I did not dislike Alpha, but I was more of a Zorda.

759
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I like Zorda better.

760
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Zorda is a disembodied head in a tube played eventually by Brian Cranston in the new movie, which is great.

761
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But but my my thing was with I just will get social clips from this show that I feel like like when I'm watching this show,

762
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
like when I'm watching it, like I'm ignoring any words that are said.

763
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But some of like when I'm watching the monsters yell, I go, this is maybe like my ideal version of entertainment.

764
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Like when Goldar is just yelling Power Rangers, I go, this is maybe the height of entertainment for me.

765
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
He suits screaming like this feels like Shakespeare to me.

766
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm not listening to anything he says. Doesn't matter.

767
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's just like this aesthetic now has been so burned in my brain that I love it.

768
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And at the time I loved it because like the kids are fine.

769
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I like Tommy. I thought he was cool.

770
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I thought they were all cool. Yeah.

771
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But the monsters were the thing I think I like the best.

772
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Is there some of that for you, Johnny, where like this is live entertainment that is fighting and where you cheer good guys and boo bad guys?

773
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Was that like getting into your brain is like, I like this.

774
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I like the feel of this.

775
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Do you think it had anything to do with the mental chemistry of getting wrestling?

776
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I definitely think that like I say this all the time.

777
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Like I when I was little, I wanted to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.

778
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Then I wanted to be a Power Ranger.

779
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And then ultimately I wanted to be a pro wrestler because I feel like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and Power Rangers weren't real jobs I could attain in real life.

780
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah. And we take it seriously, I guess.

781
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
There's only six slots too. You got a lot more chances.

782
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That's true.

783
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So I think like it's one of those things where like I could put on a different little costume and fight bad guys and be a pro wrestler.

784
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I think it definitely played a part in my ultimate evolution and becoming a pro wrestler.

785
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's just because, you know, I couldn't be Tommy from the Power Rangers growing up.

786
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
What'd you say? Like there's so like, you know, there's Johnny, there's all this talk about, you know, where you're going to wrestle next.

787
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Let's forget that. What if somebody came to you with a third option and said Power Rangers live on tour, you get to be the new Green Ranger and you can like sort of maybe do better.

788
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Like the fighting would be a lot better if you're doing it, I would say.

789
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Yeah. At one point I asked Candace, how much do you think these guys got paid?

790
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Oh, oh, oh, don't know.

791
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
No, don't look at the back.

792
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
That's bad. Real bad. Yeah.

793
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yeah.

794
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Not knowing anything.

795
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We're traveling every night, right?

796
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I mean, we're traveling city to city.

797
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So they had to feed them some soup or something.

798
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
They got nothing.

799
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
They got one cup of soup every night.

800
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I think, you know, there's a decent chance because like the actors on the show on Power Rangers were so screwed.

801
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
They were doing some stuff too. Like they were like going hard.

802
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Some of them were like some of the karate stuff, like obviously they weren't coming close at all in their strikes or anything like that.

803
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
But like, right.

804
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:09,000
At one point, and I don't want to spoil the show, but at one point when the Power Rangers jump out, like they all like had their moment where they all like show up on the screen and they're like, I'm going to jump out and have my moment.

805
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Like they were jumping off the stage and like the fact that they didn't get seriously injured blew my mind.

806
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah.

807
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
They were doing some, it was like slam dunk contest for a minute with Power Rangers.

808
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yeah, yeah.

809
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
There's in the I think maybe it was one of the videos of the press event they had where like there's a couple of big falls they take.

810
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So, yeah, I was going to say I think there's a decent chance because the actual actors that did Power Rangers were not in this show, but their voices were.

811
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But there's a chance that the actors who were actually doing the stunt work for this live show were paid better than the actors on the show because the actors on the show were so screwed over.

812
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Like people were fired.

813
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Half the team was fired just because they wanted actual real money that was being generated by the show.

814
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I was not thrilled with that cast change because the leader of the team was named Jason and suddenly it's a guy named Rocky.

815
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Oh yeah.

816
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But I believe the storyline so intently and I was like, well, they have to go to that peace conference.

817
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So on the other hand.

818
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You thought the reason.

819
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I was like, what?

820
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
They won't give them sag representation.

821
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
They're making hand over the bond companies making money hand over fist.

822
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You know, so it's crazy and I don't want to get too depressing here because because it sucks to like think of the reality sometimes of the stuff we watch as kids.

823
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Brett, I have a clip here, clip three.

824
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
If you could play real quick.

825
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's so crazy that the actors are not getting paid very well.

826
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And then this is the video going out to entice like places like cities to bring Power Rangers to them.

827
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So whenever you're ready here, hopefully this works.

828
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
The number one rated kid's trip in October sweeps.

829
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Look at this. They're just shit talking all the other shows kicking bonkers ass.

830
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Power Rangers clearly marry Melody's Tom and Jerry kids.

831
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Seven each shift.

832
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
We're just looking at a bar graph.

833
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
The show remained on the very top.

834
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Bonkers way at the fuck you.

835
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You bonkers.

836
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Power Rangers destroying the cat Bobby's World.

837
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You're getting the great Bobby World doing pretty good across the nation.

838
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah, that was high.

839
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, I cut the ego.

840
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
We're good.

841
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So I've got a 10.6.

842
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah, Bobby's are highly rated show.

843
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Apparently rating that don't exist anymore.

844
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Like the when the finale of This Is Us will not come close to one random Bobby's World.

845
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What the hell was those seeing those numbers really makes me think how popular television was back in the day.

846
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Crazy.

847
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

848
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Oh my God.

849
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And Power Rangers had Darkwing Duckle.

850
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
They got a three point six.

851
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Yeah, I think Darkwing Duck was wrapping up its run.

852
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You know, Bobby's World still might be on top.

853
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Bobby's World was hot.

854
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The storylines were compelling.

855
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yeah, well, it aired earlier in the lineup.

856
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So you're losing kids as the block goes on.

857
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So by the time it gets to X-Men, you might be a little.

858
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
They got chores to do.

859
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yeah, sweep the yard.

860
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I was impressed with the cats performance, quite frankly.

861
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I like to eat.

862
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Yeah.

863
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But Power Rangers obviously was like doing so well, making so much money.

864
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Yeah.

865
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The actors on the show getting screwed.

866
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But yeah, live performance.

867
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
We don't know.

868
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
There might have been a union.

869
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
They might have gotten OK pay is what I'm saying.

870
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Maybe to be part of this touring entity that might lead into something I was going to bring up, Mike, which is so the impetus for doing a tour was that they on

871
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Presidents Day in 1994, there was an event held at the Universal Amphitheater here in L.A.

872
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:47,000
that was done in conjunction with the DARE program, which was this initiative in the 90s to get a bunch of black shirts to a bunch of kids for them to end up at Goodwills, ironically, decades down the line.

873
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Very successful in that.

874
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Maybe not in anything else.

875
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So working with the DARE program, the Power Rangers did a live event.

876
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And the idea here was that this was going to be just a Universal Studios thing and they were going to do it in one of the theaters they have in the park, maybe in the cone in the barbarian stage or something.

877
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Then they got wind of how many people were interested in seeing the Power Rangers.

878
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And it like it was just going to be like, I don't know, we'll do a little thing in the afternoon.

879
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Right. So many people were coming.

880
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
They had to upgrade it to the Universal Amphitheater, which holds six thousand people.

881
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
The Gibson?

882
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It became the Gibson Amphitheater.

883
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah, right, right.

884
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And it became so six thousand people it holds.

885
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
They had to do six shows, ultimately.

886
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Thirty six thousand people came, which is one of the top days in the history of Universal Studios.

887
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Thirty six thousand.

888
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Thirty six thousand people showed up on one day, which caused the freeways to back up.

889
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And this, which brings me into the clip that I labeled freeways.

890
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
This is a little like, you know, to start getting the word out about the Power Rangers tour,

891
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,000
like, well, you're going to have to book this in your mega venue, because look what happened when we barely even announced it in L.A.

892
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And then it caused pandemonium throughout the city.

893
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Power Rangers gridlock in the northbound Hollywood freeway.

894
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It was a monstrous mess of traffic.

895
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Their power is so great, their mere presence backed up freeway traffic for 10 miles.

896
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So widen your freeways and prepare your town for the end of the decade.

897
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Widen your freeway.

898
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Change your zoning laws.

899
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
That's where all that construction was in Cleveland during that time.

900
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Oh, they were widening the freeway.

901
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
They had to.

903
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Hurry, cancel everything else.

904
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Cancel funding across the city.

905
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
All other programs canceled.

906
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That, that Universal Hollywood event happens with the original cast.

907
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And then by the time the live show goes on tour, then the new cast and a new cast of Zords has taken over.

908
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That changeover happened right after.

909
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
OK, OK. Wow.

910
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
That changeover.

911
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I mean, so all the Power Rangers listeners, if you don't know this, all the Power Rangers stuff is reused footage and costumes from a Japanese series called Super Sentai is kind of the umbrella name for it.

912
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:12,000
So every see they would film seasons of that and then eventually send the costumes to the American productions where they would write new stories and then film the actors, you know, without the helmets on and stuff.

913
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Yes, it would be a mix.

914
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And you could tell as a kid that it was a mix.

915
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Yeah.

916
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Like sometimes you go, well, this footage looks older than this other footage.

917
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yes, when they show in the show seems ancient.

918
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yeah, when they're fighting outside, it looks the footage looks 10 years older than when they're in the school.

919
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's like faulty towers.

920
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Like he leaves as faulty leaves and then goes to like much darker footage shot way different than how it looks inside.

921
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yeah.

922
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So, yeah, they were like there was all this cost saving things they were doing for the show.

923
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But not for the tour.

924
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Based on what happened, the early Carmageddon that shut down all of Los Angeles, they knew that they had gold on their hands, as well as gold are on their hands.

925
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So when they were going to start this tour, they knew like they had a lot of money to spend.

926
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
We'd have the number somewhere.

927
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I think.

928
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Let's see.

929
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
The guy was the guy who pitched his take on it was told by Saban.

930
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You've got three million to mount the show and a ten million dollar budget to take it on the road.

931
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I don't know what things cost, but that seems high to me.

932
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And they also just loaded this thing up with a bunch of people who mainly did concert tours.

933
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
People like rock and roll impresario Ricky Farr.

934
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Did you come across that name?

935
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I saw.

936
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I just like the sound of it.

937
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Rock and roll impresario Ricky Farr.

938
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah. Well, impresario is a great word.

939
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yeah. Yeah.

940
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It was a it was him and a bunch of people who did who mainly before this did like Rod Stewart tours.

941
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And there's a lot of I found a couple of articles where they're framing it in light of like, I mean, what would Rod think of this?

942
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And how do you know and how do you get Rod level production values to the Power Rangers?

943
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And and they would say, well, we measure it against.

944
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Well, if Rod would like it, then it'd be good enough for just a really strange juxtaposition.

945
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And then also a guy who was a promoter who put the thing together.

946
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
His name was Marcel Avram.

947
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And this is a photo I have, Brett, loaded up.

948
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I'll describe it for people who are just listening.

949
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But if you could if you could pull up Marcel Avram, just, you know, the level of Titan we're dealing with putting the show together.

950
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
That's Marcel on the far right with the beard.

951
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
He looks like a Brett Gellman character.

952
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And he is standing. He's in like a big hand huddle with bad era Michael Jackson, who is between the very tan Siegfried and Roy, who are both wearing cowboy hats.

953
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Wow. Look at those outfits.

954
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Some very bold, some very experimental cowboy uniform, as well as I believe that guy's name is Frank Grillo, Michael Jackson's manager for a long time, who's in Goodfellas.

955
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
He acts in Goodfellas.

956
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I was going to say, why is Paulie Walnuts there?

957
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
He's very much that. And he's he's in Wayne's World.

958
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
He's like the music guy in the limo.

959
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Oh, yeah. They have to impress.

960
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Yeah. What a tight. What a weird guy who was in Michael Jackson orbit.

961
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:22,000
But anyway, Marcel Avram and that guy not only put concerts together with Michael Jackson, but also sued sued Michael Jackson several times, once for five point three million dollars for not she sued him for millions of dollars.

962
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And then they settled and then he tried it again.

963
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I don't know. Let's try working with Michael again.

964
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And he just didn't show up.

965
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And these people, this is who we're dealing with, who we're putting on.

966
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
What I'm getting at is this is more than just people are doing a couple of kicks on stage.

967
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
This is concert level.

968
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yeah. Big pyro bursts throughout and trying to keep a Rod Stewart pedigree.

969
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That's a yeah, those are heavy hitters.

970
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah. Business.

971
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And you are.

972
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And you see it on stage, I think, especially we'll get to the finale.

973
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But the finale is very impressive.

974
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Oh, my God. Yeah.

975
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It's very, very cool.

976
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And yeah, first is like Turtles where Turtles feels like that show was on a budget, you know, like the set was like, OK, there weren't that many dancers.

977
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And then there wasn't much fighting.

978
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
They replaced the fighting with songs.

979
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yes. Yeah.

980
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
They just like, incidentally, well, we have to represent the idea of fighting.

981
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
We have to kind of like move around slightly to suggest what fighting might be like.

982
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
This is much more of a full on fighting stunt show.

983
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So so I remember I remember I was very disappointed going to it because I expected the actual actors would be there.

984
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Right. Yeah.

985
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So I expected like Tommy was going to show up and like take off his mask helmet and be like, hey, guys, like I'm Tommy.

986
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Good to be in Cleveland, Ohio. Like that didn't happen, obviously.

987
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:51,000
But I will say watching it back now, like it goes so far outside of the normal Power Rangers script.

988
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Because the normal Power Rangers set up obviously every single Power Rangers episode you watch any single one now as an adult, you can kind of catch on.

989
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It's Power Rangers show up. They do some stuff.

990
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
They make a bad guy. Bad guy shows up. Power Rangers fight the bad guy in little form.

991
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
They start beating the bad guy in little form. They make him grow. He grows up. They get the Zords. They beat him with the Zords.

992
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
End of show. Every single show that happens. Watching it back now and watching the live stage show.

993
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
They don't do that at all. Yeah. For some reason, the Zords fight the little guy, the little Luma Tor monster.

994
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And like the Luma Tor monster beats the Zords by himself in little form.

995
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yes. And then the Power Rangers are like, oh, we got to fight him. It's it's very wild.

996
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And I will say I also was very taken aback by the random magic. They decided to kind of have a magic show.

997
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know why they had magic for some phrase.

998
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And they were like, we got to make the show entertaining.

999
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Let's add some magic and turn the Power Rangers into birds for a random reason. Yeah. Monkeys or birds or.

1000
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I don't believe they say the phrase Parrot Rangers.

1001
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It seems like it was right there. Yeah, I know. Right there. They blew it. Yeah.

1002
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Here I have a clip just of the show to give people a little taste. Audio and video and a clip of there in here.

1003
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:11,000
There's some magic. We can cut this off at any time. But this is clip eight, please.

1004
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
This is like Zed, Lord Zed. So Lord Zed is one of my favorite characters in fiction also.

1005
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
He's so fun. He's so cool looking. We've talked about Ivan. He's a lot.

1006
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
We love Ivan news. Johnny, I don't know. You and I have a news fan.

1007
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I like Ivan news. I'm a big Power Rangers movie guy. Are you more Zed or Ivan?

1008
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I think Zed. I'm more Zed, I think. Yeah. I have a Zed helmet back there.

1009
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Oh, yeah, I've seen that. Yeah, yeah. I've seen that. It's fun. Yeah, it's fun.

1010
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Zed was scared. Scott Zed came in on the second season.

1011
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And when I say second season, I mean, there were dozens and dozens of episodes and then Zed showed up.

1012
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
But they kind of Power Rangers for a little while would air every weekday.

1013
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Wow. New episodes. Yes. Eventually shifted to kind of like a new one once or twice a week.

1014
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
He was married to Rita. Yeah. So he was the original villain.

1015
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And I like Rita too, by the way. I'm not trying to put Rita down.

1016
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
But it seems like Rita became kind of a joke in the face of. Yeah. Yes.

1017
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
She was always kind of like schticky. But then like Zed shows up and like, oh, he's a bad guy.

1018
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
He deposed Rita Repulsa. Eventually, she concocts a love potion and forces them to get married to each other.

1019
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
As you do. Yes. They treat. They treat her like shit in this. Yeah.

1020
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah. I was kind of uncomfortable by reading this live show.

1021
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I was like, wow, there's so many to her.

1022
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And she look, she has an annoying voice. That's that's part of the character.

1023
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
That was in there, too. I couldn't. Yes. But but they're mean to her in this clip.

1024
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So you're going to get in this clip. You're going to get some Lord Zed's plan.

1025
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
You're going to see why I think he's one of my favorite characters in fiction.

1026
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You're going to see them being mean to read and then you're going to get a little magic as well.

1027
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So so whenever you're ready, it's all here. Yeah.

1028
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yeah. I plan to do away with the Rangers and capture this entire city in one fell swoop.

1029
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Oh, yeah. Right. I've heard that before. Please cover this witch.

1030
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I'm so mean. They were they dated before this. Yeah. Yeah.

1031
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Yeah, their buddies are taking Rita away now. They weren't exclusive.

1032
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And they're doing this straight up David Copperfield like magic trick, putting her behind a curtain in order to draw the Rangers away from their home and away from.

1033
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So then she's like doing the trick where she disappears basically.

1034
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And unleash him upon this town. Then as the power rages come to fight my creation, Goldar will ambush and capture them two at a time and bring them here.

1035
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So what will we do with them? I mean, a great voice.

1036
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I haven't decided yet. There's a very complicated plan, by the way.

1037
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Two at a time. We're going to take the Rangers and then they're going to come to the arena.

1038
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Yeah, we're not with the magic.

1039
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
The magic.

1040
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So lifting into the air. Yeah, you can stop the clip whenever it's not that impressive of a magic trick.

1041
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I'll say this. It's Rita. How does this play out?

1042
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So it takes Rita like is like behind the curtain and they're trying to act like they've like put her in there and she's now ascending somehow.

1043
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But like she there's like a minute or two where she's clearly just like crawling out a hole or something.

1044
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
There's like it wasn't like an instantaneous thing where you see that trick sometimes.

1045
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But it is obviously the setup to some sort of a disappearing act trick.

1046
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
And yeah, they were using those little things.

1047
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
She like does she she comes out then she's replaced by a smaller.

1048
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Oh, yeah. So so yeah, when the clip keeps going.

1049
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Sorry, I cut it up, but she turns into like a small version and they put her in a little like box.

1050
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And yeah, that's one of the one of the many mean things they do to her in the show.

1051
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
She comes back to it. She's also, by the way, she's got a purple outfit, which was not her normal outfit.

1052
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
If I'm if I'm not mistaken, she usually had like a was it a gray or a brown outfit?

1053
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I think it was brown. Yeah, yeah.

1054
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It could have been purple and it was just so desaturated.

1055
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It's also possible the VHS footage was not kept up the finest.

1056
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I love going online, but I hate that big tech companies can see what I'm looking at.

1057
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I hate it so much. I wish I could like the companies on fire.

1058
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Which just so happens to be the power set of Sebastian Jackal,

1059
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Crystal Lloyd's character from UPN's Deadly Games.

1060
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Coming up on the second gate, we take a look at Sebastian Jackal, who he is, why he hates Dr. Gus Lloyd.

1061
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And I bet we'll have some laughs along the way.

1062
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So head to Patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

1063
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That's oh geez.

1064
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:50,000
P a t r e o n dot c o m slash p o d c a s t t h e r i d e.

1065
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
This is not an Internet security product.

1066
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It's an episode about Sebastian Jackal,

1067
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Christopher Lloyd's character from UPN's Deadly Games.

1068
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Once again, that's Patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

1069
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
For all your Sebastian Jackal needs.

1070
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
On the topic of Rita, can I ask for one of my clips?

1071
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And the clip is called Hey Rita.

1072
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I have this clip too, Scott, but you go ahead because I am very excited.

1073
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Wait, really? 100 percent.

1074
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I have. Well, say anything you want to say.

1075
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
How did you come across Hey Rita?

1076
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
OK, so we were talking about turtles and I was saying when I was watching this, I was like, man,

1077
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
it would be fun if they had song like original songs.

1078
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
And I was like, they don't have original songs in this too.

1079
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
But I go, I wonder if. Yeah, here we go.

1080
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I wonder if the Power Rangers ever did have original songs.

1081
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So you look it up and there is a I'm sure as you discovered a full Power Rangers music album.

1082
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Some songs used on the show, some not written by this guy, Ron Wasserman,

1083
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
who wrote the theme song to Power Rangers, also co-wrote X-Men theme.

1084
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,000
This is a legendary guy, genius, hot in Cleveland theme.

1085
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Mummy's Alive theme. This is a guy who's done.

1086
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Look at his IMDB. It's very impressive.

1087
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
So, yes, it seems like he believed that kids could.

1088
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I think like a lot of kids composers held back and were softer.

1089
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Yes. He was a guy saying, no, kids can handle metal.

1090
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
They can handle ultra fast drums.

1091
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
And that's that's what he brought into the theme song, which, by the way, he was brought into Saban told,

1092
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
OK, we need it by tomorrow.

1093
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And it's got to have the word go in it.

1094
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Does he comes back the next morning? Go, go Power Rangers.

1095
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Wow. Yep. Yeah. They give him a very clear assignment.

1096
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Hey, tell you what, I'll give you two to goes for the price of one.

1097
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I've been obsessed with Hey Rita since high school because I found I found a I found a cassette at the ninety nine cents store of a Power Rangers album.

1098
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
This seems silly. Most of it kind of drag. Who cares?

1099
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Yeah. But this song has something special.

1100
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And the challenge I issued to anyone who hasn't heard Hey Rita is to try to make out a single lyric of Hey Rita.

1101
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
OK, so that'll be for Jason and Johnny to hear.

1102
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yes. I know the lyrics already.

1103
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I don't remember this at all. OK, OK.

1104
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Hey Rita.

1105
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Hey Rita.

1106
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Rita.

1107
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Rita.

1108
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Rita.

1109
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Rita.

1110
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Rita.

1111
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Rita.

1112
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
All right. I caught girl.

1113
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Rita.

1114
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Yeah.

1115
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I think I heard something about it.

1116
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
It is a key to a.

1117
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Yes.

1118
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Yes.

1119
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It looks like the lyrics are online.

1120
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Oh, wow. I mean, I just like is I because I've always thought I heard the word to keto perhaps tequila.

1121
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
No, I don't think tequila is in there.

1122
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Would you like some tequila?

1123
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Yeah. Well, it's saying you want me to read it.

1124
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Yeah, I guess so.

1125
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
OK, mystery. So here's the dig the seed and grow girl.

1126
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
No, incorrect. Incorrect.

1127
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Dig the scenic road girl.

1128
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
No sense.

1129
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And then this.

1130
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Although you know what? I don't think the lyrics, the people who wrote these down know exactly there because the next line they wrote, whack the something girl.

1131
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
So they don't actually know either.

1132
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I do know that's whack the weed.

1133
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
But then I don't know. I've always heard whack the weed won't grow girl.

1134
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
What is that?

1135
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
This is not officially produced by Ron Wasserman.

1136
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
They're guessing as well.

1137
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I guess they're guessing. What's that?

1138
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
That big litany of OK of tequila burrito.

1139
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Here's what this says.

1140
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
This is saying and it might be guessing.

1141
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Hey Rita Senorita, the wickedest Chiquita.

1142
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Where did you come from Rita?

1143
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Hey Rita, treat a cheater.

1144
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Treat?

1145
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Is that a euphemism for kill?

1146
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Maybe.

1147
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
If you see a cheater.

1148
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I'm not sure. What are you up to Rita?

1149
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Oh Rita, won't you be there?

1150
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Get off my lander, Rita?

1151
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
In my head that's always been get off my lamborghita.

1152
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Like as if they needed a rhyme so bad that they had to tilt the name Lamborghini into lamborghita.

1153
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I think that's better than some of the actual lyrics Mike is reading.

1154
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Some of those are stretches and very dull phrases.

1155
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
We should get Wasserman on here.

1156
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I would love to. Yeah. Let's get the official word from him.

1157
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
There's a weird spoken word point later in the song too.

1158
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Do you have that? Do you want to pull up a separate clip?

1159
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I think well maybe I should.

1160
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Or we just describe it because there's the...

1161
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It's kind of like a bridge.

1162
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
The Power Rangers. I thought about leaving that in too.

1163
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It's like the Power Rangers you could not defeat so Lord Zed he put on the heat.

1164
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
He shrank you down, put you in a trash can.

1165
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
And now you're floating around space yelling at him.

1166
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I'm so glad that...

1167
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
That's more by the way the character at least.

1168
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Yeah that's more context to what actually happened.

1169
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It kind of happened in the show.

1170
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Or whacking weeds.

1171
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Wouldn't she whack and weesh? She's not doing gardening work.

1172
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
She has bunnies to do that for her.

1173
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I'm so glad that I at 16 was as delighted by Hey Rita as you were finding it out just several days ago.

1174
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It's magic isn't it?

1175
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
The rest I wouldn't recommend the album but that Hey Rita.

1176
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
The go that...

1177
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
UT La Tequila.

1178
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
On that album is also that Green Rangers song which they did use in the show.

1179
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
That's a good song.

1180
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I think you should find that album and listen to it Johnny.

1181
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I feel like there's a couple bangers on that album.

1182
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
For some reason I totally...

1183
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It's a loop to Hey Rita. I probably fast forwarded it onto my cassette tape when I was little.

1184
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
There's a couple things now that I appreciate more as an adult.

1185
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Sure.

1186
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
It's a little bit of a smithery.

1187
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Wasserman should have been hired to write original songs for this show as well.

1188
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
That would have made it the ultimate version of this.

1189
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You got in there...

1190
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Not to jump around but I feel like it's not a show necessarily.

1191
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
We have to explain the plot in glorious detail.

1192
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
There's that one song that is...

1193
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
It feels original to this unless it was in the show.

1194
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It is a song...

1195
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I don't know if you have the clip of it.

1196
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
It's a little bit craft-worky.

1197
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Like ding dong dong dong.

1198
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:35,000
The only lyrics repeated in a round are...

1199
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Silly putty building silly monster.

1200
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Silly putty.

1201
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I like that song a lot.

1202
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
That's not on the album I don't think.

1203
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Maybe it is.

1204
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I don't have the clip sadly.

1205
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
This is one of the most impressive things in the show.

1206
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:59,000
That song covers the space where the putties are all putting together a big clanky robot monster.

1207
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Which does not exist.

1208
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
There's nothing there and then they put a bunch of cans together.

1209
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And then it is just walking around.

1210
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Somebody slips in there during the building process.

1211
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And then it gets chopped apart again by the rangers before you're right.

1212
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
That's pretty cool.

1213
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I don't know exactly how they did that.

1214
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I saw that monster called the hollow monster.

1215
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
That was an original character for the stage show.

1216
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And Lumentor the fire lion.

1217
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Johnny do you remember...

1218
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Was it Lumentor or Lumentor?

1219
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I think it's Lumentor.

1220
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I wasn't sure either because some people online say Lumentor.

1221
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I thought it was Lumentor so I don't even know what it is.

1222
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I thought it was Lumentor.

1223
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
It sounds like Lumentor but I don't know if it's Lumentor.

1224
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I have a clip of that.

1225
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
We can see what Zed is saying to make sure.

1226
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
It sounds like there's no N in it when people say it.

1227
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But all the Power Rangers wiki has an M in it.

1228
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
It does sound like medicine you take for high blood pressure or something.

1229
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Ask your doctor of Lumentor.

1230
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Lumentor.

1231
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
But he's original.

1232
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Let's just get Lord Zed yelling real quick.

1233
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Clip 10 please.

1234
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
So Zed will be yelling his name here.

1235
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
He makes it sound so impressive that this is this new character.

1236
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I like Lumentor.

1237
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I like the look of him a lot.

1238
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I don't think he looks as scary as Goldar or Lord Zed.

1239
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Also, if I'm thinking back to my childhood, I was really upset that they would make Goldar a little bit of a buffoon.

1240
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Because initially he was...

1241
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Am I crazy here?

1242
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Initially he was so scary because he's the first monster they fight.

1243
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
He's the first monster.

1244
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I was so freaked out by him.

1245
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
He sort of falls into the...

1246
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
What's the character?

1247
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Babu and...

1248
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Squat.

1249
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
They were like comedic characters and he sort of fell into that.

1250
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
So I wanted to return to the fearsome Goldar.

1251
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,000
But anyway, here's the clip where Zed introduces and we'll see if we can figure out exactly if that N is there or not.

1252
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
So Rita is now back out of a different magic trick box.

1253
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
So mean!

1254
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
No. No N.

1255
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
No N.

1256
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
That's Lumentor.

1257
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
He's scary!

1258
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Isn't he magnificent?

1259
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
A mere touch from him can turn him into this.

1260
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I mean, I guess he is scary.

1261
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
But he's kind of cute.

1262
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
He's cuter than the other characters.

1263
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
So yeah, you can stop playing.

1264
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Do you think he's scary, Lumentor?

1265
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
What do we think?

1266
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
He's got an eye patch.

1267
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Yeah, that's cool.

1268
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
He had to get in some kind of a scrap for that to happen.

1269
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
No, he didn't.

1270
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
He could have fallen over in his apartment.

1271
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
You could see a poke in the corner of the...

1272
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
...redemptive.

1273
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Lumentor is tripped on the rug.

1274
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
No feng shui in Lumentor's apartment.

1275
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I think I like the flag of like

1276
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
talking about how Lumentor can't handle water.

1277
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I think they handle that like immediately.

1278
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I think like my babu or squat brings up like,

1279
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Oh man, it's hot in here.

1280
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I'm thirsty. Get me some water.

1281
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
And immediately he's like,

1282
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
No water. I can't have water.

1283
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Like immediately.

1284
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Okay, so that's how that's gonna go.

1285
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
We're gonna have all the kids chat more rain.

1286
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
In like two minutes straight.

1287
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Really like a design flaw.

1288
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Because these characters were molded out of clay by...

1289
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Is it Finster as the character?

1290
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Who I was a big fan of.

1291
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
He's got fun ears.

1292
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
He never fights, which I always kind of wanted him to fight.

1293
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Is he like a monster, a sorcerer, a scientist?

1294
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
What would you say he is?

1295
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Kind of a little bit of all of it.

1296
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
He's a monster.

1297
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Not in the show though.

1298
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
But like that's a design.

1299
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
He's designing the characters out of clay.

1300
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
He's sort of playing God, let's be honest.

1301
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
He made great little clay monsters as well.

1302
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So much so, I was so believable that this could actually...

1303
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I could do the same as Finster.

1304
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I remember me and my mom went to like

1305
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
pack of tans when I was little.

1306
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
And I got clay. And my mom bought me a bunch of clay.

1307
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Not play dough, just straight up clay.

1308
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And I tried to like recreate monsters

1309
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
from the show.

1310
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And put them in the microwave

1311
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
to get them to come to life.

1312
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Obviously, spoiler alert,

1313
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
they did not come to life.

1314
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And we had to buy a new microwave.

1315
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Wow.

1316
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
So that was like your best thought.

1317
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
The microwave was the place you thought, oh magic is made.

1318
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Because Finster doesn't put it in a microwave.

1319
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
He just kind of...

1320
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Put it in a little conveyor belt oven.

1321
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So you just were like, you have to cook it.

1322
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
They bake for a while. They're like babies.

1323
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
They bake in there for a little bit.

1324
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And then they come out and they're done.

1325
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
A monkey announces them.

1326
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
It's also funny to think though

1327
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
that your child brain was like,

1328
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
what I'm going to do right now is unleash

1329
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
a monster in the house.

1330
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I have sculpted a monster and I'm about to

1331
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
unleash it in here. I guess you assumed...

1332
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
To be fair, it wasn't a very good looking monster to be fair.

1333
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
True. It might be a stick figure monster.

1334
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Or like a little arms, legs,

1335
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
old face monster. I guess if you created

1336
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
though, then you could be the one to like

1337
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
tell the monster what to do. So I guess it maybe

1338
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
wouldn't tear up the house necessarily.

1339
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
You might not be creating a monster. You might be making...

1340
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I essentially did that now with like a human.

1341
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
So basically I'm just living in real life now.

1342
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I have a baby to live my monster life.

1343
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
You didn't make a monster. You made a new

1344
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
best friend. Yeah. Yeah. That's true.

1345
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So yeah, Luma Tor

1346
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
is original, again, original character here.

1347
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Who I like. Again, I don't know.

1348
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
People are probably thinking I'm putting him down.

1349
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And I don't want to put Luma Tor down. I like him.

1350
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I just think... You expect when somebody's

1351
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
created new for like it has to...

1352
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
As with Ivan Ooze, it has to reset

1353
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
the bar. Yes, Ivan Ooze reset

1354
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
the bar, villain bar,

1355
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
for me. And this one is like

1356
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
this is fun. But this is... I would see

1357
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Luma Tor on like a

1358
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
regular show. And I figure like they could

1359
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
have gone... Rod Stewart's

1360
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
guy could have gone bigger and forced them

1361
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
to get a more impressive, scarier villain.

1362
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Were the aliens also

1363
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
original too? Or were they on the show? I don't remember

1364
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
this at all. Those first... Yeah. So the show opens

1365
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
with these aliens kind of... Yeah.

1366
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Like exhuming or finding Lord Zed's

1367
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
temple. I don't know what you'd say.

1368
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
They're just fans. They're fans of Lord Zed.

1369
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
They're UFO fans. They're like me.

1370
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Like I am. They want to observe him

1371
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
and like discover how to be as

1372
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
evil as him. Yeah. A bunch of Lord

1373
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Zed's stands have crossed a boundary.

1374
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
They will not

1375
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
leave him alone to give him his privacy.

1376
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I didn't see for sure, but I think they are

1377
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
original. I'm not sure. I think so.

1378
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And then they kind of... I feel like they did nothing.

1379
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
They don't pay at all. They don't pay anything to this show.

1380
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
No. At all. Don't need to be there.

1381
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
They're not time killing. Yeah, not even like a Greek

1382
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
chorus or they don't even add any commentary

1383
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
or they're not like Statler and

1384
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Waldorf. They don't do anything fun. Nope.

1385
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
So, yeah.

1386
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Is it to explain... Is there like...

1387
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
They have to do some plot mechanics

1388
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
of why all of this is happening

1389
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
in your town, which in your

1390
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
case was Cleveland, but unnamed. They just said

1391
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
your town. This town. Yes.

1392
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Instead of Angel

1393
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Grove, the typical home

1394
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
of the town. Is that why a

1395
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
UFO crash lands, which unleashes...

1396
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Again, I'm a little lost. I don't know. But

1397
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
like typically it's all happening

1398
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
because all these people hang out in

1399
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Angel Grove. Yeah. Angel Grove, a town that is mostly

1400
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
like barren cliffs and large

1401
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
open green fields.

1402
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
That's 90% of Angel

1403
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Grove. If they built more housing developments

1404
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
there'd be no room for anybody to fight.

1405
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Start building up the suburbs

1406
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
and then these monsters have to leave.

1407
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
There's some explanation

1408
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
in one of them, and it might have been the press event. I can't

1409
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
remember because it's all blur, but one of the

1410
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
things I watched, they

1411
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
throw in a line like, and our

1412
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
plan is to bring the Power Rangers

1413
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
here from Angel Grove.

1414
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
So they've built in the idea that

1415
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
they're not going to be in their home base or something.

1416
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
We're luring them to your town

1417
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
to... And then I said

1418
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
in the first clip, capture them

1419
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
two at a time and

1420
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
put them in the cage and then the

1421
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
other two will come and then...

1422
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
But then I felt like 99% of the show took place

1423
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
in Lord Zedd's temple

1424
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
sort of thing. Yeah.

1425
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
His big dirty cave.

1426
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
His big nasty cave.

1427
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
The reeking of Gherkin

1428
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
pickles. Reeking of

1429
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Gherkins. And the audience needs to

1430
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
chant, like, clean the cave.

1431
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I will not clean the cave.

1432
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I didn't...

1433
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Johnny, you were saying you did not...

1434
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
You were so scared of being pulled on stage.

1435
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I feel like my childhood anxiety

1436
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
was raised whenever they're like,

1437
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
help us chant, we need your

1438
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
help. And I was like, I don't want this

1439
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
responsibility. I just want to watch the show.

1440
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Watching the YouTube clip though, kids

1441
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
were fully invested.

1442
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
And it looked like none of the kids had adults either.

1443
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It looked like watching the YouTube clip, there were just

1444
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
children everywhere. I never saw

1445
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
maybe I saw one adult.

1446
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Just lines of kids just going crazy

1447
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
and losing their minds. And I was never

1448
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
like, I was never like, I would maybe be like,

1449
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
more rain, more rain, more rain.

1450
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Or like, don't look at me, more rain.

1451
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I also didn't want...

1452
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I was horrified.

1453
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I'd be chanting like,

1454
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
we need rain or something like that. And Lord Zedd

1455
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
would be like, hey, you, I see you chanting

1456
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
down there. I'm going to come and kill you.

1457
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
So I didn't want to be

1458
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
caught. And this is like, this

1459
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
went not just for Power Rangers Live,

1460
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
but like every stage show I saw.

1461
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Maybe not Sesame Street Live,

1462
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
because I got like a Big Bird feather

1463
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
that I still have to this day that I'm very

1464
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
proud of. But like

1465
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I saw Sinbad on stage and I was

1466
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
like, I don't want Sinbad to call me out.

1467
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I saw David Copperfield. I was like, I don't want

1468
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
to be a part of a trick. Double Dare lies.

1469
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I was like, I don't want to do this.

1470
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
It's too much responsibility.

1471
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I was in the front row of Monday Night Raw.

1472
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
And I was afraid that Kane

1473
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
was going to... There's like a

1474
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
very famous clip of

1475
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
me, like a Monday Night Raw

1476
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
from like 1998 or 1997.

1477
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
And Kane is like ringing the bell

1478
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
10 times because he killed The Undertaker.

1479
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
And he goes and he grabs the

1480
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Timekeeper and he beats him up.

1481
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
And he sees like a fan standing in the front row

1482
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
and he grabs him and he pulls him over the guardrail

1483
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
and starts beating him up. And the camera like pans

1484
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
over and you just see little

1485
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
chubby Johnny Organo like sitting there in the front row

1486
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
like, like

1487
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
horrified that Kane is going to come over

1488
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
and murder me.

1489
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
That's amazing. I mean, if

1490
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
you had a camera in my childhood home, I would have also

1491
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
had the same reaction just watching the

1492
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
TV for some of the demon stuff,

1493
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
some of the satanic stuff. You know what's funny

1494
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
is I think you were talking to three guys who probably

1495
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
had a similar feeling in the audience of all these

1496
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
shows. I'm remembering now,

1497
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
funny enough, the first time I had that in my

1498
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
adult... One of the first times I had this in my adult years

1499
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
is you used to wrestle in Recita and PWG,

1500
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
which I would go to. And this,

1501
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
the first time I ever went, the action

1502
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
would spill out because it was a very small building.

1503
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And I was having the same

1504
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
sort of panic initially. Eventually,

1505
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
you get used to just like standing up and moving

1506
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
when people are fighting. But I

1507
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
remember going, oh, like I'm part of this.

1508
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
And I didn't realize I was

1509
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
part of this. So

1510
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
the old feelings of it came back.

1511
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Especially back in Recita, that was like the Wild

1512
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Wild West where there is no guardrails and everyone's

1513
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
as close to the ring as you possibly get.

1514
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
So I don't know how many times there'd be

1515
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
random celebrities just sitting in the crowd

1516
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
where you do like a dive and you land on

1517
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
like little Dwight

1518
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
from the office.

1519
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
It'd be wild.

1520
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Yes, but it was that same thing

1521
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
of like, oh, we're all part... We're actually, because this building

1522
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
was so small, we're all part of the show.

1523
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
So we all have to move. And we're

1524
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
all like anything can happen at this point.

1525
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I say all the time too that those shows

1526
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I used to do in Recita probably took

1527
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
years off, not just my career, but my life.

1528
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Given how hot that

1529
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
building used to be. Yes, yes.

1530
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
It was like 99 degrees.

1531
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And imagine having to wrestle for like 30 minutes

1532
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
in front of just the craziest heat you could imagine.

1533
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
That was wild times.

1534
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Very, very wild times.

1535
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
We all have been to

1536
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Recita and it was never

1537
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
a nice climate in there.

1538
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
It was not...

1539
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
It was never like, oh, it feels

1540
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
great in here in this Legion Hall.

1541
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Wow. But

1542
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Rest In Peace Legion Hall has been torn down.

1543
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
But yeah, yeah, this

1544
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
is still... I do

1545
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
feel like if you're in front row anywhere, I'm like,

1546
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
OK, I don't need to...

1547
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
No, thank you. Yeah, right.

1548
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I'm still that way now as an adult.

1549
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And I do stuff

1550
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
on stage and I do stuff on television.

1551
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
But I'm still like, if I'm not in my

1552
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
element, I'm like, oh, please

1553
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
don't pick on me. Like if I went to like Turtle Talk

1554
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
or Crush, I'm like,

1555
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
please don't pick on me.

1556
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Or running like Star Tours. I'm like, I don't want to...

1557
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Please don't put me on the screen.

1558
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I don't want to be seen, please. You know, real quick,

1559
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I'm remembering now when Candice was on,

1560
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
she said something about the ride

1561
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Living With the Land. Oh, boy.

1562
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And she expressed that maybe this was not your

1563
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
favorite ride. Oh.

1564
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Me and Candice have very

1565
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
not similar

1566
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
tastes when it comes to classic Disney attractions.

1567
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Right.

1568
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I have very strong opinions. I think

1569
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I share the same opinions as Matt Cardona

1570
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
on a lot of... We should

1571
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
plus him up. Oh, sure.

1572
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
He's very brutal. Just like out, out.

1573
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
That one's out. Yeah. Well,

1574
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
look, I don't want to get you in any trouble, but

1575
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I wouldn't mind you taking a little bit of heat

1576
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
off of me because I think there's some listeners I never

1577
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
got back after I said I didn't like

1578
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Living With the Land. Scott is the most anti-Ridiculous

1579
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
with the land, yes. And there were listeners who were very

1580
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
upset with him. Oh, still.

1581
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I still see it. It dogs me

1582
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
to this day. I'm like, I'm a heel of

1583
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Podcast the Ride because I was like,

1584
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I don't know. I just, I don't think seeing the

1585
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
plants is that interesting.

1586
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Candice is on me all the time because, number one,

1587
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
like Hall of Presidents, like

1588
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
not, not... Mr. Lincoln,

1589
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
like I'm out. Like any of the, any of the,

1590
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
any things where I have to learn

1591
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
while I'm doing it. Yeah. Like any

1592
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
things where I'm like, I got to learn about this,

1593
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I am 100% not

1594
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
invested in. American Adventure.

1595
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
My wife just really snapped on American,

1596
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
just like how many more people

1597
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
are we meeting today?

1598
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
How many more historical figures?

1599
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
You were just like, wait

1600
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
one minute. Will Rogers about to show

1601
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
up and he's going to make you laugh. He's

1602
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
got a lasso. He's got a lasso.

1603
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
You have to, you got to

1604
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
say what you think about living with a lamp. You got to

1605
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
help me out here. I have an ally

1606
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
finally. I mean,

1607
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
get rid of it.

1608
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Like,

1609
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I'm not one of those like

1610
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
attraction people where I'm

1611
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
like, we got to preserve the

1612
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
aura. I'm like, no, like add an overlay

1613
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
to it. Add some, like plus it up. Add

1614
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
like something I care about to the attraction.

1615
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Again, it's a hot take on a lot

1616
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
of things. But I'm very much

1617
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
so, A, we need to

1618
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
update things as they go. Like,

1619
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I'm sure the new Guardians ride is going to be my new favorite ride.

1620
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Like, Rise of Resistance is my top ride.

1621
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Like, I'm very much so a new technology

1622
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
person as opposed to a

1623
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
historical one. New exciting thing shows up when you enjoy it.

1624
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Wait, let me say this. I've, cause when

1625
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
it comes up, all I'm saying is there was a point

1626
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
in time where that ride had a song

1627
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
and somebody in the boat talked to you.

1628
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And now these things are gone and we're like,

1629
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
yes, good. Keep there being no

1630
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
song in it. That's my point.

1631
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
If nothing else, put the song

1632
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
back. Like, I don't understand why

1633
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
it has to be preserved in a

1634
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
decaying state, in a like

1635
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
lesser state than it was.

1636
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
That's all I'm saying, folks. This is all

1637
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I'm trying to say. Scott, not here.

1638
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
The lack of guide is definitely a

1639
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
cost cutting measure, for sure.

1640
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
So we shouldn't be celebrating that.

1641
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I love that there's no guide anymore.

1642
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Me and

1643
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Candice get into arguments all the time. Not arguments.

1644
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
But he did discussions all the time.

1645
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I have a very strong

1646
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
opinion on the It's a Great Big

1647
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Beautiful Tomorrow ride.

1648
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Oh, here we go. What do you got?

1649
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I mean, I, so

1650
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I say this

1651
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
as someone who experienced

1652
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
the ride, maybe in a way

1653
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
it shouldn't have been experienced.

1654
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Everyone knows, obviously, it

1655
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
circles around and things like that.

1656
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
And they go to each scene and it takes

1657
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
about five minutes per era

1658
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
that we're in. So at one point,

1659
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
me and Candice rode this ride. And this might be

1660
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
before I hated this ride. And maybe

1661
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I say this is the catalyst.

1662
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
This is my Joker story for why I

1663
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
don't like this ride.

1664
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
So we get

1665
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
about 15 minutes in. And Candice

1666
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
remembers this experience way differently than I do.

1667
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
But we get about 15 minutes in.

1668
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
We watch like, because it's

1669
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
about a 20 minute ride, we get to

1670
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
the third act of

1671
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
this scene, whatever era

1672
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
that is in the 40s, maybe

1673
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
could be the 40s, wherever it is at this point.

1674
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
So it plays.

1675
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
It starts to turn to go to like

1676
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
the last one, but it stops

1677
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
and the ride freezes

1678
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
because maybe someone stood up. We're not

1679
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
sure about this. And then it goes back

1680
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
and it goes back and it goes back

1681
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
and the ride starts over all over

1682
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
again. So you got to sit there for another

1683
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
15 minutes and it just happens

1684
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
again. You're gonna sit there like

1685
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
we got to go do this thing all over again.

1686
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
So they restart the ride. So we're about

1687
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
like, I'd say 35 minutes in

1688
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
at this point of the same thing

1689
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
over and over again. And I'm like, I'm

1690
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
done.

1691
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I'm never coming back on this ride.

1692
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
It's a great big over 35 minutes.

1693
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Every time.

1694
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
You're describing Jason's dream.

1695
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Progress isn't always smooth,

1696
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
folks.

1697
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
And hey, Johnny, you're a new father.

1698
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
You're gonna be thanking your lucky

1699
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
stars for that ride. Nice cool

1700
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
20, 25 minute nap.

1701
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
So, so it's funny you mentioned that

1702
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
because, oh,

1703
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
she just came.

1704
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Candace is here. Candace came in.

1705
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
The dog's losing his mind

1706
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
now. It's funny you mentioned that

1707
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
because the very first ride

1708
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
we took our son Quill on

1709
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
was the Wheel of Progress.

1710
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Carousel Progress.

1711
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Carousel Progress, whatever the heck it is. I don't want to even

1712
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
call it by its right name because I don't have that much respect for it.

1713
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I like it. Wheel. I'm gonna start calling it that pretty hard.

1714
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
This is basically a wheel because it felt like it kept going over and over again.

1715
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Sure.

1716
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
So we took him on the Carousel of Progress.

1717
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
And I trade great pride in

1718
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
the fact that being his

1719
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
father, he started losing his mind

1720
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
about 15 minutes in.

1721
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And he starts crying.

1722
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And Candace is trying to feed him.

1723
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
But he starts crying and crying and crying.

1724
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And I'm sitting there very proud.

1725
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
And afterwards I'm like, see? See?

1726
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
He didn't like it.

1727
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
He didn't like it. That was his first ride.

1728
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
He did not like it at all.

1729
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
It could not hold a less than one year old's attention for more than 15 minutes.

1730
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Almost everything holds a one year old for 15 minutes.

1731
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And then he went on Space Mountain and he loved it.

1732
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
You held him up like Rafiki the whole way.

1733
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Yeah, of course.

1734
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
What is the oldest, is there any old kind of ride that you do like?

1735
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Haunted Mansion, obviously, right?

1736
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Yeah, of course. Haunted Mansion, love Haunted Mansion.

1737
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Haunted Mansion, like Space Mountain, OG Space Mountain, still love that.

1738
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
But you know what, these like boring Walt things.

1739
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Do you like any boring Walt things?

1740
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Like what? Like what do you classify as boring?

1741
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Train? Like everything we've listed.

1742
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
The train. Do you like the train?

1743
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
No, I mean, it's fine. It's just not.

1744
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
So like we're obviously more, we go to Disney World more than we go to Disneyland.

1745
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Even though it might be a hot take that I prefer.

1746
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I do prefer Disneyland to Disney World.

1747
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I don't know if that's a hot take or not.

1748
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
We like that take. We agree with the take.

1749
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I'm sure you guys, I just feel like it's easier to do everything in Disneyland in one day than it is in Disney World,

1750
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
because there's just so much in Disney World and like there's so many different parks and things like that.

1751
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,000
And we got married there, so that's a whole other thing that I kind of I feel like I need to say that because if I don't I'll be in trouble.

1752
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
You got married there.

1753
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Yeah, yeah, no, that's not so controversial.

1754
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
What about Epcot movie, like 360 movies?

1755
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You ever do the 360 movies?

1756
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Do you learn about Canada with Martin Short?

1757
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
No, I don't think I've ever done that.

1758
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
For a good reason.

1759
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Maybe next time though.

1760
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Maybe, you never know.

1761
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Like me and Candace, I don't know if she told you when she was on the podcast, but we got a chance to go to Walt's actual office when we were in California.

1762
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So we went and saw his actual office and Candace started crying.

1763
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:22,000
So she obviously has a much deeper connection to Walt and all the history that I do being from California and Disneyland and things like that.

1764
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:34,000
But I didn't start being, I wasn't a Disney person until I met Candace as well, because being from Cleveland, Ohio, all we had was like Jogga Lake and Sea World and Power Rangers Live.

1765
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
So I didn't do any Disney trips when I was younger.

1766
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:44,000
If you were in the office of Ron Wasserman, writer of the theme song, you would shed a tear there.

1767
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
He wrote Hey Rita here.

1768
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
The wickedest senorita.

1769
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
What else can we hit about the show?

1770
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
You got anything fun in the clip realm?

1771
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I have a clip.

1772
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Oh yeah, go for it.

1773
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
This is a moment later in the show.

1774
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Just to set it up, Alpha 5 has got the kids to chant to help the Power Rangers.

1775
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:19,000
And I think the big thing about this clip is it kind of shows the limitations of using some of the Power Rangers material.

1776
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Brett, do you have that?

1777
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Huge arena.

1778
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Yeah.

1779
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Okay, so this is a shot of a field.

1780
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Yeah, the Power Rangers are running towards camera.

1781
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
So far.

1782
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So far.

1783
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Now we can kind of see them.

1784
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Just now.

1785
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Come on guys, hustle.

1786
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And then they burst through the screen.

1787
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
That's cool.

1788
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
That gets a big response from the crowd.

1789
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Okay, you can stop it.

1790
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
But just that footage of them running from so far away.

1791
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Oh my god.

1792
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Like okay, oh man, a lot can happen when we're waiting for them to show up.

1793
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
That clip also illustrated a thing that I like.

1794
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I just want to translate to the listener.

1795
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:20,000
But I like the way, the physicality they bring to the fighting, they also bring just to the dialogue.

1796
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Because what the White Ranger was saying, they're like, alright guys, we need a plan.

1797
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Because Lord Zed is on the attack and we are going to be in trouble.

1798
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
It's almost gesticulated.

1799
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
It's all like, how many movements can I do on every syllable?

1800
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
It's all pre-recorded audio.

1801
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
So they're like, yeah, they're gesticulating to go along with the pre-recorded audio.

1802
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:46,000
They don't have to be making the sounds from their lungs so they can go ape shit with all that word punching.

1803
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Yeah, but that was towards the end of the show.

1804
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Very funny moments towards the end of the show where they summon all their zords to fight Lumetor.

1805
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Okay, good. Yeah, you're going to get into this.

1806
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And then they are using the stock footage of the zords projected on a pretty standard like 4x3 screen.

1807
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And Lumetor, there's no on stage zords.

1808
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Lumetor just fights next to footage.

1809
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Footage of the giant creature.

1810
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:25,000
It does give them a chance to use the kind of regularly used footage of the zords exploding and the Power Rangers getting tossed out of them,

1811
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
which always made me really anxious as a kid as well.

1812
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Yes. Do we have the clip of that or no?

1813
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I don't have the clip. Sorry.

1814
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I have a clip of the finale in which you do get some massive action, which might be worth it.

1815
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
What is that? I think I call that more light.

1816
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
You were describing. This is the only part.

1817
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
This is the only part that I remember.

1818
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Okay, this is the only part that I remember actually being there live because I remember having one of the little reflective light things.

1819
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
And I remember the big inflatable Lord Zed for some reason.

1820
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
That's the only thing I remember.

1821
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Maybe because I was horrified that he was going to like come out and kill me.

1822
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And I didn't want him to see that I had this reflector thing that was murdering him.

1823
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Specifically the other children all kind of break.

1824
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I was a reasonably smart kid, but not smart enough to know it behooves companies to not murder the audience to make money.

1825
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
They should keep the audience alive to keep doing shows and making money.

1826
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Maybe I thought because I was dressed like the White Ranger, he would get confused.

1827
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
That like I was the White Ranger.

1828
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Yeah, we were like, I was probably the worst kind of.

1829
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Yeah, yeah, I wasn't a civilian.

1830
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I was a part of it.

1831
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
You had enlisted.

1832
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I mean, I do have the official Power Ranger.

1833
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I am an official Power Ranger.

1834
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I like a certificate that says I'm official young Power Ranger that I signed up for.

1835
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I think I was part of the fan club and I got an official certificate that says I was a young Power Ranger.

1836
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
So yeah, I did officially enlist.

1837
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I don't know what I signed up for, but they deputize young children to also be in the Power Rangers.

1838
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

1839
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Target on your back.

1840
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
There's a funny we can.

1841
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
We actually I do have a clip.

1842
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
We can play it after this.

1843
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,000
There's it is so funny because so much of it is like, you know, we're teaching martial arts.

1844
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:17,000
There was a Tommy video that I had that where Tommy taught children how to do martial arts.

1845
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Oh, there's about 10 minutes of like, do not do this.

1846
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Do not fight children at school.

1847
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Do not do that.

1848
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
It's only for for discipline.

1849
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
That's what we're doing.

1850
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,000
If you know how you watch that show every week where people beat the shit out of each other.

1851
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
No, do not do that fun stuff.

1852
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
This is just to learn the art of this.

1853
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Yeah.

1854
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:45,000
When I was a kid, I actually had my parents sign me up for a karate class only so I could get the geek.

1855
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I never went to a karate class.

1856
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I only wanted the outfit.

1857
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
So they decided to get the outfit so I can be at home.

1858
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And I watched the Tommy instructional video.

1859
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So that's how I taught myself karate is I didn't go to any of the real the real classes.

1860
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I wanted to learn from Jason David Frank and stay.

1861
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Of course.

1862
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1863
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Power Rangers definitely led to an increase in karate class enrollment.

1864
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,000
But yes, it did also lead to recesses of like, what do you guys want to do this recess?

1865
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Do you want to fight like Power Rangers?

1866
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Yeah, let's do it.

1867
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:21,000
And just like the wimpiest little kick said, like the moment we saw authority, it's like scram.

1868
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Amps gray.

1869
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I know a Power Ranger fan if like you see someone throw a kick and go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1870
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Like they all always had the sound effects.

1871
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Right.

1872
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
And any kicks they threw that accompanied it.

1873
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Yes.

1874
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Oh, that's how you know.

1875
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
That's that's Ranger style turtle style.

1876
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Would you learn?

1877
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
That's what you learn.

1878
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
You say maybe you throw a cowabunga in there, but you aren't accompanying.

1879
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:50,000
You know what it led to for me was this is some of my other negative Power Rangers Association was one time.

1880
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Only once I was like walking up in the hills by this park and then some kids came up to me, younger kids than me, little.

1881
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Oh, wow.

1882
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I'm wearing sunglasses, which was enough for them to say, hey, you're Lord Zed.

1883
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And I was and I said defensively, no, I'm not.

1884
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And they said, yeah, you're him.

1885
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And I was like, no.

1886
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And I ran away from the littler children.

1887
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Oh, wow.

1888
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
There was no threat for all I knew.

1889
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
They could have liked that I was Lord Zed.

1890
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
There was no violence.

1891
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
They didn't start kicking me.

1892
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
There weren't little kicks, little kicks in my direction.

1893
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
But somehow that was scarring enough for me to remember still.

1894
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And that held and this held me back from being able to truly embrace what's on the screen right now.

1895
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Wow.

1896
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
That's sad.

1897
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1898
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I'm sorry.

1899
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
That's what I want.

1900
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
A dark memory being told.

1901
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Sunglasses made you Lord Zed.

1902
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I mean, he's got sort of like what kind of sunglasses were they?

1903
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Were they like the old like the the weird square ones?

1904
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Knowing me and my lack of style ever, they were probably abnormally large and aviator like for a little child.

1905
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
So were they red and then they had like a metal mask under it?

1906
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Also, was that the sunglasses you were wearing?

1907
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1908
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Kind of spike coming up.

1909
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Yes, there was all those industrial gnarled metal that covered my mouth.

1910
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
And it was that time in puberty when your muscles were exposed.

1911
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Oh, yeah, where my where my the flesh, my skin got completely translucent and you could see everything inside me.

1912
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
That's probably why.

1913
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Now, so that was not a good Zed memory for me.

1914
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,000
This is a new Zed memory that I like, because for the listener, what we're looking at is final.

1915
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
They do in a Rod Stewart esque display of rock and roll spectacle.

1916
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
They create a big Lord Zed.

1917
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And how do they do it?

1918
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:51,000
By making a big inflatable figure done kind of like King Kong and initially was done at Universal Studios where it's kind of like torso up.

1919
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
So that saves a little bit.

1920
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
They don't have to make all those legs.

1921
01:36:53,000 --> 01:37:05,000
So it's just kind of chest up and they puppeteer him kind of, I assume by it's probably just like a dozen guys in black clothes back there just like shaking them around wildly.

1922
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
And it is cool.

1923
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And this involves the kid participation in what Johnny said he recalls strongly from from being there.

1924
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
So here's this.

1925
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
This is your kid.

1926
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

1927
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Little Bobby Buttnik.

1928
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Pyro.

1929
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Yes.

1930
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Tommy Tommy's little.

1931
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Sabo?

1932
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Sabo?

1933
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1934
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:42,000
More light, more light, more light, more light, more light, more light.

1935
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
How good does that thing look?

1936
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I do love that effect.

1937
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
It's really cool.

1938
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:57,000
And then that, you know, obviously he gets defeated, which is just him inflating.

1939
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
They just let the air out and then he just flops down onto the stage and kind of ignore.

1940
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Hey, kids, don't worry about all that loose skin.

1941
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Yes.

1942
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:11,000
The square, the vast square footage of loose skin kicking around the stage.

1943
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:18,000
That does illustrate, though, one of the things I didn't like as a kid was like, why does only Tommy has have his weapon?

1944
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Like he has a sword.

1945
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Scott, shortly into the first season, all the Power Rangers each got a different weapon.

1946
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:33,000
And then when they were really in a pinch, they would combine their weapons to make a gun, which is kind of weird to say.

1947
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Like the guy who tried to attack Dave Chappelle.

1948
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Yeah.

1949
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
A real knife and fake gun combined.

1950
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Yeah.

1951
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
So that was a big deal for me as a kid.

1952
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:52,000
And the toy makers were kind of psyched, too, because, yeah, eventually the next line of action figures had the weapons and the blasters.

1953
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:57,000
They also had blasters that kind of became nightsticks and then definitely became switch blades.

1954
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
That's a good point.

1955
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Yeah.

1956
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I had one of those.

1957
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,000
If you had the gun, yeah, the regular gun from the first seat, would you like open it and it would turn into a blade?

1958
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Yes.

1959
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Yeah.

1960
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
What do you got on the front?

1961
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I'm curious about it.

1962
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Do you have a clip from this martial arts?

1963
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Oh, I do. Yes.

1964
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
From the Jason Davis.

1965
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Yes.

1966
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Oh, I love it.

1967
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I do have a clip.

1968
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Let me look real quick.

1969
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Johnny, you did that.

1970
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
So you had this tape.

1971
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
This was your education in this area.

1972
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Yes.

1973
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
This is what prepared me for professional wrestling, I think.

1974
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I didn't actually go training at a school for pro wrestling.

1975
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I just did this.

1976
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
This is where I developed my skills from.

1977
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I hope this doesn't have the answers to any of your weaknesses.

1978
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Does this give your opponents potential?

1979
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
It might.

1980
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
At the Z spot?

1981
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
You don't have a Z spot, do you?

1982
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
It's hidden, though.

1983
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
It's harder to find.

1984
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
It's not just right.

1985
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Yeah, I'm not going to tell you where it is.

1986
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
It's not advertised.

1987
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Clip seven.

1988
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
This is when Tommy's giving some sort of instruction.

1989
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
He's telling you what not to do with his martial arts training.

1990
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Yeah.

1991
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
So, yeah, whenever you're ready.

1992
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And it's a long video.

1993
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
It's like an hour long.

1994
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Oh, yeah.

1995
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And here it is.

1996
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
All of it.

1997
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Yep.

1998
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Unless you can control your mind.

1999
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Once you do this, your body will fall along.

2000
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Okay.

2001
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
If you know what I'm talking about.

2002
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I know exactly what Tommy's talking about.

2003
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Alpha, please don't interrupt.

2004
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Sorry, Zordon.

2005
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Mean to Alpha for no reason.

2006
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Now, before we get started, here's a few rules about martial arts.

2007
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Have a couple drinks.

2008
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Take some tequila shots.

2009
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
First, remember to practice martial arts either at home in a large open area.

2010
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Okay.

2011
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Away from lamps, furniture, you know, the stuff that could break or hurt you.

2012
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Or in a karate school like this one.

2013
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And always make sure there's an adult there when you're practicing.

2014
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Either your sense of your mom or dad.

2015
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
So I'll bring up the point I'm making.

2016
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
One second.

2017
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
You especially don't want to practice martial arts.

2018
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Dragon sword.

2019
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
No.

2020
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Hey, guys, you know better than that.

2021
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Wow, it's the Green Ranger.

2022
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Why don't you guys tell us why you shouldn't practice martial arts at school?

2023
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
We don't know.

2024
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
We wanted to.

2025
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Right.

2026
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Someone could definitely get hurt.

2027
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
What else?

2028
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
And you can get in trouble.

2029
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
So make sure you two guys remember that.

2030
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Okay.

2031
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
All right.

2032
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
All right.

2033
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Well.

2034
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:04,000
So here's what's confusing about this clip if you know the show at all.

2035
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
He says don't do this at school.

2036
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
He makes it very clear.

2037
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Do it in a karate space or a gym or whatever.

2038
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,000
That's the set of the school that he's in from Power Rangers.

2039
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Yeah.

2040
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:24,000
So he's pretending he's gaslighting a bunch of kids saying this is not the school you see on the TV every week.

2041
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I just put a bunch of mats down in the cafeteria.

2042
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
But this is a karate school, not school.

2043
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Don't do.

2044
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Yeah.

2045
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Don't fight in school.

2046
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I think my first question at the Green Ranger appeared in front of me would have been, hey, can I see your giant flute knife?

2047
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I really want to take a look at that flute slash knife.

2048
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
It is a key as a flute.

2049
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
He is a it's like an ocarina knife.

2050
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Yeah.

2051
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Oh, wow.

2052
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
So we like pun plays it like this.

2053
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Do you have that Johnny?

2054
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Do you have that toy?

2055
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Yeah, I don't want I don't want to flex or anything.

2056
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
But I have a 24 karat gold version of it.

2057
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Oh, my God.

2058
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Wow.

2059
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Hold on.

2060
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Hold on.

2061
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Oh, yeah.

2062
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Can you play it?

2063
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Yeah.

2064
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Is it playable?

2065
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
No, you're in shorts.

2066
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
OK, hold on.

2067
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
This is a San Diego Comic Con.

2068
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Wow.

2069
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Oh, my God.

2070
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
It's dusty.

2071
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
It has a bit of a different San Diego Comic Con.

2072
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I saw it on a documentary and I was like, wait a minute.

2073
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,000
They made a 24 karat gold dragon dagger and got it to prove me for Christmas.

2074
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
From from eBay.

2075
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
He's like, I brought up like the you can get anything anymore.

2076
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:31,000
I mean, but yeah, so this is a limited edition 24 karat gold.

2077
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Oh, my God.

2078
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Wow.

2079
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I know.

2080
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Right.

2081
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Clap for that.

2082
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
That's awesome.

2083
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I know.

2084
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
But it's not play.

2085
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Can you play it?

2086
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I think so.

2087
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Yeah.

2088
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
It's a you can do a concert with this.

2089
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Yeah.

2090
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Hold on.

2091
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
This is unbelievable.

2092
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Oh, hold on.

2093
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Demonstration.

01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I'm going to hold down the so it's like you're blowing on it.

2095
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
New theme song.

Oh, is it working?

2097
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Hold on.

2098
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Oh, sorry to put you on the spot.

Oh, there it is.

2101
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Oh, it's a song.

2102
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
OK.

2103
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
The famous that's how you that's the calling the dragons.

2104
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Yeah.

2105

A little tune.

2106
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Oh, my God.

2107
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Wow.

2108
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
That's awesome.

2109
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I think like you.

2110
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I think it's a little bit of a.

2111
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Yeah.

2112
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Yeah.

2113
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Yeah.

2114
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Yeah.

2115
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
That's awesome.

2116
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I think like you do things.

2117
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Sure.

2118
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
It's also good for home defense.

2119
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
It is great.

2120
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Yeah.

2121
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Yeah.

2122
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Twenty four karat gold Dragon Dagger exists.

2123
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
That's wild.

2124
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Damn.

2125
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
That's awesome.

2126
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
That's an item.

2127
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I'm impressed by that.

2128
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
And I didn't even grow up with this show.

2129
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I know.

2130
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,800
Did you have a would you have a favorite of all the toys back there?

2131
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,880
Power Rangers or not or anything else?

2132
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:45,960
So like I think like I said, the 24 karat gold Dragon Dagger is probably my biggest

2133
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:46,960
flex.

2134
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:47,960
Yeah.

2135
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:48,960
You got to late.

2136
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,960
You got to throw a softball up for me.

2137
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:51,960
Sure.

2138
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,960
I didn't realize.

2139
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,960
I am such a big Spider-Man the animated series fan.

2140
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:00,960
So I have like the complete set collection of all the Spider-Man the animated series

2141
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,960
toys like the original or the new retro ones.

2142
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:03,960
The original.

2143
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:04,960
Yeah.

2144
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:05,960
The new retros as well.

2145
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:07,960
But the original like the OG.

2146
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:08,960
Oh, yeah.

2147
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,960
I see it there.

2148
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:10,960
Yeah.

2149
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:11,960
Yeah.

2150
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:12,960
All up here.

2151
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:13,960
And like I said, like I'll pan the camera up.

2152
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,960
I have like the Daily Bugle play set.

2153
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:16,960
I have the Tri-Spider Slayer.

2154
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,960
And all those I didn't see all those helmet.

2155
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:20,960
Those those Ranger helmets.

2156
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,960
There's literally a Lord Zed helmet right there.

2157
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:23,960
It is.

2158
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:24,960
Yeah.

2159
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:25,960
Wow.

2160
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:26,960
Wow.

2161
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:27,960
And are they terrifying?

2162
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:28,960
I'm not asking you to do this, but are they wearable?

2163
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:29,960
You want to you want to see them?

2164
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:30,960
Hmm.

2165
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:31,960
Kind of.

2166
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:32,960
It's up to you.

2167
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,960
Yeah, I can grab them.

2168
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:34,960
If it's easy.

2169
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:35,960
Only if it's easy.

2170
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:36,960
Okay.

2171
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:37,960
If it's easy.

2172
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:38,960
Yes, I do want to.

2173
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:42,560
Now, look, it's not just him because I just went to a birthday party that you guys were

2174
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,160
at and the there was a present at the birthday party.

2175
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,160
Wait, he's got.

2176
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,160
Oh, yeah.

2177
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,160
Okay.

2178
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,160
Yeah.

2179
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,160
Oh, my God.

2180
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,160
Look at it.

2181
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:53,160
It's beautiful helmet.

2182
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,160
It just goes over my head.

2183
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,160
Yeah.

2184
01:44:55,160 --> 01:45:01,160
It has like a voice modulator as well to where you can talk like Lord Zed.

2185
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:02,160
Oh, wow.

2186
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:05,160
So why don't we do the whole episode that way?

2187
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:09,360
I know I should just wore this the whole podcast and talk like Lord Zed.

2188
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,080
If you were just popped up like that at the beginning.

2189
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:18,000
I mean, we've all been zooming and in Google hang outing for years now, but that would have

2190
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,680
been the most terrifying thing of this entire pandemic run.

2191
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,680
Like Lord said, is join the chat.

2192
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,680
Happy birthday.

2193
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:25,680
It is true.

2194
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:26,680
Happy birthday over Zoom.

2195
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:29,080
I figured this is the first time we met.

2196
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:31,080
So I probably ease into the Lord said showing up.

2197
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:32,080
That's sure.

2198
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,080
Next time.

2199
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:34,080
Art Attack.

2200
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:37,680
The next time I do the podcast, Lord said Lord said reviewing living with the land.

2201
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,320
Oh, that'd have been boring ride.

2202
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,320
No scientists.

2203
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,560
I couldn't even find the scientists.

2204
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,040
They were supposed to be in the lab.

2205
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,040
What about cast members?

2206
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:47,040
Why don't they give the tour anymore?

2207
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:50,520
These puny hydroponics do not impress me.

2208
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:51,520
Yeah.

2209
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,280
So that'll be a good thing to look forward to.

2210
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,280
Yeah.

2211
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:55,920
What else should we hit about this about this live show?

2212
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:56,920
Do you have it?

2213
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:57,920
Do you have clips?

2214
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:00,560
Is there anything or Johnny, do you have any memories of this that we that we have missed?

2215
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,520
Is there something part of the spec?

2216
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,520
We hit the magic.

2217
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:10,000
We hit the recordings of clips of Power Rangers running very slowly through a meadow.

2218
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:14,800
What what any other memories of this this fun childhood event?

2219
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,360
I'm trying to think now.

2220
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:21,960
So like I said, like the the I think it's kind of a backtracking a bit.

2221
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:28,200
But one of the biggest letdowns to me was they did this big introduction like the the

2222
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:29,840
Zords are going to be coming.

2223
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,200
So they do like, oh, we're going to go to get the Zords.

2224
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:35,360
And then like we talked about, like the Zords are just on the screen the whole time.

2225
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:39,400
Like they couldn't spring production for just to have like one Zord show up and just kind

2226
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:42,840
of roll out. They have a big hollow monster, a big inflatable Lord Zed.

2227
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:45,920
They couldn't have a big inflatable Megazord or anything like that.

2228
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,560
But I mean, that was my biggest letdown.

2229
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,760
They had two of the actual people not showing up.

2230
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:54,760
But sure, they have. Yeah, they had two inflatables maybe at the end, because I get

2231
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:57,000
you want to save that for the big the big finale.

2232
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,520
But yeah, then the Megazord came out and attacked.

2233
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,600
What is it called? I'm going to be so embarrassed.

2234
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,800
What is it called when the Megazord and the Dragonzord combine?

2235
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,680
Is there a name for it?

2236
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:08,720
Oh, I'm trying to remember now.

2237
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:12,280
So ultra dragon Megazord, Megadragonzord or something maybe.

2238
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,720
Oh, it might be Megadragonzord.

2239
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:16,360
There was different incarnations of it because they like change the names.

2240
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:17,760
Yeah, it's the White Tiger.

2241
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:20,520
White Tigerzord. Yeah, it's the White Tigerzord in this instance.

2242
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:23,480
And then it becomes one of my I had that too.

2243
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,880
I had that toy, too.

2244
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:31,040
Yeah. But then his next one, he gets is a giant falcon that the tips of the wings

2245
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:33,400
are missiles.

2246
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:37,080
So like the falcon would like fold its wings and then it would just launch

2247
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,920
missiles like I thought that was the coolest thing as a kid.

2248
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,160
That is good. Wow.

2249
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,880
I can't be mad. I wrote this down.

2250
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:46,320
I don't know about you guys, but the putties to me.

2251
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:51,480
So watching watching it back, it really felt like the putties

2252
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,480
were going into business for themselves.

2253
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:57,920
Like at one point, at one point, the putties are just like doing like dances.

2254
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:59,360
Yeah. Yeah.

2255
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:03,800
I had a little they kind of had a little bit of tumble monkey to them from Lion King.

2256
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:07,840
Like they kind of had a little bit like they do one of the most amazing things

2257
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,880
I've ever seen as well, where they were all sitting in like a row

2258
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:13,280
and they turn over where they're all on top of each other.

2259
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:17,000
But also thinking back, like the putties are like doing this

2260
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,640
very intricate dance number.

2261
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:21,840
They're like going into the crowd and like high five and kids

2262
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,520
and like being genuinely pretty cool. Yeah.

2263
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:28,400
These children and then like the children just still want to see them get killed.

2264
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:31,240
Like, I'm very surprised the kids didn't kind of turn their backs

2265
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:33,000
on the Power Rangers.

2266
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,120
And the putties are so so much more relatable for me now.

2267
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,320
And they're like coming out and talking to us like they're right there.

2268
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:40,560
They're like one of us.

2269
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,960
The Power Rangers are celebrities up on a pedestal. Yeah. Yeah.

2270
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,480
Yes. Yes. They were putting the revving fun with the kids. Yes.

2271
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:48,640
And it does seem odd.

2272
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,720
It feels like, yeah, they were not maybe supposed to do that, but like they don't.

2273
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,600
They didn't want to be mean to kids.

2274
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,880
They wanted the kids to like they were desperate for the kids affection, maybe.

2275
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:00,560
So they were like, yeah, goofing around more like I wonder if there was like

2276
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,320
an instance where like when the show first started, the putties were too scary.

2277
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:05,920
Yeah. The kids were too like, oh, we don't like these putties.

2278
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:08,920
We're like, we got to make this way more silly than it need to be.

2279
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,880
That's why they added the magic and they added

2280
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,640
the weird beat, the the uncomfortableness with Rita.

2281
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:18,200
But sure. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

2282
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:21,800
But yeah, it would have been funny if the kids like silently protested the Rangers

2283
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:25,440
and they turn their back to the Rangers during the middle of the show

2284
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,680
to say, we don't care for what you're doing.

2285
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,600
No more light. No.

2286
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,680
It was also interesting to me that like they took.

2287
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:34,680
So they made a spoiler alert for anyone that's going to watch this on YouTube.

2288
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:38,600
They took the yellow and black ranger

2289
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:42,720
and kind of eliminated them for like a good portion of the show. Yes.

2290
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:46,160
It like you came to see these two and they got turned into a monkey and a bird.

2291
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:49,200
And you don't get to see them get their full action on until the very end.

2292
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:53,720
And they have this like long dialogue and pre-recorded video of like, oh, man,

2293
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:55,640
sucks, we're birds now.

2294
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:57,920
What are we going to do?

2295
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:02,680
Also create some fun Zordon stuff of him saying bad news.

2296
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:06,360
The black ranger, the yellow ranger birds now.

2297
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:11,000
I like his I like talking like Zordon.

2298
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,120
I feel like Zordon is kind of like you do Zordon.

2299
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:15,560
It's not just that you go deep.

2300
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:18,880
It's that it's kind of like a Kermit the Frog, but pitched down.

2301
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,520
It's sort of a very easily thing to it.

2302
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:24,280
Hi, ho. He's also so on here.

2303
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,720
He's also sad. He also sounds very sad.

2304
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:29,480
He said, Saki, yeah, I didn't.

2305
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:32,120
They didn't take me on tour. They wouldn't spring for me.

2306
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:35,000
There should be too many writers. I got greedy.

2307
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,080
There should be a toy like Brian Krantz and didn't do that at all.

2308
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,520
No, I Krantz. It was just straight up Brian Krantz.

2309
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:42,800
He wanted gravitas.

2310
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,400
There should be a toy.

2311
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:47,560
Yellow Ranger is a Zordon toy where you put your head in a tube

2312
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:49,800
and then it gives you Zordon voice.

2313
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,680
That's good. Yeah, good.

2314
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,960
It makes you sad, too.

2315
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:54,600
It makes you sad.

2316
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:55,600
Depressive agent.

2317
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:56,840
There's a depression gas.

2318
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:58,080
I was having a good day today.

2319
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:00,200
And no, I'm not. Oh, jeez.

2320
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,760
People don't know what it's like to live in a tube.

2321
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:06,440
Not that easy being in a tube.

2322
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,120
So you're a Zordon fan, maybe first and foremost.

2323
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2324
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,600
I like Krantz and one.

2325
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:15,120
And yeah, yeah, that's the only voice that I embrace.

2326
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:17,080
It's the opposite of an I.

2327
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:20,360
So so your ooze Zordon, those are your top two guys.

2328
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:21,160
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2329
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:23,920
Oh, yes, I have a good I have an answer for who are my Power Rangers guy.

2330
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:28,280
For sure. It is Zordon and an ooze, which I was saying we went to a birthday party

2331
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:33,720
where our friend Andrew and the party favor was was a playing card.

2332
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:36,440
It was like a fun pack of playing cards that he hadn't opened.

2333
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:38,960
And so you didn't know what was going to be inside.

2334
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:43,280
And I feel like I hit the jackpot because not only did I get a pack of playing cards

2335
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:47,920
from Power Rangers, the movie specifically, as opposed to the show,

2336
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,080
which were also in the pack.

2337
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:50,440
So I don't know what you guys got.

2338
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:54,120
But my I was just opening it like, please, ooze, please, give me Ivan

2339
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:57,520
ooze, a character we did an episode about on the Patreon who I didn't care about

2340
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,560
or had seen before until we did that.

2341
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:04,840
One of my favorite things we found and not one, but two oozes.

2342
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:09,560
Look at that. It's no, you know, it's no like I have a new rookie cards.

2343
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:12,160
Yeah, yeah. It was when he was in his prime.

2344
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:16,760
He was never better than in ninety five, including the one that Jason,

2345
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:20,160
you for Mark Town, as soon as I said it, this is really the this is the prime card.

2346
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:22,080
Who is on first?

2347
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,320
Oh, wow.

2348
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,120
Who's on first?

2349
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:26,320
I appreciate that.

2350
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:31,120
Is yeah, say classic routine, right?

2351
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:34,800
Love these cards. Thank you, Andrew.

2352
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,760
Yeah, well, what have we I mean, we were coming to a close.

2353
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:42,360
This thing seems like I think I would have enjoyed it if I went.

2354
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:43,080
Yeah.

2355
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,600
The guys who put it together were feeling pretty high on it.

2356
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:48,480
I have one more quote from Rock and Roll and for sorry, Ricky Farr.

2357
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,880
He says this.

2358
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:54,240
I can't tell you who, but I've already been asked by a major artist,

2359
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:59,280
a household name, if I can incorporate into his next show some of the kind of magic

2360
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:03,400
and illusions that we're representing with the Power Rangers live on tour.

2361
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:06,040
Wow. Who do we think it is? Who is it? Who do we think that is?

2362
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:09,800
OK, I know that he as I said, Rod Stewart, his name checked a lot.

2363
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,080
But the other one I saw a bunch that this guy represented apparently was Morrissey.

2364
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:14,920
Wow.

2365
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:19,480
Usually he's taken maybe he gets a Morrissey call on one phone, hangs up,

2366
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:23,160
takes a Power Rangers call, so I and I'm no Morrissey.

2367
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:25,320
I don't have him memorized whatsoever.

2368
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,840
But does anyone recall Morrissey having a bunch of magic

2369
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:32,680
that one of Morrissey's enemies was shrunk and put into a cage way above?

2370
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,360
Inflatable version of himself.

2371
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,960
I don't remember that.

2372
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:41,920
Mega Morrissey, he's in his final form.

2373
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:47,320
He made a giant inflatable guy wearing a shirt that said like the meatpacking

2374
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:51,960
industry, you know, and maybe all right.

2375
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:53,600
Oh, yeah, that yes.

2376
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,640
More veganism, more vegan.

2377
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,440
Look up Morrissey inflatable.

2378
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:58,400
Let's see.

2379
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:00,680
You know, just anybody I guess out there think about it.

2380
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:05,240
If you saw something in 96, 97 or so where there was a big inflatable guy,

2381
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:09,440
a bunch of magic tricks, this could this seems like an area

2382
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:13,240
where the Power Rangers might have had some lasting influence and understandably.

2383
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:17,400
Because what kind of what concert wouldn't be made better by a giant inflatable.

2384
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:22,920
There was even discussion after that of this is really weird.

2385
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:26,840
OK, what about further possibilities of morphine rock cross pollination?

2386
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:31,440
Might we someday see an arena spectacular in which Lord Zed, weary of battling

2387
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:35,720
the unflagging Power Rangers, turns his nefarious attentions instead to somebody

2388
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:38,560
like Trent Reznor? Whoa.

2389
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,680
What? And then the guy responds well with a chuckle.

2390
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:43,520
Nine Inch Nails is a client of mine,

2391
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,960
and I'm afraid poor Lord Zed wouldn't stand a chance against Trent.

2392
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:52,040
But I think he'd stand a pretty fair chance against Pink Floyd's pig.

2393
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:56,280
So we're imagine I love like this is an article in the L.A. Times where an adult

2394
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:01,520
is imagining scenarios where Lord Zed fights Trent Reznor and the Pink Floyd pig.

2395
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,080
That's awesome, by the way. Yeah.

2396
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:05,160
What a life. Rock and roll adversary Ricky Fargo.

2397
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:09,800
Lord Zed being like, I hurt myself today

2398
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:12,800
to see.

2399
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:16,040
He got the Trent's got the sole job, not me.

2400
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:19,440
Damn it. I wanted that Oscar.

2401
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:22,360
Gosh, well, there's still I mean, there's still possibility of Zed.

2402
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:27,800
Maybe if Reznor scores a Zed movie like a Zed origin movie.

2403
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:28,960
Oh, yes.

2404
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:32,080
Wait, why are we breaking them off into the first one?

2405
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,800
Not do well enough. Yeah, I want spin offs.

2406
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:38,120
I want. Yeah, Zed solo solo, obviously canceled the second remake, right?

2407
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:39,640
Then they were going to do a sequel to the pirate.

2408
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:41,480
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

2409
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,920
I think they canceled it.

2410
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:44,680
I don't think it did super young.

2411
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:46,440
I want young Zed.

2412
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:48,440
Young Zed is like a show on NBC.

2413
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:50,880
Yes, he's like a little boy right over young rock.

2414
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:54,280
He's a little guy shows up and he's a little boy, but his muscles are potent.

2415
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:56,160
You can see his muscles.

2416
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:59,200
And that's it played by Jenny Gargano.

2417
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:03,000
Oh, man. Yeah.

2418
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,400
Who could it be?

2419
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,840
Oh, wait, I was saying you were young.

2420
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:07,840
Oh, I don't want that.

2421
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,560
I don't want that responsibility to play young Zed.

2422
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:11,200
I can't bring that. That's like Hamlet.

2423
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:13,560
That's like Hamlet. We got the helmet already.

2424
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:15,240
I do have the helmet.

2425
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:16,040
I do have the helmet.

2426
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:18,320
If that's the only requirement, then yes, I can play young Zed.

2427
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,080
All right.

2428
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,840
Well, here's owning the Hasbro helmet.

2429
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,400
I got it. I got it in the bank.

2430
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:25,280
Well, hopefully at least Power Ranger Live people come to you after this.

2431
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:28,280
After I gave them the idea that you should stop wrestling and become

2432
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:31,040
a full time Power Ranger live performer. I'd love to.

2433
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:31,880
I'd love to.

2434
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:33,880
So people out there do it. Do it.

2435
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:37,280
Yeah. Any of the Power Ranger live people out there that wants to see me on stage

2436
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:41,120
as the Green Ranger or White Ranger this instance, I'm more than down.

2437
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:43,440
Yeah. I'm prepared. I'm fully prepared. I'm trained.

2438
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:44,800
Yes. You are.

2439
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,320
I have a certificate to prove it.

2440
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,640
You have a great reel. Yeah.

2441
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:51,160
And that's good because the later seasons of Power Rangers,

2442
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:54,280
they're getting slammed into concrete a lot more often.

2443
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:55,680
Is that true? No one's.

2444
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:58,200
Oh, that could be good.

2445
01:56:58,200 --> 01:56:59,120
More practical.

2446
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:00,360
Yeah, it is practical effects.

2447
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,200
I haven't watched it.

2448
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,520
Oh, God. Jason David Frank came back for this episode.

2449
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:06,040
He got German suplex on the conference.

2450
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:10,840
He's a tough guy. Jason David Frank and Austin St.

2451
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,280
John, right? Yeah.

2452
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:14,840
Austin St. John, they came back a lot. They did.

2453
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,040
They are like recently recently.

2454
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,720
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. They're in the family.

2455
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:21,960
Yeah. So anyway, Jason David Frank, in my in my memory,

2456
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:25,160
it was like the number one guy of my childhood.

2457
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:27,000
Like no one touched Jason David Frank.

2458
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I saw Michaels.

2459
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:31,200
It's like a one two of Jason David Frank and Shawn Michaels to me.

2460
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:33,520
Sure. Like my my role models growing up.

2461
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,440
Yeah, I can see that.

2462
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,440
Yeah. Tommy was very cool.

2463
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,160
He was so cool.

2464
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:41,080
And he like Kimberly liked him.

2465
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:43,440
He did. Wow.

2466
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:46,640
So much so that I didn't even have a favorite Power Ranger until Tommy showed up.

2467
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,680
I like I like held my reservations.

2468
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:51,040
I was like, I don't know. I'm not feeling anyone yet on this team.

2469
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,480
And then Tommy showed up and I was like, there's my guy.

2470
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:55,240
There's my guy right there.

2471
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:56,200
Everyone thought that way.

2472
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:57,200
Yeah. Now that I'm thinking about it,

2473
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:00,880
I am unlocking some sort of memory where I was like, then maybe Kimberly would like me

2474
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,360
if I was as cool as Tommy.

2475
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:05,640
I think I did like I do think I liked Kimberly.

2476
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:07,720
I do think so. So. Yeah.

2477
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:09,400
Well, who wouldn't? Yeah.

2478
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:12,760
Come on. Well, I think you served as a

2479
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:17,640
white ranger upping the stakes and the quality of this episode.

2480
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:19,920
Jenny Gargano, you survived podcast The Ride.

2481
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:23,520
Thanks so much for joining us from afar and via video.

2482
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:26,320
This is a blast. Let's exit through the gift shop.

2483
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,240
Is there anything you would like to plug?

2484
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:31,360
You can find me on Twitch at Twitch TV slash the Johnny Wrestling.
