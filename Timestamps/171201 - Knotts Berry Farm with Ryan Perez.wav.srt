Berry Farm with guest Ryan Perez.

Trap in for Podcast the Ride.

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,560
Hello and welcome to Podcast the Ride, the podcast about theme parks hosted by three men

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,600
who once counted audio animatronics as their only friends.

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,920
Joining me today is Jason Sheridan.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Hi.

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,400
And the great Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Oh great.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Wow.

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,960
He got a great arbitrarily change you a great and not Jason.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
That's nice.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
I thought they did make me feel like good.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,280
Also, and as all the greats, that was the Larry King movie on my part.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,440
You know call anyone great, like great Joey Budafuco.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,320
It would be anyone he was talking to.

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
The great Will.I.Am.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,400
The one and only Pol Pot is here.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,960
He was being nice.

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
We'll trade it out.

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,120
I'll call you great next time and I'll call Carlson dirt.

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,520
Hey, we're a part of Feral Audio, home to Doughboys, Beyond Yacht Rock and many other

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
great podcasts.

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Check out Feral Audio at feralaudio.com.

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,080
How's everybody doing guys?

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
What's going on?

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
Good.

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
I don't know.

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Everything's fine.

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
No recent developments?

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,560
Anybody's dying to get off their chests in the world of theme parks or otherwise?

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
No.

35
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,840
I mean I just ate a big tuna sandwich and it's sitting weird with me, but other than

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
that everything's fine.

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,960
You've got a real roller coaster ride in your stomach.

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
Yeah.

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,640
It was like a big bread bowl basically and then there was tuna in it, but it was called

40
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,320
a sandwich, but it was weird and I ate all of the bread.

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,120
I ate every single piece of bread and it's bad right now.

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
It was good bread.

43
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
It was good Italian bread.

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
Oh, we all ate.

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
I was pretending we didn't eat.

46
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
I was keeping that secret.

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,680
No, but we all just ate together.

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
That's true.

49
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,600
So, well, we don't want to sell out the restaurant, but start poking around the Burbank area.

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,480
If you're in the Burbank area, see if you can guess what was the place.

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:29,120
I had a thing I wanted to address real quick because I'm not 100% sure when you will be

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,680
listening to this episode listeners.

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,040
As we recorded, it's early October.

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,060
It's the start of the Halloween season and I feel like we should mention a lot of theme

55
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,000
parks go all out with the haunts, Halloween Horror Nights at Universal, not Scary Farm.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,080
We are three men who do not like to be scared, right?

57
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,040
Yeah, we don't do the haunts, do we?

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,320
We're not haunt people.

59
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,680
I think this might be true of our guest as well if I know him.

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Our guest is-

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
He doesn't like a good spook.

62
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Our guest is Ryan Perez.

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,320
He's a great writer and actor.

64
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,000
The great Ryan Perez.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He's great.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,240
Let me ask, do you like to be spooked, Ryan?

67
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,720
This is a very odd way to-

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,240
Yeah, we didn't really build you up.

69
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,880
We gave you no credits.

70
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,600
Who is this guy?

71
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,200
Yes, I mean immediately I'm a pussy before anything.

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,240
First you know him as a pussy.

73
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,840
No other achievements.

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
Do I like the spooks or not?

75
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,480
I don't really love these, what are they, not scary farm Halloween Horror Night kind

76
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
of things.

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,960
Like teens jumping out at you to be, yeah.

78
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,200
No, I've only been to one which was the Queen Mary.

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,320
I think they still do it.

80
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,600
They would retrofit their boat to be a haunted boat and then on the grounds of the Queen

81
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,200
Mary they would have various horror mazes and things.

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,840
I found the whole thing very stressful.

83
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,920
It's very cheap.

84
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
It's a very cheap thrill.

85
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,920
I don't care for it.

86
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,040
Anybody can jump out from behind a thing and scare you.

87
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,440
It is pretty true and hiring a teenager at minimum wage is probably literally cheaper

88
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:23,320
than building an animatronic or some kind of machine to blast smoke or fog at you.

89
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,240
The thing that's weird to me is that people love it.

90
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,860
It's beloved.

91
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,760
This is the most popular time for all of these things is people go there just to get a teenager

92
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,200
to jump at them.

93
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,560
But they also want to be part of the twisted mazes going to the world of Guillermo del

94
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Toro.

95
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:49,680
It does seem like those Universal Studios, I don't go to them really, but they are supposedly

96
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,440
good experiences for horror film nerds.

97
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,560
I don't think it's like they aren't like chintzy sellout-y experiences.

98
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,800
They make a good set.

99
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,760
They make the set look very authentic to whatever the IP is.

100
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,160
They have a shining maze this year that looks great.

101
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
That's an interesting idea.

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,360
I think they should do a mother, a Darren Aronofsky's mother horror house where the

103
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,080
whole thing is a metaphor for the destruction of our planet.

104
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Is that what it is?

105
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,440
And the patriarchy's religious control.

106
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,120
Scarier than any scar-ector.

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
We live in a constant horror maze.

108
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,760
We live in a horror maze.

109
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:45,880
It's a horror maze about me and how I use my girlfriends and throw them away after they've

110
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,160
given me all the artistic validation I need.

111
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,120
Is it a very personal statement on Mr. Aronofsky's part?

112
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
It's the darkest part of his psyche?

113
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,180
It's a very personal...

114
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,360
This movie, I should just have a podcast just talking about mother.

115
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:12,720
I'll talk to these Feral Audio guys after that and see if I can have just one podcast.

116
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,040
It's called Exclaimin' About Mother.

117
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,440
Every week I have a different person talking about mother.

118
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,240
Mother has many different kinds of themes in it.

119
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:30,600
An environmentalist theme, a sort of religious allegory, and a statement about artistic inspiration.

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,640
And they're all pretentious, all three of them.

121
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,240
One mild theme.

122
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,840
Universal this year also has one maze called the Horrors of Blumhouse, which is the production

123
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
company that makes horror movies.

124
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
So it's got me.

125
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,000
So it's like a get out move.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,440
Their company is a codified Pixar.

127
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,080
You get a little of the purge, you get a little sinister, and a little bit of Happy Death

128
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Day.

129
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
What?

130
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,080
The upcoming Happy Death Day.

131
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,560
Oh, so it's a tease for the movie Happy Death Day.

132
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,640
But no get out.

133
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,040
That's their big hit.

134
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't think they could do a get out now.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Little touchy.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a bit...

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,820
Oh, I want a sunken place ride.

138
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,960
That would be great.

139
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,040
Jordan Peele went in and pitched the ride and then somebody clinked on a glass and his

140
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
ideas were not even...

141
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I guess they'll be in all right now.

142
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,680
Never mind, it was a dumb idea.

143
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,800
There is an actual discussion on the Horror Nights Twitter account of someone going, why

144
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,040
didn't you make a get out house?

145
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,240
And did they respond to that?

146
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
They did.

147
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,200
One of the Universal creative people were like, I need you.

148
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,240
All right, I'm going to try to be very nice about this.

149
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,960
I need you to think about what that movie was about and then think about why we didn't

150
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
do that.

151
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,200
That we couldn't do a house based on a...

152
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Who is the person responding?

153
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,280
This doesn't sound like the official PR account of Universal Studios.

154
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,720
It was one of the creative people.

155
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,240
I don't know who exactly, but they were just like, we could not.

156
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,840
The movie is a Rachel...

157
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,120
We can't do that.

158
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,160
We're glad you enjoyed the movie, but we could not make a haunted house.

159
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,440
That would be very inappropriate.

160
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,480
Well, can we send the get out gang on a new adventure where they're running away from

161
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,600
more conventional villains like skeletons and goblins?

162
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,040
Get out meets Freddy.

163
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,800
This time goblins were trying to sell me as a modern slave.

164
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,160
Let me ask this, are all the mazes in one Blum house?

165
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,760
Is there a Blum house?

166
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,160
I don't know the answer to that.

167
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Okay, probably not.

168
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,800
So it's probably, the Blum house is not a real house is what I guess what I'm asking.

169
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,960
I hope it's like, because at the Disney studios in Florida, you can go into a recreation of

170
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,160
the Pixar campus.

171
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,320
It looks like the Emeryville campus of Pixar.

172
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,160
So if they made it look like whatever the production bungalow is of Blumhouse honoring

173
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,720
the famous Blumhouse headquarters.

174
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,320
Just like a harried intern answering phones.

175
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,400
Palettes of Diet Coke everywhere.

176
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,360
Are you here for the haunting?

177
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Okay, well, just have a seat.

178
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,400
You get to take a general at one house.

179
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,120
The scary thing and then they tell you they'll call you and they don't.

180
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,160
The real world is full of horrors.

181
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,120
Blum house doesn't like your pitch.

182
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
I'm so sorry.

183
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
I'm so sorry.

184
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,160
The on tap cold brew machine is not working today.

185
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Well, Mike, you had some business with the horrors of singer songwriters.

187
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,160
That was a good Byron Allen transition.

188
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,160
So Mike, I understand you've got some complaints about what you've heard lately.

189
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
So your father used to give you a whooping, right?

190
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,160
No, it was the one where he was like, so John, I understand you're getting older.

191
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,160
I said that to John Lovitz, I think.

192
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,160
I understand you have some observations about the difference between men and women.

193
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,160
For anyone who doesn't know, there's a show called Comics Unleashed hosted by a man named

194
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Byron Allen and it's just they end up stealing their material and that's the way he transitions.

195
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,160
If you like your comics leashed, do not tune in.

196
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Comics Unleashed also, you'll just be watching it like I was watching it the other night

197
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,160
and like Robert Schiml, like a dead comics will just show up on him.

198
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
There'll be four dead comedians.

199
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,160
These guys have any great Geraldo.

200
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Mitch Hedberg, you have a story about coupons.

201
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Any young men.

202
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,160
I guess he's alive. I thought he was dead.

203
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
You had a soft shoe to do, is that correct?

204
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Hey, Mort Sahl, what's in the newspaper today?

205
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Anyway, enough about Byron Allen.

206
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,160
So, yeah, so my buddy and I were at California Adventure and we're at the line.

207
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,160
So Cars Land is a land dedicated to the successful franchise of Cars,

208
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
where the Cars talk in case you have not seen these.

209
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,160
It's Mater and Lightning McQueen and kids like it.

210
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,160
We all probably agree we like Cars Land better than we like the movies.

211
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Cars Land is wonderful. The movies are fine.

212
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,160
So in line for the big ride called Radiator Springs Racer,

213
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,160
they play old timey music, rock and roll country stuff.

214
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,160
And it's not it's like real old. It's not like new old stuff.

215
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,160
It's really old stuff.

216
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Yeah, but sounds like a little bit.

217
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Everyone's in like a little box. The recordings are all bad.

218
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,160
And the one song which I've heard before in pieces,

219
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,160
we were sitting there and we heard it and we were singing the chorus of it.

220
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
And then we looked and we found the whole song.

221
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,160
And it's a song by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys and it's called Roly Poly.

222
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,160
And I'll play here.

223
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,160
You can hear it sounds old.

224
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,160
And it's I can't believe this was I think this was like a popular song.

225
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,160
I think it's a banger.

226
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Alright, so here.

227
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:22,160
We'll get after the piano comes out. Oh, wait, there's a whole intro.

228
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Now we're all up and dancing.

229
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,160
We can't focus on some point you got.

230
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Oh, no, the fiddles coming in.

231
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,160
I really planned poorly for this.

232
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Trash can full of stones they're going to rotate.

233
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,140
The

234
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,160
the

235
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
long as he can chew it.

236
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
It's OK.

237
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,160
He can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye.

238
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,160
He likes everything from soup to hay.

239
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Roly poly daddy's little daddy.

240
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,160
All right, so

241
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,160
that should give you an idea of what the song the song is.

242
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Best I can tell is about a man admiring his son is chubby son.

243
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,160
And the chorus is the roly poly daddy's little fatty.

244
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,160
But he's going to be a man someday.

245
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,160
And it's just like talking about how much his son is eating.

246
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,160
While he's doing chores on a farm.

247
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Not a bus going on a biscuit, hungry every minute.

248
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Roy, he can eat an apple pie and never bat an eye.

249
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,160
And then the second verse is like scrambled eggs for breakfast bread and jelly 20 times a day.

250
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
I mean, it's it's weird.

251
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,160
I mean, it's a man who wrote like a pop song about his son overeating.

252
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,160
But it's not a fat shaming song.

253
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
No, he's admiring it. Yeah. Yeah.

254
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:04,160
I think without this song, without Mike Huckabee's father writing him this song,

255
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,160
he wouldn't have achieved the success that he has in life.

256
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,160
That wouldn't be a shock if it was like, oh, did you know that was written about Mike Huckabee?

257
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,160
I'd be like, oh, yeah. Oh, of course. OK.

258
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,160
And then Huckabee got to sing it to his two large sons.

259
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,160
Yeah. Right. Right. He got to clang it on the bass.

260
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Fox and Friends or whatever the hell show he plays.

261
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
I learned to jam. I jammed on. Oh, he plays on a Huckabee.

262
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Oh, my text. Oh, yeah.

263
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Don't yank that cord out. I had it muted. I forgot.

264
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,160
It's the Bob Willis and the Playboys estate.

265
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
They're shutting us down.

266
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,160
When somebody plays one of my songs, a little fat angel gets his wings.

267
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Good luck carrying little fatty around.

268
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Those wings are going to work overtime.

269
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:55,160
I don't think I'd ever heard Daddy's Little Fatty in like a pop culture reference.

270
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,160
There's like one Adventure Time or something.

271
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,160
I think Ice King calls one of the penguins Daddy's Little Fatty at one point.

272
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Yeah, I don't know if that's an expression, but we were listening to it because most of the songs are just about

273
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,160
most of those songs in the line are just either about like rock and rollin or driving a car.

274
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
And then there's this one we were like, what the hell is this?

275
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Is it mostly country music in Cars Land or is it tough?

276
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Well, it's outside in Cars Land, I think it's more rock and roll, 50s rock and roll.

277
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:30,160
And then when you're in the line for Radiator Springs, it's more like country, old time country or like standard type music.

278
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,160
I think it goes a little bit even. It's like older music in line for Radiator Springs.

279
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,160
But it's very specifically chosen and they really went after what they do.

280
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,160
I guess really pay attention because there must be some maybe some other weird songs,

281
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,160
weird old timey songs that are playing in that line.

282
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Women should stay in their place.

283
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,160
They're like, all right, get on the car, get on the ride.

284
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
And you're like, what was that? No, no, no.

285
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
Don't worry about that.

286
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
You don't have enough time to register.

287
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Sending a subliminal message from the 40s to get me to re-adhere to traditional value.

288
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Hey, well, from one song, one cool jam to another, I'm going to transition us into today's topic with a spirited song.

289
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Take you back to 1986. And here we go.

290
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Can I leave? Can I do it?

291
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
For the discussion.

292
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
The door is locked from the outside.

293
00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:00,160
And the man who's easily frightened, who wanted to talk about the place from which that song came.

294
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:09,160
There's a YouTube channel. You can find several employee morale building music videos such as that was my favorite.

295
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,160
We love the farm. There's also a what I like about knots.

296
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,160
So check those out anyway.

297
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Hey, today we're loving the farm here with Ryan Perez, who you know, you have some some particular childhood affection right around.

298
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
You're probably going there. It all went away.

299
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
You love it.

300
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
I take it back.

301
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,160
You might admit you could be potentially in this video somewhere.

302
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,160
You could have been at the park and unaware.

303
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
That's true.

304
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
1986. You might be on the merry-go-round.

305
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
I'm looking at right now.

306
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
You're on an ostrich going by.

307
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Yeah. So you grew up.

308
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Because you grew up in Orange County and wait in Laguna, Laguna, Nogale or Laguna.

309
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
Yes. Yeah.

310
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,160
So you're the well near Disneyland, but also very near near the Knott's Berry farm.

311
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Yeah. What's your what's your what's your relationship with with knots?

312
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,160
Well, that's I've always liked because it's kind of number two.

313
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:18,160
Like in this, I guess it's maybe it might be number three, actually, I think, by universal in Southern California, actually, because Magic Mountain, I think, is also more.

314
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
So Knott's is coming in at four.

315
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Actually, that's might be the worst part in the country, with the exception of like Action Park or whatever.

316
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Or people.

317
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Traction.

318
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,160
But it has like such a huge.

319
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,160
I'm just so in my heart, it's number one.

320
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,160
I really like Knott's more than any other.

321
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:53,160
And growing up, so much of that of my memories of this of Knott's and really all these Southern California parks have to do with my parents and my mom in particular lived out here.

322
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,160
She's originally from South Carolina, but moved out here in 10 and lived in Anaheim.

323
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:10,160
And so she has these memories of Disneyland as a young woman and going there when it was sort of when you didn't have to pay and you would buy tickets to individual rides and everything.

324
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
So she has those memories.

325
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Her and my dad would go see bands at Disneyland.

326
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:26,160
This is like in an era when jazz bands and big band Count Basie and Woody Herman and these kinds of Duke Ellington would play there.

327
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Yeah, they got really legitimate.

328
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
And there's no admission.

329
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
I didn't think about that.

330
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
So they used it just as a bandstand.

331
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Yeah, at the Carnation Plaza.

332
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,160
And so so much of growing up.

333
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,160
These are the kind of stories that I would hear about like, yeah, Disneyland used to be.

334
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
We just go there and dance.

335
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:49,160
You know, it was not like you can still actually there's a place for it still.

336
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:54,160
It's a tiny place where like old people go and some young people to swing dance at Disneyland at night.

337
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Yeah, they tried to move it to downtown Disney.

338
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
And I think it happens there sometimes, too.

339
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
But then they eventually brought it back to the park.

340
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
There's a little area.

341
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,160
There's a little area out of the way where they let you swing dance.

342
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Anyway, and yeah, that's I mean, it's still I guess it's still sort of in the heritage of the park.

343
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:21,160
And then my mom was also a she was a hostess at a restaurant called Shake Harry, which used to be an orange or in Santa Ana.

344
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:30,160
And it was sort of one of Southern California, really one of Orange County's like only five star restaurants, a very high quality restaurant.

345
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
And there was a lot of celebrities that would come in.

346
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,160
John Wayne and Lucille Ball and Walter Knott would come in as well.

347
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:43,160
And so she sort of had that, you know, time waiting on Walter Knott.

348
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:53,160
And then of all places in the world, when my parents got married in 1970, they got married at the Church of Reflections at Knott's Berry Farm,

349
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,160
which is a little chapel that sits inside of the park.

350
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,160
And if you go there, it's still there. People still get married there to this day.

351
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,160
But the park was very different back then.

352
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,160
It was sort of like in the four wedding photos that my parents have.

353
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,160
One of them is them in the Church of Reflections getting married and then one of them is feeding chickens.

354
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,160
It was like, oh, well, it's a fun place to get married.

355
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,160
You go to the chapel and then you feed the chickens and then we'll go home.

356
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Like it was that kind of situation. I don't even know if they had rides. I think they probably had a ride or two.

357
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,160
They were maybe starting to around then.

358
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,160
But they also, yeah, they didn't have an admission for a very long time.

359
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,160
And it sort of came out of this tradition of like it was like a like a roadside stop.

360
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:45,160
They really started as a farm and they added this restaurant and started adding this like old west calico ghost town kind of stuff

361
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,160
just to give people something to do while they waited for the endless line.

362
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Like this chicken dinner restaurant, the line would build up for three, four hours and let's give people something to do.

363
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,160
And so it really like very organically became a theme park and not really a premeditated.

364
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:08,160
And it still shows to this day that it's sort of this weird mishmash of like, oh, then this grew and then we did this and this.

365
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
And it's sort of all over the place, but it still has all this old stuff.

366
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
So it's a very like interesting like time capsule.

367
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Yeah, the old west vibe is still very much there.

368
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:23,160
And back when I was going to it, mostly in like the early 90s as a as a, you know, whatever, middle school kid or whatever,

369
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,160
we would take a middle school trip and that would be the graduation trip.

370
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Also, not had like a crazy deal in maybe 1994 or 95 where it was like fifteen dollars a person after three or four p.m.

371
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,160
So like during the summer, we would go multiple times.

372
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,160
My family would go multiple times. And so much more so than Disneyland.

373
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,160
That was the place to go.

374
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,160
And then also it wasn't a particularly popular park.

375
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,160
So you could just get on the log ride or whatever and ride it over and over and over again.

376
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,160
And I mean, there were just no lines for anything.

377
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,160
And so in a way, it felt like having your own little park or whatever at certain times of day.

378
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,160
You would go there like on a late August day and and, you know, have the park to yourself almost.

379
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,160
It's still pretty affordable compared to other.

380
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,160
It is like I think the tickets vary price wise by season.

381
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,160
But like if we went down tomorrow, I think it's like forty five dollars to get it.

382
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,160
And it's one of those were like you give us 80 bucks.

383
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
You can come in whenever you want for a year. Oh, yeah.

384
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Like whatever you want. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

385
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Like because it's they want they want people there.

386
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Yeah. Which I think is nice.

387
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,160
It is an unfortunate thing about Disneyland that it's getting more and more and more expensive.

388
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,160
And now there's add ons to get you like more better access to the rides.

389
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,160
It really is becoming, you know, yeah, it's so insane for a giant family to go to Disneyland.

390
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,160
So for there to be like a fun local place that is not bank breaking, I think is cool.

391
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:57,160
And it's unique in the history of theme parks and that like both Disney and Universal were made by movie companies, you know,

392
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,160
made by movie companies featuring their properties.

393
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:06,160
And this, like you said, Scott, was a roadside attraction that just grew and grew and kind of evolved into a park.

394
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:13,160
And has never really retained any kind of property other than peanuts, which has that association with.

395
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:22,160
But that I think is because of Cedar. It's owned by the Cedar Fair Company now, which runs Cedar Fair and in Pennsylvania,

396
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Dorney Park and a bunch of other parks around the country.

397
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,160
And I think a lot of those parks have the the peanuts characters.

398
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,160
But I think peanuts were first. They now have under that general license.

399
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,160
The peanuts also it was a Camp Snoopy is the peanuts area.

400
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,160
And it used to be Camp Snoopy in the middle of the Mall of America as well.

401
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:47,160
I'm not sure how affiliated those things were, but two big two Camp Snoopy locations in odd places.

402
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,160
I've been I mean, we went Scott Ryan and we were there once and we saw.

403
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
This is the last time I was there. This is about three years ago.

404
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,160
OK, because it was there was an ice show. It was a peanuts ice show.

405
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Snoopy on ice. Yes, Snoopy on ice.

406
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:08,160
One of my greatest memories is Snoopy at the very end dancing to Opa Gangnam style.

407
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,160
That's like my platonic ideal for entertainment.

408
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,160
Yeah, this was very disappointing because I had never seen Snoopy on ice.

409
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,160
And I thought, oh, it'll be a you'll go see Snoopy on ice and it'll be Vince Guraldi music.

410
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:27,160
And it'll sort of have the like it'll be like an ice show that has the sweet feeling of a Christmas special.

411
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,160
It was the most obnoxious thing I've ever seen.

412
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:37,160
I believe one of the routines was set to the Sugar Ray cover of Abracadabra.

413
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,160
And then there was like maybe a weird Al song or like was Eated in there or something or there was a food.

414
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,160
There was a whole kitchen section. But it was just like humans.

415
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,160
Snoopy was the only one who was a character. He was the only one on ice.

416
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Just local talented ice dancers.

417
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:58,160
And like we were sitting in the front row and we were getting hit by like just the spray, the ice spray in the face.

418
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Did you ever see did you ever go to a park that had Star Trek on ice?

419
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,160
What? That was in. What the hell?

420
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Kings Dominion, another Cedar Faroe Park now was one of the Paramount branded parks in the 90s.

421
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:20,160
And a lot of these regional parks, for whatever reason, yeah, they tend to have ice shows, I guess, because they're cheaper than stunt shows.

422
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,160
To make you just need some ice skaters. What was the narrative of that?

423
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I cannot remember, but there was definitely. Oh, that's well, that makes a lot of sense.

424
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:37,160
I think they played this music. They played the Star Trek music like like you would think,

425
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,160
like you thought with the Vince Garaldi music would play with Snoopy.

426
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,160
This was like the next generation. Next generation was on at the time.

427
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,160
Oh, there's probably a video of this. We got to do a whole thing on this.

428
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,160
What were the characters? Were the characters like Picard was Picard on ice?

429
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,160
I think it was like generic crew members and then maybe some cling.

430
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,160
I think there were two Klingons did like a mating ice skating ice.

431
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,160
I don't think I'm making this up.

432
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
We'll come back to this. We'll come back to this.

433
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,160
That's what like people outside the thing said when they looked at the marquee. Klingons ice skating.

434
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Now this I got to see. Yeah. God, that does sound really awful and great.

435
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:26,160
The other thing that Nats has right now that's like an IP is Elvira is doing a Halloween show.

436
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
I saw that. She's been doing it for many years.

437
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Last year, I believe. Little kids out there. Is this the last year?

438
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,160
I think maybe. We know you love Elvira.

439
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,160
You're clamoring for more Elvira. Every I don't know.

440
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,160
My little niece, 10 years old, she says, I want Elvira.

441
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Where do we go to see Elvira? I go, there's a place. That's Mary Farm.

442
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Where do we see her do what Elvira does? You know, Elvira's act.

443
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Yes, this it's like an old cabaret act essentially.

444
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,160
I haven't seen it in a long time. She tells jokes, I think.

445
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,160
I think it's like the Bill and Ted Halloween special.

446
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,160
The thing they did at Universal. Are they still doing it in Florida? Is that right?

447
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
This is the last year of the one in Florida.

448
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,160
All these special Halloween shows are ending.

449
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,160
I can't be the real actress that plays Elvira. It is.

450
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Yes. So she does shows. Yes, she does like five shows in a week.

451
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,160
She like lives in Buena Park for the Halloween season.

452
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
It's like a cabaret residency.

453
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,160
It's interesting at Halloween that there's an exclusive place you can see Elvira.

454
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:31,160
I like it. All kidding aside about Elvira, it's pretty cool that Elvira's down in Buena Park for a month.

455
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,160
That's great that she just has a residency for a month. That's terrific.

456
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Now that you know it's not a regional Elvira.

457
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:44,160
So weird knockoff Elvira on all the cedar points. There's a different young girl playing Elvira.

458
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,160
No, that wouldn't be fun. You would see right through that.

459
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:53,160
The real cleavage. I don't know anything about Elvira. That seems to be a big...

460
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Elvira was, that was her thing. She was sexy. She was sort of a sexy vampire. I think Vampira sued her.

461
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,160
Yeah, yeah. She stole Vampira's gimmick supposedly.

462
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Are you the Groundlings? Yeah, she is. Because she's in, the actress is in, what's her name?

463
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Cassandra Peterson, I believe. She's in Pee-wee's Big Adventure.

464
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
That's right.

465
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:20,160
And there's a moment, my memory of Elvira, I might be wrong about this, but it was like

466
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:27,160
as a little kid staying up to watch Saturday Night Live, sometimes it would be, my two memories,

467
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,160
it would be like preempted because of wrestling, which was a bummer,

468
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:38,160
which because I was not a wrestling watcher, and also preempted because Elvira would sometimes come on.

469
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
I feel like, you'd be like, what's Elvira doing?

470
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:47,160
I saw, I think up until a couple years ago, she had a show still out at midnight on NBC or whatever channel,

471
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:53,160
and it would just be like Mystery Science Theater, but maybe a tenth of the jokes.

472
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:58,160
And I literally mean to say, she would play a minute of the movie, and it would be like a Wolfman,

473
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,160
and a little circle would appear, and Elvira, and she'd be like, this looks like my last ex-boyfriend.

474
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,160
And then the circle would close, and then it would be a minute, and then another minute,

475
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
and then she would come back in with another joke.

476
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
Oh, she would host a movie.

477
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
She would host basically like a bad movie.

478
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Like a Ghoulardy or a Joe Bob movie.

479
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Yeah, so it was the same kind of horror movie host gimmick, but it seemed like there was,

480
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,160
they just probably had like 30 of them, and they would just put these in different movies,

481
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,160
and they were the most generic, because she was literally like, my ex-boyfriend, huh?

482
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
And like rolled her eyes.

483
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,160
And it could be any weird looking thing or guy.

484
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,160
I don't know that that's true, but it felt like it.

485
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,160
It felt like they were so not specific to whatever I was watching.

486
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,160
The production value sure is hokey of what's going on behind you.

487
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
Yeah, whoa.

488
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,160
What generic comments to comment on an old movie?

489
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
That's like a reverse dream on.

490
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,160
That's like if you put dream on in a thing that made it go backward,

491
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:59,160
it would be watching an old movie with contemporary comments that don't apply to it necessarily.

492
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
I figured it out.

493
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Wait, what channel was Dream On on?

494
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
Was HBO Dream On?

495
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
Yeah, that was HBO.

496
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
So this would be on OVH.

497
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Oh, you got to watch a Dream On.

498
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,160
That's when Dream On is one of those HBO shows that like HBO Go or Now has disavowed.

499
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
What was it?

500
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,160
I don't think it's in the collection of old shows that you can pull up on HBO.

501
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
But I mean, what happened on?

502
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I thought I knew what it was, but I can't picture it now.

503
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Dream On?

504
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Oh.

505
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Dream On was about a guy who, hell, it was Brian Ben-Ben was the guy.

506
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,160
And the idea was that as a kid, he'd watched all this old television.

507
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,160
And so as he's going through his daily life, dating and troubles at work or whatever,

508
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:52,160
it would cut to clips from old TV shows to punctuate what was going on.

509
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,160
So he's in bed with a woman and he's having a hard time getting the bra off or whatever.

510
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,160
And then it would cut to an old movie where a guy's trying to defuse a bomb or something.

511
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,160
And that was how the show worked.

512
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
Could it be a rights issue?

513
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Oh, probably. That's true. Yeah, that's true.

514
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Oh, maybe.

515
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
Do they have like their old horny shows and stuff?

516
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Like the Real Sex, do they have all those or whatever?

517
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,160
I think they have like one or two Real Sexes, but not the entire collection of Real Sex.

518
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Also maybe a rights issue.

519
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
That's true.

520
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Real Sex is so funny because it was like Real Sex 57.

521
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,160
Let's just make it a series.

522
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Why are we doing Real Sex 1 million bajillion, gajillion?

523
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Yeah, they have to keep three numbers.

524
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Like Chicago albums.

525
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Roman numerals.

526
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm jumping around and order things a little bit here, but this kind of dovetails into...

527
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I found a YouTube oddity of a weird cable show that seemed to be a cable show that was on,

528
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,160
but it could have been like a presentation and there were just clips from it.

529
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
It was just cut up into parts.

530
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:04,160
But there was a show called Dinosaurs that was hosted by Gary Owen from Laugh-In.

531
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Is that right? That's who Gary Owen is?

532
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,160
He was the announcer.

533
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:16,160
But there was a show about dinosaurs where they explored the modern fascination with dinosaurs

534
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:22,160
and went to weird road stop places that have dinosaurs, like the place on the way to Palm Springs.

535
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:28,160
And there was a...so I found a clip of Gary Owen and the other host going on this ride,

536
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Kingdom of the Dinosaurs, which is a dark ride, a sadly departed dark ride that Nutsberry Farm used to have.

537
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,160
And you can watch it. It's not an edited segment of him on the ride.

538
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:47,160
It is just raw footage pointed at the host and you don't really see what's around him too much.

539
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:55,160
And you can hear the director in the other car giving ideas of lines and things for him to say.

540
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,160
So you'll hear some mumbled thing and then Gary Owen will repeat it back,

541
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:04,160
such as they pass by like a big lava flow, something that looks real hot.

542
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,160
And Gary Owen says, I'll have my filet medium rare, please.

543
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Oh, that's a line.

544
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
That's good.

545
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,160
And then later they pass by a particular animal and Gary Owen says,

546
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Oh, look at the saber toothed executive.

547
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,160
This sounds like whatever director was feeding him lines.

548
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:29,160
This sounds like Scott Gardner's dream job.

549
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,160
Sounds like everything you're mentioning this because you want to see if there's a contemporary example of this.

550
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,160
So if any aspiring sizzle reel creators out there are...

551
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,160
There's an 80 year old announcer that you can feed lines to.

552
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Like, oh, looks like my mother-in-law.

553
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Wait, yeah, lines about theme parks through a voice that I can do very readily.

554
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,160
I rode Kingdom of the Dinosaurs a bunch because it was one of those rides with no line.

555
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,160
If you went to the park in like 1994, no line.

556
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,160
And I had my little sister Carly at the time, she was four or five years old,

557
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,160
loved dinosaurs and so we would jump on that ride.

558
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,160
And it was a good ride.

559
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,160
Can I ask, was it a slow moving ride?

560
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
Yes.

561
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Someone who grew up in Orange County and used to go to knots a lot told me once

562
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,160
that there is a ride at knots that teenagers would go on to make out like a tunnel of love kind of ride.

563
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,160
And I think it might be the dinosaurs ride because it was dark and slow.

564
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,160
I've heard about teenagers making out before.

565
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,160
I don't know about this.

566
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
I don't know about teenagers.

567
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
It was definitely slow enough.

568
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Every ride at Knotsbury Farm is slow.

569
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
The Calico Mountain thing is slow.

570
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,160
The log ride is slow.

571
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
I can't think of one that's not slow.

572
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,160
The train, which by the way gets robbed.

573
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Have you been on the train during a robbery?

574
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
You know, I haven't actually.

575
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
I forgot that they did that.

576
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Oh, it's great.

577
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,160
I think this is in many ways, I think the train at Knots is better than the train at Disneyland.

578
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
A robbery.

579
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
There's a robbery.

580
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:21,160
They should brand it to be like an assassination of Jesse James by the Calico Mountain Ford ride.

581
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:30,160
I saw a video of that too that had a great theme park joke where one of the cowboys is pointing out people on the ride.

582
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Like, yeah, I know all these people.

583
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,160
There's Billy Sue, there's Billy Joe, and there's Billy Goat.

584
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Sorry sir, I didn't mean to.

585
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Good, clean fun.

586
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
I like jokes like this.

587
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,160
I feel like everyone laughed a little earnestly at that, right?

588
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
Yeah.

589
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Good for that cowboy.

590
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:55,160
There's a lot, like with Knots it does feel like, because they do like a whole old west town, there's a lot even more like characters.

591
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
People in character.

592
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,160
You'll talk to the sheriff in front of the jail.

593
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,160
There'll be a guy in a rocking chair that'll razz you as you walk by.

594
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,160
There's a little more interactivity than there is at Disney, I feel like.

595
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:20,160
One of the great Knots attractions is, and I believe it's still there, but this was a family tradition growing up, is there is a jail cell with a wooden carved character in it who's called Sad Eye Joe.

596
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:30,160
And you can go up to the, my parents knew the trick where you can go up and talk to the guy that does the voice beforehand and give him information.

597
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:40,160
And so we went, I remember one time going with my little sister and my mom goes back there and gives him information and then through the little thing he says, hey, how you doing, Carly?

598
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
How's your brother Ryan?

599
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
And how's first grade?

600
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
I heard that you're here for da da da da.

601
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,160
And it blows the kid's mind because Sad Eye Joe knows everything about the kid.

602
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,160
It's like one of the great, I mean, imagine being a little kid and that happens.

603
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
It's terrific.

604
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Yeah, you wouldn't be able to put it together.

605
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
That's really magical.

606
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
It's like a Santa Claus type experience.

607
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
How did they know?

608
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
That's pretty neat.

609
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:14,160
There's a wooden character who is no longer at Knots that I found in one of those, if you go to Barnes and Noble, there's like a sepia tinted book that tells you about the history of a local area.

610
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Oh, the historic images of the world of America.

611
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:26,160
And I found one for Knots Berry Farm and they had a local character who I can only assume they have retired who is Wing Li, the Chinese laundry man.

612
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Oh, no.

613
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:37,160
He had a sign on his laundry display that says, no, no Tiki, no Shirtie.

614
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Oh, no.

615
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
No Shirtie.

616
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
I thought the phrase was no Tiki, no laundry.

617
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,160
That's the phrase I've heard.

618
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,160
This was Tiki and Shirtie with double E's.

619
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,160
So bad on you for that one, Knots.

620
00:38:52,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Although I have also seen some touting of the fact that they do acknowledge the role of Chinese Americans in building the railroad.

621
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:10,160
Like they like there are Chinese robots on those rides on the on the mine.

622
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
I guess that's good.

623
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,160
I think I saw a site that claimed that that was good.

624
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,160
So I will go along with that and say that it's good.

625
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,160
There is also Knots is also home to dioramas, right?

626
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Of all the missions in California.

627
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Am I imagining?

628
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
I can't remember that.

629
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
I feel like I heard they started putting those back in.

630
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Full disclosure, I have never been to Knots Berry Farm.

631
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
Oh, my God.

632
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
I want to go down there.

633
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,160
And this is all just making me even more excited to see all this.

634
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,160
You would really love it.

635
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
And I you'll never come back.

636
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
I love chicken dinners.

637
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,160
Knots also where they originally grew boysenberries.

638
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
They're famous for that.

639
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Yeah.

640
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,160
Well, we should talk about the man who started it all.

641
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Yeah.

642
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
The man, the myth, the legend.

643
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,160
And it's not your mom's friend.

644
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
Did you get anything out of it?

645
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,160
Like what's do we know about the guy?

646
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Oh, no.

647
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,160
They came into the restaurant with his wife and they were all very courteous.

648
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
Cordelia.

649
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Cordelia.

650
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
The lovely Cordelia.

651
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Who cooked all the chicken dinners herself.

652
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,160
She really is to blame.

653
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,160
She's not the right word.

654
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
She should get the credit.

655
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,160
There you go.

656
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:28,160
The positive word for for kicking off the whole thing, because it really was though they had a successful farm, it was the chicken dinners that caused this influx of people to come in and ultimately grew the place into a theme park.

657
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
And she's still like through the 70s.

658
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,160
If you went and got a boysenberry pie there, it was very possible that Mrs. Knots made it herself.

659
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Wow.

660
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
That would be amazing to get a Mrs.

661
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Knots one that she touched with her hands.

662
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
She says Knots touched this pie.

663
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
I didn't really.

664
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
I don't think she signed it in some way.

665
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
If she could like kind of autograph the crust.

666
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,160
She had a signature way that she would decorate the crust perhaps.

667
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
Mrs. K.

668
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:03,160
So I didn't know this, but Walter Knots teamed up early on in his farming career with Rudolf Boysen and they created the boysenberry.

669
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Oh boy.

670
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
That wasn't a thing that existed.

671
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:19,160
I heard this other version of it where that's kind of clunky or more confusing where a guy is he like he knew of this guy Rudolf Boysen, who was the head of parks in Anaheim and said, I heard you tried to make a berry and it didn't really work out for you.

672
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,160
And he said, oh, I just got a couple of vines of it left here.

673
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
You take them, see if you have any luck.

674
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:31,160
And then it flourished for some reason at Knots, which that seems like I'm worried that that's a cover for like he stole the berry.

675
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,160
Yeah, that seems like he stole the berry.

676
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,160
If that's what that's what did you I mean mine is just some Wikipedia.

677
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Mine is probably a website that got it from Wikipedia.

678
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Sure.

679
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,160
We're all just using the same barely sourced material.

680
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,160
We need you guys need to go like talk to the farmers.

681
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,160
You get out there in the field and get actual information.

682
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,160
The definitive berry theft.

683
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,160
Who made the expose.

684
00:41:52,160 --> 00:42:01,160
Let me throw another one in too, which is that it's possible that Boysen originally got it from a guy named John Lubin and that he called them Lubinberries.

685
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,160
And that and whatever. Maybe this was just a chain of lies on Wikipedia or wherever I saw it.

686
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:14,160
But that Lubin might have taken it from Luther Burbank, who is the founder of Burbank founded the very city we're in right now.

687
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,160
So there's a lot of weird stuff going on with the history of the boys and bearing.

688
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Oh, my Lord.

689
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Yeah. Yeah. Huh.

690
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Not clear. I like this kind of old timey fight, though.

691
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:31,160
Like, you know, if we were all fighting one day about like, no, it's the Carlson Berry.

692
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,160
No, Jason stole the Carlson Berry from him.

693
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,160
You'll never prove that old boy.

694
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,160
The Sheridan Berry.

695
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,160
It just sounds better to the ear.

696
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,160
We've given the public what they want.

697
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,160
Nobody nobody would buy a Carlson Berry barf.

698
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,160
We should all wish that we could be so successful to have a berry.

699
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,160
And to have a tangible skill such as cross breeding berries to get.

700
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,160
What is that? How do you do that to begin with?

701
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
That's a very good question.

702
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Yeah. I don't know.

703
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,160
When you go to wineries and you start with they start explaining how they make the wine and you get bored immediately.

704
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,160
Just want the wine samples.

705
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,160
Yeah. Coppola does it.

706
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
He's out there.

707
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Does he explain it to you?

708
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,160
I'm making grapes.

709
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
I got the best grace.

710
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Sophia, come try these grapes.

711
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
I don't want to direct movies anymore.

712
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,160
No, I just want to play with grapes.

713
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,160
I was thinking about putting a red grape and a white grape together.

714
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,160
It came out gray. Who would have thought anyway?

715
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,160
Walt are not famously friends with Walt Disney.

716
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,160
They would visit each other's parks and steal each other's ideas.

717
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,160
It's unclear if they were like because some people say they're friends.

718
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,160
There's a lot of misinformation I feel like some people are like, we don't know if they were like really friends.

719
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,160
They were like competitors, but I don't know if they were truly like friends.

720
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,160
But the one thing is clear. They certainly stole ideas from each other.

721
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,160
And like the log flume ride at not clearly influenced then Splash Mountain later, which isn't Walt's creation.

722
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,160
But the mine train through Nature's Wonderland and Disneyland.

723
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,160
Walt stole that right away from the Calico.

724
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,160
That predated, I think.

725
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:28,160
I think Calico mine ride has not happened until the 60s.

726
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:37,160
But the big thing, I could be wrong about this, but I think the big thing that influenced Walt Disney was the like hidden lines.

727
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:43,160
There's the story where that ride, the Calico mine ride that Walt Disney got on it because he thought there was no line.

728
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:52,160
And then he got it in and the line was hidden in the rock work instead of just sitting out in like a boring kind of back and forth queue, like which is all Disneyland had.

729
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
Sure.

730
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,160
So the idea of like the line is also part of the theming.

731
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:03,160
Walt's definitely was influenced by all these the nicer by by Nuts.

732
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:11,160
Yeah, and you're getting like you're you're looking at some cool stuff and it's air conditioned and the idea of a lot of the line is indoors as opposed to.

733
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

734
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
And then you're not. Yeah, you're not sitting out in the sun.

735
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:21,160
And it's more inviting if you if you see a if you see a ride with a three hour line outside, you know, you might skip it.

736
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,160
But if you don't know how long it is, it's all hidden.

737
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Scott is indeed correct.

738
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,160
Hey, about the mines.

739
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,160
All right. Let's not credit it.

740
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,160
What else though in this back and forth?

741
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:45,160
Oh, I think, well, one thing I discovered in the history of it that, yeah, it didn't it was just an open gate park until 1968 when there was a bunch of vandalism.

742
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,160
So they had to build a wall to keep people out of the park.

743
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:56,160
And only then did they charge admission, which I'm not sure when Disneyland became an admission park.

744
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:10,160
They held on to the ticket booklets for a while and used them in Florida, too, because I remember my dad talking about having when they went down to Orlando in the 70s, they they were still using the ticket booklets.

745
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
OK. Yeah.

746
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,160
But anyway, it does seem like they bounced back and forth in terms of like figuring out how the modern theme park works.

747
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,160
One thing on those ticket booklets. Are you talking about that?

748
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,160
You said in Orlando or?

749
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,160
Yeah, Disneyland and Disney World. They used to you would.

750
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,160
The ticket book and the tickets.

751
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

752
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,160
Yeah. My parents would use that phrase, e-ticket ride.

753
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:42,160
One time years ago when the movie Waterworld came out, I saw at the premiere, they interviewed James Kahn.

754
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,160
And he walked out and said, they said, what did you think of Waterworld, James Kahn?

755
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,160
And he says, oh, it's great. It's an e-ticket ride.

756
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,160
He said that phrase. Did he think of that before? Did someone ask him to say it?

757
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,160
I think that was how he described a really fun ride was that's you.

758
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
That's how you would describe a thrilling experience.

759
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,160
That was the vernacular at the time.

760
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,160
This is 1995.

761
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,160
Yeah, this is 1995, the vernacular.

762
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,160
Yes. But it was an old man who had gone to Disney World.

763
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,160
And theme park enthusiasts still refer to like, you know, the big marquee ride, your Space Mountain Haunted Mansion.

764
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,160
Oh, so that's still in the.

765
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,160
I mean, like kids don't maybe know that.

766
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
Kids don't.

767
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:30,160
But like, yeah, the inside Imagineering and then weirdos that do podcasts certainly know, well, this is more of a d-ticket than an e, you know.

768
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,160
The thrill, the robots aren't quite as good on this ride as they would be on an e-ticket.

769
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,160
Or to know what they would have charged.

770
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,160
Only the head moves on this, not the arms.

771
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,160
Those new Star Wars rides could be f-tickets. It could go bigger than anything we've seen before.

772
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,160
They are saying they want these to be f-tickets, these Star Wars.

773
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,160
They've used that phrase, they want to go beyond e.

774
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,160
With the big ride through on this.

775
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,160
Probably not the best thing that the letter after e is a big old f, though.

776
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,160
You mean because f is failing or.

777
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,160
F grade is good.

778
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,160
It's like bad.

779
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,160
Shut up, man.

780
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,160
They mean good now?

781
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,160
More on Walter Knott from his obituary in the New York Times from 1981, which the headline is very funny.

782
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,160
It's Walter Knott of Knott's Berry Farm is dead.

783
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
Like that's what they wrote.

784
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
Blunter time.

785
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,160
Like, OK, like not like kindly old man passes away.

786
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,160
It's like, no, he's dead.

787
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:28,160
Jam jars across America emptied to half full in respect.

788
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:34,160
Was he preserved in any form?

789
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,160
Save it for Mr. Owens's special.

790
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,160
Was he preserved?

791
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,160
He was described as a trim and spunky man.

792
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,160
And personify this is weird, the personify the spunky.

793
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,160
Hey, a wily idea.

794
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
I got a new jam idea too.

795
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,160
Can I write obituary?

796
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,160
This spunky man deceased.

797
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,160
I don't know what this somebody maybe somebody knows where this comes from.

798
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:09,160
Personify the rags dash torches, which obviously is rags to riches, but I don't know the spelling.

799
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:16,160
Rags dash toriches.

800
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:22,160
Spelling rags to riches like this as one word rags to riches rags to riches.

801
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,160
Is that from something?

802
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,160
This is just a poorly written piece of shit.

803
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,160
I don't know what any of it means.

804
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,160
James Kahn coined that term.

805
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,160
He was a very conservative man.

806
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,160
He was more politically active than Disney, right?

807
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,160
Yes.

808
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:50,160
So he has the full Independence Hall, which is in Knott's Berry Farm, which is still there.

809
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:58,160
But also he financed a lot of conservative endeavors, which is probably very bad.

810
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,160
He gave out pamphlets in Knott's Berry Farm potentially about conservative ideals.

811
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,160
Yes.

812
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:12,160
And the can-can dancers of the Calico Saloon would often spout anti-communist propaganda.

813
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:19,160
So yeah, he had a freedom center in the park, he called it, and it produced pamphlets and film strips,

814
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:25,160
extolling free enterprise and self-sufficiency and deploring big government and taxes.

815
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,160
So do you have any recollection?

816
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,160
As a child, do you remember going to the freedom center?

817
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,160
Now that's an e-ticket, baby.

818
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,160
That's another e-ticket for enterprise.

819
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,160
I don't remember this at all.

820
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,160
He died in 81, so maybe as soon as he was dead they shut the freedom center down.

821
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,160
Get the freedom center out of here.

822
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,160
No, I don't remember any political memories.

823
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,160
Of course, Mr. Knott, we will keep the freedom center alive and burning bright.

824
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,160
It's funny to think about now, because I feel like people who don't live in California,

825
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,160
when you talk about California in terms of national politics, it's always like, oh, it's a blue state, it's a blue state.

826
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,160
But there's a huge conservative streak.

827
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:08,160
Orange County gave us Richard Nixon, and Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were both California politicians

828
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,160
before becoming president, and Orange County sells a lot of very conservative pockets.

829
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:19,160
Yeah, when I was a kid growing up, I lived in the most conservative congressional district in the entire country.

830
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,160
Wow.

831
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,160
It was the most conservative district?

832
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,160
I believe so.

833
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,160
In the mid-'90s, it was.

834
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,160
I remember hearing that in school and thinking, oh, shit.

835
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,160
Now it's the chillest conservative county.

836
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,160
It's the most relaxed.

837
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:39,160
They say that Walter Knott and Carl Karcher.

838
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,160
Carl Karcher also came into my mom's restaurant.

839
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,160
Oh, really?

840
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,160
Yeah.

841
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,160
Oh, wow.

842
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,160
A different, not his own.

843
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,160
And Walt Disney.

844
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,160
These guys always came into the Shae Carey.

845
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,160
That's wild.

846
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,160
We haven't previewed this, and it's only 49 seconds.

847
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,160
I found a clip from the Freedom Center.

848
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,160
Whoa.

849
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,160
It's Clip Currency of Orange County Archives.

850
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
It's from 1964.

851
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,160
Okay.

852
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
So who knows?

853
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,160
We'll see what this is.

854
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,160
I think that if we are ever going to eliminate poverty in America, it will have to be done

855
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,160
through the free enterprise system and certainly not by government.

856
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,160
That was Walter Knott, owner of Knott's Berry Farm, a family entertainment center near Los Angeles.

857
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:22,160
Last year, nearly two million dinners were served here with Walter's wife, Cordelia, in charge of the kitchen.

858
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:29,160
The farm is a huge playland, and Walter Knott makes sure that his employees share in the profit.

859
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,160
He also puts his ideas into action in other ways.

860
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:43,160
For instance, he has established, in a re-appilitated farmhouse, the Freedom Center, a passion in a one-man program to

861
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:52,160
to bulwark certain of our liberties, which he believes are being eroded by authoritarian ideologies of the right and left.

862
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,160
Wow. That does not beat around the bush either.

863
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,160
authoritarian ideology

864
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,160
You'd be a kid sitting there listening to that in the Freedom Center.

865
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:12,160
It is funny how nowadays people talk about, oh, the Trump administration has destroyed decorum and that sort of thing.

866
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:19,160
But back then, you would be hearing that about, our boy is shipping off to Vietnam.

867
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:27,160
And it's just like these insidious things would be presented with wholesome Leave-It-to-Beaver background music.

868
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:33,160
I mean, even the Iraq War, that was a thing where it was like, well, everyone is very composed.

869
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:39,160
All the politicians are very composed and professional, but they still sold this crazy war.

870
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,160
Well, look, a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.

871
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,160
Yeah, that's true. I mean, you get that Freedom Center.

872
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,160
Now, what you're saying is you like it now, Jason.

873
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
I mean, I'm a crass. I'm a crass man.

874
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,160
Jason shared it as on the record for saying he likes it now.

875
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,160
He likes Trump better.

876
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,160
This is now the second episode in a row where this business goes up.

877
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,160
Trump tells it like it is. He doesn't underscore things with some old filmstrip soundtrack.

878
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:10,160
Yeah, some old Land of Chocolate Homer Simpson music to play while he's saying something horrible.

879
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,160
Trump doesn't need full sentences to get his idea across.

880
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,160
Every day he becomes more presidential.

881
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,160
In fact, I think we should bring back that Freedom Center.

882
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Bulldoze that restored Calico Mine train.

883
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,160
I think Trump would have gotten bored midway through the clip you just played.

884
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,160
He would have drifted off and started tweeting.

885
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,160
Or just pulled out his emergency McDonald's bag.

886
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,160
Oh, sorry, I couldn't hear it.

887
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,160
Man, so there you go. That's the history.

888
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,160
The history of nuts.

889
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:50,160
But you know what? They got less conservative as time went on because in the 80s they opened two hot dance clubs for teenagers.

890
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,160
One called Studio K and the other one called Cloud Nine.

891
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:01,160
You could go see all the hottest DJs from K-Rock. Richard Blade would be there.

892
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,160
This is on the premises of...

893
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,160
Richard Blade?

894
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,160
Yeah, I forget who that was.

895
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,160
I don't know who that is.

896
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,160
I saw him in a little pamphlet about Studio K.

897
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:16,160
That's another little back and forth Disneyland arms war which I'm sure, well, I hope to God we talk about in a later episode

898
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,160
because Disneyland opened the teen nightclub Videopolis.

899
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,160
So they both had competing teen dance clubs.

900
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,160
Now what happened to these clubs? How come they don't...

901
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,160
I believe there was a stabbing at one or like one...

902
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,160
Was there an incident at one of them?

903
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,160
Or maybe in the parking lot like an altercation or something.

904
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,160
I think it was at the parking lot during Videopolis, yeah.

905
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:40,160
When teens dance they start getting rowdy and they get violent and horny I guess.

906
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,160
And that's probably why they had to close down Kingdom of the Dinosaurs.

907
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:50,160
They got pregnant on the ride and people were just getting too horny on the damn ride.

908
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:55,160
There was a custody battle between the mother, the father and the dinosaurs.

909
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,160
Technically I caused this.

910
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,160
That was a T-Rex target.

911
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,160
That baby is property of the Knot family.

912
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:06,160
So when you, Ryan, when you were a kid though you never like saw the dance club and were like, let me in.

913
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:14,160
Never saw the dance club but an average Knot thing would be we would, it was a relatively easy park to sneak food into.

914
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:23,160
And so that was another, you'd either eat at the chicken restaurant or if it was on a sort of a more money saving day

915
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:29,160
you could sneak like a bunch of sandwiches into the park and ride on.

916
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:35,160
There was a parachute ride or a sky drop ride that was very scary.

917
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,160
Yeah, no longer there I don't think.

918
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,160
Yeah, no longer.

919
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,160
So many of these things are now gone.

920
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,160
Yeah.

921
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,160
There was the mine ride of course.

922
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:53,160
There was the Bigfoot Rapids ride where you would get soaked and then go into the, where is it that we went?

923
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,160
Oh, the mystery lodge.

924
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,160
The mystery lodge.

925
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,160
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

926
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,160
That's the first, that was the thing you were.

927
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,160
Do you know about this, Jason?

928
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,160
Scott was most excited I think to show me the mystery lodge.

929
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,160
I did not know what it was.

930
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,160
Life could not have been less exciting.

931
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,160
Again, we're doing the, she might have just not done it.

932
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,160
No patience for dull, dull shows.

933
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:17,160
She's like, I would rather look at this grass than go into the mystery lodge.

934
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,160
She can sit quietly and I think she did.

935
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,160
Is it like Twin Peaks is Black Lodge?

936
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,160
Is it like a place where everything is weird?

937
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,160
No, I wish.

938
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,160
No, no, no.

939
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,160
Maybe it is though.

940
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,160
Am I prepared to explain mystery lodge?

941
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,160
I think you have to, at least give a brief explanation.

942
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:38,160
It's a thing that was at like a Vancouver World's Fair Expo kind of thing and they just moved its lock, stock and barrel.

943
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,160
Lock and stock, I'm not sure there's a barrel in this ride, that'd be too exciting.

944
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:52,160
But it was like, it's a slightly multimedia show where a wise old Indian tells tales of...

945
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:58,160
He tells a tale about a raven that pretends to be an owl.

946
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,160
Oh, the raven doing a trickster.

947
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:09,160
And also, before you go in, they admonish you very heavily, like show respect to this thing.

948
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,160
This is like Native American history and show...

949
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,160
They would be mad at me if I did the voice.

950
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,160
Well, actually a lot of people would probably be mad.

951
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,160
Yeah, we're gonna get problems online.

952
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:26,160
But yes, it's like this is very serious history and then you walk in and it's an animatronic.

953
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,160
Native American.

954
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:32,160
Well, you know what it is? It's like a performer who doesn't actually...

955
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,160
Is it a performer or is it a geek?

956
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:40,160
He performs to a lip sync track and he wears an old Indian mask over his face to make him look like an old man.

957
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:48,160
And he's like hunched over. It's kind of a magic show that he's interacting with a projected bird like the Haunted Mansion ghost.

958
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:53,160
It's like a screen. There's a screen in between that looks like it's just a mirror, but the mirror is actually a projection.

959
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
So that is a real man.

960
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
Oh my God, I thought it was a robot.

961
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,160
I thought it was a very sophisticated robot.

962
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,160
It should be underselling the show.

963
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,160
That would be one of the greatest robots of all time.

964
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,160
Well, I don't think so.

965
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:13,160
Notts has restored a lot of their classic rides in recent years and uses Garner Holt, the same animatronic manufacturer that Disney uses to repair and build them.

966
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,160
Yeah, the Mine Ride has better animatronics.

967
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:24,160
I was told, because I hadn't didn't go like eight years ago, the Mine Ride, which is you go through this mine and you see a bunch of robots like working in horrible conditions

968
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,160
in a mine breathing in, you know, getting black lungs.

969
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,160
Conservative values.

970
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,160
Yeah, conservative values. But they got that Asian one.

971
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,160
So everything's all right.

972
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:40,160
But I was told, and I didn't see this, that like if you went on that ride eight or nine years ago, all of the characters were melting.

973
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,160
All the skin was like melting off of them.

974
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:50,160
And before the restoration happened, it was a nightmare ride of like all these men's faces were falling off.

975
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:56,160
And then they went in and did a full scale like, you know, cleaning up the whole thing, which they did a great job.

976
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:02,160
And here's the thing to congratulate Notts on the recent past. Really great job restoring that ride.

977
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:07,160
Did they restore also the Calico Mine Ride or was that just the Mine Ride and the Log?

978
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,160
Yeah, both of them have gotten recent.

979
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,160
They're both great and really fun, unique experiences and good reasons to go there.

980
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:21,160
I also just went to they I just checked out the the Chicken Dinner Restaurant, which they have recently remodeled.

981
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:25,160
And now it's like a cool gastropub kind of place.

982
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,160
Cordelia's restaurant.

983
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,160
No, they didn't. It's like still homey. I mean, it's like as cool.

984
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,160
That sounds like a bummer.

985
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,160
It's as cool as like an Applebee's would be.

986
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,160
That sucks.

987
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,160
You dig it, though, I think.

988
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
Really?

989
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,160
Yeah, it doesn't feel like it's the same week as we went anymore.

990
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,160
Weren't you telling me there was a TGI Fridays in the park?

991
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,160
It's across the street. Yeah, there's a TGI Fridays, but it's on site.

992
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,160
That's another great thing about Notts.

993
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,160
There's an on site TGI Fridays that you don't have to pay admission to get to.

994
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,160
Please show respect to the Mystery Lodge.

995
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,160
And if y'all are hungry, there's a TGI Fridays.

996
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,160
Jack Daniel's chicken strips always in fashion.

997
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,160
Was Mrs. Notts, was the we went to a breakfast buffet there like a couple of years ago.

998
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,160
Was that the same room or is that different?

999
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:13,160
That had mimosas and the breakfast buffet at Mrs. Notts.

1000
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,160
No, they've redone it since then, but it's nice.

1001
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,160
It looks like a new, it looks like a frontier land type.

1002
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,160
That's kind of a bummer to me, though, because going in that one room,

1003
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,160
it felt like you could be in the middle of like Alabama in 1940, which is scary,

1004
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,160
but also like it does feel timeless.

1005
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,160
I liked it. I'm now very reticent to revisit the chicken restaurant.

1006
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,160
But I'd be the first to say that I'm bummed that they redid it.

1007
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,160
I think you'd like it if you walked in.

1008
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,160
There's like a bar in there now.

1009
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,160
And the food is still what it was.

1010
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:49,160
You get a ton of food for, you get this giant chicken dinner plate for like $16.

1011
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:53,160
With like the giant bowl of rhubarb.

1012
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,160
There's a lot of people in there, especially older couples, that are just in there for dinner.

1013
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,160
They're not even, they wouldn't even think about going into the park or Soak City

1014
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,160
or any of that stuff. They're just in there to have dinner and go back home.

1015
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:07,160
Is it free to just park and go to the restaurant? Like it's just like a restaurant.

1016
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,160
I think you can.

1017
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,160
And here's the thing I'd like to say, because I've done this several times,

1018
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,160
highly recommend it. If you don't want to pay the Knott's Berry Farm admission,

1019
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:23,160
just go down to Buena Park and check out all the stuff that is free in the Knott's Berry Farm area.

1020
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,160
There's the chicken dinner restaurant, although you pay for that, obviously.

1021
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,160
But then there's like lots of oddball little shops.

1022
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,160
You can go hang out in the Knott's Hotel, which has a...

1023
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,160
Oh yeah, they have an outside hotel.

1024
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,160
They've got, yeah, and they've got a, there's a fun little restaurant in there called Amber Waves.

1025
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,160
You can go get a nice beer at Amber Waves.

1026
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,160
Is that the hotel where you can pay a fee and Snoopy will tuck you in?

1027
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:51,160
Yes, we learned this from Doug Jones, our friend who will be on the show soon, I'm sure.

1028
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,160
Yeah, you can have Snoopy come tuck your kid in, or presumably...

1029
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,160
Or you.

1030
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,160
Or you.

1031
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,160
Yeah, Snoopy will walk into the room.

1032
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,160
It's up to the person playing Snoopy.

1033
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,160
Snoopy tucked me in. It was great. It was the best day of my life.

1034
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,160
Doug Jones.

1035
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:18,160
I'm not sure if that was a man, like somebody who was too into Snoopy tucking him in.

1036
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:24,160
So you could just call downstairs, like Snoopy please.

1037
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:31,160
$50 later, college student likes up some stairs because he can't fit in the elevator.

1038
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,160
Kiss my forehead, Snoopy.

1039
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:40,160
Opens that door to a handful of swingers and eyes wide shut, Basks.

1040
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:47,160
Hello, Snoopy. Welcome to the party, Snoopy.

1041
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:51,160
The general Knott's area, and also down there, these are unrelated to Knott's, but you can go down there,

1042
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,160
you can go to Medieval Times, you can go to the Pirates Dinner Adventure.

1043
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,160
We should cover all of these things at some point.

1044
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:03,160
There's a weird McDonald's that used to have a simulator ride in it, and it no longer does,

1045
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,160
and yet it's still labeled on the outside McThriller.

1046
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,160
Oh yeah.

1047
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,160
Well, this McDonald's that we went to, incredible, has that...

1048
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,160
A big model train.

1049
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,160
A big model train.

1050
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,160
Yeah. This is a whole McDonald's that have novelties within them.

1051
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:23,160
There aren't enough left. In Dallas, I tried to go to a McDonald's that had chandeliers,

1052
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,160
and we had to explain to the Lyft driver, where are you going?

1053
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,160
Well, we're going to a McDonald's, but it's like a weird McDonald's,

1054
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,160
and then we got there and it was just a normal McDonald's.

1055
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,160
They had taken out the weird stuff.

1056
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,160
But yeah, it's a sadly endangered animal, the weird McDonald's.

1057
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,160
But they got one of those down there.

1058
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,160
A really crazy, creepy mall that has a photo studio for fetuses,

1059
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,160
which several malls do. I don't know if you see...

1060
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,160
Ultrasound photography.

1061
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,160
Yeah.

1062
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1063
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Wait, that's... What? In Buena Park Mall?

1064
01:04:55,160 --> 01:05:02,160
In the Buena Park Mall, yeah, me and old Bug Mane went down there,

1065
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:07,160
and the first thing we saw when we went up the escalator was Ultrasound photo studio,

1066
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:12,160
and it was lots of heart-shaped frames with little fetuses inside.

1067
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,160
Buena Park is a real bazaar. I highly recommend.

1068
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,160
Go have a free day in Buena Park. So bazaar.

1069
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:25,160
Your other dream job would be taking an announcer through an abandoned mall.

1070
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:28,160
There's plenty of them right now in America.

1071
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,160
Why am I not pitching a true TV on this subject?

1072
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,160
Scott, the mall guy.

1073
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:39,160
As you describe Buena Park, it's crazy to think about...

1074
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:44,160
Not Sperry Farm, I don't know how many years ago, but it was up for sale,

1075
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:50,160
and Disney was considering buying it, and they briefly were trying to figure out,

1076
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,160
can we run the monorail from Anaheim Way to Park,

1077
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:59,160
which not that far considering how long monorail tracks they have in Florida,

1078
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,160
but they control all of the land under it in Florida.

1079
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:07,160
They would have had to run an above-ground monorail through neighborhoods,

1080
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,160
so it was pretty much impossible.

1081
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,160
Wow, that would be incredible though.

1082
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:16,160
Imagine it moving at hyperloop speed.

1083
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,160
It would be there before you know it.

1084
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,160
Disneyland in two knots in 2.4 seconds.

1085
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:27,160
You might burst ventricles in your heart.

1086
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,160
But you get there fast. You'd be fine.

1087
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:36,160
Yeah. Oh, well, seriously, the weird thing to go back to something you mentioned earlier,

1088
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,160
the Church of Reflections that your parents were married in,

1089
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:43,160
they actually moved that. It was inside the theme park,

1090
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,160
which I guess when they got married, it would have been...

1091
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,160
Do they have to pay admission to get married?

1092
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,160
No, I think the park was free at the time,

1093
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:57,160
and I think the whole cost of renting the church was like $150.

1094
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,160
Oh my God. Wow.

1095
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,160
So, yeah, very cheap thing.

1096
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,160
But then going back as a teenager, the church was like under a roller coaster.

1097
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:09,160
It might have been under the Boomerang roller coaster or whatever it was.

1098
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:14,160
It was the first roller coaster I ever rode on when I was like eight years old.

1099
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,160
A roller coaster going over the church.

1100
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,160
And I remember making the sort of...

1101
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,160
At the time, I thought it was a very cool writerly analogy of like,

1102
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:29,160
this is where my parents got married, and their marriage was a roller coaster too.

1103
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:35,160
One day I'll like put that in something.

1104
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,160
Have you put it in something?

1105
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,160
No.

1106
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,160
In the great novel.

1107
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,160
That's much better than if the church is just next to a parking lot or planes.

1108
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,160
But now they've moved it.

1109
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,160
Yeah, now it's across the street.

1110
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,160
Also in the weird free area you can explore,

1111
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:57,160
there's a full perfect replica of Independence Hall that is so perfect,

1112
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,160
it was used in the film National Treasure.

1113
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,160
It was like that much of a double for the real Independence Hall.

1114
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,160
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

1115
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,160
And then you can go from that to visit the Church of Reflection

1116
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,160
and reflect on the spot where Ryan's parents were married.

1117
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,160
But weirdly they moved it across the street.

1118
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:19,160
And here's an odd fact, I don't know if you know about the Church of Reflections,

1119
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:22,160
but there used to be a thing called the Transfiguration.

1120
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:26,160
It was a painting of Christ, and he looks sad and forlorn,

1121
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:32,160
and his eyes are closed, but if you shine a blacklight on it, his eyes open up.

1122
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,160
I don't know about that.

1123
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,160
There is a magic blacklight, a college dorm Jesus painting.

1124
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,160
Oh, boy.

1125
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,160
Gee whiz.

1126
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,160
I want one for over my bed.

1127
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:50,160
Some might say that blacklight could be described as poisonberry colored.

1128
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,160
Oh, boy.

1129
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:56,160
On that we're sort of coming back around to the station.

1130
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,160
Incident free, no robbery.

1131
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,160
If we missed anything big about another,

1132
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:05,160
there's so much to talk about with the entire park, but that's, yeah.

1133
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,160
I think we're recommending it.

1134
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,160
Yeah, yeah.

1135
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,160
If you're living in LA or if you're coming here.

1136
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,160
Is that how this show works?

1137
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,160
Can you just shit on an entire park?

1138
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:20,160
Could you be like, California Adventure? No.

1139
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,160
You know, we haven't reviewed an entire park yet,

1140
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,160
so we don't really know our system necessarily.

1141
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,160
I don't know if we have a different one.

1142
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:33,160
What we've been doing for rides is a system which is keep it as is,

1143
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,160
plus it up, or burn it to the ground for insurance money.

1144
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:41,160
And now do you land on one of those four knots Berry Park?

1145
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,160
What was the first one?

1146
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,160
Keep it as is.

1147
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,160
Don't change a single thing about.

1148
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,160
I think probably keep as is at the moment.

1149
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:52,160
And they have they also also I do think you could probably review

1150
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:56,160
individual rides at Knott's Berry Farm because they do have some pretty

1151
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,160
distinctive rides right now.

1152
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,160
They have Pony Express, which you sit on like a horse.

1153
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,160
The roller coaster you sit on like a horse.

1154
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,160
They have a silver bullet, which is a pretty good roller coaster.

1155
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,160
They have some pretty good roller coasters.

1156
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,160
And some a couple of important.

1157
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:13,160
I believe the first roller coaster where you went upside down was at Knott's Berry.

1158
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,160
I think the corkscrew.

1159
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:18,160
Well, corkscrew Montezuma's Revenge is a famous roller coaster there.

1160
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:22,160
That is the first ride that had like a launch mechanism as opposed to you just

1161
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,160
like climb up.

1162
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,160
You climb up a hill on like a hook on the track.

1163
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:30,160
It was the first ride that launched you the way like, you know, like a Hyperloop from

1164
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,160
the zero to six.

1165
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,160
Is that that green coaster?

1166
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:38,160
I went on a green coaster there last time and it hurt my head so bad.

1167
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,160
That might have been the boomerang before they got rid of it.

1168
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,160
Did they just get rid of it?

1169
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,160
How many years ago was it?

1170
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,160
Two years.

1171
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,160
Well, I don't know.

1172
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:50,160
Some of them, they really tried to be a coaster park in the night with like very minimal theming.

1173
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,160
And then eventually they're like, man, we're going to take some of these down and.

1174
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,160
Yeah, that is that is probably an issue with it.

1175
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:00,160
That was our complaint talking earlier is that they sort of added all of the roller

1176
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,160
coasters kind of willy nilly.

1177
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:06,160
And it doesn't like the theming from place to place doesn't make a lot of sense.

1178
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,160
And there's an area called the Roaring Twenties.

1179
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:13,160
And then that's just full of a bunch of neon roller coasters.

1180
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,160
And they don't do the best job of like cohesion in the place.

1181
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,160
And I'm glad they've taken out a couple of.

1182
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,160
Yeah, it's a little bit right now.

1183
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,160
The old west stuff is I mean, this is three years ago.

1184
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:27,160
It's coexisting with the roller coaster stuff, the kind of tackier roller coaster stuff.

1185
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:32,160
And so there's really like some of that old west stuff, I think, is still genuinely old

1186
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,160
west stuff taken from old west towns.

1187
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,160
And there's like a bottle house.

1188
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:40,160
I think there's like a bottle house where you read the plaque, it's like this lady like

1189
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:43,160
built the bottle house out of her alcoholic husband's beer bottles.

1190
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,160
And you're like, oh, this is very dark stuff.

1191
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:52,160
But then that's sort of next to, you know, whatever, you know, a scary drop.

1192
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,160
Yeah, yeah.

1193
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:58,160
I think you're right that there are individual rides worth reviewing because we didn't even

1194
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:03,160
touch upon a newer ride where steampunk octopus.

1195
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,160
Yes, are destroying the park.

1196
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,160
Right. And you have to shoot them.

1197
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,160
We went on this ride a couple years ago.

1198
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:13,160
You're in Knott's Berry Farm in a lagoon and this is a giant robot octopus.

1199
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,160
So you have to shoot lasers at.

1200
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:19,160
Yeah, it's a steampunk like a wild, wild west.

1201
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,160
Yes, exactly.

1202
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,160
Yeah, yeah.

1203
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:25,160
Giant spider in that giant octopus in this.

1204
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,160
We have.

1205
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,160
My opinion is certainly plus it up.

1206
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,160
I like all the old stuff.

1207
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,160
I don't like a lot of the non-themed roller coasters.

1208
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:40,160
Like the thing I was talking about is the boomerang that green that's gone now.

1209
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:45,160
But like I want, you know, terrible ride, by the way, a terrible ride.

1210
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:49,160
But like a shitty roller coaster, a shitty roller coaster that really like I remember

1211
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:53,160
there was a part where because it goes like backwards and I like clang my neck against

1212
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:58,160
them. I felt like a crack in my neck and I was like, oh, shit, like I'm hurt.

1213
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,160
Yeah, I think I just heard I went on it like eight years old.

1214
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:04,160
I think I almost fainted. Yeah, it's terrible.

1215
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,160
But rides that hurt you.

1216
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,160
I'll say this.

1217
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,160
The roller coaster should be themed better.

1218
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,160
It's called the boomerang.

1219
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:14,160
You know, put it put at least the queue, the line in a in a enclosed space.

1220
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,160
Give me a Australian man robot.

1221
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,160
Make it like he's throwing or something.

1222
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,160
We've got to get the whatever.

1223
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,160
Like the kangaroos are coming.

1224
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,160
We've got to get away from them or whatever.

1225
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,160
Give me something like that.

1226
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,160
Yeah. Give me a little theme.

1227
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:31,160
A little theme after Baz Luhrmann's Australia.

1228
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,160
Great, great idea.

1229
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,160
Let's I don't care if they're IPs.

1230
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,160
I don't care if they're original.

1231
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:41,160
I just think there's too many rides in this place that just have a generic kind of six flags roller coaster name.

1232
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,160
And then give me some robots.

1233
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,160
Give me some story.

1234
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,160
That's what I like.

1235
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,160
I like it mixed with the thrills.

1236
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,160
So I love all the old stuff.

1237
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,160
I love the chicken dinner.

1238
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:56,160
I'm going to love this new fancy downtown L.A. chicken restaurant vibe you're talking about.

1239
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,160
Is it like the hot chicken?

1240
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,160
I keep forgetting.

1241
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,160
Old Buzzy Miller.

1242
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,160
What was his name?

1243
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,160
Buzzy Miller.

1244
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:11,160
The ghost of Cordelia.

1245
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:16,160
How dare you speak ill of my precious roller coaster.

1246
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,160
So yeah, yeah.

1247
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,160
Because it because that's now just feels like it's half fun.

1248
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,160
Old park, half six flags from the 90s.

1249
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:30,160
It's caught in a bit of an identity crisis and clearly that's why I like those remodels of the Calico Mine Ride and the log ride.

1250
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:34,160
It's that's getting you back to the the old timey charm and fun.

1251
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:39,160
I think you're never going to compete in the thrill area.

1252
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:44,160
So yeah, I like that it's a bit of historic landmark a little bit.

1253
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,160
They should play into that more.

1254
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:51,160
They should really play into it like, you know, every couple of years in Hollywood, they're like a Western will come out and be a hit.

1255
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:56,160
People will be like the Westerns back open range or whatever was a hit.

1256
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:04,160
And they should not really embrace that as like where the old West where Westworld or, you know, whatever the Western property is.

1257
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,160
If they took I guess it's an all IP and everything.

1258
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,160
But I feel like people would come in just for the old West experience.

1259
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,160
So they have an old West show there.

1260
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,160
That's a lot of fun.

1261
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,160
Yeah, fun.

1262
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,160
Yeah, I know they're doing more.

1263
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:25,160
We haven't seen it. They're doing more with like interactive like you go on a journey now in the old West town where you have like this an adventure and you get your and your part of it.

1264
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,160
There's a whole thing going on, which we have not tried.

1265
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:31,160
If not wants to bring us down, we'd love to try it.

1266
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:35,160
If they're listening, I'll withhold judgment until I get to see it myself.

1267
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,160
Sure.

1268
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,160
Jason hasn't even been.

1269
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,160
Let's get Jason to not make it happen.

1270
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,160
It happened.

1271
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:46,160
We sort of insulted a lot of things as we went and now we're demanding things.

1272
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,160
This is the most anyone's ever talked about.

1273
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,160
Not very long.

1274
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:58,160
This is the longest conversation about the Farfetch'd ever recorded and also ever.

1275
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:04,160
Even the employees there talk about how their kids are doing more than they talk about.

1276
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,160
Hey, well, not you're welcome.

1277
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:11,160
I guess with that, we're heading back to the station.

1278
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:16,160
Choo-choo, we're back in the station.

1279
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:21,160
That's what you say when you when you land back at the Choo-choo.

1280
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,160
Choo-choo.

1281
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,160
And we're home.

1282
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:28,160
Hey, Ryan, thanks so much for being here and sharing your not memories.

1283
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:32,160
It's been a roller coaster of a conversation.

1284
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,160
Cool, man. Cool.

1285
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,160
That's a pretty neat analogy.

1286
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,160
I feel like I thought of it.

1287
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:44,160
And then you'd like to plug or say closing thoughts here.

1288
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,160
I don't really have any closing thoughts.

1289
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,160
Thanks for having me on.

1290
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:54,160
And I don't know, to plug, I would maybe I do like this idea about you going to malls.

1291
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:57,160
That's more of a pitch to you.

1292
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,160
Sure.

1293
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,160
We will take it upstairs to Starbirds.

1294
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,160
Okay, great.

1295
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,160
And take it general.

1296
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:08,160
Yes, we immediately lost our exclusivity.

1297
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,160
Look, I'm fine with that.

1298
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,160
And some of those malls have like weird like have been retaken by nature and these weird swamps.

1299
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,160
Yeah.

1300
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:21,160
Yeah. No, thanks for seeing the idea I should have been doing all along.

1301
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,160
Well, that's the next project.

1302
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:25,160
This is the last episode of podcast.

1303
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,160
I'm thrilled.

1304
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:31,160
Thank you guys for having me on podcast the ride.

1305
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,160
And I hope you guys are all driving safe.

1306
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:37,160
I like to say that now.

1307
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,160
Watch the road.

1308
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:44,160
Laugh, laugh, love, but watch the road.

1309
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,160
And enjoy the rest of your day.

1310
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,160
And you all enjoy your day.

1311
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,160
Mike, Jason, any closing?

1312
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,160

1314
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,160

1315
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,160
Is that right?

1316
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,160
I always forget it.

1317
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:03,160
And or our personal Twitter's and you can find that we don't need to say them.

1318
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,160
They're all linked on our show Twitter account.

1319
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,160
This is some kind of dating thing for you guys.

1320
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,160
Well, for Jason.

1321
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,160
For me.

1322
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:17,160
If there's any Jason single and if anyone likes all this bullshit, like tweet at him.

1323
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,160
You know he's in.

1324
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,160
If this gets you going, like tweet at Jason.

1325
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:25,160
Please don't murder me with an oversized turkey leg.

1326
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:29,160
But you're into someone lately beating you with a turkey leg.

1327
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:32,160
Oh, yeah, not be around all day long.

1328
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:36,160
Is that part of the new restaurant?

1329
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,160
That's part of the hotel service.

1330
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,160
Oh boy.

1331
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,160
Snoopy will beat the shit out of you.

1332
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:45,160
Civilization is crumbling.

1333
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,160
Thank you, Snoopy.

1334
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:51,160
Hit the button weird stuff on the not's phone.

1335
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,160
Hey, folks.

1336
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,160
Thanks.

1337
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,160
Thank you so much.

1338
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,160
You've survived.

1339
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,160
I guess the ride.

1340
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,160
We'll see you next time.

1341
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,160
