1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,300
Welcome in to the final podcast the ride European vacation a podcast hosted by three alfs

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,240
I'm alf number one Scott Gardner joined by alf number two Mike Carlson

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,240
Hello, I am alf number two Mike Carlson and numbers love three days ago. Oh, no, sorry

6
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,500
Say what you want to say alf. I don't know. I was gonna ramble, you know, and then I was deciding that I really I should have said

7
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,740
Hey, it's alf number two or something. Which I should have I guess we all should have had the impressions in the pocket

8
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,420
Yeah, Jason. It's up to you what you want to do alf number three. Oh, hey, it's alf number three

9
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:16,220
Sounds good to me. I just did that to follow up on something that we said we were gonna do

10
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,460
In an episode over on the second gate if you haven't been following the the side episodes

11
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,460
This is the the side excursions

12
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,020
We did a really fun episode came out a couple days ago about the alf and gremlins ride

13
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,660
Did that with Joan Ford and that was a lot of fun. I guess we determined that

14
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,780
We are all more like alf and we are like gremlins. Yeah

15
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:42,180
Yeah, that was what we we are all more alf. Yeah, we feel we relate more to alf than the gremlins

16
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,380
We're not as crazy as the gremlins are but we're very low-key like alf is and sardonic. I would say

17
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,660
casual like sandwiches and

18
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,860
Hawaiian shirts

19
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,580
I mean, it's truly it's not even that much of a joke

20
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,660
No, not really accurate. It's not even if you okay, please go check out the episode

21
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,020
But if you're looking for a great runner around that point, I can't promise you that

22
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,620
I just wanted to make good on something we said we would do. I appreciate that

23
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,300
But yeah, I'd say it's barely a joke. Let's be honest. No, no, we're just you want to hear further

24
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,500
Elaboration of why we're more like alf and also to hear about a crazy ride

25
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,720
That thing is nuts. I'm glad we got to talk about it. But today we stay in the Western

26
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,660
Germany

27
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,940
Area, we just go a little bit south down to a very delightful place called Fantasia land

28
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,140
I would have my knee-jerk would have been to say Fantasia land, but I found a

29
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,100
fantastic

30
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,460
1891 video that takes you around the park that's hosted by a frightening orange monkey

31
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,260
I don't know if you guys met this right I did and is this an original character to that video or is there a

32
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,260
Fantasia land original character like I

33
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,820
Mean there are original characters and I I definitely definitely kept stumbling upon them. I didn't see him in any other

34
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,960
Context but he was oddly upgraded to being the host of this video

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,200
Really kind of a shoddy puppeteering job for being your host

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,000
I got a lot of my content out of this video and I recommend it

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
we'll post a link somewhere, but

38
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,520
Yes from that video. I found a song that taught me that it is not Fantasia land, but rather fun

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,080
Taz your land fontaz your land

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,440
Yeah, I really liked the song and I like the place a lot

41
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,920
You

42
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,920
How do you guys any overall before we get into it thoughts on Fantasia land?

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,520
Is it is it possible for reality itself to be oversaturated like reality to be HDR because this

44
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,200
This park is so there's so much detail

45
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,960
In what I have seen of this park in such a compact space, too

46
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
It's it's overwhelming

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,080
Like this this this park strikes me as like

48
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,240
It is weird. It is weird like some of the earlier ones we did but it is very full of substance

49
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Like it feels very good

50
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,620
Yeah, yes, it feels it feels like just from looking at the website now the website

51
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,100
I think is probably the best website of any of the parks

52
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,240
We've examined through this European trip as far as making you go. This is a real place. This looks like it's a real

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,860
Destination but I will say the website even hides the mystery in the magic. I

54
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,560
Would say yeah, that's kind of true

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,160
We were talking about things that we discovered along the way that they did not put front and center as here's big things in this

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,760
Park almost as if they were trying to shove them into the basement like they were embarrassed of them and they should not be

57
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,280
Yeah, so I don't know what their rationale was for doing that

58
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,320
But when you look at the website always looks like pleasant and there's some roller coasters

59
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,160
But then you start going through the YouTube videos and you go. Oh they have this is some weird robot shit

60
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,280
This is they have it they really do I

61
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,120
I don't think that this is so much the case in

62
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,740
2020 but I think that there was a sweet spot in this park

63
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,600
Maybe in the early 90s, maybe if you went, you know in the right Venn diagram of a lot of these rides

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:31,000
I think you could have gone there in like 1992 and seen over 500 robots. I really think that is accurate

65
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,520
Which might be I think certainly there have been Disney parks with less robots than that

66
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,680
So you you really got to give him credit? Yes

67
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,200
And there's still there are still some robots. So am I totally wrong? Oh, no, they're definitely

68
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
There's an insane amount

69
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,680
In like 90s point in time, yeah, I think there was like tons of like pirates level

70
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,200
There's so many I know trying and shows as well

71
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,800
But my overall thought about this place

72
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,400
I think it's a it's a great place to be ending the European trip because I if I had to take a guess

73
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,200
Before we really looked into any of these places if we're gonna do a month full of Europe episodes. I thought we would find some

74
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
surprisingly charming

75
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,920
Parks full of oddities that reflect the European culture and spirit and I also thought we would find lots of weird shady

76
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:29,120
rip-offs of American rides and I and with Italy it was mostly the latter category

77
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,160
And then you know a lot of odd charm

78
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,160
I think in Popeye Village and Chessington and Pato and I think Fantasia land is the perfect blend of all of it

79
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,840
It's it's everything I thought we would find in Europe. Yeah, that's definitely some rip-offs here

80
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,920
Yeah, and still yeah, it's expensive rip-offs, but newer rip-offs as well in the last ten years

81
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,540
I found yeah, they're still in the in the rip-off game

82
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,880
Definitely though also some rides that I think predated

83
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Rides we have in America

84
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
and and I also like

85
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,580
We'll view this on a case-by-case basis, and I don't want to put my views on to you guys

86
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,840
But I think whereas the movie but Park Italy

87
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
I think the

88
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Fake Universal

89
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,080
Feeling it just it almost like made me a little mad in its

90
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,360
Exploitation it's just the brazenness of the rip-off and I I still like it

91
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,800
I would like to go there, but there's it doesn't feel as I don't know

92
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,680
It doesn't feel as exploitative the ripping off here. It just feels like I don't know we like these rides

93
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,260
It feels like if your dad and your uncle tried to build a pirates or a haunted mansion for you

94
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,980
Yeah, with with every bit of sweet intention that you could imagine

95
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,620
This is like you know when the Beatles do sergeant peppers

96
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,920
And then the Rolling Stones do that album where they're like wizards on the cover

97
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,180
And it's clear that they're like oh we want to do something weird, too

98
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,580
But you know they're talented as well

99
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
How could you be upset with

100
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,040
Another talented group of people doing a weird thing clearly influenced by the other set

101
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,100
Yes, yeah, you know they're hopping on a trend you know the basis, but but it's not just I

102
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,700
Think they might admit it they might admit we were inspired by this whereas the the modus operandi

103
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,220
In that Italy Park seemed like what are you talking about Universal Studios never heard of it?

104
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,300
Yeah, there's a different vibe, and there's a different. There's a craft at least to this

105
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,340
From like when I mean like King Kong is in fun Taz or was in Fantasia land

106
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,820
Still is still is yeah, I am cloudy on what's still there in places

107
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:55,000
I think I mostly know but I might get one wrong as we go okay. They have a map on their website, which is not

108
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,660
unlike the German stereotype the

109
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,900
Some of the stuff on the website is not very efficient like it's very detailed

110
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,580
There's a lot of layers to it

111
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:11,460
But yeah a lot of it is hidden and probably by this maybe by design to keep some mystery although even the Wikipedia

112
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,020
Page is not very thorough like it leaves out some big

113
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,460
attractions

114
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:26,180
Which they've yeah, they've had this this place feels a little more to me like a Disneyland or a Magic Kingdom where there's tons of

115
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,780
Little oddities everywhere it feels like a park of I could be wrong

116
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,060
Like 30 attractions where if you look to the website they kind of only feature the top five

117
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,060
Yeah, yes, I'm wondering. I mean we really again. We should really do our research

118
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,840
We should try to talk to PR. You know we should say what's your philosophy here behind this, but we don't do that yet

119
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:53,860
We're still a small operation, but I am so I am interested if that's part of the mission like let the wonder be

120
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,180
Experienced when you get here

121
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,180
Don't give it all away for free

122
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Sure sure

123
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,380
well

124
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,380
Basics what do we know?

125
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,820
This this park was opened in 1967

126
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,620
There's two people were behind it one of them. I don't have the name handy

127
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,620
but another one was Richard Schmidt who was apparently a

128
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,820
prolific producer of puppet shows on German television, and I think his idea was very

129
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,220
In the spirit of what Disneyland was gonna be before it it evolved and grew

130
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,660
Where he wanted to house his puppet collection somewhere?

131
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:39,100
Yeah, and then also have some carnival rides or merry-go-round or something and you know a nice little afternoon place

132
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,560
For for European and German families, and it grew a lot

133
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,220
I think especially in the 80s it seems like this place had a boom which obviously increases its appeal to me

134
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,940
I think there feels like an inherent 80s-ness to it. You can really tell that's that's where it's it grew big time and came

135
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,740
Of it, so it was yeah, so he started it basically just as a puppet puppet storage area

136
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,980
puppet garage

137
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,900
Does don't is Jeff Dunham have a puppet garage oh

138
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,980
Man like J with cars obviously

139
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,540
I mean hit that theme park also if anybody has enough IP to

140
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,220
make a theme park out of I feel like if he

141
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,480
Took over the parking lot of the Venetian or wherever the hell he does Vegas shows

142
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,080
Oh my god did a little shady mini is this it's clearly a tradition. We know Richard Schmidt did it and

143
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,880
Sid Marty Croft did it for several months in Atlanta. Yeah, where's if if Dunham?

144
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,640
Like weird independent puppeteers have to try to do weird shady theme parks. Yes, don't um yeah up we have ideas

145
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,520
We'll help you out with this Dunham fader. You know oh, yeah

146
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Terry's got a massive the chunk of is it treasure island or mirage

147
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,400
He has a giant theater. He has the Terry fader theater. It's the Terry fader theater

148
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,720
Yeah, yeah, so where's fader land?

149
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,680
Where's fader land and why is it people even know who Terry fader is offhand?

150
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,360
He's like one of the more generic looking

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,100
people who you would see

152
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,680
gigantic posters have in Las Vegas there are about

153
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,840
Thirty to fifty I feel like maybe this is a little high but thirty to fifty

154
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,200
Names that you would go to Vegas and go oh these are the biggest stars in the world

155
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,760
Because you see their posters so often and they all probably make

156
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Twenty million dollars or more a year

157
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,960
They're all probably very rich Terry fader on that list

158
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,000
My newest my newest favorite is tape face. Oh

159
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,840
Tape face yeah the Australian

160
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,280
Prevords artist yes tape faces all everywhere

161
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,760
Yes

162
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,080
He said Harris heard of tape face. You call yourself a Vegas enthusiast

163
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,720
You don't know who tape face is I am shocked that I've missed to this. He's a Harris guy

164
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,880
New Zealand it's like a

165
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,000
Kind of silent comedy show or like he doesn't talk but he puts tape on his face and stuff

166
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,400
Never seen him. He might be he might be fantastic

167
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,440
I don't know I'm excited to see him whenever we're allowed to go back

168
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,040
Well, I guess we can go back now, but I don't think tape face is running shows not a lot running right now

169
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,760
Yeah, that was an early quarreled activity for me because I had been in Vegas not too long before

170
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,960
but when everything first locked down I was like

171
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:42,480
Hmm who who was sent best wishes to everyone has tape face yes tape face has said everyone stay safe

172
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,160
Well when you said activity I thought you were were you putting a bunch of tape on your face

173
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,280
Yeah, I was trying to putting tape on my face

174
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,720
I was making like alcohol slushies with a teaspoon of alcohol in them

175
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,120
Do you I do you think with the right

176
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,360
Positioning of tape on your face could that supplant a mask? Oh, that's good question if it's the right kind of tape

177
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,080
I do think that would probably be pretty effective. It also might be a

178
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,920
Effective at blocking any air coming in that might actually be the situation that the conservatives pretend

179
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,320
Is happening with a mask where it's restricting your airflow?

180
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,560
There's no way you're gonna pass out because you're being deprived of oxygen

181
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,720
Tape face actually would have that problem. He would have that problem

182
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Yeah, the conservatives got an early peek at the Batman trailer where the Riddler is to keep the guys face up

183
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:45,680
This is what they're doing to us. It's like they're kidnapping us. Yeah, put tape on our face. We're all forced tape faces

184
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,760
We're all at the mercy of Dan Oh's the left are all Dan Oh's Dan Oh's world data

185
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
My

186
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Last thought before we go right back to Germany is that what if tape face and bucket head teamed up?

187
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,920
Oh, could you imagine kid you could you imagine and his bucket?

188
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,640
Let's say is the bucket a good mask is the KFC bucket if you pulled it all the way down over your head?

189
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,120
Because he has a mask as well and a bucket

190
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
But maybe that's also effective

191
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,360
He has a witty as a mask too. Yeah, he has kind of like a weird Halloween

192
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,160
Blank like I forget what you call those. Yeah, Jabbawocke kind of yeah, Jabbawocke masks

193
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,860
I think hmm. I'd say maybe that more than the bucket

194
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,480
I'm concerned about the bottom of the bucket like it's the same thing as bandanas

195
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,220
I write we aren't covering that chin area, right?

196
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:43,980
So it's what's it's actually weird when you add it up how many masks there are in Vegas entertainer world. So who who needs

197
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,800
Extra masks the least is it the Jabbawocke's?

198
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,560
One of these guys maybe Terry fader has a routine where that's very disturbing. I think where they like

199
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Force a person to be a living

200
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Marionette

201
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,080
Like they'll get like dad from the audience and then like make him be a lady and

202
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,520
I

203
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,500
Feel like that's maybe a fully enveloping

204
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,360
Mask situation. So if Terry fader turns you into a lady puppet, then you don't need an extra mask. Okay

205
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
That's good to know

206
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,840
All right back to back to

207
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
fantaisie land, I

208
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Also, just want to say this is in

209
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,880
An area that I'm very fond of because I lived here. I studied abroad in this neck of the woods

210
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
It's kind of between

211
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
Cologne and Bonn in

212
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,120
Germany, I lived in Dusseldorf. I studied abroad

213
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,680
There and my girlfriend at the time lived in Bonn and Cologne was a major city right in the middle so I did this

214
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,120
North South trip many many times. I really loved it around there loved living there for a while and

215
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,120
The only thing now is that I'm baffled why I did not ever learn about

216
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,800
Fantasia land why did nobody tell me it was as I've said the least theme parkie and therefore most regrettable

217
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,400
Time of my life, but I had plenty of opportunity to go to Fantasia land

218
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,200
I died I lived that I had so many days for you. I don't know why I didn't do it and I'm upset

219
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
You didn't even know was there

220
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
No idea. No Wow

221
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,480
Yeah, that's we all look life is full of regrets

222
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,540
And some of them will take to our deathbed and will never be able to make up for them

223
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,640
so

224
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,800
Maybe this is just one of them and you'll have to just learn to live with it

225
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,360
I mean I could still go to Fantasia land today, but I think there are rides that I missed that are closed

226
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
forever

227
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,560
I mean, I think that might have been my opportunity to go on Galaxy or on

228
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:03,860
I think race for Atlantis was still open and now I'll never be I I was in Vegas and the Star Trek thing was

229
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,180
Still going and I didn't do it soon

230
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,700
It's a tragedy because I love Star Trek and the whole thing looks all it looked awesome

231
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,740
I could have drank a quarks bar and I will regret it for the for as long as I live

232
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:23,000
Did every did everybody bail on theme parks in your college years? Is this consistent between the three of us? Well?

233
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,140
You know my quote-unquote study abroad was I did a semester in Los Angeles

234
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,820
So I went to theme parks a lot

235
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,140
To the point where my peers I think were concerned

236
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,260
How many times I went to Disneyland and Universal so that was interning issue on the universal lot

237
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:53,580
So could pretty much get in free, but it got in the that was the time of like by a day get the year for free

238
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,580
So like I was only there for three months

239
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:02,340
But I could go whatever I wanted and I I lived down the street like I lived around the corner from universal

240
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,960
So is this where you get your love of California Adventure 1.0?

241
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,460
Probably yeah, I mean I that was like I did right before I

242
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
went back east and

243
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:21,860
We did I remember like just being baffled by it because we did it in like before lunch

244
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,380
We had done most of the attractions before noon

245
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,340
So like you're in you're freshly in Los Angeles and Anaheim

246
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,900
You're young and the world is ahead of you and anything is possible

247
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,220
You didn't know what?

248
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,540
Horror show Los Angeles would eventually turn out to be

249
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,060
And you're you're seeing the the the Sun when you come into Disney's California Adventure

250
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,180
You're like this is the greatest place I've ever been

251
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,140
You know I there was there was a lot of like MGM like

252
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,580
Photocopied signage essentially in the Hollywood part that was very comforting to me

253
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,420
Wow

254
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,500
Yeah, I understand our show assessment is a little odd to me that was do you mean just like this year?

255
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:10,140
Or did you consider it a horror show being in Los Angeles? Yeah. Yeah. No, I look I

256
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,860
Make a bit of fun. It was it hasn't been that bad. There's a lot of good stuff about it. Yeah

257
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,980
I love Los Angeles amazing city

258
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,740
But it certainly takes a couple of years to get used to and there's some real weirdness like every now

259
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,980
And I'm very good. I can spot it immediately where it's like someone it's like, uh, someone's yelling at a car

260
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:36,820
It's like up. There's a horse running down the street. No one around like these those little moments of Los Angeles weirdness

261
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,020
Know what you're talking about. What are you seeing a horse running a horse running down the street alone?

262
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,300
Yeah, yes

263
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:52,180
Well, I saw someone okay in the this is Burbank actually that I guess weirdness of Los Angeles County

264
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,620
I was cutting by the equestrian area in Burbank and

265
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,980
someone had clearly just gotten a runaway horse under control and

266
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,180
Then as I was driving down the street

267
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,100
I saw a German Shepherd walking in the lane in front of me and I'd like

268
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,340
Had I was like fought like trying to get this

269
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,660
Protect this dog and like a bunch of other people were to just a day in LA, you know

270
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
Was dr. Doolittle in town?

271
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,340
I think what had happened is someone's course got out of control and then their dog ran away

272
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,220
So they had to get them back one after the other which did happen, right?

273
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,180
But this doesn't seem like any way to encapsulate your

274
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,420
The experience of Los Angeles in general. This seems like one thing that happened

275
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,780
Okay, how about the other time where I got off the subway and Hollywood and a man in a trench coat?

276
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,300
But no shirt on lunged at me and yelled. I can't be alone anymore

277
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Jesus

278
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Yeah

279
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,900
Yeah

280
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:02,740
What do you think happened I think he just wanted a friend but it wasn't gonna be me

281
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,620
The next guy probably

282
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,620
Yeah

283
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,540
I'm glad he didn't show up after the horse and the dog

284
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,900
You again

285
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,900
He was riding on the horse

286
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,460
So anyways, yeah, I'm upset I missed upset I missed Fonthaziland

287
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,660
and

288
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,420
I don't know. I mean, I'm not sure where to get into it. I mean

289
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,220
I it really is just

290
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,180
There's there's an odd amount of attractions that just have a lot of

291
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,660
interesting odd culture to him

292
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,620
I mean like what one that might bear talking about right at the beginning

293
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:50,220
Good solid attractions is Taron this this roller coaster that went in in 2016

294
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,620
This came up on the show before because I threw it in as kind of a

295
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,620
Could this possibly make it into the fake rock?

296
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,820
Final four because I think the rock work is pretty strong on it

297
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,780
It didn't make it into the into the competition to 16, but if you google it, it looks

298
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,620
fantastic

299
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,500
This I feel is a ride that is absolutely

300
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,700
This I feel is a ride that is absolutely Disney and universal quality

301
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:23,000
It's a multi-launch roller coaster the fastest and longest multi-launch coaster at least when it opens that that might be Hagrid's now

302
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,060
But I mean this this ride seems legitimately fantastic

303
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,880
Yeah, it seems like I don't know if it seems like yeah

304
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,740
like a mix of like Hagrid's and Big Thunder or something like that where it's like it's not a

305
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
It's like not a ton of

306
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:45,700
Like I guess theming other than just like the mountains or the whatever you'd call these yeah, would they would they what are these things?

307
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,180
Are they?

308
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
My just rocks

309
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,460
Still it's an old Norse village is what it is. So is it is it kind of?

310
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,220
He has a cliff walls or

311
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,540
They aren't man-made right? I don't think so

312
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,380
I mean, I'm sure people are yelling if they know what this is. Yeah cliff walls might be right

313
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
Let's say cliff walls. I like that son of that

314
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,020
Yeah, but it's very much like

315
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,700
It's very much like you kind of puts it's enough stuff to make you feel like you're in a different spot

316
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,620
In addition to obviously what is a very cool thrill element with multi launches

317
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,780
Yeah, yeah, they have a lot of pretty sizable coasters here from like the big

318
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,780
coaster manufacturer B&M and they come a

319
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Welcome I don't know how to say it Intamin

320
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:42,940
And they all seem to have very nice sets like yeah really puts to shame the American like

321
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:50,500
Yeah, put the steel pylons up and put a bunch of gravel underneath like just really make some of our American coasters

322
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,400
Look like shit. This is what yeah

323
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,140
This is what like a six flags either doesn't understand or doesn't give a shit about and it's probably the latter. It's like

324
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,260
Looking at this I don't think this costs as much as cars land costs or something like that

325
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:11,300
I'm sure it's a little more expensive than a regular coaster because you're putting up different little pieces of rock and stuff

326
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,420
But it makes so much difference

327
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,940
It's so different gives you a vibe and it makes you able to

328
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,380
Separate this from other coasters in your head

329
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,300
you know, this is the one with the rocks and the the rooftop and the the Norse theme and and it's

330
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,100
Yeah, a little a little more of it a little transformative experience

331
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,620
Yeah, and it makes like it makes it probably like 25 to 50 percent better of an experience

332
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:42,220
Like it is interesting like see a six flags is just like yeah, you're gonna get to see Valencia

333
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,480
When you get to the top, that's what you're gonna see

334
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:53,140
You're gonna see the see your car sometimes like make sure it hasn't been broken into you're gonna see your car plugged into a service

335
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,740
trailer

336
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,740
charging

337
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:02,100
Like mine was regular extension cord just an orange Home Depot extension cord

338
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,540
I'll see teens trying to steal the hubcaps off the car and you'll be able to shout at them, which is fun

339
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,020
Hey, hey, don't you the white car specifically, please don't

340
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,300
They look up

341
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,400
Give you the finger keep doing what they're doing. We talked a little bit of from Alton Towers the Wicker Man coaster

342
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,600
And it's another one where like obviously that's a big impressive thing

343
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,760
But it's not like it's some crazy ass robot

344
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,280
it's just like this big cool looking structure that gives it a vibe and it would be really nice if

345
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,180
Six-flags and other parks were just to like just put a little dressing a little set dressing. It goes a long way

346
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,360
Yeah, and just a theme just to let you know a little like hint of

347
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:51,640
This is kind of a ride where you go into the Old West or into Medieval times or whatever it like

348
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,960
Yeah, like the like the Riddler's Revenge coaster. It's like I like that coaster

349
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,840
I did it but like give us some of that Gotham that Batman forever

350
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,120
Architecture where like think like a big statue is holding the observatory up like this is your second

351
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,080
I think of the way no, it's I'm making Batman forever content

352
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,600
and I mean this I think is just your particular hang up is I

353
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,560
Love Batman forever. I meant forever land. I love Batman forever so much

354
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,760
And that this is one of those movies were like if if people were like would you are you interested in watching new movies?

355
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,200
Or would you just like to watch Batman forever all the time? I would say oh Batman forever. I think

356
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,020
Like I like if I had to choose never seeing Batman forever again or new movies

357
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,640
I might go Batman forever, and I'm very excited at the idea that there's a three-hour cut of Batman forever

358
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,920
That was just talked about that sitting, you know, yes, there's a there's possibly a full Schumacher

359
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:58,100
Three-hour cut of Batman forever that puts back in this deleted scenes where there's a giant practical bat that's haunting Val Kilmer

360
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,900
It's a much darker movie apparently that then those scenes are on YouTube. Oh

361
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,160
Okay, but yes this this this Taron released the Schumacher cut

362
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,660
Yeah, maybe that three-hour cut finally get some Leonard Cohen songs in there so we know

363
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
To take this seriously

364
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,760
Mm-hmm, I don't hear a sad song. I don't know whether this is a film or not

365
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,120
I mean kiss from a rose seal is

366
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,840
Seal is my Leonard Cohen

367
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,800
Taron

368
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:39,760
Also as Jason as you said really like all the legit all the best coaster makers have done something in

369
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:47,580
Phantasialand and this this one's by Intamin who later several years later built the Hagrid's coaster

370
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,340
And it's similar in a lot of ways it does

371
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,660
It's not the same level of you stop and do a little scene

372
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,700
There's no robots or anything, but it it feels a lot like

373
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,020
Hagrid's in that there's like there's kind of a downbeat and then you super speed up

374
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,920
They just do a little bit with lighting and fog and that kind of thing

375
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,940
But they I don't know this feels to me like

376
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:14,180
If you like the vibe of Hagrid's and you want more of it and maybe a more intense one because this one goes 72

377
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,780
Miles an hour I'd really like to go on this ride

378
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:23,900
But this would be more than pushing the amount of launch that I can be a queen of what is yeah

379
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,700
What is the speed of Hagrid's do you know offhand?

380
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
I don't know if I have that down

381
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:38,820
Like sounds like I think 55. Yeah, if rock and roller coaster is

382
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,380
That that's the fastest that I've done and that gets up to 57

383
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:49,100
So this would be intense, but it seems fun as hell it seems really really great

384
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:56,780
Yeah, and it looks like that like smooth fun crazy like as long as stuff is smooth. I can go pretty fast. I think

385
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:02,600
I'm with you. Yeah. Yeah, I can't be I can't be shaken. I can't be feeling individual nails

386
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,480
Other awesome coasters there's something called black Mamba

387
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,280
Which I've seen described as the best inverted coaster in the world

388
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,460
It has 10 near misses there are 10 parts of the ride where if you're staring straight ahead

389
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,720
You feel like you're gonna slam into a wall or something and presumably you do not

390
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,480
Yeah, that sounds cool to his black Mamba the one that lifts you up into a building

391
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,520
So cuz maybe I'm not sure a couple of these go through buildings or tunnels and

392
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,080
Aesthetically like it's not like there's show scenes in it

393
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,360
But it does add like an interesting like oh, it's dark and then the next turn is a total surprise

394
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,800
But I feel like I kept seeing and passing that some of the designs of these coasters

395
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:56,580
The buildings or the walls act as sound dampeners because there are residences very close to this park

396
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,120
Yeah, extremely. It's in the town of Brule, which is pretty

397
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,040
Suburban like it I think this park was like a big boon to that city. Yeah, it seems very sleepy

398
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,280
Around there and yeah odd that there would be lots of coasters right next to homes

399
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,040
I think that really impacted

400
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,200
the ride

401
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,800
mystery castle

402
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,200
Which also seems like I guess in keeping with the rides

403
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,200
We've been talking about it seems like it's it's the bones of a ride, you know, very well

404
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,840
It's a drop tower, but in order to dampen screams, they do it inside

405
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,440
So it's and they and it's not all tower. It's not all riders around the same tower

406
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:47,920
They're like you're up against the wall. There's four walls and you know four separate, you know drops on either on all the sides

407
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,720
With a little bit of effects like there's lightning up at the top and you know

408
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,520
Kind of some music and some plottiness and the tower itself looks really scary from the outside

409
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
It looks like a prison or something

410
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,120
This seems great. It's like it's a ride that you know, but with 20% more effort in theming. It seems really cool

411
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,140
Yeah, almost the setup to dr. Doom's fearfall of like a pod my experiments, you know

412
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:21,200
Uh-huh, but we just yeah with a lot of inside neon or fake Tesla coil kind of thing and it a little bit goes a long way

413
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,660
That's the lesson for this park and for theming in general a little bit goes a long way

414
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,900
You don't have to go nuts, but I'm glad for times when they do

415
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,780
I guess in terms of

416
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,340
if we start transitioning from hey, that's a good amount of theming to

417
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,580
potentially confusing

418
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,980
theming

419
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:52,020
I one of the big headlines about fontazi land is a ride called Colorado Adventure

420
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,220
I'm feeling this is their direction you were going yeah

421
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Colorado Adventure is a

422
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:08,540
Mine train type coaster. It's like Big Thunder. It's it's steel. So you're in a train and it's a madcap train adventure with some

423
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,340
Fake rocks. That's good

424
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,500
We understand what this is

425
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,460
but

426
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,700
After it opened and up until 2013

427
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:22,740
This ride was called Colorado Adventure the Michael Jackson thrill ride

428
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:28,060
Yes, I mean is this let me ask you this Scott. Is this why we're doing this park

429
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:35,220
It helps it really helps I mean hard for me to stay away from something

430
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:43,140
Something is that contains the Michael Jackson thrill ride that when when I first just saw the first two layers of the website and

431
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,060
And was on the second thing I looked at was Colorado Adventure I

432
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,420
Immediately was like is this all this park has because the website is such a smokescreen

433
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,300
Like like wait are we doing this because we're gonna talk about Colorado Adventure for half an hour

434
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:06,140
Nothing, but Colorado Adventure. I mean the thing is there's not a ton to talk about there is it with it

435
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,780
And I was because I was disappointed. I feel like I might have heard about this years ago

436
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:16,900
Oh really they named a ride after Michael. Okay, so then does he do the the pre-show video?

437
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,220
Or is it set to a Michael Jackson song?

438
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:25,140
No, none of this the theming is that it says the word Michael Jackson on the outside

439
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:31,980
And then otherwise is an old west thing. It's not even like there's stars or

440
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:39,020
Glitter like would be on his glove. It has absolutely nothing to do with Michael Jackson. Did you investigate?

441
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,540
I mean, I mean I know there's footage of him on the ride

442
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,920
Is this something where he just was on the ride one day and said I want I want it

443
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,180
I want to be on this ride. No, he was there

444
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,260
Didn't he oh did they not change the name at some point?

445
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:01,780
Do I have this wrong? Did it open as the Michael Jackson? I think well now I think it's they've dropped that but I

446
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,300
Think that was the opening. Yeah, that was the opening in the marketing for years

447
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,020
Yeah, and and by

448
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,420
It's a curious marketing strategy because you look at the sign and it's very not very far

449
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,620
I'm just imagine, you know

450
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,460
kind of rustic wooden sign for your roller coaster as this Colorado venture and then

451
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:27,260
Just kind of pasted on letters the Michael Jackson thrill ride the M looks bad

452
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:33,460
The M kind of looks like an N so it's a little crooked and it looks like Nikol Jackson

453
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
to me this feels like

454
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,260
They heard he was coming and threw it up really quickly to make him happy

455
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,180
Dirty get like get old Gus up there to

456
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:52,380
Bang some letters onto that sign. There are so many different like legends and confirmed stories of

457
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,140
like meetings Michael Jackson took like in the 90s and probably early 2000s like

458
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:05,700
Michael Jackson was gonna buy Marvel Comics. He had a meeting with Stan Lee and I just read Michael Jackson met with Laura Shuler Donner

459
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,280
To try to be professor X in the X-Men movie

460
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,060
Yes

461
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,540
That's in the big singer article. I think yes, that's true. Yes

462
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,220
So I wonder if this is just a weird meeting he had that actually

463
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,300
Like bore fruit like it was just like yeah

464
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:32,580
Whatever you want, I guess because it seems like most of these meetings are people leave confused exactly what Michael is looking for

465
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:39,620
Hey like anytime you read it's like yeah, he he was he thought that he could just

466
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,780
Like star in the men in black to movie was that right?

467
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,220
Like did he think he was gonna have a much bigger part

468
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,580
Did he think like agent M was gonna be the the climax of the film?

469
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,320
I think it was like is he gonna have his like name on the poster

470
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,420
Will he be in sequels like it just seems like any meeting he had people just left confused

471
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:08,540
And is this the one meeting where he was like, yeah, I want to have a ride and it's a choo-choo train and they were like

472
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,580
Okay, and then like that was done

473
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:16,740
Like this was the only weird meeting he had that worked and some really severe

474
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:23,100
Efficient German guy just said just put his name on the sign, right? It doesn't need to be more than that, right?

475
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,340
You're overthinking it. You got her to get it up in the next hour

476
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,220
He didn't develop it

477
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:36,860
Yeah, the footage of him riding it is very confusing because he has the hat he is like the

478
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,260
The moonwalker hat and then everyone else in the car

479
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,820
The train has clearly been given cowboy hats which they're waving like you do when you're like

480
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,100
Riding a horse or on a bucking bronco, you know that sort of thing

481
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:58,740
But he it looks like he just has his like the hat you associate with him and he's wearing it going up the lift hill

482
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,860
And then he takes it off and he holds it for a while

483
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,740
And then he tries to put it back on as the coasters picking up speed

484
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,220
He realized he has to hold it and it's just a lot of him taking the hat on it off

485
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:16,260
And then everyone else never tries to put their hat on they're like these are props and we're waving it is very confusing

486
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:22,900
Mm-hmm. Yes, did he not have object permanence? Does he did he not understand how things worked?

487
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,380
Well, I think we know for sure

488
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:31,380
Know how things know how things work. I think that is a hundred percent confirmed. Sure. Yes. Well, he thought he could you know

489
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,300
show his baby to a

490
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:40,460
Bunch of people outside his hotel without the baby tumbling seven stories to its death. Yes

491
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,360
He so he might not know hats fine

492
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,580
My question though is once they took his name off of it

493
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,220
Why didn't they replace it with another famous German celebrity like David Hasselhoff or elf?

494
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:58,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, this ride is just yet thrown to the gutter

495
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,260
Unbranded it's just some ordinary ride now who cares?

496
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,140
I don't know

497
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,100
Is there even a way is Foss Bender?

498
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,740
German I forget where he's from. I like that pronunciation is everyone just call some fast Bender, but you're right

499
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,700
If it is if he is it's obviously people don't say Foss. I don't think I've actually heard fast

500
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:26,060
But it's probably my correct pronunciation. Yeah, but it's all these American fast fast banner

501
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,040
That's how I say I'm assuming it's like Fantasia land

502
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,100
If he ever wanted to just brand this place entirely

503
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:40,580
Foss Bender land false false badder just rethemed everything after his films

504
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,580
Get all Prometheus. Oh, yeah

505
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,300
I

506
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,980
Yeah, I don't know

507
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,180
Yeah, this ride is now there's no owner

508
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:57,820
That's the thing I saw it one justification that people said this ride had been adopted by Michael Jackson

509
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,820
I don't like the sound of that

510
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,820
No, I can't say I do

511
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,020
The dream of anything being adopted by Michael Jackson, yeah

512
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
There's a

513
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
There's got to be a good story

514
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:21,580
About this coming together that we I don't know if maybe it's impossible to find maybe there's like one old man who worked for the company

515
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,860
That's like

516
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:28,120
85 and we have to like journey to Germany to meet him to learn what happened

517
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:33,860
But there's got to be some interesting weird story behind this somebody has it. Yeah, it's it's not public

518
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,980
It just makes no sense. They and they

519
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:41,660
Stopped calling it that in 2013 which implies that this was not a cancellation

520
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,440
This is not like they recently stripped it of the Michael Jackson's name. Did they just think like oh wait, he died

521
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,120
He's not coming back. Let's just we can take this confusing thing off now, can't we?

522
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,940
It's very possible. Yeah

523
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
But this isn't the only

524
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,860
celebrity tie-in to this park because

525
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,460
some friends of

526
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,320
Michael Jackson are also very associated with it

527
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:17,960
Who also have you know a lot of a lot of flair and sparkles and I refer of course to Siegfried and Roy

528
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,880
big Siegfried and Roy

529
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,640
presence over the years at this park

530
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
in 1987

531
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:33,120
For the 20th anniversary Siegfried and Roy started a tiger breeding program at Fontasia land

532
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,880
They basically recreated their setup at the Mirage like it like those the same

533
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,040
tiger

534
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,640
Territory same tiger tank. I don't know the phrase

535
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,080
Probably tiger tank. I prefer a tiger tank in your tank, you know

536
00:41:52,920 --> 00:42:00,360
But yeah, they I don't know the super interesting to be around a lot around this time

537
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,780
There's no one more suited to be in a park called Fantasia land than Siegfried and Roy

538
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,980
Yeah, yeah big time and

539
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,460
Over the course of discovering that I found an odd little

540
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,380
rabbit hole

541
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:22,100
And I can't believe this rabbit hole in particular keeps going

542
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,140
So I was on a website that was in German

543
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:32,180
So I didn't understand the bulk of it, but there would be it was the timeline of the history of

544
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,580
Fantasia land and there was you know big keywords

545
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,340
Here's what we did this year, you know, just Millennium for 2000

546
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:45,420
And I kind of gave me the gist of what happened when and for when this happened in 1987

547
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,300
The timeline said in big golden letters

548
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,860
Sar modi

549
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,900
You guys know the word. Whoa, Sar modi

550
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,180
Audience if you didn't follow us over to the second gate

551
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:04,100
We did an episode where we watched every episode of the terrible series father of the pride the

552
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,620
Dreamworks animated series based on Siegfried and Roy and that had a character named

553
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,960
Sar modi played by Karl Reiner

554
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,740
RIP Roy Horn RIP

555
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:21,580
Also, we didn't do that episode very long ago and both Roy Horn and the voice of Sar modi Karl Reiner have sadly passed away

556
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,180
So

557
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,180
Yeah, Sar modi

558
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:31,700
Related to Fantasia land and I jumped out of my chair like oh no this word

559
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:37,100
Because also if you didn't hear that episode Sar modi is an incredibly unpleasant character all of the many

560
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,980
Homophobic moments in the series come out of Sar modi's mouth

561
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:49,300
So I was a little unnerved to see Sar modi's name again and I thought well did they breed a

562
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,700
Tiger here named Sar modi. What's the deal?

563
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,780
Why am I seeing this word again?

564
00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:00,540
And then I found something that I can't believe the three of us didn't find in our previous father of the pride research

565
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:06,340
Do you guys know that Sar modi is an acronym? No, what?

566
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,180
Do you know what it can now just picture it in your mind?

567
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,860
And you guess what it what it might stand for at least what part of it might stand for?

568
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,580
Siegfried and Roy

569
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,300
Yep, you got it master

570
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,300
Masters of the

571
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,580
Impossible that's it

572
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,060
Modi means

573
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:35,740
Siegfried and Roy masters of the impossible whoa this you guys was their magic word

574
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:42,780
We don't know about Siegfried and Roy to have realized that they didn't say abracadabra. They said Sar modi. Oh my god

575
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,780
We look like such fools

576
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,620
We just left that hand there's one listener

577
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:53,440
This has been gnawing at them and they were hoping that the day would come where we would be shamed and that has happened

578
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,820
All of a sudden as if magic Sar modi we have been shamed. Oh my god

579
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:06,320
I mean we I I have not felt so embarrassed doing this that we don't know that much about Siegfried and Roy a topic

580
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,220
We should be experts on

581
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:15,540
Yeah, yeah, all three of us missed it and not only that that's not the only way that Sar modi has reared its head

582
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:21,100
In Siegfried and Roy world, it's not even the last time Sar modi has come up in an animated way

583
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,180
Oh my god guys turn your attention to

584
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,780
the shared screen on zoom

585
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,540
Where I'm horrified to say that there was another

586
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,380
Siegfried and Roy animated series this I was cold

587
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,140
Okay, okay, you did find this before her

588
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,660
No, I just it's all coming back to me from childhood

589
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,320
No, I didn't talk I don't think I've talked about this on the show

590
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,540
But go ahead. Yeah

591
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:54,020
This show is called the full thing. What's our modi means Siegfried and Roy masters of the impossible. Here's a little scene

592
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:05,740
The dust demons are swept from the hearth and the kindlings been set a place the mages sit by the fire

593
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,020
and recall a once magic world called

594
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:17,020
Sar modi a place of fairy queens and wishing wells of unicorns dragons potions and spells

595
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,260
so Sar modi is also

596
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,300
the magical kingdom that they

597
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,540
Protect and by the way in this series Siegfried and Roy are jacked

598
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:33,420
They all have they're like they seem like they're six foot seven and have very broad shoulders

599
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,500
They all look they both look essentially like

600
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:42,260
Batman the animated series like the proportions of that Bruce Wayne slash Batman that cartoon way better

601
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:48,100
Yeah, yes. Yes, only four episodes well way less successful oddly

602
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:55,020
Siegfried and Roy animated series, but there's two one sir Modi is their magical land and in the other one sir Modi is a

603
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,940
old cranky tiger who hates gay tigers

604
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:05,100
Yeah, I think the first one's better. I think the first series is better. Yeah. Wow, I gotta see that

605
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:10,820
What is the if you had to put a percentage on your individual desires to watch?

606
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,120
Every episode of this Siegfried and Roy animated show. What would your percentage be?

607
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:20,100
Rewatch in my case because I think I watched every episode I

608
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:26,820
I think that show was one of the ones so in like the the golden era of Saturday

609
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,140
I don't know if it's a golden era might be the Bronze Age

610
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:34,180
but like Saturday morning cartoons when we were kids were like Fox and the WB and even like

611
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,980
ABC NBC CBS we're starting to get in the game

612
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,800
They would usually start around 8 a.m. 9 a.m

613
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:46,940
But then there would be weird syndicated ones that like 7 a.m. And I think that's where it got

614
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,900
Dropped it felt kind of European that felt yeah

615
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,160
I would do like not me or it was a joint production with England or France or something

616
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,240
Well, there was and there was a lot of fantasy kind of whether there was a Pirates one. There was a Sinbad one

617
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,820
the Sinbad the sailor

618
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:09,660
And and I think because you know those are in the public domain. You just do whatever you want with pirates

619
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,940
It's in bad, you know, right, right

620
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,660
Well, what how much does anybody want to watch all the episodes of this?

621
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:24,020
Yeah, we did I would I would do this I would do it because it's everybody's over 50% I'm at like

622
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:31,180
4% I think you said four episodes and it feels like it's right in the sweet spot of when we were kids which makes me more

623
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,140
attracted to it

624
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:37,220
Like it's just a ripoff of an action show from the early 90s

625
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,660
Sure. Sure. So I'm I don't know. Oh

626
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,300
Well, I would watch one for sure and then I my percentage could change

627
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,760
Yeah, they would judge it judge it off of the pilot. Sure

628
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,020
It'd be less punishing either way. Yes, thanks to me. Yeah the other one

629
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,140
so

630
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:01,620
Anyway, yeah Siegfried and Roy they were there. They were in the park a lot seemingly

631
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,580
along with a guy named Hino I

632
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,140
Guess if you're if you're German or

633
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,260
If you grew up in Germany, I'm sure you know who Hino is I did I didn't previously

634
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:20,140
he's like a he's a blonde dude with perennial sunglasses and I

635
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,980
Don't know like the most one of the most successful German musicians of all time. All I know is when I looked up

636
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:30,020
Fantasia land on Getty editorial it see I think he was there once a month

637
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:36,800
I think I know had an apartment at Fantasia land. Was he the that perfume guy that was always an Epcot Center

638
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,820
You know wait, what's that again? What's that guy's name? Oh, right?

639
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,260
Yeah, I got a look at people are yelling right now because he's always there

640
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:53,020
The your way, I mean gear net gear Ness. Thank you, Jason

641
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:59,340
The Norwegian fragrance man. Yeah. Yeah, he's like always he's like signing once a day

642
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:06,060
He's like number one there Mickey Thomas is in Epcot probably the second most out of the year from

643
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,820
Starship

644
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,780
Do they all get their own episodes then I guess

645
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:19,700
I think people would be very excited about the gear Weiss episode if you're a weird world showcase

646
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,060
Person I think for sure

647
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,580
I

648
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:29,300
And one thing maybe this maybe I can kick it over to Jason with this. I do know that

649
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,300
while Roy was still relatively with it that they

650
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:40,620
They went I believe to the premiere of this big dinner show that is a a tentpole

651
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:46,020
Event that's a must-see at Fantasia land and we were arguing about the pronunciation

652
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,080
Now I don't remember the name at all. Would you like to give it a go?

653
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,600
I think I saw it read as

654
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,600
This is a dinner show, right

655
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,720
Fantasima

656
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,240
fan yeah

657
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,680
Fantasium fun to I would guess fantastic. Oh, but it's spelled F a n t

658
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,360
like not F a

659
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,600
pH a

660
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,600
NT like it

661
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,500
It's it's got the F. It doesn't have the pH

662
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,720
And it looks very

663
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,120
Weird it looks like the entertainment before an eyes wide shut sort of situation

664
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,720
like I

665
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,680
Don't know here. Let me screen share. I mean

666
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,080
if you have seen like the

667
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,840
If you have seen the guys can you see these guys these guys in blue

668
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,920
with the hands

669
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:53,540
Yeah, they look like in in pitch perfect to the bad guys the German bad guys from that

670
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,920
and then there's like like

671
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,920
Like computer guys like heisty guys have with goggles and stuff

672
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,560
These are just some of the seeds that you can see online

673
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:14,800
It looks like 15 different cults have gathered to each perform their own musical number

674
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:22,440
Like it's a there's a variety of different weird little numbers that are all creepy in their own way

675
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:29,140
Yeah, I don't understand how you get from one to the other those images you just showed

676
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,360
Seem like two completely different shows. I'd be very curious how they bridge it and some of it looks like

677
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,280
Thunder from Down Under some of it is just like jacked guys

678
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:44,620
Like mm-hmm dancing for you. It's it's interesting. It's a real variety show

679
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,540
I'll say from the look of it. You get a lot of different types. Yeah, you get your like

680
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,580
weird auto erotic asphyxiation Starlight Express

681
00:52:53,260 --> 00:53:00,260
You get your hunks you get your like ribbon dancers you get your acrobats and you get a

682
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,900
Supposedly a decent dinner as well. It's a dinner show. Yeah

683
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,540
I

684
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,920
Was looking at so I'm showing the guy like two photos from this show

685
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:19,280
But there's like six more photos that again look very much like they're from totally different shows all in a row on this website

686
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,440
and

687
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,160
The other thing that that feels very like the European kind of weirdness

688
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,880
The other thing that's kind of weird on the website kind of related to this is some of the verbiage

689
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,940
Like did you guys come across celebrate?

690
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:43,180
Which is like the word celebrate but it's spelled CEL EBR colon

691
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,420
EAT

692
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,380
Celebrate and the location known as

693
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,620
Musartium the word museum with the word art shoved in the middle

694
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,020
There's so bad I can't believe they aren't going into Orange County

695
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,020
In a couple years or it's a late period Prince album

696
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,700
Use artium

697
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:16,140
Yeah, that sounds like it it's a it's 46 minutes of jazz art and oh well he doesn't sing once

698
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,060
artificial age

699
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:24,580
Which was a pretty good album honestly you late period no that's on the better end. Yeah. Yeah, he got out of the

700
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,780
The nose dive I think but it was rough around

701
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,680
97 or so third eye girl album not as good though

702
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,040
Hmm, but artificial age pretty good

703
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah

704
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,480
Can I read some reviews real quick please the show yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

705
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,400
So I mean I think this is actually a pretty popular show and then look just for the sake of comedy

706
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,940
I found some bad reviews because isn't this fun

707
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,920
I'm not trying to say it's a bad show

708
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,020
I'm just let's this I was amused by the way this person wrote so I translated this

709
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:05,700
It says this person's talking about going to the show approximately an hour before the show the actual auditorium which exudes the charm of an

710
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:12,900
Unrenovated train station and which also smells like that in some places of nicotine and urine to be precise

711
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,940
opens

712
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,940
With and then this is just a great

713
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:24,060
Translation with a little less with a little less luck you come across a kind of bouncer who asks for the table number and

714
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,060
Does not use any manners

715
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,460
Most bouncers should be friendlier

716
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:34,720
We had booked the second most expensive price category by telephone because the most expensive was already booked

717
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:41,680
Our table was at the maximum distance from the stage ie at the opposite end of the station hall as is typical for a train

718
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:49,300
Station it drew which I assume smelled like pike soup, and it smelled either of smoke or toilet

719
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,700
Pike soup me I don't know I don't know that's just

720
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,260
Yeah, that might be a but I like maybe it's like a

721
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:04,500
Because what's a pike is that like like a dock? I'm thinking of like see yeah, they're a pike place right?

722
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,580
Yeah, I know is it like

723
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,460
ground up

724
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,660
coffee beans ground up into a soup

725
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,580
Yeah, I I hope pike soup is real

726
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:21,980
I should really you know just google it and let's see if it's a translation or if it's just

727
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:27,500
Oddly the ultimate phrase in Germany pike soup is real

728
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,260
It's a real soup

729
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:35,100
Pike oh, it's like an edible soup. Oh, yeah, wait a day pike soup doesn't look too bad

730
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:41,480
Yeah, maybe pike soup is good, so it's either it either smells like pike soup smoke or toilet

731
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:48,740
This reminds me I didn't get the chance to bring this up on the Chesington episode

732
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,940
But I found a review of the hotels at Chesington is very complimentary

733
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:58,740
But it kept mentioning the detail that it's like came down here on a trip with my niece

734
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:04,700
And it just kept saying trip with my niece a lot and I was like that is I

735
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,020
Don't think I ever went on a trip with an aunt or uncle

736
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:15,060
Do you think that's actually what was happening or that person was like with a young girlfriend and they were trying to deflect?

737
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,900
That was like a smoke screen. Yeah

738
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,660
That's also

739
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,540
Yeah, it seems

740
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,980
Something seemed up. He was 55. He's dating a 23 year old. He's like it's my niece. This is my niece

741
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,020
It's my niece nothing weird

742
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:33,220
Just a 50 year old uncle and a 20 year old niece. That's right

743
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:41,460
Those ages are possible that's something that's sometimes the age separation and that's the case here with me and my niece

744
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,700
Did I mention my fun trip with my niece? Yeah, my niece

745
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:49,180
It's Europe he's going to the park announcing that to everybody

746
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:56,540
He's like yeah, we'll have the pasta. I'll have a pasta and then my niece over here. What will you have nice nice?

747
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,540
Would you explain your order to the waiter?

748
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:03,980
How many in your party? Well, let me see. It's me and my niece. So that'd be two

749
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,220
I guess that'd be two one two, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, be two two is my niece who will be checking into the hotel

750
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:13,400
Yes, yes, my niece and I will be checking into the hotel. Isn't that right? Is that hey?

751
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,400
Let me just make sure my niece hears me. Hey niece

752
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,640
niece

753
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:24,980
See what she is she waved when she heard she responded she heard she waved and responded. So yes, a hundred percent nice

754
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,440
So just a separate beds separate beds one uncle one niece

755
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,680
You never sleep in the bed with your niece it's the uncle niece

756
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,440
Yeah, I got the uncle nice package at the hotel just wanted to make sure holiday. It's a short break a short break

757
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,800
short break for an uncle and a niece

758
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,400
I

759
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,640
Can I can I talk about some other shows

760
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,880
Run across and this is what I'm talking about that. I think these are I think a lot of these are gone now

761
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,560
but there was a time where I

762
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,600
think you could have seen hundreds and hundreds of of animatronics and

763
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,280
you know, maybe we'll start heading into the truly rip off the zone of

764
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,760
Phantasialand because they have a lot of things that are

765
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,760
Pretty country bear s pretty

766
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,680
Enchantique room s guess I videos where it is a bunch of flowers descending from the ceiling or like a

767
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,480
animatronic character on a swing

768
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:31,400
And I when all these were open at once. I mean, this is peak animatronic maybe

769
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,960
anywhere in the world

770
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,320
I'm just gonna flip through some for you guys

771
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,000
This was these guys were open maybe they were going maybe in the 70s. This is pretty old-school

772
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:49,920
The this is a family of there's a family monkey band there. They're called deep deep

773
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:56,360
My what I want to say climb bin ski and I say climb because maybe is it climb because they're

774
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:04,600
Monkeys and monkeys climb. Oh, that's a get wrong though. I'm not sure but yeah, we got a monkey banner like homemade instruments

775
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,600
It was banjo and accordion. I mean, this is really country bear s. Oh, yeah

776
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,840
If you keep going down, there's this other one. I think the name of this is La Scala

777
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,920
I could be wrong though, but here's some like

778
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:23,600
Showgirl gophers there's tons of animals in this show, but a lot of them are

779
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,400
Gophers and gophers with full

780
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,720
human female

781
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:33,800
proportions often very scantily clad kind of like it's this is in this case, they look very

782
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:40,080
You know Brazilian dancer, I guess big headdresses and kind of sparkly bras

783
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,040
You got kind of a Miss Piggy, but way taller in an elegant gown

784
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,540
Here you've got out there. He looks like another character, of course

785
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:56,520
The king yes, this is the king. We've talked about the it was he a rocker fire

786
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,960
Cast away somewhere in Chuck E. Cheese world. There is a an Elvis dog

787
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:09,200
Is this a dog he there's he like a mountain lion? What is he this character looks like a lion?

788
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,280
Yeah, I think

789
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,400
But anyway, these are these were all in the park at the same time and then let me show you one more of these

790
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,920
Sexy gophers. I don't I don't feel great about this one. This is very

791
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,440
Can-can like Mulan Rouge

792
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,120
Hey Velco

793
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:37,720
Here's what okay, so obviously we know now I'm completely comfortable with any kind of sexuality now

794
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,720
It's no you were at the end of the series

795
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,760
You've made the full transformation fully comfortable with every anything. We're almost anything

796
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,040
I will say though. Let me let me approach this from where I would have been a month ago

797
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:55,760
This half gopher half lady has like realistic skin

798
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:04,320
Yeah, very smooth. She's wearing furry like a bikini and she has a female human female body

799
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,040
with no fur

800
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,720
realistic skin

801
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:14,840
very like in a real like cabaret like kind of sexy pose and if I had

802
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,600
Hostile eggs you can't see in this current view

803
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:22,400
I know that she is wearing bottoms, but you can't see them in this in this view that I'm showing

804
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,120
And if I hadn't gone through all this character development, I would think this is creepy as hell

805
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,680
But but in but currently

806
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,440
I love it. I love that this sexy lady gopher is out there doing her thing

807
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:42,440
Celebrating herself and her body. I'm so comfortable with this now, but a month ago

808
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,960
I would say whoever built this has some issues

809
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,520
Would you?

810
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,520
So would you hit this?

811
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,120
Look

812
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,460
Would I if you're asking would I make love to this half gopher half woman?

813
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:07,040
Let me I'd really need to break this down from an exercise is this an actual just gopher or is this truly half woman half gopher?

814
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,840
You know what I'm saying like I think that might actually play into it because if it's like a

815
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:18,320
Woman with a little gopher then that's that seems perhaps ethical

816
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:23,880
But if it's just a gopher that's like sexy, I don't think I don't think that's him

817
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,800
I don't think that's ethical at all

818
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:33,640
Well, she's singing which is something that people can't do or perhaps already people can do I had a reverse people could certainly sing

819
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,000
Gophers typically cannot so her having the will to sing

820
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:44,920
Implies that she is more human and has more of a human brain because of like it's just like a lady who went to a dr

821
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,980
Moreau island and got a gopher face

822
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:54,320
Then I'm like, yeah, let's go. Let's hit the town like you'll you'll take a nice break

823
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,060
You'll take a short break with a niece with her, you know

824
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,720
This is just my gopher niece

825
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,240
my niece

826
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,320
This is just my niece who's a gopher lady

827
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,040
Very common a lot of people have nieces on people have nieces who are half gopher

828
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:14,560
Yeah, so I think I think we would have to fully understand what's going on here

829
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:18,480
But if it's a doctor island of dr. Moreau situation that I think I'm on board

830
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,400
So

831
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,400
you would need some kind of

832
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,360
What's the the 23 and me with like you need?

833
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:35,320
Ancestry DNA sort of thing to find out what percentage gopher is it some percentage?

834
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,920
It's at least five if this sexy gopher would swab her cheek and send it away

835
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:47,240
Then I could understand exactly what's going on here if she was for instance just a

836
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:54,880
Lady gopher a real gopher that was maybe like came in contact with some sort of wizard and the wizard changed the gopher just into

837
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,880
This giant lady version then it's no way

838
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:05,020
Absolutely not that is just a gopher that was enchanted by a wizard and I will not take this gopher on a date

839
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,920
That is if it was a wizard involvement. No way

840
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,280
I am this you're implying a scenario where

841
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,680
This gopher woman is I mean, I don't know this for sure

842
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,880
But it seems like this is gonna take a while to do all this stuff

843
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,880
It seems like she's willing to wait for you

844
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,640
Well, he's into you and she whatever it takes if this all plays out over three months if it means

845
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,200
Making sweet love to newly

846
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,880
Liberated the European Mike and it's worth it. Look I I appreciate her way

847
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,480
Waiting for me and I think she'll actually

848
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:47,760
Respects that I want to take the time to figure out what's going on here

849
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,160
so

850
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:56,760
This were all a monologue, you know boys to men kind of you know, like this would you you're laying out all the steps

851
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,480
girl

852
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:05,520
Let's I want to make love but first it's got to be right. Let me just get a swab girl

853
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,520
Let me get a swab of that girl. Let me see how much gopher you are

854
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:16,360
What's the percentage was there a mad scientist that worked on a lady and made her have a gopher face if that's the case

855
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,120
Then I'm in but I have to know for sure girl

856
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:25,640
I've been dreaming about you ever since I saw you sitting on a carousel horse in that German

857
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:33,000
Cabaret show. Oh, but here's the thing if a wizard was involved. I'm out no offense

858
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,640
We can have our fantasies, but we can't make them reality

859
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,400
if a wizard involved

860
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:45,120
Girl, you just took a DNA test turns out it's a hundred percent gopher. So that deal is off

861
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,840
100% that gopher

862
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,160
Go scurry away to your hole

863
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:02,520
You don't belong up here above the soil it was nice to meet you though. Well, I will always have the fantasy though

864
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Here have some kibbles

865
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:14,680
Put some caterpillars in your hole for you. Have a nice day long. It's just about feeding caterpillars to a gopher

866
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,400
the

867
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,360
These strangest slow jam ever recorded

868
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,000
So you can see that there used to be able to

869
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,880
Yeah years ago. Um, do you guys have any?

870
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,520
any favorites

871
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,480
Legacy attractions stumbled across Oh legacy. Oh, okay

872
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:41,920
Well from any time well any just want Ozzy land favorites the one thing immediately that I'm

873
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,180
Excited about is mouse or shock a lot. Yeah

874
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,040
yeah

875
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:51,400
which is we I made reference to this, you know, this is a

876
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,240
Ripoff of the ride vehicle from Toy Story Midway Mania

877
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,240
It's the exact same

878
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,080
double-sided the way the

879
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:08,560
The little podiums whatever you want to call it the little front part and the little the weapon lower down on dia

880
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:14,480
There's a little ball and a pole on the back of it and you shoot at a 3d screen and instead of it

881
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,200
Just being these weird little cannons on Toy Story. It's like

882
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,080
What do you call these things the the frosting question?

883
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,160
They stress

884
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,720
Pastry bags full which I as a child I always was very fascinated and by these pastry bags

885
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,720
I would imagine Jason you as well

886
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,320
Mm-hmm. You can make them folks

887
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,620
You can make them real easy at home if you got ziploc bags

888
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:43,120
You just cut one of the corners off you got your own homemade pastry bag right there. Have you done it? I

889
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,320
Had to do it for like yeah with some school projects, I think

890
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:54,120
Hmm I did it cuz it was also a way to like do it he said or like decorative like

891
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,880
Paints and stuff the same idea. Yeah

892
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:05,040
So you kept it around at home you just you fill it up with frosting once a month and oh after school snack, too

893
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,760
You know those AP classes you need that sugar boost

894
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:18,240
This will this ride and I don't know I don't know if this is accurate reminded me of like Mouse Hunt the Nathan Lane movie

895
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:24,680
Yeah, they're like just because it's about mice but something about the sort of surreal

896
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,480
Aesthetic of it as well cuz like you the 3d

897
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:34,400
Film element is that you're shooting at like mice that are trying to eat sweets and

898
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,200
You fight them by squirting more chocolate at them, right?

899
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:46,480
Which seems like questionable like you would only enticing them to stay they want that chocolate

900
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,880
So the logic of this side they seem to just

901
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:57,360
From the events of the ride they seem to just fight back like it like Jason prepping for an AP test

902
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,480
It only makes them stronger, right?

903
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,160
The graphics not as good as Toy Story Midway mania. No

904
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,200
But there's a style to it and I don't hate I don't hate it. I don't think it looks horrible

905
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,000
It's fun

906
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,920
There's a very fun little pre-show with a CGI kind of eggy man with a curly q mustache

907
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,440
and then he transitions into live-action and

908
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,960
He's got a big fake Santa belly

909
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,960
So when he sits in the vehicle and tries to pull the thing down in front of him

910
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,120
He has a little bit of trouble has a little trouble squeezing in there. There's a lot of whim Z

911
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,680
There's like the office. There's the office section, which is fun

912
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,720
with like a

913
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,360
tired owner of the I

914
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,320
Guess is that what he is? Do you know I'm talking about?

915
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Wait, what is is?

916
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,760
Is this a

917
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:54,280
Kitchen or a restaurant that's being taken over by these mice and is he the owner of that?

918
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,960
I think I think I don't know the specific

919
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:01,880
I think that's what's happening because he's in like an office and it's very like cluttered and he's very like he's you know

920
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,880
He's stressed out because of all the mice

921
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,040
And he's showing you how to work the

922
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:13,320
Frosting whatever I can already forgot the name of what is it frosting a street bag a street a street bag. Thank you

923
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,400
Yes, he's showing you to work your pastry bag

924
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:21,960
So I think yeah, this is great. This is I think great original yes

925
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,760
It's cheaper certainly than Midway mania, but it's it's definitely its own thing

926
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,280
They they figured out and

927
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,800
Though you might call it a ripoff

928
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,680
It would the ride vehicles were built by the same company as Midway mania

929
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,440
It's a Dutch company called ETF ride systems, so they

930
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,040
Betrayed Disney they went behind their backs and gave them the same

931
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:54,000
Vehicle they also were behind the mechanics of the actual ride vehicles not the creative but the vehicles

932
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,360
For one of the best rides in podcast thread history nights and white satin. Oh, right

933
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,400
Yeah, what a history for ETF ride system

934
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:09,720
It's interesting though like that Disney didn't have an exclusivity with this because I think that happens a lot and that happened with

935
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,960
Universal and the Harry Potter ride with the Kuka arm where they have that ride system

936
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,360
Exclusively for like ten years there's probably different terms of the agreement

937
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,920
So it is interesting maybe this was sort of developed even before Midway mania

938
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,700
And they kind of bought it off the shelf in a way

939
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,840
But it would seem that Disney would want to own something like this for a while

940
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:35,400
Because you wouldn't think that like week if we had a theme park or if you know Jeff Dunham or Terry fader wanted to do

941
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,040
Their own version they could have done it immediately in

942
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,240
2011 which is when I think this ride opened

943
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,820
2011 right right yeah, yeah, so pretty far after Ratatouille the movie Ratatouille

944
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,120
It's also about rodents in a restaurant

945
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,120
Mm-hmm. I mean it's not so far away from a to in 2011

946
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:02,560
Well so this is this kind of has the I was thinking how a lot of the rides here have little equations

947
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,560
and this is kind of

948
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:11,760
Midway mania plus Ratatouille, and there's a number of other ones that are similar where it is

949
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:17,360
This plus this I don't know if you want to throw in a multiplied by or divided by

950
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,600
Yeah, I don't know how complicated these equations are but there's

951
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,480
That's that's the formula. I feel like I love a lot of fontazza land rights

952
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,520
Yes a good example, I think of

953
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:33,600
The x plus y ride formula is a ride that is not there anymore

954
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,320
called silver mine and

955
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,520
This is basically

956
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:45,180
Maybe you have to do percentages here. Maybe this is like one fifth

957
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,000
Knott's Berry farm. What's the mine one?

958
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:57,360
To Timber Mountain alaco no or a timber mountain to my log, right? Yeah, not the not the flume

959
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,360
What's the other one? Oh?

960
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,800
Calico mine ride

961
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,240
Okay, all right

962
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,720
Okay, so it's part that because it's like miserable claustrophobic

963
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,640
You're seeing animatronics in really small spaces

964
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:18,680
And you feel like you could reach out and slap them or if you stuck your hand out

965
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:22,560
It would get dragged by the rock wall behind you and eventually just come clean off

966
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:28,360
But then it takes this turn that you don't expect at all because it's called mine

967
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:34,480
It's silver mine and then so then four fifths of the way through you leave the mine you go upstairs

968
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:41,480
And you crawl up to a an area that you'd have to call pirates of the Caribbean plus Mexico

969
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:48,840
It's really weird it just completely is the vibe of pirates and you're in a little Mexican town

970
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,440
And it's got

971
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:57,240
Something I want to codify. I think you know we like fake rocks, and I want to say I think we also like cloth fire

972
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:04,200
Let's just does it's not a lot of examples of it, but probably one of them and this ride is one of them as well

973
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,720
Yes, it's on is it in a spaceship Earth as well

974
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,060
I think there might be some cloth fire. I don't recall a fan

975
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:17,480
I want to say maybe it's a small world and little in miniature

976
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:23,680
That's right. Yeah, interesting. Let's say this here now. We podcast red likes cloth fire

977
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,720
I bet there's more cloth fire than we think

978
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:31,820
Yeah, I think if you had it now that we've put a name on it, and we're on the hunt for it

979
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,360
I think we'll start seeing it more at a new innovation is

980
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,680
Steam fire

981
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:43,040
We use fire like on Big Thunder Mountain. Oh you project on to steam

982
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:49,760
Yeah, turn the steam into fire exactly and then they already have sort of had that effect on the Indiana Jones in Japan

983
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:56,960
When you go that blows the ring yeah, yeah, so so steam fire as well of a big were big fans of I think

984
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,880
Also a fan of steam fire. Yeah, yeah, we I guess you could call it all

985
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:07,200
Fake fire, but you do need to delineate between the two and maybe there might be multiple multiple types

986
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,360
Well, we'll figure it out multiple types. Yeah, yeah

987
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:15,760
Anyway, this ride is crazy. People should watch ride throughs of it. It's just like I

988
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:22,440
It's so much of the vibe of pirates almost impressive that you could take you could capture the

989
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:29,480
Elements of what pirates is despite moving it over to a different theme in this case a little Mexican village because it's debauchery

990
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,840
It's you know it is it's things on fire

991
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:40,320
It's antics with the animals that are too close to houses as a woman chasing a donkey out with a broom

992
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:49,500
There is even in this ride literally a dirty foot pirate you go under a bridge and there is a guy

993
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:56,820
With a bottle up there swinging around and you pass right under his foot. They do it all it's really the difference is it's like

994
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:01,540
Mashing up versus like ripoff. It's like a girl talk

995
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,220
version of a mashup where it's like

996
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:10,580
Yeah, the all the elements kind of work I can see where they rip and this is exactly the same thing as this thing

997
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:14,740
But they've now recontextualized it and I can't be mad. This is kind of cool

998
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:22,500
And they did it there at least it feels at least a half the budget like maybe not more than that and they're jankier

999
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:29,060
Animatronics for sure they do less. We're not even close to Jack Sparrow territory, but I don't know

1000
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:32,540
I give I found this thing charming. Yeah, I

1001
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:39,020
Like all of the things I kind of find like they like it may made it work with the budget and

1002
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:44,460
I'm not mad at the ripoff. I can't be mad at the ripoff. Are we Jason you feel the same way?

1003
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,340
I don't know why it doesn't almost doesn't make sense that we were like

1004
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:52,100
For Universal Studios, but I kind of love that they just stole all this Disney stuff

1005
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:59,500
Yeah, well and honestly, it's enough of a trend that I thought you were setting up a

1006
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,620
Transition to a different ride to the ride

1007
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:06,860
Geist Geister, Iksha. Yeah

1008
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,460
Well, Rickshaw

1009
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:13,580
Yes, because the the literal translation is ghost

1010
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:18,180
Yes, cuz the the literal translation is ghostly Rickshaw

1011
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:25,300
Uh-huh, and this is very haunted mansion to the point of it appears to be doom buggy capsules a

1012
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,340
Ghost follows you home

1013
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:35,580
But the big big difference is that it appears to be as if Germans interpreted Chinese ghost stories

1014
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:41,660
Yeah, yes, because it's in the Chinatown section of the park. That's got the ride you were

1015
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,620
Discussing is in the Mexico section of the park

1016
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:51,340
The lands of course Mexico Chinatown mystery fantasy Berlin and deep in Africa

1017
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:57,820
Wow, you know the lands in this park is every theme park in Europe a nations of the world

1018
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,260
I feel like so many of them. This is what they do

1019
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:09,620
Yeah, it certainly seems that way. I I don't know why they felt the need to add deep in Africa that feels very

1020
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,100
Collodio

1021
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:16,260
But yeah from the format of all the other ones, you know, what are you?

1022
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:22,820
Also just naming two sections. It's like this is mystery and this is fantasy. Those are the lands gave up

1023
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,700
But yeah, the ghost ghostly Rickshaw I

1024
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:35,260
Is incredibly again another ride that's incredibly detailed like has similar elements from the haunted man. There's a big party scene

1025
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:38,100
Yeah, but again, it's it's

1026
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,940
Like Chinese ghosts and culture and architecture and

1027
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:51,620
Masks and it's and then they follow you home. Of course, they follow you home at the end. They have that set piece it is

1028
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:58,060
Just from the look of it and part of it is because it's not the most expensive ride, but it is scary as shit

1029
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,060
It is so creepy

1030
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:06,300
All of these things all of these little like a lot of the robots are like little which honestly makes it I think worse

1031
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:13,260
It almost like a storture view of reality and you're like little creepy guys. Yes, and

1032
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:17,660
It's like the skeleton. It's like a little skeletons and you're like, oh

1033
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:23,120
Like I there's a on their website. Is this one still open?

1034
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,820
I want to say it's still open because I feel like I saw something on there. Okay. Yeah

1035
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:32,460
They their official literature calls it Europe's longest underground ghost train

1036
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:39,340
Which seems like an attack on something else like is there a specific thing in Portugal or Finland?

1037
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:44,100
That's in their sights making some claim. That's like 500 feet shorter

1038
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:50,180
And they're like we're gonna stick to that ghost train. You are the second longest underground ghost train

1039
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:55,580
I mean, it's kind of it's not really a you're in the Omnimov or a haunted mansion vehicle. Not really a train

1040
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,300
Yeah, wouldn't say

1041
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,300
Say

1042
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:05,260
Might be like a European term instead of like haunted house. Maybe ghost train

1043
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:10,420
Mmm, I kept coming across that but maybe so the phrase train

1044
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:17,100
Yeah, both of these rides. We just talked about are really long. There's so many rooms

1045
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:21,540
There's so many animatronics. This is what I'm saying. I feel like this place has been

1046
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,220
hidden from us in terms of

1047
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:26,220
pure robot

1048
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:32,500
Coverage I would love to know the official number. I feel like you'd have to actually check with someone who knew I'm not gonna watch

1049
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,500
All the videos and do it count

1050
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,980
That's that sounds hard

1051
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:43,540
But I like it's crazy that I give them that's a lot of what we're after

1052
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:47,900
I think is robots as opposed to screens and oh my god so many

1053
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:51,980
Yeah, I was shocked as I outside of

1054
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:57,700
Yeah, I'm trying to think I don't think any other I mean it's more robots and universal

1055
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:03,660
Yeah, and for like all you like any you know any era of universal it feels like

1056
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:08,780
It's a little more limited in another attraction. That's not there anymore

1057
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:12,820
Called one thousand and one knocks

1058
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:15,820
like nights and

1059
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:17,060
I

1060
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:22,460
Mean the equation here, maybe let me just instead. Let me let me break it down like okay

1061
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,780
this is a ride where you

1062
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:27,580
climb on a

1063
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:31,420
suspended ship like Peter Pan

1064
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:34,300
Where you're where the track is up above you?

1065
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:38,500
But it starts in a fake rock cave like the Matterhorn

1066
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:42,500
And then you leave the cave and you spend a full minute outside

1067
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:46,820
Looking over other rides in a very storybook land

1068
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:52,420
Fashion but that whole time you're slowly approaching the mouth of a dragon

1069
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:57,820
And then you go inside the dragon where you're in a different scary type of cave

1070
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:00,980
It's more like mr. Toad hell where it's red scary caves

1071
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:08,260
And then you end up looking at a bunch of miniatures that are like the size of the Sleeping Beauty dioramas

1072
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,660
but the

1073
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,580
Miniatures are

1074
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:18,660
Telling stories of Arabian Nights kind of stuff it has a vibe a lot like the Sinbad ride

1075
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:25,580
In Disney see that's like five things all in one which is enough to make it completely its own

1076
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:29,900
Original thing this is a really cool ride. I think or was

1077
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:35,940
Yeah, it's like when you see those videos with Quentin Tarantino's references in his movies, and there's

1078
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,460
50 other movies and you go he's stealing a lot, but he's

1079
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:45,700
Taking them all and made a different thing out of him. I guess I'm in a blender. Yes exactly right

1080
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:51,380
I yeah, this this thing's cool as hell. I don't know I I just think they

1081
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,020
They took things to new levels

1082
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,940
I

1083
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:57,940
Don't know just just charm by this place

1084
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:04,580
Yeah, now some stuff is just there is one thing that is an exact photocopy

1085
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:10,220
In the sense that it ran at a lot of other parks and oddly enough

1086
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:13,460
This is not buried on the website this does get a decent

1087
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:19,300
Link on the attractions page. I'm talking about Pirates 4d

1088
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:23,980
Pirates 4d is a 4d movie

1089
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:29,780
Starring the great Leslie Nielsen and Monty Python's Eric Idol

1090
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:35,980
Theme park legend Eric Idol also theme park legend Eric Idol, yeah and

1091
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:44,140
So I looked a little into the make so this was produced by Bush Entertainment Corporation the

1092
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:48,460
Entertainment wing of the anheuser-bush company back in the 90s

1093
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:53,140
Who of course at the time ran bush gardens and SeaWorld at the moment?

1094
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:57,580
I believe just bush gardens, but they produced this string of

1095
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:02,420
4d movies that would just play almost on a circuit of

1096
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:10,460
It would play at bush gardens and SeaWorld places, and then they'd license it to other places movies like haunts of the old country and

1097
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,580
something I am very interested in

1098
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:20,740
Not least of which because of the people involved RL. Stein's haunted lighthouse a

1099
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:24,220
40 movie starring Christopher Lloyd

1100
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,660
Huh?

1101
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:32,400
Rick written and those are in Christopher Lloyd Leah Thompson and Michael McKeon whoa

1102
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,100
so I

1103
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:42,940
That one we might have to dig into a little more. Yeah, we haven't done any of these lesser more overlooked

1104
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,340
theme park 3d

1105
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:51,040
Yeah, cuz every now and then people do I believe I saw either Pirates 4d at bush gardens Williamsburg

1106
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,460
But I'm pretty sure I saw haunts of the old country

1107
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:59,000
But they would just like they they spent a chunk of money to make these movies with like

1108
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:06,580
You know big stars in them. I believe pirates 4d also played the Wisconsin Dells Michael mm-hmm

1109
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:09,920
I believe Eric Idle wrote Pirates 4d I

1110
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:14,340
Think that's possible. I believe I read that I could be

1111
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:19,520
RL. Stein's haunted lighthouse was directed by Joe Dante

1112
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,960
Yeah, that's that we just covered

1113
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:26,780
Were you building to that fact? I'm sorry if I jumped on it well

1114
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:34,740
I another one interesting to me the writer of haunted lighthouse is Sam Ham the writer of Tim Burton's Batman

1115
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:38,420
Crazy

1116
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:45,060
Run of Batman comics that introduced the harrick character of Henry Ducard

1117
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:52,300
Batman's mentor that I believe let Liam Neeson plays for some of Batman begins well you yeah

1118
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,180
He's not really it's a fake out. He's not really a fake out

1119
01:26:55,180 --> 01:27:01,700
Yeah, I'll go as they say even though I always thought it was racial ghoul because of the animated series, but that's another podcast

1120
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:08,140
Yeah, that's another podcast. Yeah, so so there's some interesting stuff in the Bush Entertainment Corporation

1121
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:13,340
Pipeline we got a that's a full we got to do all of them. Yeah

1122
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:17,000
And pirate the yeah, go ahead. Go ahead

1123
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:23,960
Well I was gonna say the other thing about Pirates 4d the plot is one of the grimace things I've ever heard

1124
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,680
Yes, do tell so

1125
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,240
Leslie Nielsen is the captain of a pirate ship and right at the beginning

1126
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:37,740
He says ah I have not returned to pirate island in five years and as they arrive on pirate island

1127
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:39,760
They start falling into like comical

1128
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:46,920
You know slapsticky traps, and it is revealed the previous crew of this ship was left to

1129
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:54,880
die on pirate Island and the survivor was a child who has laid all of these traps to get his

1130
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:00,040
Revenge and in the end ends up becoming the new captain of the ship

1131
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,560
Captain Davey

1132
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:07,240
It's a child's revenge. It's a home alone pirates

1133
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:13,040
Yeah, because they wanted a lot of antics. I mean it's a lot of like cannonball shot at the screen

1134
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,080
door hitting people

1135
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:23,520
Flying Leslie Nielsen flinging a door open and hitting someone in the head sure sure but if home alone at an extremely dark

1136
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,080
backstory

1137
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,080
like if the if the

1138
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,080
You know sloppy bandits. What are they the wet band?

1139
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,960
Sloppy band is good too

1140
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,760
What else are they called?

1141
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:44,200
Yeah, what are they aren't they the the feathery bandits the guitar to bandits?

1142
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:49,240
Why am I having a problem people are this is another one are yelling wet bandits in which one?

1143
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,360
They're the first one the wet bandits

1144
01:28:53,760 --> 01:29:00,880
Sticky sticky sticky band. Yeah, all right. I got it. I did the yelling for the odds. Yeah

1145
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:08,280
Huh pirates for D. I mean yeah this when you look at this wiki this was open in bizarre

1146
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:16,720
Locations across the world across different theme park brands from SeaWorld the bush gardens to the Luxor

1147
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,520
And now it seems like it is only open in

1148
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:23,400
Fantasia land on Tosy land now the exclusive home of this

1149
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,080
proud work of Eric Idle I

1150
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,280
assume I

1151
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,200
Watched most of this Jason. Did you watch most of it? I watched the whole yeah

1152
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:42,140
Like 15 minutes as my I mean I will say Eric Idle theme park legend, but is he attached to the most unpleasant

1153
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,880
Theme park things that exist I

1154
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,880
Liked it as a kid yeah, I

1155
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,720
It's not it's not no

1156
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:54,960
It's it's not that bad

1157
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:00,920
And it doesn't think it looks like they spent some money on it like that's that's the thing it seems like

1158
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,120
The theme park Wars of the 90s it does seem like

1159
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:11,800
Bush garden SeaWorld was like trying to compete a little with these 4d movies, but also

1160
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,240
There's a brief period of time where Dave and Buster's had 4d theaters

1161
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:20,200
And they would probably just shove them in there if they paid for the licensing you know

1162
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:25,140
I guess it's just because Eric poor Eric has an association with figment

1163
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,880
That's yeah

1164
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:34,400
The audience which I like but is also you you might you wouldn't be wrong to call parts of it unpleasant at least

1165
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:38,320
Yeah, then as a kid I was scared of it and then but I do people do like that

1166
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,320
So I really shouldn't tar and feather a title here

1167
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:50,280
Oh certainly yeah, I'm flipping through his filmography also, and I'm reminded that he is a recurring character

1168
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:57,480
Throughout the film that this series is titled after national lampoon's European vacation

1169
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,960
As I recall his part is funny. He's a guy riding a bike. Oh, yeah, yeah by

1170
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,880
Chevy that being said just I just want to give a quick

1171
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:12,600
His anti shout-outs to that film we titled it after I don't know if you guys agree

1172
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,000
I think that is such an unpleasant movie

1173
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:21,920
Like the eating nightmare at the beginning and the fashion montage or that song new looks

1174
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:30,360
You've been down a street for am I crazy I like I had a discussion with our friend Ryan Perez who called that a rotten film

1175
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:42,200
Am I crazy that bear I haven't you're you know that I'm saying seen it in years, but I that feeling is correct

1176
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:45,440
I think seeing when I was younger. I definitely like felt it was very unpleasant

1177
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:51,120
There's stuff I obviously the Eric Otto stuff is a funny runner because he's like very polite every time he gets hit

1178
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:56,100
Yeah, that's all that's all funny. I like his and like the game show John Aston game show

1179
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,960
Traffic, so we've talked about John Aston this week too because he was that's right

1180
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:05,280
Still alive teaching teaching theater

1181
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,480
Him on I'd love the parking enough. I mean whatever

1182
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:18,440
There's no reason not to have Eric Idle and John Aston both on but the only reason is a lack of ability to get a hold of

1183
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:21,480
Yeah, it's the biggest obstacle

1184
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,480
anyway, not to dwell on that if I'm wrong, please yell at me and

1185
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,400
Cancel me but not permanently

1186
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,320
You can cancel me for a day

1187
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:39,960
What else weird stuff oh oh in that neck of the woods, you know the movies that slid in and out

1188
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:43,000
So I don't think they have it anymore

1189
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:49,240
But for a while this is one of the other theme parks that has a very Epcot esque gold geodesic dome

1190
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,280
It's like half of a spaceship Earth essentially

1191
01:32:53,360 --> 01:33:00,360
Which I always like seeing those anywhere, and I was never sure what was inside them the monk the monkey hosted video

1192
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,320
That I watched

1193
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:07,560
Has a funny moment where it it shows you the dome and it says and in here you can see

1194
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:15,440
Cine 2000 and then it cuts to Cine 2000 and it's imagine if you were in the if you're in LA the

1195
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:21,280
Arclet the Cinerama dome and you were standing on the floor of the Cinerama dome

1196
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:26,120
Just watching a video of the POV of a roller coaster and everybody goes ah

1197
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,720
It's just the weirdest lowest rent like a

1198
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:36,720
Simulator, but it's a simulator where you just stand. I think you get dizzy so fast. This seems like the laziest thing

1199
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:40,280
Let's just play a video of a roller coaster instead of building one

1200
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:46,880
But then they put in something that I think has a little more value an attraction called race for Atlantis

1201
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,480
Which I think we could just touch on and maybe deal with later

1202
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:56,880
Because race for Atlantis is the same movie that played in an IMAX theater in Caesar's Palace in the mall

1203
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,200
shops at Caesar

1204
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:04,340
If you've been to that mall you know that there is a show where a bunch of statues come to life

1205
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:10,580
And that's called called fall of Atlantis, but that's just part of the story the rest of the story was told through this

1206
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:13,420
simulator attraction which

1207
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:17,400
I saw a poster for that said

1208
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:22,620
The IMAX 3d ride that makes every other thrill ride obsolete

1209
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:26,980
Very bold claim

1210
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:31,540
Very especially when this thing itself is obsolete

1211
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:37,140
It has not been at Caesar's for a long time it made it at Fantasia land from 94 to 2016

1212
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:39,420
And now I think this dome is gone entirely

1213
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:46,780
I think we should loop back around to this one because the I think aesthetically it's very interesting from what I watched

1214
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:53,460
I it's a it's a very it feels like Flight of Passage meets Star Wars prequels

1215
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:57,980
It's a very like odd fantasy design scheme

1216
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,980
And I'm also intrigued because it has a villain named

1217
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,100
Gastelius

1218
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:10,400
And I would I would like to know more about Gastelius, but we could do that as part of some Vegas block

1219
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:17,260
Oh, yeah, it was here, too, and still open in France. I believe so it's still still hanging on but yeah race for Atlantis

1220
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:18,460
I'd love to

1221
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:20,860
Dig into more yeah, that sounds great

1222
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:25,680
I'd like to talk about while we're talking the magic of the movies

1223
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:33,260
I mean the website invites us to rediscover some old classics on an attraction called Hollywood tour. Yeah

1224
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:36,280
I mean this is the star of the show

1225
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:43,740
I think this is this might be the fiesta resistance of this this park look does it have some maybe some of the best

1226
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:49,620
Rollercoasters in the world. Yes sure that of course how many parts can you say that about?

1227
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:56,820
But Hollywood tour seems like something special well, and I would describe this equation as

1228
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,620
Great movie ride

1229
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:05,780
Plus universal tram tour plus Pirates of the Caribbean again

1230
01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:12,720
Even though we already have pirate rip-offs. Maybe we have a pirate's rip-off and we pirates 4d

1231
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:14,820
This one is yet another

1232
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:17,980
Pirate sea ride, but it's weird they splinter everything off

1233
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:24,000
So the the town and the drunkenness and the fires and the revelry is moved over to silver mine

1234
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:27,660
This right now just uses the caves

1235
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,780
Essentially it starts in the caves

1236
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:37,100
They're more well, it's and it's also a mix of the rainbow caverns which is now attributed at the start of Big Thunder

1237
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,560
It's all of that at the same time because it's the Pirates caves

1238
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,940
But they're now like rainbow much like that scene at the end the hill lift on Big Thunder

1239
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:47,700
Absolutely and

1240
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:53,020
And a lot of these elements also show up in a different ride in this park called Chiapas

1241
01:36:53,100 --> 01:37:00,340
Which is an incredibly steep log flume that ends in like an Aztec temple where it appears a

1242
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,660
Party is happening

1243
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,660
It's like yeah, that ride looks great

1244
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:07,180
Yeah, yeah, it's it's like a

1245
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:11,100
Guy I saw it on their site as a Mexican archaeological site

1246
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:14,380
So I think you're you know, they're digging for artifacts or something

1247
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:21,340
But then there are a bunch of statues or busts that all light up with lighting effects and music and that's a ride that like

1248
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:24,640
It has a backward section and then flips around to go

1249
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:27,460
Front-facing again like the Norway ride

1250
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:30,740
steepest log flume in the world in the world

1251
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:36,500
Yeah, it's got kind of that double bounce like the Dudley do right ride that right that looks just

1252
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:39,020
Legitimately

1253
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:43,700
Fantastic as does River Quest just to give that a shout. This looks like a

1254
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:45,900
pretty unique

1255
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:50,460
Rapids ride where you know, most rapids rides are sort of rustic or it's you know

1256
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:52,860
It through it's through the forests or you know

1257
01:37:53,660 --> 01:38:00,940
Cedar kind of area this is like you're in some scary tower and there's a big cyclone on the top of a building and there's

1258
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:06,100
An elevator that delivers you to a drop like again just super unique

1259
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:08,780
These water rides seem really awesome

1260
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:15,540
Yeah, I didn't want to take away don't want to take away from from Hollywood tour Hollywood tour. Yeah, which has a

1261
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,100
also

1262
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:25,260
What I would describe is a plus up from pirates where clearly the drop is based on pirates and you go into a cavern right after

1263
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:29,660
But as you're barreling down the drop you're heading towards a wall of water

1264
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:34,660
And it moves out of the way at the very last second before you land

1265
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:40,980
Like if they put that in today in our pirates you'd say that's great. That's a huge improvement

1266
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:47,360
Yeah, that is and even if they like I guess I mean there are different colors in the rocks

1267
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:51,660
I was gonna say if they made the little more colorful rocks, you wouldn't be mad either. I don't think

1268
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,100
Yeah, you can light that up. That'd be cool

1269
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:58,780
Yeah, that is a that is a neat little trick. It's much better than the now gone

1270
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:02,500
But they do tell tales with seeing

1271
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:04,620
You know

1272
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:08,780
Blackbeard or Davy Joe it would switch every now and then yeah, it's usually Davy Jones

1273
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:12,420
But then they threw Blackbeard on for like the fourth movie, which we just watched and

1274
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:18,220
It's really like you got Ian McShane and like you're not gonna use him that much. Okay. All right movie

1275
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:24,940
Hmm, very strange. I don't think I think there's things about the refresh that I like fine

1276
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:28,380
But that's not one of that always felt very

1277
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:32,940
Plotty it felt like let me let's just like stamp some exposition

1278
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:38,820
You mean the the barber the addition of the miss and do tells it. Yeah, it sucks

1279
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:42,740
It's like we have to like re-explain and

1280
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:48,580
It's like that's God. That's like of all the things to take out. I think that's the thing to take out

1281
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:51,740
Oh, yeah, and the new thing they put in is a nice little fun

1282
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,500
thing

1283
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:59,740
Great illusion, I was probably done pretty cheaply but still pretty effective and does a little

1284
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:05,180
Narrative kind of explanation sort of of what is going on in the ride

1285
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:08,720
Yeah, which I actually helps easy in the world. Yeah

1286
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:15,940
Yeah, super cool, but pirates I think might still rank behind Hollywood tour as the best

1287
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:19,660
cavern born boat ride cuz

1288
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:25,820
Unlike all right, so you're in caverns and you know, do you go see some skeletons and some ships and stuff?

1289
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:32,540
No, you see a lot of nothing for a while and then you see a 1950s film crew making a movie

1290
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:38,560
It's so weird it's why are we in caves for this?

1291
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:44,020
Yeah, yeah is I don't know is the cave is supposed to be a set. Oh

1292
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:52,140
I mean I think at some point you you go on to a set like the big one with the big thing that like

1293
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:58,180
Stuck out to me and I forget if it's a first or second scene you see but you come around the corner

1294
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:04,980
There was a helicopter going up and down then there's a cowboy shooting a gun then over to the left

1295
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:10,740
There is like a film crew and then you straight ahead. There is a giant spider

1296
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:15,440
So it's a cowboy shooting a gun at a giant spider

1297
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:22,060
I have no idea what the helicopter is doing did John Peters have something to do with this ride is my question

1298
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:24,300
It's the scariest

1299
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,380
Villain a giant spider scariest bad guy

1300
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:31,500
In the scariest killer in the animal kingdom. Mmm. Yeah, there's cowboys

1301
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:39,900
Talking about Kevin Smith has a story about John Peters the producer trying to get a giant spider into a Superman movie and eventually

1302
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,800
He got a giant spider into Wild Wild West

1303
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:49,060
Which was yeah robot spider and if you want to hear that story take 25 minutes and have the words

1304
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,500
Fuck and flick a bunch more. That's right

1305
01:41:56,580 --> 01:42:01,820
What else say speaking of directors right at the top of it you see a really miserable

1306
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:08,580
Dead looking Alfred Hitchcock. Is that what that's supposed to be? I had that written so yeah

1307
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:11,420
Um, I don't know he's a

1308
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:20,300
And there's no other IP per se it's not like this is then a great movie ride where you see Marilyn Monroe and

1309
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:27,020
Cary Grant I think the only sort of recognizable one is Hitchcock who seems like he's at the moment of dying

1310
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:30,480
Like you were at frame one of a heart attack

1311
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:35,300
Well, that's the most exciting frame. I think it's about to start

1312
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:38,140
You don't know what's happening

1313
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:40,660
His eyes lit up. Here we go

1314
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:43,300
I will say with all of these rides

1315
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:47,400
I'm sure when if you go on them, I think if we were to go on all of them in person

1316
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:55,640
We would notice the junkier elements more because some like there's a fully exposed industrial ceiling a lot in this ride and a lot

1317
01:42:55,640 --> 01:43:03,900
Of other rides when the boat is like turning a corner. There's just like some loose dirty pipes and clearly like like water damaged

1318
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:06,060
walls

1319
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:08,060
That are pretty visible pipes

1320
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:12,340
The pipes in the walls for the sad man from the end of the sad man. We got some

1321
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:16,220
We got some for proud design choice

1322
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:18,220
Yeah

1323
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:24,220
You you see it. There's a Tarzan section much like the great movie ride as

1324
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:26,740
then

1325
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:33,900
Then you see a boat and then as you pass around the corner you see rising over it the the great ape King Kong

1326
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:38,340
King Kong is also in this so it's the King Kong and this kind of a jaws

1327
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:43,700
At the beginning. Yes. Yeah, there's a quick shark there. There's um

1328
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:47,020
my favorite thing a a

1329
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:51,340
Alligator pulling a water skiing monkey

1330
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:59,780
That's pretty fun. That's in the that's in the Tarzan section here. I'll show you I just really

1331
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:03,380
Really enjoyed this

1332
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,740
He's pulling the monkey

1333
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:13,180
There's another month the monkey above has a like a carrot on a stick or something that's making the Gators swim around

1334
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:17,180
That's that rules. That's great. Yeah

1335
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:23,380
That for I love that Frankenstein. There's Frankenstein's Frankenstein's monster on the on the

1336
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:26,060
trip it's a slab

1337
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:29,060
which honestly is like one of the all like very

1338
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:31,940
worried about

1339
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:34,820
Not getting that Universal epic universe

1340
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:40,780
Horror land now because they're probably gonna build that park in Orlando or it's gonna take a while

1341
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:46,820
So maybe this is the best representation of Frankenstein we have because the rumor was it was gonna be Frankenstein's castle in a crazy

1342
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:48,460
E ticket maybe kook arm

1343
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:53,540
That's also a roller coaster ride with all the monsters and you'd finally get some insane

1344
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:59,860
Classic Universal monster thing but until then we'll have to just go to Germany to experience Frankenstein

1345
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:05,760
Well for a while the title was held by Frankenstein playing a keytar or whatever in the Beetlejuice

1346
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,580
Graveyard review right but yes

1347
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:15,980
Not for that's not a ride. So I guess if we're talking ride depictions of Frankenstein, right? It'd be this movie

1348
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,500
Are we okay? Is it?

1349
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:25,300
Are we touring an underground movie? So are we touring the movie mines? Is that what it is?

1350
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:31,740
Or is this like a magic cave where all your movie dreams come to light

1351
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:38,900
What what is it? Hmm? I think from what I understand is this park has very limited space

1352
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:46,800
So they have built the longer dark rides underground underneath other attractions. Oh, yeah, this is under another ride

1353
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:51,760
That's right. Yeah, there's a basement literally a flooded now

1354
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:53,180
I

1355
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:57,180
Cannot find a justification for why the generic Wizard of Oz scene

1356
01:45:57,700 --> 01:46:01,740
Appears to imply that Alice's house in Kansas is in the woods

1357
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:06,340
And all of our friends are at the house too

1358
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:10,060
It's just kind of a lot of elements of Wizard of Oz just thrown together

1359
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:13,580
the video is a little hard to parse but

1360
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:18,420
Is there I feel like I only saw Glinda and not a door

1361
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:24,740
There's a scarecrow and a Glinda Dorothy on the porch like on the side

1362
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:30,100
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking through the YouTube right here. I think there is a side of the porch

1363
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:34,380
You see her kind of when you first come in but it's not she's not like pointed

1364
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:39,740
There's if you were the main show scene is looking head-on at the building and she's not looking out that way

1365
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:41,740
She's on the porch looking off

1366
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:46,960
This is not Dorothy. This is Dana Dana American farm girl

1367
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:52,440
Anyone could wear a dress like that. What are you referring to straw man?

1368
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:55,640
They are sapphire

1369
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:57,960
Dana

1370
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:03,080
Mr. Ape the gorilla teeth the shark all of your Hollywood favorites

1371
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:08,400
This is the one thing where it's like, all right, you know, not at the license for any of this crap. Okay, that's fine

1372
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,520
You got one you got one. You're a

1373
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,200
senior swinger

1374
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,520
That's not Tarzan

1375
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:19,080
King Kong had the fake King Kong has some very funny eyebrows

1376
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,480
You know

1377
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:27,740
I don't recall his eyebrows. Oh, okay. Hold on. Yeah one second. I want to make sure you see his eyebrows

1378
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,740
I want to know that they're funny

1379
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,760
Yeah, they're fine waiting to laugh

1380
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:37,560
Yo, you'll laugh I put you on the spot. I'm sorry. I don't want to miss out on these eyebrows. You see

1381
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:42,120
Yeah, it's bogged on from breaking bad

1382
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,280
Yeah

1383
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:51,400
They're like two feet tall by these proportions and also like his pecs are very strange

1384
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:57,680
Well, he's like you look like yeah, he looks like he love his like pectoral

1385
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:04,520
He looks like he fell asleep on the beach wearing a bikini top. Yes left some tan marks

1386
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:10,960
Yeah, I guess and that also implies that if when King Kong tans that it changes the

1387
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:15,720
Darkness of his hair. Well, I think maybe the hair looks like it's like a bad die

1388
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:19,160
Situation oh that's revealing what's underneath?

1389
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:26,680
Yeah, he looks like maybe he's like either gray or balding or something and he did like a really bad like shoe polish job

1390
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:29,200
On the top of his head

1391
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,800
It is receding. You're absolutely right

1392
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:38,520
So maybe he let himself go on the top but he wears a hat and on his pecs, but he wears a bikini top

1393
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:44,320
So right mad at these sailors or whatever because they interrupted him without clothes on

1394
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:51,320
You know my secret I'm balding there's yeah, there's a line

1395
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:56,080
I don't know exactly what he looked like when the park opens

1396
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,600
But you know, look we all age

1397
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:04,720
We're all the same Lee fingers too. It's very like it's very big footy fingers

1398
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:10,200
He's yeah, he looks like he looks like he also could be just like some sort of old-time Catskill comedian maybe

1399
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:16,480
Like he's like still doing shows. He could be in Vegas. He could be like opening for Rich Little in Vegas

1400
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,720
These Peter Gallagher what he is. That's true

1401
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:25,720
What if we fused in April Peter Gallagher

1402
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:31,680
And give it where would give it a werewolf fingers

1403
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,960
Oh

1404
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:38,800
Look at this. This is one of my other thing. I've decided I like in theme park world green cities

1405
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:44,920
I love my dark ride green cities. Give me give me a cloth fire and green cities. Yeah

1406
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:51,400
Man, this is a good ride and it seems like I feel like this is on the chopping block like there

1407
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,880
You like you said they hit it on the website

1408
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:58,080
It's like buried all the way you have to keep scrolling and scrolling and scrolling to find out if it's even there

1409
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:03,720
It's like they're embarrassed of it. They shoved it in a basement and they should not be there should be front and center in the ads

1410
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:06,360
I mean if I were to go to this place

1411
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:11,400
This is the first thing I would go there first thing because I'd be worried it'd be broken by the end of the day

1412
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:16,520
They should have a big picture of King Kong's weird eyebrows on the main page

1413
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:22,160
To like entice you because like if you looked at it you'd be like always a nice park seems like it's got some cool

1414
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:23,640
Coasters some nice food

1415
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:27,920
But I don't know if there's any like character to it and then you'd see like a big janky

1416
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:32,360
King Kong robot head and you go something for everyone here

1417
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:38,760
Yeah, yeah, I mean this is that I feels like the best

1418
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:43,160
Thing at the park to me the only thing I'd like to name check really really quick

1419
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,720
All these rides are kind of in the dark so you can't there's not a lot to say about them

1420
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:49,160
But I really like that there was

1421
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:55,180
There is a roller coaster that has shifted hands a couple times and it started in the 80s as Space Center

1422
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:03,480
Where it was very space mountain II so I like the vibe of that Space Center became temple of the Nighthawk and today is

1423
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,640
crazy bats

1424
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:12,800
Those are three best ride names have ever heard and it's all the same right that's great. Yeah, can I quick name check feng shui place?

1425
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:20,680
What's that no I didn't fan this is a type of ride that I only we've talked about a lot. It's a madhouse

1426
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:25,400
Mm-hmm. Yes, it's a it's like it's a site

1427
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:26,640
I'm reading from Wikipedia

1428
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:28,840
It's an up designed to be an optical and physical illusion

1429
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,960
Consisting of several rows of seats attached to a swaying gondola with a rotating drum

1430
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:36,040
So it's sort of making it seem like

1431
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:39,000
Crazy stuff is happening as it's rotating

1432
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:44,680
It creates the impression that the rider is turning upside down where the room is actually moving around them

1433
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:49,880
So feng shui place is something I thought was interesting because to me it feels a lot like

1434
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:57,040
Scott your favorite ride had not or experienced mystery lodge. Oh, hey, yeah, it's very much like

1435
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:01,180
Yes, it's like people like there's obviously actors

1436
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:05,960
They recorded at a certain point they fight and there's a whole narrative going on and in in a madhouse

1437
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,520
Which I mean the name madhouse is a great

1438
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:12,760
Name what else is a matter there examples of man?

1439
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:15,440
Absolutely are more examples

1440
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:21,880
The American ones there Merlin's mystical mansion at Clark's Trading Post in Lincoln, New Hampshire

1441
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:26,160
What are you talking about? I'm not sure if some of these are still there

1442
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:31,320
Denny's great escape at Six Flags New England in 1999

1443
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:36,880
Who they had that a something like that a great adventure to where the room goes upside down

1444
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,280
You were like seated and you think you were upside down, but it's the room has gone upside down

1445
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:48,320
Yeah, and this is something I've been to this place, but it was not there Noah's incredible adventure at Noah's Ark water park in Wisconsin Dells

1446
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:55,920
We got to hit that one. We definitely got to hit that one. There's so yeah, I mean my friend. Yeah, we're gonna do that

1447
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:59,160
There's so much Tommy Bartlett you guys

1448
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:03,080
I have no idea Tommy Bartlett is so interesting

1449
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:07,160
Tommy Barlow all I'll say is Tommy Bartlett's robot world

1450
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,200
And it's now it's changed the name of it, but it was literally like you'd walk through

1451
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:17,080
Tommy Bartlett had thrown together some like tin cans with googly eyes

1452
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:19,400
and

1453
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:24,320
Yeah, here you go. Oh, and that's your happiest memory. Oh my god. I love it

1454
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,680
Wow, yeah, okay

1455
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:32,080
That's a great one. Let's build that up his name haunts me Tommy Bartlett Poseidon Fury

1456
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:37,160
Was gonna be at islands of adventure and it was gonna be a madhouse. I believe that's what I'm reading here

1457
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:42,720
Unfamiliar with this genre in general. I'd like to know more about mad house mad houses

1458
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:44,960
so

1459
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,280
Yeah, yeah, I think there's a fun house here, too

1460
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:53,040
I forgot what it was called, but like there's so many rides through with the and there's so many still here and

1461
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:59,200
Here and the other thing that we haven't talked about they have like a lot of like

1462
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:04,580
Some Disney parks they have two hotels built into the park

1463
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:13,400
the hotel Mataba and Hotel Ling Bao and they were scheduled for a whole new land for 2020 which is

1464
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:16,080
I don't I'm sure has been delayed

1465
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:22,540
Called Rookberg that was gonna have this Charles Lindberg Hotel Charles Lindbergh

1466
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:27,500
This capsule hotel Wow, whoa, which smaller is he?

1467
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:33,800
It's it's all steampunky and then they were gonna have this fly coaster, which is an act

1468
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:38,500
I don't know what it's an acronym for but it's a flight coaster like

1469
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:43,720
Tatsu where you're lying down. It's a first launching flight coaster

1470
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:50,000
man eats with a hotel built into it and oh my god this with a

1471
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:54,980
And the like coaster would go by like the patio the upstairs like

1472
01:54:55,560 --> 01:55:03,160
Roofdeck or something now would I have maybe not named it after the aviator who flew to Germany to get a medal for?

1473
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:08,360
Hermann Goring. Yeah, I might have gone with Amelia Earhart, but that's just me. What are you gonna do?

1474
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:14,560
Well, you're not we're not in charge of anything yet until we get it employed by Dunham or failure

1475
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:16,640
Sure

1476
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:19,520
Fader land till we all come up with fader land

1477
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:24,820
We'll get some advice we'll get some counsel from John Binkowski of Hard Rock Park before too

1478
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:30,520
Oh, yeah, he gives us a crash course and how to open up open a park that makes it at least six months

1479
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:35,600
Yeah, did they start building that Jason? Do you know it's yeah, it's pretty far along

1480
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:40,840
Wow, it seems like from the pictures I saw we have but I don't know they have an opening date yet

1481
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:45,480
The reality is I feel like anything that's with the exception probably of a splash mountain redo

1482
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,480
Which is obviously not started

1483
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:53,780
Anything that is already like 25 to 50 percent done will probably get in theme parks

1484
01:55:54,160 --> 01:56:00,200
But almost everything else is canceled for the next few years. That's I would guess what's gonna happen. I

1485
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:07,640
Think so. I think that's accurate Nintendo land though construction out here for us still moving along though

1486
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:14,120
Yeah, we're very lucky and they were like they were gonna open secret life of pets like the week of yes

1487
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,560
we were you know, it's a funny moment was that

1488
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:22,360
We I keep like a document of episodes that are coming up and like well around this week

1489
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:28,360
We'll do secret life of pets there on here. We'll do Marvel the pandemic starting and need deleting those from the

1490
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:36,680
Won't be needing those at the who about a Europe trip that could be different that's something else we could do

1491
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:41,280
Good we could still talk about the pictures of Josh tomorrow

1492
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:46,640
Installing the Quinjet at the top of the Avengers campus, which I'm sure we all saw

1493
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:51,960
Well, my favorite thing of like the Quinjet has been placed at Avengers campus

1494
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:59,560
Except the fact they're all standing in dirt pathways. It's like you have not you have not paved the walkways yet. So

1495
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:05,100
Let me know when cement arrives. Yeah, let me know when the water is hooked up

1496
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:12,140
All right, I think we're I think we're heading to the end here I've totally forgot one more thing though

1497
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:14,740
Oh my god in in the world of ripoffs

1498
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:21,480
They have a at least I don't know if they do anymore. They had a just full-on Star Tours ripoff called galaxy. Oh, yeah

1499
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:22,620
Yeah, yeah

1500
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:28,100
Which let me screen share that it was so down to the elements of the ripoff

1501
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:33,060
Look at this host. Look at this flight attendant Wow. That's just exactly

1502
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:41,060
Original Star Tours, it's the same weird flippy hair the ward actually actually oddly looks more similar to the current the

1503
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:44,340
Allison Janney voiced robot who they have now

1504
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:51,860
But they did add a new element which was it which is you know, it's not Chewbacca

1505
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:58,980
Obviously who you know, it's it's not Ewoks bumbling in the in the ride vehicle in the safety video. It's this guy

1506
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:04,580
Who looks like kind of a green Michelin man

1507
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:12,400
Yeah, like they took a sumo wrestling novelty suit and threw a coat of green paint on it

1508
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:16,340
You watch his antics. I love this guy

1509
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:24,980
Angry family who has to like we're forced to sit next to this guy who by the way, let me check my notes

1510
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:27,620
Oh, yes, he is Alex from Galex

1511
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:32,660
Alex from Galex love Alex from Galex

1512
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:41,020
Yeah, big puffy arms. This girl is so pissed off to be next to Alex from Galex

1513
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:47,200
As much tension as if you were being taken along on a false niece trip

1514
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:56,400
Yeah, anyway so much crazy IP Alex from Galex it goes on and on so many robots this place is absolutely insane and

1515
01:58:56,400 --> 01:59:00,600
I think I mean I've seen look there's there's been some criticism of us

1516
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:07,200
Look, we're not gonna be able to get to everything. We haven't been to these places. I already regret that we haven't talked about

1517
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:13,200
The McDonald's was a Chessington the McDonald's. Yeah the McDonald's non-standard McDonald's

1518
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:16,480
We missed the non-standard McDonald's in Chessington and a medieval

1519
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:21,800
McDonald's. Yeah. Yeah, any other big regrets that we've become aware

1520
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:28,160
I mean Flynn, please let us know please. Shoot us a tweet or an email if we miss something big we can collect all these things

1521
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:34,280
Things we missed or maybe we'll go to Europe again and talk about them. I saw that we'd and I think there was a criticism

1522
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:36,280
It was valid

1523
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:39,280
Somebody said we did not devote enough time to the family

1524
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:46,200
Somebody said we did not devote enough time to the fifth dimension and Zappa manic and I completely agree

1525
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:50,560
I feel like we hit that pretty good. I think we need 20 to 30 more minutes at least

1526
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:57,840
I I spaced on that like the writer of that ride was Douglas Adams of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy

1527
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:01,200
Like yeah, this big stuff

1528
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:07,040
But we you know what we want to get to these places, you know, we want to also leave some room

1529
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:13,160
For when we go in now experience, obviously we won't get to experience Zappa manic, but you know, maybe Zappa manic is his own

1530
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:19,720
Patreon spin spin him off somehow. Well, I mean maybe that brings me to sort of a

1531
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,600
overall question

1532
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:24,160
for you guys

1533
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:26,920
Some of these things in the burn the past you got to take them off the table

1534
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:32,160
But of the places that we have discussed here on the main feed or the second gate

1535
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:39,840
You know Alf and gremlins we can't do but that that leaves five five places that currently exist if you could only go

1536
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:42,160
To one of the five

1537
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:44,200
Which one would you choose?

1538
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:49,320
Okay, I want to work through my my I want to show my work here a little bit

1539
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:52,440
I think Chessington if they still had professor burp and

1540
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:56,200
Zappa-matic that's high up on the list. The problem is they're gone

1541
02:00:56,600 --> 02:01:02,800
That one suffers a little more from the really cool things are in the past as charming as that park seems and that right below

1542
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:08,640
Ride, but yeah, maybe with it and the dumpy and the dumpy, you know movie land movie world

1543
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:11,320
It's fun

1544
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:14,680
Yeah, I love to be there. I love to be there right now eating that

1545
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:16,920
club sandwich

1546
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:22,720
That they were advertising I'd love that but the Dakota stick. Oh my god

1547
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:25,480
I'd love to get one of those Dakota sticks in my mouth

1548
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:29,580
And then learn a little bit more about the male anatomy

1549
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:36,720
Show us how illustrate how comfortable you are with your sexuality using a Dakota. Yes, I will

1550
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:39,880
So but that's you know

1551
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:45,800
What so it comes comes on to Malta Village it comes down to this place. What's the is there one more?

1552
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:51,080
Am I forgetting the Tato Park? Oh, of course Tato Park Tato Park is great, but it's not like

1553
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:54,440
What I want from Tato Park is probably a

1554
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:59,520
One-on-one interaction with mr. Tato for a few hours. That's really what I want

1555
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:05,520
I I we spent so much of the episode talking about him. Mr. Tato and we like the ride. They seem nice

1556
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:10,680
They seem cute, but it's not like I want to be best friends with him. I want to go walking around

1557
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,480
Telling women that their underwear is showing with him

1558
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:18,000
I want to help him on his quest to

1559
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:22,880
Stop indecency modest up this world. Yeah modest up this world

1560
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:27,240
So I the right the place itself doesn't do so much for me

1561
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:32,480
So it comes down to Popeye Village or this place. I'm between these two as well. So

1562
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,600
You know, I

1563
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,800
Think I gotta give it to I think for me

1564
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:45,660
Fantasia land seems like so rich and so full of substance like and the other thing

1565
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:51,380
I mean, I don't know the euro exchange rate seemed pretty reasonable for like

1566
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:59,980
The the quality that of the bills, you know, and yes, and and it also feels like they're adding stuff to Fantasia land

1567
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:04,980
Like you just showed like it feels like it's trying to stay somewhat relevant

1568
02:03:04,980 --> 02:03:09,820
and I would argue of course getting rid of some of the other robot rides that are crazy bad move, but

1569
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:14,820
This thing you showed me this hotel looks insane. It's got a good mix of old

1570
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:21,340
Crazy stuck-in-time robot rides a new mix of cool coasters. It looks very nice

1571
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:26,140
I think it's this is a slam dunk. I would love to go to Malta Village, but I think it's a slam dunk

1572
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:31,500
This is this is the winner. Are we all saying Fantasia land? I think so Wow

1573
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:36,780
Your land on your land you are the winner

1574
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:42,140
I don't think we knew there was gonna be a competition but you're the winner of the European vacation

1575
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:46,540
I agree as well and just to say I loved living in this area so much

1576
02:03:47,260 --> 02:03:52,760
And when one other thing I'm the drinker of the show the beer in this area. Oh my god

1577
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:56,620
That's that was my favorite thing. I got to live there before I was 21

1578
02:03:57,220 --> 02:04:04,180
In America, but I went to Europe and could drink at 20 and pay one euro and get like the best beer I've ever had

1579
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:08,660
Wow, the cheap be it said they'll give you this massive thing for a single euro

1580
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:10,540
So

1581
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:12,540
if the if the

1582
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:17,940
Beer is anywhere close because I because I have to take eating into account too and the food at a lot of these places

1583
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:22,900
Seems a little miserable admittedly. I mean, I'm not sure about food at a fun time

1584
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:25,620
You land but seems like some you know, big old bratwurst and stuff

1585
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:31,420
But if the oh, oh Jason which is tied with rope a sandwich with rope

1586
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:37,020
That looks delicious honestly. Yeah, I like that. Yeah, actually we watched a video

1587
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,980
Erin and I watched a video where there's a big

1588
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:46,580
French Briesian section where they're making fresh crepes Alex delicious. Did you see did you see this?

1589
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:50,780
Ruttmors Tavern desire for honest cuisine. Oh

1590
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:56,340
My god, I had made up my despite made up my mind before Ruttmors Tavern

1591
02:04:57,580 --> 02:05:02,720
This is absolutely the quality of the Harry Potter restaurants. Oh my god

1592
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,760
These are unreal

1593
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:11,200
Bratwurst. Yeah, those jams look so great. This is like solid lunch man. Then like what?

1594
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,720
Yeah, my god

1595
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,880
Yeah, this

1596
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,280
also if you I there's a

1597
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:22,240
It might be the case on this menu, too

1598
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:26,680
I saw a rooftop bar called the dragon bar in the China area

1599
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:32,800
And the drink assortment went on and on and on it went there were so many

1600
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:36,880
Varieties so many types of whiskey and vodka and beer, of course

1601
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:42,200
You know and to get to be close to this area. I like so much clone and Dusseldorf

1602
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:48,380
I would absolutely I this one legitimately that after talking about this. I think I do want to actually go to

1603
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:53,960
To Western Germany and check out funtazi land. So yes, congrats you win

1604
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:59,040
I also just want to point the menu you were just showing Mike contain the phrase pork knuckle

1605
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:07,800
That was a staple of the Sheridan house growing up I assumed well sure, you know

1606
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:14,320
Your mama just a wrap all of your your actual knuckles in pork go on

1607
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:19,540
You're gonna go go have some lunch. You say you get smacked by some pork knuckle

1608
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:23,080
It's feeling pretty ramy. He's full of pork

1609
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:32,880
Yeah, too much pork knuckle too excited. Well, then that means that you survived to podcast the rides European vacation

1610
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:39,160
What a blast one more stamp of the passport could clunk and what we have here

1611
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,280
it looks to me like a

1612
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:44,920
DNA test from the gopher woman and

1613
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:50,680
Wouldn't you know it? There's a big green check mark. It says more

1614
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:55,480
Woman than gopher so Mike you are a go

1615
02:06:56,320 --> 02:07:02,000
Hmm. What person does a percentage does it say a percentage? Is it 51% woman?

1616
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:04,880
It's

1617
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:06,080
72

1618
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:10,760
72 percent human woman pretty good. Honestly pretty good. So yeah

1619
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:17,840
I think you got to go for it and after this journey you've been on of of sexual liberation you learned what sex is

1620
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:25,360
You still want to participate in mr. Tato's plan to modest up Ireland, but you've I think you've made incredible progress

1621
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:30,840
Thank you. Yes. I feel different. I feel better as I said before I feel good and better

1622
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:34,840
Which is what we're all saying during this time of quarantining and pandemic

1623
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:41,660
We say it's so much you almost get tired of saying you get tired saying I feel better and you get tired of saying I now

1624
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:44,640
Feel willing to have sex with a gopher woman. Mm-hmm

1625
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:50,080
I mean this is look this is a time Marissa Strickland is going to marry a potato chip or a potato

1626
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:53,200

Entry into a relationship with this gopher woman. Mm-hmm. I mean, I wouldn't want these stickers

But I hope that we were hopefully I I feel the three of us like we got to I I feel like metaphorically
