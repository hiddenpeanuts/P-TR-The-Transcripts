1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,256
Christmas everyone, this is a podcast,

3
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:30,096
the ride special Christmas surprise present.

4
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:32,556
Hope your, hope your morning's going great.

5
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:34,516
This is Scott Gardener with Jason Sheridan

6
00:00:34,516 --> 00:00:35,416
and Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:36,676
Hi.

8
00:00:37,156 --> 00:00:37,936
Hello, Mike here.

9
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:42,616
Hey, excited to give you a little extra something.

10
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:46,116
You are beloved second gate subscribers.

11
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:50,596
Here's what's happening in addition to the regular

12
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:53,036
December episodes, we thought we'd try something,

13
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:57,776
which is we're going to do an audio commentary

14
00:00:57,776 --> 00:01:00,556
on an old Disney special.

15
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:04,216
And I think it's a particularly special, special.

16
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:10,116
It is the Mickey's very Merry Christmas parade from 1991,

17
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:14,016
which I think is like, this is in the dead center

18
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:16,596
of all of our childhoods, probably right around

19
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:18,456
when we all went for the first time.

20
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,056
Jason, you were saying this was right in the heat

21
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:24,236
of your early days of Disney fandom.

22
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:27,696
Yeah, my family went down with my,

23
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:33,036
with both my grandparents and we all stayed at the Polynesian

24
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:37,536
and it was very much a different time because

25
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,636
I just remember my mom talking about how like, yeah,

26
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:43,896
when we went that time, the parks closed pretty early

27
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:47,536
at nights, cause it was a very slow season.

28
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:51,496
It was, the thing was colder than everyone expected it to be.

29
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,956
And it was the week after Thanksgiving, which now,

30
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:57,376
by that point, they got the holiday stuff up.

31
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:59,916
I mean, they got the Christmas stuff up before Thanksgiving

32
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:04,316
now, but after Halloween, they had not even started

33
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:05,176
putting it up.

34
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:09,196
So, and Tomorrowland hadn't been redone.

35
00:02:09,516 --> 00:02:12,336
My grandparents, everyone in the family was walking around

36
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:13,996
singing the best time of your lives.

37
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,756
The other Sherman Brothers song about Carousel of Progress.

38
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,076
Your whole family.

39
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:19,356
We all loved.

40
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:21,876
One, two, one, two, three, four.

41
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:23,196
Now is the time.

42
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:23,596
Now is the time.

43
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,756
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

44
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:27,536
You picked some percussion, you picked your harmony parts.

45
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,956
Jason is like the kid in Step Brothers in the back seat

46
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,336
who takes the high part.

47
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:38,516
Well, yeah, and this is, it's kind of the first

48
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:40,956
Christmas parade that I remember.

49
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:44,636
A lot of moments of this linger with me,

50
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:46,816
although I don't remember it super well.

51
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:48,636
And here's the other thing, cut us a little slack.

52
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:51,156
This is a bit of an experiment.

53
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:53,656
This isn't gonna be like mystery science theater.

54
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:55,876
We didn't write out our jokes.

55
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:59,616
So we're gonna be sort of reacting to this as it comes,

56
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:01,936
but I think it's gonna be fun.

57
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:03,836
We're gonna riff along to this track,

58
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:06,076
but it's truly improvised.

59
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:06,556
Mm-hmm.

60
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,536
So we get a lot of credit.

61
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:10,496
Give us more credit, is what I'm saying.

62
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:11,596
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

63
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:14,016
We're gonna be really sweating it here for you.

64
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:16,016
It's a special Christmas gift.

65
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:20,976
So if you're at home and if you're frustrated

66
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:22,116
with how your holiday is going,

67
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:24,496
you need to get away from the family.

68
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,856
You need some distraction.

69
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:28,996
Or yeah, even if you're having a great time,

70
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:32,316
if you're, hey, put this on.

71
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:35,356
Make your parents or grandparents, all of them,

72
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:39,376
all generations, listen to us synced up with a YouTube video.

73
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:43,076
Yes, the link is in the description for this episode.

74
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,156
And unlike most modern Disney parades,

75
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:53,756
there is 0% chance of seeing any Meghan Trainor in this one.

76
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:56,036
So no offense to Meghan Trainor,

77
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:58,136
but the last couple specials they have aired

78
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:01,236
sure have had a lot of Meghan Trainor.

79
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,216
No offense, not again.

80
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:07,816
Just a lot of vowels, as many vowels as you could fit in.

81
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,796
So make sure that you, I mean,

82
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:13,236
the link will be in front of you,

83
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,576
but you should be watching

84
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:19,476
Disney's Very Merry Christmas Parade, parentheses, 1991.

85
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:25,036
It is posted by Mike Newell, December 7th, 2017.

86
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,976
I'm just giving you every little bit to verify

87
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,296
you're watching the right one.

88
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:31,916
He explains that due to a copyright claim,

89
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:35,136
the audio of Through the Years by Kenny Rogers

90
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,196
has been muted.

91
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:39,056
So apologies for that.

92
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:39,616
Although I checked, I think it's in there.

93
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:40,676
So we will also be muted.

94
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:42,936
We will be totally silent

95
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:45,356
in respect to modern copyright laws.

96
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:47,096
I think you, actually, we shouldn't do that.

97
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:49,676
And you should just sing Now Is The Time during that part.

98
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,516
Oh, I mean, I guess more appropriately,

99
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,996
I should learn this Kenny Rogers song.

100
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:54,656
Yeah, that's good too.

101
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:55,796
That would be, but we don't have time for that.

102
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:56,656
So now is the time.

103
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:57,816
You'll sing it.

104
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:01,656
Okay, so here, we'll give you a say.

105
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:02,756
So pull it up.

106
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:05,176
I guess you're gonna need multiple devices.

107
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:06,096
Yeah.

108
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:07,016
Oh, that's right.

109
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:08,696
Here, yeah, maybe we should give 15 seconds.

110
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:10,016
So make sure you do whatever it takes.

111
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:13,076
If you have to get past a 15 second or a 30 second,

112
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:14,336
hopefully it's just a five,

113
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:16,116
but get that video in front of you.

114
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:17,896
The first frame's gonna be black,

115
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:21,216
and then it's gonna go to Mickey and his friends

116
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:24,656
surrounded by a presence in a tree.

117
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:30,096
And, but yeah, we'll sync this thing up.

118
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:32,016
And maybe, I was saying,

119
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:36,176
maybe we do it in California screaming style.

120
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:36,776
Oh, okay.

121
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:40,196
So I guess it'll be on one.

122
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:42,436
I'll go from five to one.

123
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,056
So everybody get it ready.

124
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:51,956
And here we go in five, four, three, two, one.

125
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:59,468
Okay, Mickey and friends as promised.

126
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,940
What?

127
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,460
Who people have a giant watch, but that's not, that is not to scale with his.

128
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,700
I hope that scarf he gave Minnie is cashmere too, cause that watch probably costs more.

129
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,360
Now this is Mickey's house in Orlando, am I right?

130
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah.

131
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,160
Because I've been in this house.

132
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,880
Pre-Tune Town, you've been in the house.

133
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm pretty, yeah, we went into some Mickey's birthday, like Mickey's birthday land house.

134
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,620
Well that means, that means you've been in the den.

135
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,200
You need to make a phone call, use the den.

136
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,900
That's a very specific thing from another special that I've referenced before.

137
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,420
We'll get to that one eventually.

138
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,040
So this is the fantastic opening showing Disney's MGM Studios.

139
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,980
MGM Studios would have been pretty, still pretty new, still pretty glossy and new.

140
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,680
And this is before drone, this is a helicopter shot I'm assuming.

141
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,520
The Grand Floridian also still shiny and new.

142
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,440
Yes, this was a very exciting time for the party,

143
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,780
and a very exciting time for Teal Graphics.

144
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, I love, yeah, that's a great one.

145
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,160
Oh, the Mardi Gras Parade.

146
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,660
I mean, we were talking about in the email, the Mardi Gras themed parade.

147
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,680
Well, that's what, see, you get the regular holiday parade in this one and the Mardi Gras parade

148
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,380
with appearances by, I want to say the dinosaurs.

149
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh.

150
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,760
Joan London.

151
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,340
Joan London, Regis of course.

152
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,160
And Regis.

153
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,320
Mayim Bialik.

154
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,680
Regis Bialik, who only this year, she was not brought back.

155
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,940
So I don't know what she did.

156
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,680
I don't know how she fucked up.

157
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,700
I don't know how she wronged the Disney company, but not asked to put this in.

158
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,600
Oh my God, look at those dancing, are those horses?

159
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,960
They're awfully strange.

160
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,660
They kind of, I mean, we'll see them again in a bit.

161
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,520
We're just getting the preview here.

162
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,800
Would Beauty and the Beast have just come out?

163
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,500
Is that right?

164
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,720
Yeah.

165
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,820
December 91.

166
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,300
Oh, and we get the preview of Disney Paris.

167
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,280
And Spectrum Magic.

168
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,420
This is the doll-faced man of Jason's Nightmares.

169
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,600
My nemesis.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,220
I, Spectrum Magic was such a cool show, like such a cool parade, except I was never comfortable

171
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,780
watching it.

172
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,180
Ninja Turtles.

173
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,100
I'll talk about it more when it comes up.

174
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,680
Yeah, we just saw the Ninja Turtles.

175
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,860
Doll-faced men.

176
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,900
And the dinosaurs from Dinosaur.

177
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,740
This is a big special.

178
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,780
This is a major one.

179
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,340
And as always, you have the, now these are dolls that I like.

180
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,820
I really like the marching dolls from Babes in Toyland.

181
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,540
And I also like the Disney Reindeer.

182
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,860
I think they're a lot of fun.

183
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,340
I like them too.

184
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,680
I also like the Disney Reindeer.

185
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,860
That's stuff to look forward to in the holiday seasons.

186
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,560
The carriages that only come out.

187
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,140
The little armies they had.

188
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,260
This here, you'll see, you'll notice the room font on screen.

189
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,560
Shout out to the room font.

190
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,040
So, Joan and Regis, kind of the classic lineup.

191
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,960
And they started veering from Joan and Regis.

192
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,500
I remember there was one year that was Jerry Van Dyke, and I want to say Suzanne Summers.

193
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,180
Oh, yes.

194
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,980
And that was the one I brought for the, when we did the parade special.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,800
Oh, that's right.

196
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,500
Last year.

197
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:12,880
Yeah.

198
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,260
And they, Jerry Van Dyke is just off the leash.

199
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,980
I hated him.

200
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,820
I was kind of, I don't know.

201
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,140
Maybe, I'll go ahead and say it.

202
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:30,500
I think it ruined my Christmas morning to not see trustworthy Regis and benign fine Joan

203
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:30,840
London.

204
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,400
Yeah.

205
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,940
I'm not excited about Joan London.

206
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,500
I think she did a great job though.

207
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,580
And I thought Suzanne and Jerry were not prepared.

208
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,620
Yeah.

209
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,380
And there's a reason why they didn't come back, and there's a reason why Regis came

210
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,740
back the next year.

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,340
Regis has an ability to roll with things, I think, that really makes Regis the superior

212
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,740
choice for hosting stuff like this.

213
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,560
Regis healed the nation after 9-11.

214
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,920
He was on the first Letterman post 9-11, and he wasn't the first guest, but they had Dan

215
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,280
Rather talk and he was very sad about what had happened.

216
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,100
Regis was the first comedy guest.

217
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,060
So he really was the first to do comedy in some regard.

218
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,320
He was America's funny man.

219
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,840
America's premier funny man.

220
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,920
Until Lauren got permission from Rudy.

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,640
Right.

222
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,540
Oh, I just heard Regis say mutant ninja turtles.

223
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,860
Can you imagine adults rapping?

224
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,140
If a new thing like Ninja Turtles was happening now, you'd mess it up all the time.

225
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,640
Like, you'd be so dismissive.

226
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,020
Right.

227
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,680
And kids would be shouting, no, it's Paw Patrol, not the Patrol Pawlers.

228
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,200
Yeah, my ambialic blossom.

229
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:46,200
You know, I found a bunch of old VHS tapes at my mom's a couple years ago and did watch

230
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,080
a bunch of parades.

231
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,120
And I think this maybe some of this one was on there.

232
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,560
I'm pretty sure I had this taped onto TV.

233
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,300
I think the version we're watching does not have commercials.

234
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,700
Yes.

235
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,620
And I wanted to dip a toe into the water because all of these are on YouTube and everyone should

236
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,060
watch all of them always, whether or not it's Christmas.

237
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,900
But I figured an hour and a half would be a little easier than the two with the full

238
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,400
commercial.

239
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,040
Oh, yeah.

240
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,960
That's what I figured because I figured it would be two hours with the commercials.

241
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,500
We did see a card when they were showing the sponsors of Kissimmee St. Cloud, which is

242
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,000
a kid.

243
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,200
I just knew the term Kissimmee St. Cloud.

244
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,620
You loved Kissimmee St. Cloud.

245
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,260
It's like next to Disney World.

246
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,820
I did not in the Christmas parade, but I famously did march in my high school marching band

247
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,660
at Disney World.

248
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,040
Right.

249
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:36,940
Which park?

250
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,460
Magic Kingdom and Epcot.

251
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,340
Nice.

252
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:39,760
Both?

253
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,020
Really?

254
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:40,940
But not yet.

255
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,240
Not here.

256
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,840
These kids are in MGM Studios.

257
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,540
They're playing the music off of the sheet.

258
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,460
We only played one song, so I didn't need the sheet music in front of me.

259
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,180
What was the song?

260
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,840
It was Paul Simon's Late in the Evening.

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,060
I don't know that song.

262
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,960
You've heard Late in the Evening, I think.

263
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,100
Yeah, probably.

264
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,660
I mean, probably.

265
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,440
It's like a Graceland-y.

266
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,960
I don't even forget if it's on Graceland, but it's around that time.

267
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,420
It's like one of those little funky songs.

268
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:12,600
And what did you feel like the marching band interpretation worked?

269
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,140
Did it lend itself to marching bands, to the marching band genre?

270
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,560
There's a section of it that has a big horn part that I think is what our band director

271
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,160
was thinking.

272
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,820
It's like all horns.

273
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,660
Are you with your hands playing the correct notes right now?

274
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,520
No, I'm just doing a little shimmy with my fingers to show you how fun it is.

275
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,400
These nights on horseback.

276
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,240
Yeah, these are like our medieval times nights.

277
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,560
Now is this the...

278
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,140
They're cutting fast too here.

279
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,420
There's this odd guy.

280
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,660
Do you guys remember from these specials that there was this very like cherubic, like jolly

281
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,940
old man who wore kind of fancy pastels who was like the leader of the band?

282
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,040
I think we're going to see him at some point.

283
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,520
I don't know.

284
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,460
That doesn't sound familiar.

285
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,840
But he's kind of this like...

286
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,100
Like a Duda-parade kind of guy.

287
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,880
Oh, sure.

288
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,620
Yeah, yeah.

289
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:13,240
Well, he's also like a perennially young looking old man like Mickey Rooney or to put it in

290
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,860
a worse way, like a Jeff Sessions.

291
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,720
This is him.

292
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,040
Here's who I was thinking of.

293
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,860
Oh, yeah, the leader of the parade.

294
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,060
The martial of the parade.

295
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,440
He's twirling his baton.

296
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,640
Do they name him?

297
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,900
I want to see more of him.

298
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,520
You're going to get a good shot of him for sure.

299
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:34,780
Like, when it trains on a close of this man just loving life, loving Disney, loving Christmas,

300
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,480
here we go.

301
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,980
Ta-ta.

302
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,200
Yeah, I thought like guys like that were cool as a kid.

303
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,060
Is that true?

304
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,840
I mean, I love anyone with a little pomp and circumstance, a little size.

305
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,900
He really does have a cherubic face.

306
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,420
You thought this little boy old man was really cool?

307
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:59,140
Like any sort of MC, like Harold Hill type, MC, leader of the parade.

308
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,140
Harold Hill is like Mick Jagger compared to this guy.

309
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,740
No offense to this guy.

310
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,540
There's a WWE wrestler Chris Benoit in the audience.

311
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,300
Sorry.

312
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,980
And a big puddle on the ground.

313
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,560
He looked like Chris Benoit.

314
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,180
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,120
So am I crazy or did these parades?

316
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,260
I mean, I'm sure they shot a lot of it in advance like they do now, but I feel like

317
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,420
when we would watch them live, they would say we're live so much.

318
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, I think there were actual live components.

319
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,860
Did you think this guy was cool?

320
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,180
Jason loves a coachman.

321
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,780
I know.

322
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,900
Well, it's cool to have a craft and be good at it.

323
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,520
The coachman has a craft.

324
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,100
Yeah.

325
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,920
Well, that's a nice sentiment for the kids out there.

326
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,860
I had that thought when I was younger.

327
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,800
The cartoon version of him, I mean, I found very odd.

328
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,380
Like he's much tinier than the rest of the Cinderella humans.

329
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,120
Oh, yeah.

330
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,740
It weirded me out and sort of in the giant like 50s pompadour.

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,400
I don't think he registered that high on my list of like memorable characters from that

332
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,680
movie.

333
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:19,320
It's interesting to see the changing, like the dancers, much more metallic kind of interpretation

334
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,880
of medieval sort of outfits as opposed to now.

335
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,560
I feel like it's much more detail oriented.

336
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,520
Cinderella Regis is saying hi to Cinderella.

337
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,800
Now that's a runner in all the parades is that I don't think it happened there.

338
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,500
The Cinderella mice, my wife's favorite, she'd be shrieking if they were.

339
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,200
She loves that.

340
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,400
Not so much in the cartoon.

341
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,140
She loves the costumes of the Cinderella mice, the full size, and it seems like they are

342
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,560
pretty present in Tokyo.

343
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,980
And I'm really excited.

344
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,060
I don't know if you saw them.

345
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,800
We may have seen them in a parade, but we're not just hanging around.

346
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,000
They show up in the parades here.

347
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,860
I was saying about Cinderella, there's a runner that it always zooms in on her and Regis is

348
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,500
like Cinderella, where's my kiss?

349
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,520
Give me the kiss.

350
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,520
Oh, there it goes.

351
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,320
And I think as the years go on, she gets a little withholding.

352
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,480
She's toying with him, but he always gets it.

353
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,440
Wait, he always gets a kiss from Cinderella?

354
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,500
I mean, he gets blown a kiss from Cinderella.

355
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,480
I'm just going to say the specials end with them making out.

356
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,340
All right, just roll on this until we're out.

357
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,920
Joy doesn't mind if it's Cinderella.

358
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,200
I've had a hall pass from childhood.

359
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,160
Childhood in 1905.

360
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,140
I meant the original storybook character.

361
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,700
I didn't grow up with a cartoon.

362
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,060
OK, these carolers in full winter wear.

363
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,220
I like this guy.

364
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,020
I like the Disney snowman too.

365
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,420
Yeah, I like all of the Disney cartoon characters.

366
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,240
Everything is in slow motion.

367
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,200
Yeah, that is just a man driving.

368
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,320
Oh, he's got Snow White blowing a kiss.

369
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,360
Blown kisses.

370
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,080
A lot of kisses from the princesses.

371
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,320
Nothing from Minnie, though.

372
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,120
Sorry, Mike.

373
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,300
That's too bad, but there's a cowboy.

374
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,020
Those are nice.

375
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,180
These are good figures.

376
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,320
So the way Orlando weather is in winter, those carolers are either standing in 90

377
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,640
degree heat or 60 degree heat in full, like

378
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,440
mufflers and gloves and stuff.

379
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,960
That's a good shot. But some of these shots are a little boring.

380
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,380
Well, in 1991, slow motion was still very exciting.

381
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,440
And now we can do it on our phones and we're bored by it and hate it.

382
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,120
That's fair.

383
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,820
There's Mickey. He's got a hat on and a suit.

384
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,780
Why does that Mickey feel old?

385
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,700
He does his face. Something about his face.

386
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
It's not the newer face.

387
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,760
Yeah, he's got a different face and he seems.

388
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,040
Yeah, he seems old.

389
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,760
But he seems similar to the 80s Chuck E.

390
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,300
Cheese, sort of like blunter features.

391
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,840
And it's like, yeah, it's like kind of more of felty fuzz is his hair.

392
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,360
As if I feel like they're like more so they like import like special horse hair

393
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,320
from Nepal or something and cut it real short these days.

394
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,700
I think they were on a lot of the specials.

395
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,620
Right. Is anyone listening to like, did other people

396
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,500
grow up with these these parades or are we?

397
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,460
Yeah, we I'm sure of like it was part of our morning.

398
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,220
If we weren't, if we were opening presents

399
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,440
or if we weren't, if we slept in, we would have a tape going

400
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,800
so we could watch it later.

401
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,340
Like this was yeah, we would.

402
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,440
Yeah, we would tape often. Yeah.

403
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,860
If Church conflicted with the Christmas parade.

404
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,640
Oh, see, we always bang that out.

405
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,920
We always did Christmas Eve candlelight and that.

406
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,380
Oh, yeah. We started to and we do.

407
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,520
So these are Pleasure Island cat.

408
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,740
We know those are the Pinocchio.

409
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,740
Pleasure Island cat with the Mardi Gras, Mardi Gras, Domino mask.

410
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,080
We moved over the Magic Kingdom now.

411
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,040
Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,360
Which is similar to the 35th anniversary Disneyland parade.

413
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,980
And Jiminy Cricket has a Mardi Gras mask on.

414
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,680
Everyone's into Mardi Gras.

415
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,040
Why? But Mardi Gras to me seems like a real pleasure islandy

416
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,440
kind of a thing with the excess.

417
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,260
So why are all the characters way into it after Pinocchio

418
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,340
learns lessons is this pre movie maybe and Jiminy and the mean cats?

419
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,680
Yeah. Celebrating together.

420
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,100
Right. It's probably also the the vibe of the centerpiece of of the parade is

421
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,120
is Roger Rabbit's vibe is very wild.

422
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
And I feel like goes with Mardi Gras.

423
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,960
I get Roger Rabbit celebrating. I'm just saying.

424
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,260
Well, he's it's a party when he invited all his friends to the party parade.

425
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,980
I don't think Roger Rabbit gets enough credit for like the

426
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,340
in the Disney animation resurgence.

427
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,420
Right. That's a good point.

428
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,020
It is weird that it's like and then the Little Mermaid brought it back to light.

429
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,960
But Roger was a major hit and they don't they don't give Roger Bob

430
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,060
Bob Zemeckis, as I call him, talks about how I mean, especially like Jessica Rabbit.

431
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,560
They don't want to they don't you they don't want to use her.

432
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,120
He says, oh, is that it?

433
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,460
But also, like Roger seems to get no love either.

434
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,560
And Roger seems like you do something with Roger.

435
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,380
My goodness. Like everyone likes Roger.

436
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,180
Maybe Roger could welcome us to Marwin.

437
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,740
I'm sure if the right of old Bob Zemeckis could could do it, he would.

438
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,140
He would let Roger welcome us to Marwin.

439
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,220
But you know, they're going so CGI with Roger.

440
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,780
I don't know if I want it to happen.

441
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,460
I like the in theory, the Roger Rabbit sequel was about

442
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,860
the influx of 3D animation.

443
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,180
Really? You get like the original dynamic Roger.

444
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,840
Roger can is weird.

445
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,600
Well, this knows you get all the Pixar characters in there, too.

446
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,840
So like there is a fun of like, oh, that is a kind of a cool idea.

447
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,900
Well, with the all live in my Disney dot com now, but they would always

448
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,160
in all my Disney dot com.

449
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,840
This is so awesome.

450
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,160
Somebody blazing up outside.

451
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,500
I smell a strong weed.

452
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,140
A little bit of a smell.

453
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,120
Yeah, guess what? It's me.

454
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Oh, I've been hiding it behind the pillows.

455
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,780
This Roger float is great because it's got a giant Roger Rabbit

456
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,320
and Roger Rabbit is on it.

457
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,800
So it's sort of like in Citizen King when he's giving his speech

458
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,960
and he's got a giant picture behind himself.

459
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,360
Roger was like it was the big six for a while.

460
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,080
Yeah, Roger was an equal.

461
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,720
He was a stitch of his day.

462
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,080
Oh, yes. Oddly, heavily represented for a while.

463
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,660
It's interesting to think about because Roger is sort of like Disney

464
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,660
doing a Looney Tunes character, right? Yeah.

465
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,480
Yeah. OK.

466
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,980
He's kind of like that.

467
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,680
He's kind of the middle in a way.

468
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,700
He's like that's true.

469
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,640
That's a great Mickey and Bugs had a baby.

470
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,420
You know, this is just my personal opinion.

471
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,740
I think Mickey is more the everyman, but Bugs is funnier.

472
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,300
I don't think that would be a huge thing.

473
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,120
I don't think Bugs is the funny one.

474
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,580
I think if you pose, if somebody had to take the other side in a debate,

475
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,100
no one would accept that.

476
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,060
I guess that's the feeling.

477
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,160
Yeah, that's the correct opinion.

478
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,220
All right.

479
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,420
But now when Mickey at some point in time was funny,

480
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,660
like in the 20s, early on Mickey was funny and he was weird and edgy and mean.

481
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,820
Plain crazy where he messes his hair up and he makes like the goofball face.

482
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,500
And then Walt, yeah, Walt wanted him to be a very like bland corporate mascot.

483
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:33,560
So Donald got he would give the different like fun qualities to Donald and Goofy.

484
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,080
And Mickey then became sort of a blank slate,

485
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,820
although most people say like the runaway brain short.

486
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,420
Is it short? No, it's longer.

487
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,900
It's not a short. It was one of those weird.

488
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,740
That was one where like they like he gets to do weird stuff in that one.

489
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,660
And it's bizarre.

490
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,600
And there's some people say it's problematic.

491
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,160
But he finally got to be like funny and weird again.

492
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,120
But then they stamp that right out and he's back to being sort of

493
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,240
likable every man.

494
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,640
I think not necessarily in the those the cartoons that the railway is based on.

495
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,640
I think Mickey's I haven't I'm not super familiar with them.

496
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,720
The railway, the new cartoons.

497
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,020
Yes. No, that's true.

498
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,340
And those cartoons are good.

499
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,740
And I think they're on to some.

500
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,160
And isn't the main guy behind it, one of the Rocco Rocco's Modern Life?

501
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,720
Oh, is that right? I don't I don't know.

502
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,740
Let's go back to the parade.

503
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,440
It's I think it's nice to see some roofs.

504
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,500
A co-centerpiece of the not to give Roger all the credit

505
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,940
because Mickey with Minnie with the fruit on her head is great, too.

506
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,140
Oh, my gosh.

507
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,140
Minnie with the fruit on her head is so great.

508
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,160
I feel like this was in commercials as well.

509
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,360
Oh, right. For sure.

510
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,840
Commercials and the VHS.

511
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,660
We haven't talked about those really very much.

512
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,340
The promotional videos, they would make a new one every year and mail you a VHS.

513
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,420
Oh, yeah. They just send you a link to like practically a Vimeo file.

514
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,740
You can still get the practical copy.

515
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,660
I feel like they stopped this year.

516
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,700
Oh, this year they did.

517
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,840
Oh, this year or last year.

518
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,340
I got here. We go. Hold on. Sorry.

519
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,540
So these are horses.

520
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,100
These I don't like.

521
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,540
Yeah, these are I don't like them, but they are fascinating to me.

522
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,680
Yes. All right. I'll give you that.

523
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,940
They are engaging.

524
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,100
They're interesting.

525
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,700
Look, right. Oh, look at the chairs.

526
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,980
And here's all of our dads got what everyone's dad looked like at the time.

527
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,540
That dad was going over to Pleasure Island after the kids went to bed

528
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,780
or down to the Neverland Club.

529
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,940
So these are OK, Donald and Daisy are on a sleigh

530
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,640
and they're in the back watching the show, enjoying it.

531
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,000
And these are not reindeer, but they're white horses and just carolers.

532
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,060
Caroly, people playing kind of mutant horses.

533
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,940
And they all point up one one horse open sleigh.

534
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,140
Right. This guy looks like he's wearing a white and bison.

535
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,400
Get up a white and bison of string.

536
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,920
That's right.

537
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,260
Every time I in preparation for Tokyo Disney,

538
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,140
if I look up a show that happened in front of their castle

539
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,380
in the 80s, early 90s, it's spectacular.

540
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,840
Yeah, I know. Super bizarre.

541
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,800
Sometimes scary things, sometimes grotesque things.

542
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,100
There's like a 60s rock and roll show that they did,

543
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,040
which was very bizarre.

544
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,060
But they do like rock and roll classics in Tokyo.

545
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,860
That's great. And correct me if I'm wrong, Mike.

546
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,320
Don't don't when parades come around, people sit on the ground.

547
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,300
Is that right?

548
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,800
So everyone may see and enjoy it and have an unobstructed view.

549
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,100
Yes, that is correct.

550
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,300
As opposed to the hours of staking out the spot,

551
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,180
staking out and standing and putting kids on shoulders.

552
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,660
People do stake out here or excuse me,

553
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,300
they stake out there, but it's like a whole event.

554
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,200
People really line up and.

555
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,280
Yeah. Tap dancing this horse creatures.

556
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,500
I love tap dancing. Little Jason love tap dancing.

557
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,340
I mean, that is still that is on my bucket list is to learn how to tap.

558
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,400
Really? Yes, I've always wanted to learn.

559
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,720
Oh, my God. Because you want to know who Jason.

560
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,660
I will find you cheap tap lessons and I will buy it for Christmas.

561
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,180
The Arthur Murray Dance Studio.

562
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,720
Yes, I will find the funniest place you can learn tap and I will pay.

563
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,160
I will give you a Christmas present.

564
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,360
I think Rachel Hastings took tap a few years.

565
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,420
Oh, my God.

566
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,640
With seven great titles. Here's.

567
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,680
And the fans come.

568
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,580
Oh, that's a patriot here.

569
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,040
We'll tell you where you're the location of Jason's recital.

570
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,880
I think you mean to be encouraging.

571
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,360
You're get a little mean.

572
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,620
It's just such a fine line.

573
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,880
Fair enough. So here's another here's another thing

574
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,360
little Jason thought was cool.

575
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,840
Gene Kelly and singing in the rain.

576
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,100
They do in no small part to MGM's.

577
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,860
How much singing in the rain was in MGM Studios.

578
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,620
We were different little kids.

579
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,520
I will say that you and I were different.

580
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,300
I like Gene Kelly a lot now.

581
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,120
Scrooge McDuck. He looks very weird, but that Scrooge.

582
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,400
I like the costume of Scrooge.

583
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,420
He is a simplified look somehow.

584
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,400
Yeah. But you and I were different as little kids.

585
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,800
I think maybe we would have you like the same stuff I did, but I was not.

586
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,580
I did not like a lot of like old timey stuff.

587
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,340
I think we turned when I started doing like the school musicals and stuff,

588
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,060
because then I started learning about other musicals.

589
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,320
And then I started really paying attention to all the like

590
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,520
Hollywood hits in MGM Studios.

591
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,100
And like, OK, so this from OK, singing in the room,

592
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,740
I'm going to go home and go to Blockbuster and Red's singing in the rain.

593
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,560
We get back to that.

594
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,160
Mother, I like all of Busby Berkeley's films that she choreographed.

595
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,340
I didn't watch until like a few years ago, and some of them are still very good

596
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,060
and impressive. But then there's some weird racial stuff.

597
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,320
And we talked about that.

598
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,960
Yeah, we talked about Shanghai, Lil's Light Parade.

599
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,920
Here's what I think.

600
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,480
I think like I think we were very similar kids because my mom raised me

601
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,820
with musicals and I loved, you know, that's entertainment.

602
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,320
The MGM compilation of all the greatest musical scenes.

603
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,780
I liked weird like my mom had a baton around the house

604
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,200
because she did whatever that is where you have a baton.

605
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,680
And I tried like play with the baton.

606
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,480
And so we were not dissimilar kids.

607
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,300
But here's what I think.

608
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,880
I think now I kind of roll my eyes like, oh, my God, as a lamest kid, Jason,

609
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,880
I think you're like, I was great then and great now.

610
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,340
Like, I think you stick by Jason in a big way, which I think is fun.

611
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,100
Oh, sure. Yeah.

612
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,600
And like I don't I look, I've reimbred this entire podcast

613
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,200
is me re embracing lame right kids, Scott.

614
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,300
I've picked up. I'm carrying the baton of that stuff.

615
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,900
Well, Scott, you did do, I mean, improv classes.

616
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,720
But if you go past the classes and you just keep doing improv,

617
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:44,400
shame goes away, like the shame just gets beaten out of you.

618
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,860
So I did. You know what? That is something I was always embarrassed doing,

619
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,180
like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four.

620
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,060
Like I don't those kinds of and like sort of sound and movement stuff.

621
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,600
That's like the only kind of a bear.

622
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,360
I like really these crazy.

623
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,180
You know what it did?

624
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,140
I just did it just now and it felt kind of good.

625
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,460
I feel looser. It does help.

626
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,120
I'm going to do that.

627
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,160
Yeah, there you go.

628
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,480
And stretch and share.

629
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,140
It gets people talking.

630
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,200
That's where you like just tell a story about like something that happened recently.

631
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,380
And then you pick a stretch. Everyone mirrors it.

632
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,960
I find it also helps groups, you know, to bond, to bond.

633
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,760
And then also, like if people are feeling chatty, they get the chattyness out

634
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,060
so they can focus on teamwork.

635
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,340
Oh, sure. And now let me also say, I'm not sure I've said on the podcast anywhere

636
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,960
just to equal your childhood.

637
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,780
I was like I was particularly into the movie The Happiest Millionaire,

638
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,000
the Disney movie, which I don't know.

639
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,280
Nobody else really grew up with, but it's always around a lot for me.

640
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,860
Even more than Mary Poppins.

641
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,280
I watched the happiest millionaire more with the song Fortuosity.

642
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,620
And my mom and I would sing Fortuosity together and my dad would

643
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,100
pray and hope that I ended up OK.

644
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,880
Oh, wow.

645
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,000
So, you know, oh, my God.

646
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,720
What is this?

647
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,040
This was such a cool trick.

648
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,220
The snowman melts.

649
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,420
But then he's OK.

650
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,620
That's amazing.

651
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,920
So where did you do?

652
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,320
So I don't know where those legs went.

653
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,360
Most of the body in the head and then like he just like.

654
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,120
Why don't they do that?

655
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,880
I should just try that with a blanket right now.

656
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,860
We're back in MGM Studios.

657
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,640
I feel like they're putting all the big hits in MGM Studios,

658
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,780
because that would be the brand new park at the time.

659
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,400
By being that Snow White and the snow white and the dwarfs.

660
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,980
And then we saw Sleeping Beauty earlier.

661
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,840
Now here's Ariel and Eric and then some horrifying seahorse character.

662
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,680
Now, I know getting to be a child when the Little Mermaid

663
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,620
and Beauty and the Beast came out.

664
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,660
What a wonderful blessing.

665
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,260
I remember these were greats to experience.

666
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,320
I remember being in the lobby.

667
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,060
I remember being in the lobby before we saw Little Mermaid,

668
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,480
which is what? 89.

669
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,740
So I'm four.

670
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,140
What theater we taught, what's the brand?

671
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,500
Five. Oh, good question.

672
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,500
We had a Cinemark, we had a GCC.

673
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,700
It was not one of our regular theaters.

674
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,860
I think maybe we had only that was the only time we went to that theater

675
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,180
to see a movie because we went with some friends and I cannot remember.

676
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,380
There was a great you would love.

677
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,140
There was a movie theater in a shopping mall, not Woodfield.

678
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,940
It was in Stratford Square Mall, which is very close by.

679
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,940
It was under a waterfall in the mall.

680
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,100
So you would go.

681
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,060
Yeah, you would go inside and then like you would be like

682
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,360
what you walking down the halls of the scene, the theaters was you walk by

683
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,180
on the left, it was the waterfall and you would see out into the mall.

684
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,840
And I believe still that way is today is completely.

685
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,940
Yeah, it's gone.

686
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,660
I was like there.

687
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,880
There's a site called Cinematreasers.org

688
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,020
where you can look at where people compile photos of how their local

689
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,800
movie theater used to be. And I'll look it up.

690
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,300
I want to know about this waterfall.

691
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,220
Stratford Square Mall.

692
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:00,120
I saw Fievel goes west there and several other movies like that in the theater.

693
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,040
I was very lucky growing up in Los Angeles that I did get to.

694
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,920
I get to see movies here and there at the Grand Floridian when they're not

695
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,160
Grand Floridian, what I'm talking about, the El Capitan.

696
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,600
Oh, yeah, I did.

697
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,900
I saw Aladdin for the first time in the El Capitan.

698
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,980
Wow. That's crazy.

699
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,600
Yeah, yeah. With that giant ceiling and little show for him.

700
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,600
They owned it.

701
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,620
They were they like learning how to dance

702
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,860
with me playing trumpet.

703
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,240
I hate dancing.

704
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,280
I hate dancing.

705
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,200
You wouldn't dance at the hell of the moon.

706
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,680
Yeah, that's right. Refused.

707
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,680
You slipped out the door.

708
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,220
I mean, I was like five different ways of uncomfortable at hell.

709
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,440
At the moon. So.

710
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,060
But where is Mike and I were only two.

711
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,280
Yeah, I think you guys were in a.

712
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,280
OK, here. Oh, God, I'm getting uncomfortable right now

713
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,800
because Spectre Magic is happening.

714
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,720
So I.

715
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,840
I want to go there's like a dozen.

716
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,300
Rubik's Cube chests.

717
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,840
Make these outfit. All the outfits are fantastic.

718
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,840
The outfits are fantastic.

719
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,780
And I would enjoy the parade, but I would be like the doll men are lurking

720
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,680
somewhere and Jim and Len talked about them.

721
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,460
I believe they all have individual names,

722
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,040
but they are collectively known as the Spectre Men, which is a terrifying name.

723
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,240
If we are not back to our men.

724
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,120
Disney plus series about the Spectre Men, maybe it's going to be all that's left.

725
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,100
Yeah, final characters.

726
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,440
Cinderella mice.

727
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,000
Aaron specifically loves Cinderella mice in the electrical parade.

728
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,180
And therefore in Spectre Man, this also I this is the first

729
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,900
electrical parade I would have seen.

730
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,980
They didn't bring the mainstream to Florida for a number of years.

731
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,040
Yeah, this is my first electric that I would have seen.

732
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,900
Yeah, first.

733
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,740
Your first electric first electric parade of two.

734
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,100
Unless did you see anything like that in Japan?

735
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,160
Is there some like different equivalent?

736
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
Yeah, there is a there's I forget what it's called,

737
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,000
but it's like very similar electric light parade.

738
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:00,160
But then it's also they've got the phantasmic, which is in Disney.

739
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,660
Patti LaBelle.

740
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,040
With cool eyebrows.

741
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,640
Yeah, we're shade.

742
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,820
See, Patti LaBelle is the kind of artist who I listen to now,

743
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,820
but all those kind of people were so lame by the 90s that I did not.

744
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,820
I like had a distrust of a lot of like the Pointer sisters

745
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,020
were always on a lot of Disney specials and I found them so lame.

746
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,340
And now you go back to prime Pointer sisters and they're pretty rad.

747
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,540
Yeah, that is I am always interested in people I thought were lame,

748
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,040
like even like Springsteen in the 90s, who I didn't listen to a lot.

749
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,320
You'd see pictures and he looked old to me,

750
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,160
but like it didn't look anything appealing.

751
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,040
And no one he didn't he had like a resurgence after 9 11,

752
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,220
too, where he became cool again, I feel like.

753
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,460
Yeah, in the 90s, I was always like, who's this?

754
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,140
Well, I think 70s looks cool.

755
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:58,300
Oh, yeah. In early 80s and then late 80s, 90s, like the fashion did no favors to men.

756
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,760
I also as a kid, this seems insane to me now.

757
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,140
But I would tailspin.

758
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,760
Baloo, of course, never had a rough period, never stopped.

759
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,300
Always cool. Yeah, always look cool.

760
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,460
But I would I would mix up Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel

761
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,100
because they were so ubiquitous, like their music was just always played at weddings

762
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,880
on classic rock stations.

763
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,300
So I would just mix them up.

764
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,420
And they're they're grown up musicians.

765
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,700
Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,120
I think not everyone cool kid musicians like Baloo. Right.

767
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,840
Which is do you guys listen to that?

768
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,040
Do you have the tape of the Disney afternoon song?

769
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,880
There was like a Disney afternoon album with the theme songs,

770
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,000
but also like related songs that I remember listening to on the way to Disneyland

771
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
in those early to go to the Disney afternoon Avenue.

772
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,620
I don't think I know.

773
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,840
It's another time your dad asking if you were OK.

774
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,040
I was more OK with that stuff.

775
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,760
That's like cool island rhythms.

776
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,740
Like the Beach Boys. Yeah.

777
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,900
See, he was perfectly comfortable with me listening to Kokomo all the time.

778
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,880
But oh, sure.

779
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,880
Well, we didn't really have a choice of that.

780
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,040
If you want to go to the mall, you're probably going to hear a Kokomo.

781
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,440
That was shoved at Kokomo.

782
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,680
Of course, the music video filmed at the Grand Floridian, right?

783
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,540
A couple of years before this was part of a Disney special.

784
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,960
But then they shot it for broadcast cameras and then they brought in film

785
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,900
cameras and with the same setup.

786
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,620
So everybody's in the same wardrobe.

787
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,320
If you're a fan of the 80s, Beach Boys and different types of cameras,

788
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,160
as I was from four years old, apparently.

789
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,400
See, my dad raised me.

790
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,940
Yeah. See, Donald looks good, but I don't have much of a memory of this float.

791
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,800
And this isn't the iconic is that mini float.

792
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,140
Yeah. And by euros, the caballeros

793
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,580
and with their big caballeros fans here.

794
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,960
You want to see a shaky shot like today?

795
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,900
Because it's real. It's raw, man.

796
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,360
They're too polished today.

797
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,920
This is a punk parade.

798
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,260
Nothing more punk than standard death.

799
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,780
Standard of shake party.

800
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,660
There's Jose going nuts.

801
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,060
Famously, of course, in Tokyo, they grab each.

802
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,020
Donald and Jose grab each other's butts before the party.

803
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,320
Grasher. Yeah. Really?

804
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,060
Oh, yeah. You missed that part.

805
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,520
That's an OK spoiler to tell you. Yeah, absolutely.

806
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,720
But when we're standing when we were standing waiting for the let's party

807
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,280
grasher, Donald and Jose came up because we saw it happen like the day before.

808
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,220
So we're like, let's stand here.

809
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,160
So we're right by them.

810
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,700
And I got some great pictures and like they're clowning around

811
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,200
and telling us like not to say anything.

812
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,780
And they turn around.

813
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,380
Jose like pushes and might be the way around.

814
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,660
Pushes like Donald down his head down

815
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,120
and then starts like touching his butt and fluffing his butt up.

816
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,600
And then they're both like laughing, like doing their like hands to the mouth

817
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,560
to suggest laughing.

818
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,640
And they turn around.

819
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,000
Then the other then like, well, they switch off.

820
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,740
And now the other one's touching the other one's butt and fluffing.

821
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,220
And this is happening right in front of something like, what is this?

822
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,100
Fluff a pillow. You know, if you have a pillow, you got to fluff it.

823
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,960
But it was very like that would not fly in the American parks.

824
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,620
I would imagine.

825
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,120
Definitely not.

826
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,260
But if you're if your butt was that fluffy.

827
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,320
Yeah, you just need that kind of treatments.

828
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,980
Yeah. Oh, Disneyland.

829
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,820
Castle, not this site.

830
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,720
Do not like there were nutcrackers that I didn't go see this.

831
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
It's taken over.

832
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,400
But this is a regular video.

833
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,600
Opel is being video.

834
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,700
I think maybe a couple of years in a row.

835
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,680
And there was a special of Mickey's Nutcracker, and I did not like that one.

836
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,300
If it does never cameos from celebrities of the time, I don't care.

837
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,700
I was never a nut. We.

838
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,060
Kids with giant lolis and fit through the bars, dudes.

839
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,720
I was never a nutcracker fan in general.

840
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,880
Oh, no, no iteration of it.

841
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,340
Now, didn't did you end up seeing or will you see nutcracker in the four realms?

842
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,040
Well, I'm a big fan of the four realms.

843
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,580
I haven't seen it yet, but I will see it when it's on Disney Plus

844
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,820
late 2019.

845
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,160
Oh, they were going to waste a lot of time and Roger and Roger again.

846
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,560
Rogers and the Nutcracker show.

847
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,880
This is an early appearance to of sitting down Mickey,

848
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,420
who you can see in Mickey's birthday Mickey's 90th special.

849
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,920
I see there's a toothbrush back there

850
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,680
and then somebody is in front of a thing of chocolate.

851
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,020
There's a great there's a way that these specials are edited

852
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,660
where the people start

853
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,000
applauding as soon as a song begins or a character arrives,

854
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,280
which have you ever seen anything that way where like

855
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,060
note one and yeah, yeah, yeah.

856
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:45,120
Which also, now that I said it, is also the style of the film A Star is Born.

857
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,940
Oh, so it begins.

858
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,680
People are screaming front to back, you know, the way concerts work.

859
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,100
People cheer for the Lady Gaga character.

860
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,600
When she walks on stage to sing Shallows,

861
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,320
you know, she is just a stranger walking out in a lanyard.

862
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,800
Who's not really been introduced.

863
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,920
He said like a girl going out and where is the girl?

864
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,240
Which is a very moving scene.

865
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,180
But it's like, well, we don't know her yet.

866
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,440
Yeah. These cowboys, by the way, this is only a few years.

867
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,500
They would have been Woody and Jesse.

868
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,800
Hmm. The cowboys.

869
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,300
They kind of look similar.

870
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,440
There it is.

871
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,460
Actually, though, no, that's a Disneyland monorail.

872
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,960
So it's actually changed, changed.

873
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,960
Oh, and here we go.

874
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,500
Lee Greenwood and Sandy Patty.

875
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,160
Sandy Patty was in the one that I talked about last year.

876
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,380
There's a lot of them.

877
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:46,200
Yeah. Sandy Patty, I did not rediscover and reappreciate like Patty LaBelle.

878
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,660
Yeah. If there's good Sandy Patty music, I'm unfamiliar with it.

879
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,060
It's probably all it's all gospel and standards, right?

880
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,400
I guess so. Like, yeah.

881
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,120
Which, you know, I have that she's probably a nice person.

882
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,340
She's a good singer.

883
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,680
She I don't remember what she's wearing in this,

884
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,600
but I think it's like a sparkly bag.

885
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:09,220
But all the women in these specials were wearing sparkly bags.

886
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,180
Any 90s special is sparkly bags front to back.

887
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,420
Disney characters in Epcot.

888
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,180
I don't know about this.

889
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,240
What Bart is a little Bart.

890
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,560
Hey, yeah. Whoa.

891
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,360
Fry. What? No. What's his name?

892
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,320
Is it a turtle?

893
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,340
You can see the cultural divide forming

894
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,440
non Disney characters on the shirts for the first time ever.

895
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,600
Yeah, they brought the turtles into the fold, but not until 2019

896
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,320
would Bart Simpson join the Disney family.

897
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,080
What's going to that's one of those.

898
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,540
We you know, you don't have any time to like process this and think about it.

899
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,080
Bart, can they start using Bart? Yes.

900
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,500
But what happens in January?

901
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,520
First Bart?

902
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,420
Well, that's a good question.

903
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,780
I wonder maybe if it's a similar thing to the Marvel deal

904
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,440
where they can't use Bart in the parks. Maybe.

905
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,580
But maybe like somewhere where it's Simpsons,

906
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,700
is there a universal park where they don't have Simpsons?

907
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,880
Maybe internationally, internationally, maybe an international park.

908
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,860
Like Tokyo, just Simpsons in Tokyo.

909
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:12,880
Or is it still?

910
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,480
I'm not sure.

911
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,300
I can't remember.

912
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,200
Do the Simpsons rate in Japan?

913
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:17,860
Yeah, I don't know.

914
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,820
Anyone care about the Simpsons?

915
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,620
Well, clearly what they have to do is take all the Simpsons rides out,

916
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,460
move them to Disney parks and let the characters walk around

917
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,540
and bring back the back to the future ride.

918
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,820
There's only one choice. Yeah.

919
00:42:35,584 --> 00:42:39,924
Now, there's a lot of serious parts of these which we can't make fun of, so...

920
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:44,384
No, but there was a very funny slow push in on Joan London.

921
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:45,884
And like...

922
00:42:45,884 --> 00:42:46,644
Push ins are fair game.

923
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:50,924
Yeah, it's... I gotta say, very smooth, practical push in.

924
00:42:51,164 --> 00:42:54,764
Like, a very... They had pros working these cameras, except for that weird shaky one.

925
00:42:55,224 --> 00:42:57,664
And I can make fun of her jacket that looks like a big strawberry.

926
00:42:58,044 --> 00:42:58,544
Mm-hmm.

927
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:02,564
I assume I and Bialik, they were like, we...

928
00:43:02,564 --> 00:43:06,744
Maybe kids will want to see someone closer to their own age hosting these things,

929
00:43:06,744 --> 00:43:08,664
and that's why they tried her out.

930
00:43:08,924 --> 00:43:11,244
Well, did Disney produce Blossom?

931
00:43:12,044 --> 00:43:12,644
Was it ABC?

932
00:43:13,444 --> 00:43:14,844
You know what? I think it was NBC.

933
00:43:15,484 --> 00:43:18,484
I think it was NBC, because it had the relationship with NBC at the time.

934
00:43:18,784 --> 00:43:22,304
You'd have that cool old graphic, the NBC productions.

935
00:43:22,704 --> 00:43:23,864
Oh, yeah.

936
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:30,344
But Blossom did visit...

937
00:43:32,204 --> 00:43:32,664
Um...

938
00:43:32,664 --> 00:43:32,904
Disneyland.

939
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:37,864
Which we also have to do commentary on at some point, with this bizarre scene where

940
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:41,764
people are just chucking shit out of the skyway and nobody does anything about it.

941
00:43:45,784 --> 00:43:48,424
Oh, now here we got another reason why this is appropriate.

942
00:43:48,704 --> 00:43:51,944
The recently passed away...

943
00:43:51,944 --> 00:43:54,684
You're probably still seeing half-mast flags.

944
00:43:54,984 --> 00:43:57,264
That flags are half-mast all month, apparently.

945
00:43:57,604 --> 00:43:58,324
For George Bush.

946
00:43:58,484 --> 00:43:58,884
Did every...

947
00:43:58,884 --> 00:43:59,744
There he is.

948
00:44:00,044 --> 00:44:02,604
Did Ford and Reagan also go to Epcot?

949
00:44:03,504 --> 00:44:05,824
I think a lot of presidents have been to Epcot.

950
00:44:06,564 --> 00:44:08,964
Yeah, Ford I'm not totally confident, but...

951
00:44:08,964 --> 00:44:11,964
And Trump will be there when Guardians of the Galaxy roller coaster opens.

952
00:44:12,804 --> 00:44:14,644
Did you see a picture of that show building at night?

953
00:44:15,024 --> 00:44:16,084
Is it lit up?

954
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:18,604
It's lit, like it's lit because they're doing construction on it.

955
00:44:18,604 --> 00:44:20,004
It is so big.

956
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:21,104
Pretty massive, yeah.

957
00:44:21,304 --> 00:44:22,064
It's crazy.

958
00:44:23,324 --> 00:44:23,704
It is.

959
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:26,824
It's almost as bright as a thousand points of light.

960
00:44:27,744 --> 00:44:32,204
Glasses Bush is wearing in this have come back into fashion, so...

961
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:33,564
Yeah, kind of though.

962
00:44:33,644 --> 00:44:34,424
Kind of.

963
00:44:36,344 --> 00:44:41,024
His son eulogizing him, called him the brightest point of light.

964
00:44:42,684 --> 00:44:44,944
And now also wearing a sparkly bag.

965
00:44:45,484 --> 00:44:47,984
Well, that sparkly jacket has also come back into fashion.

966
00:44:48,524 --> 00:44:52,924
Everyone, anyone watching this for attention, please just look at his bleak greenwoods mouth.

967
00:44:53,604 --> 00:44:55,384
He has a quiver, a quiver.

968
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:55,924
Yeah.

969
00:44:56,324 --> 00:44:56,964
There she is.

970
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:57,844
There's the bag.

971
00:44:58,204 --> 00:44:58,944
There's the bell and balls.

972
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:01,344
It's not sparkly, it's just...

973
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:06,384
Just a blouse, blouse and a jacket, a blazer.

974
00:45:08,744 --> 00:45:16,284
You know what I think is nice is that all our presidents, regardless of political affiliations

975
00:45:16,284 --> 00:45:20,804
on all sides of the aisle, all of their favorite musical artist is Lee Greenwood.

976
00:45:21,424 --> 00:45:23,464
And has always been.

977
00:45:24,004 --> 00:45:27,364
Donald Trump, before it was even a glimmer in his eyes that he'd be the president,

978
00:45:27,484 --> 00:45:29,324
he's always loved Lee Greenwood.

979
00:45:29,444 --> 00:45:31,424
And I know this, I know this is true.

980
00:45:31,924 --> 00:45:33,144
Obama loved Lee Greenwood, too.

981
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:34,264
Of course.

982
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:39,264
Obama loves, you know, Jay-Z and probably like Nina Simone and stuff.

983
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:39,844
And Wilco.

984
00:45:39,984 --> 00:45:40,724
He loved Wilco.

985
00:45:40,724 --> 00:45:44,544
Wilco and for sure Lee Greenwood.

986
00:45:45,304 --> 00:45:46,584
Let me be clear.

987
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:50,184
Number one in my book, gotta be Lee Greenwood.

988
00:45:50,844 --> 00:45:51,664
That guy can belt.

989
00:45:51,844 --> 00:45:52,564
Got him elected.

990
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:53,604
Got him elected.

991
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:57,084
Lee Greenwood also, I think he has got the long enough mullet thing in the back that

992
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:59,204
it should have been a pony, a little tiny pony.

993
00:46:00,044 --> 00:46:02,144
It definitely shows that everyone had.

994
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:04,364
Barbara enjoying.

995
00:46:04,684 --> 00:46:06,104
They're laughing at the song.

996
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:09,584
That feels like a shot where they were just like, we need a quick insert of you guys looking

997
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:10,044
happy.

998
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:10,984
So they went to.

999
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:12,384
And they're there.

1000
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:13,924
It's the ring of hope.

1001
00:46:15,224 --> 00:46:17,764
You know, there's a family off to the side going like,

1002
00:46:18,184 --> 00:46:21,984
are all these fucking chairs gonna, are they not going to do illuminations tonight?

1003
00:46:22,164 --> 00:46:22,884
What the hell?

1004
00:46:28,784 --> 00:46:30,344
Oh, things like this.

1005
00:46:30,344 --> 00:46:36,084
Reminder for the anniversary, the year of the, what would that have been, 25th anniversary?

1006
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:38,644
With Sandy Patty doing the parade.

1007
00:46:38,984 --> 00:46:44,224
She sang a medley of an original song called Remember the Magic and Zippity Doo Dah sort

1008
00:46:44,224 --> 00:46:46,224
of mushed together.

1009
00:46:49,444 --> 00:46:51,164
Do, I do, I do, I do.

1010
00:46:51,644 --> 00:46:52,864
Did they point at us?

1011
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:55,084
I think she missed us.

1012
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:58,364
That's from like earlier when they were listening to a speech or something.

1013
00:46:58,424 --> 00:47:01,124
Yeah, that's not how you respond to a music performance.

1014
00:47:01,424 --> 00:47:01,824
Yeah.

1015
00:47:02,304 --> 00:47:04,464
Watch his vibrato again here.

1016
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,724
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

1017
00:47:07,184 --> 00:47:09,644
He's like a chattering teeth or something.

1018
00:47:09,764 --> 00:47:11,164
He's a wind up toy.

1019
00:47:11,444 --> 00:47:11,884
Yeah.

1020
00:47:13,704 --> 00:47:14,984
Good job, guys.

1021
00:47:15,864 --> 00:47:17,124
No fireworks at the end.

1022
00:47:17,184 --> 00:47:18,364
Those are mid fireworks.

1023
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:24,124
They should have done this on the stage with Ben Franklin and Mark Twain shaking hands.

1024
00:47:25,204 --> 00:47:28,004
They should have brought him outside for the first time ever.

1025
00:47:28,564 --> 00:47:33,104
Here we go, the Yacht and Beach Club, another brand new Disney innovation.

1026
00:47:33,424 --> 00:47:35,084
This was the time.

1027
00:47:35,784 --> 00:47:36,944
And you know who did it all?

1028
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,124
Michael Eisner.

1029
00:47:38,544 --> 00:47:40,404
God bless Michael Eisner.

1030
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,224
He's the brightest guy in this holiday season.

1031
00:47:42,524 --> 00:47:43,784
God bless Michael Eisner.

1032
00:47:44,544 --> 00:47:45,264
King Michael.

1033
00:47:46,844 --> 00:47:50,044
Hmm, what's happening here?

1034
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:52,564
Just getting a Bambi clip.

1035
00:47:56,184 --> 00:47:59,664
Seeing Bambi in the room font is very unsettling.

1036
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:00,464
Yeah.

1037
00:48:01,184 --> 00:48:07,084
God, I don't think I realized Bambi was released in 1942 in the middle of a world war.

1038
00:48:08,664 --> 00:48:09,824
It's what the world needed.

1039
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,140
I don't, I ate him.

1040
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,000
Never seen it!

1041
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:25,712
I shot his mother!

1042
00:48:26,772 --> 00:48:28,152
I was 50 when it came out!

1043
00:48:34,424 --> 00:48:34,924
Uh oh.

1044
00:48:34,944 --> 00:48:35,744
Oh, we don't say.

1045
00:48:36,324 --> 00:48:36,964
Well, well.

1046
00:48:37,064 --> 00:48:42,484
So any dads being made to watch this by their kids.

1047
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:46,144
They waited till 40 minutes in to show the Disney girls.

1048
00:48:46,864 --> 00:48:48,784
Children, did that just mean the daughters, the Disney?

1049
00:48:49,284 --> 00:48:52,124
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1050
00:48:52,244 --> 00:48:54,164
The Scarecrow Jordan Crane has escaped from Markham.

1051
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:55,984
Did you call him Jordan Crane?

1052
00:48:56,484 --> 00:48:57,804
The Scarecrow, isn't it Jordan?

1053
00:48:57,904 --> 00:48:59,964
Jonathan Crane, Jason, come on.

1054
00:48:59,964 --> 00:49:00,344
Are you sure?

1055
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:02,564
I'm 100% sure it's not Jordan Crane.

1056
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,444
The Scarecrow is not Jordan.

1057
00:49:05,664 --> 00:49:07,264
It's not Jonathan Kane.

1058
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:09,524
No, that's the keyboard player from Journey.

1059
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:11,044
Jordan, that's not Jordan.

1060
00:49:11,584 --> 00:49:13,624
Jordan Crane is, I looked up Jordan Crane

1061
00:49:13,624 --> 00:49:15,324
as an American comic book creator.

1062
00:49:15,344 --> 00:49:19,044
Okay, that's why I conflated the cartoonish Jordan Crane

1063
00:49:19,044 --> 00:49:21,484
with the an actual character.

1064
00:49:22,984 --> 00:49:25,144
So this is,

1065
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,960
I think they're not pushing the Brairs outside of Splash Mountain.

1066
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,220
Oh, here they-

1067
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:35,780
These days.

1068
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,720
These days.

1069
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,100
They said it's the 40th- celebrating the 40th anniversary.

1070
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:45,280
There's a resurgence though of merch with the characters.

1071
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,120
The characters, yeah.

1072
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,720
Oh, because that toy that I have now.

1073
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,860
But then also like shirts and stuff use the Brair Rabbit and Brair Fox and Brair Bear characters.

1074
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,080
With no mention of the film.

1075
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,040
Okay, I see Scrooge.

1076
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,140
I see Gadget.

1077
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:00,540
Oh.

1078
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,400
And Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy.

1079
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,540
Are they public domain?

1080
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,260
I don't know.

1081
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,040
Can we make a movie right now?

1082
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:10,960
That is amazing.

1083
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,620
We haven't seen a Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy universe.

1084
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,600
I will admit this, childhood crush on Gadget.

1085
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,260
I thought you were gonna say Raggedy Ann.

1086
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,880
That's smart, Jason's slaying.

1087
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,340
Yeah, I know.

1088
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,160
That seems like a Jason thing.

1089
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,540
That's like Nancy or something.

1090
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,420
Jason, well Jason is Sluggo.

1091
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,040
I don't think you said you have a crush on Nancy.

1092
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,140
No, we're very related.

1093
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,680
I read a Nancy comic last night where she is telling an ice cream scooper to mix the

1094
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,500
Rocky Road and Nango flavors together.

1095
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,480
And I was like, yes, that sounds good.

1096
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,880
But you are Nancy's boyfriend, Jason.

1097
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:45,720
Sluggo.

1098
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,380
Sluggo, yeah.

1099
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,560
Yeah.

1100
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,500
Yeah, Gadget is cool.

1101
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,380
I let- well, and I just learned that Gadget was based on the love interest in the movie

1102
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,220
Real Genius with Val Kilmer.

1103
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,000
Okay.

1104
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,440
Interesting.

1105
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,360
Right, that's Val Kilmer.

1106
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:10,020
But that's kind of a crushable character also, sort of like hyper smart, cool nerd girl.

1107
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:17,340
But then also the trope of the male characters are short and stout and cute and then the

1108
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,980
female character is sexy.

1109
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,300
Yeah.

1110
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,880
Like she falls into that trap too.

1111
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,140
Oh, you mean like within Rescue Rangers?

1112
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:23,580
Yes.

1113
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:28,900
Rescue Rangers, but yeah, like Lola Bunny and Space Jam and many other examples.

1114
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,140
Lola Bunny is kind of attractive.

1115
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,160
Short and stout.

1116
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,020
Kind of attractive.

1117
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,660
Don't Google Lola Bunny because it's mostly smut.

1118
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:38,980
It's mostly people-

1119
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,080
Smut.

1120
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,120
It's mostly people drawing filthy things.

1121
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:41,740
See, I think-

1122
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,760
Maudie smut.

1123
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:51,740
I think- is Lola Bunny to young men as Fox Robin Hood is to young women, at least of

1124
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,140
our generation?

1125
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,640
I don't know.

1126
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,140
I haven't- my generation.

1127
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,320
No, I wouldn't say.

1128
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,720
Not as many men have expressed that, I think.

1129
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,040
I think of- what's her face from Goofy movie?

1130
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:02,680
Peg?

1131
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,260
From- oh, the girl from Goofy.

1132
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,340
The girl from Goofy movie.

1133
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,960
That Max is trying-

1134
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,220
Peace wife Peg, I believe is what I was looking for.

1135
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,440
What's her name?

1136
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:10,880
Roxanne.

1137
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,540
Roxanne.

1138
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,740
Yeah, I liked Roxanne.

1139
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,940
Yeah, there is a certain- for sure, Goofy movie, we've talked about how horny it is.

1140
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,300
It's so unsettling to watch Roxanne.

1141
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,780
We're watching these shots of this doe-eyed, sexy dog.

1142
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,780
Who's like 12, or 14, or 15.

1143
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,580
Yeah, it is weird.

1144
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:33,460
But back then, it was- as when you're coming of age, I don't know, it's still- it's odd.

1145
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,200
The sexuality surrounding the Goofy movie is very weird.

1146
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,240
I don't deny it's there.

1147
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,540
I think it is why it's so popular- part of why it's so popular in addition to the songs.

1148
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,040
Clips from Beauty and the Beast playing right now.

1149
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,560
I gotta say, Beauty and the Beast still looks great.

1150
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,580
It still looks really good.

1151
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:55,060
We were watching it a couple years ago and it's- the Gaston song is so much funnier than

1152
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,380
I even remember it being.

1153
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,040
Yeah.

1154
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,160
Like it plays so well.

1155
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,920
And obviously the live action, every bit as fun.

1156
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,060
Silence.

1157
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:05,840
Silence.

1158
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,480
Silence.

1159
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,660
Silence.

1160
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,820
Now this, I love Chip and Mrs. Potts.

1161
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,180
Yeah.

1162
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,580
Here's the media applause I was talking about.

1163
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,000
Start of the song, let's applaud.

1164
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,640
The Chip and Mrs. Potts, same size as Belle.

1165
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,080
So crazy.

1166
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,880
And the Beast, they are the same.

1167
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,800
Now I don't know what else they would do.

1168
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,420
I don't know how else they represent any of this.

1169
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,180
But I love- I love them all.

1170
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,640
She makes me laugh.

1171
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,700
That was another really cool costume.

1172
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,300
Big Mrs. Potts is very funny.

1173
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,800
Like a parfait into like a lady in an elegant gown.

1174
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,180
Another cool practical effect.

1175
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:45,720
That was cool.

1176
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,800
That's- Katy Perry did a thing like that on a tour.

1177
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,660
That went in the hot and cold number.

1178
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:51,860
Oh, sure.

1179
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,780
Like the- it was like the immediately changing costumes.

1180
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,360
This was- and wouldn't it happen without this Beauty and the Beast live show?

1181
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,580
They turned this live show around really quick.

1182
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,180
They still do this show.

1183
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:05,900
Yes.

1184
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,440
In Hollywood studios.

1185
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,080
God, really?

1186
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:08,880
Yeah.

1187
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,880
The longest running theatrical production.

1188
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,080
Is this where there's a Cars show going in?

1189
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,180
Am I crazy?

1190
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,120
There's a Cars show going in, but I don't know if it's replacing this.

1191
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,120
I don't know if it's replacing this.

1192
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,800
Maybe replacing this.

1193
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,460
Better not be.

1194
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,000
I want this greatest hits musical that is fine.

1195
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,040
We did see this years ago.

1196
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,500
There are so many shows in Hollywood studios that you don't even realize.

1197
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,160
Gaston looks like a Fred Armisen character in this.

1198
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,960
Yes, that's true.

1199
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,060
I will say he's not as strong as like the recent- when you see the Gaston viral video

1200
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:43,480
of him doing push-ups or challenging some like tourist, they always get like a real

1201
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,160
hunky.

1202
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,000
I apologize.

1203
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,760
And then immediately the song about, something has changed.

1204
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,720
He was just screaming at her.

1205
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:54,960
And then one line later-

1206
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,760
It's also in the movie too where you're like, what actually changed?

1207
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:04,460
He's a literal monster screaming in my face, throwing plates around.

1208
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,180
But I was not scared of the walker.

1209
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:11,340
I know I have a picture at home back in Pennsylvania of me and walk around beast.

1210
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,840
I'll have to see if I can dig that up.

1211
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,280
Wow, really?

1212
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,020
Yeah.

1213
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,040
And maybe the turtles too.

1214
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:23,320
Also high up on Aaron's cute character list along with giant Mrs. Potts and at the top

1215
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:29,780
of Cinderella mice, the costumed beast is like kind of-

1216
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:35,400
Still, new iterations of it are kind of- he just looks so simple and dumb and watching

1217
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,140
him wave.

1218
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,000
I feel like he doesn't have a lot of faculties about him.

1219
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,480
You guys got to be our guest.

1220
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,260
Take a picture with him in his castle.

1221
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,580
In the restaurant?

1222
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:45,540
Yeah.

1223
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,600
Yeah.

1224
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,440
I'll reserve that at a time.

1225
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,380
I'll reserve it now for 18 months from now.

1226
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,780
I mean, you can get it if you check every day.

1227
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,640
All right.

1228
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,120
But also breakfast.

1229
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,740
They have breakfast now.

1230
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,580
I think it's easier to get in.

1231
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,600
Here she is.

1232
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,280
That was my girlfriend now.

1233
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,460
I didn't change in this one.

1234
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,420
He doesn't change, but he doesn't really change.

1235
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,740
The only thing he changes is that he gets really badly hurt in the movie because he

1236
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,840
saves Belle in the woods and then she like nurses him back to hell.

1237
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,740
So when he's weak, it's kind of like a phantom threat.

1238
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,480
It's a lot like that now that I think about it.

1239
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,440
It's like she likes him when he's weak, yet is almost vulnerable because he's not such

1240
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,520
a raging monster.

1241
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,360
Once every couple of months, I will send a pack of wolves after you.

1242
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,080
They will bite you up and I will take care of you.

1243
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:37,880
My hungry boy.

1244
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:38,720
My hungry boy.

1245
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,640
My hungry beast.

1246
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,500
That beast is one lucky beast.

1247
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,860
Does that make Mrs. Potts almost?

1248
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,840
Thank you.

1249
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:51,800
All right.

1250
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,100
Did you see what I did?

1251
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:53,860
I gave her a rose.

1252
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,340
No one wants to see the hideous post-transformation beat.

1253
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:02,380
No one wants to see man beast from the end because he looks like a weirdo.

1254
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,480
You know what he does?

1255
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,900
It's like Michael Bolton.

1256
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,680
He's like early 90s Michael Bolton.

1257
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,900
Who was the standard of handsomeness at the time?

1258
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:15,560
In that video of the ride coming to Tokyo Disney, when they're in the dancing room,

1259
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,320
it's the human beast for some weird reason.

1260
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:25,820
They see that video out and then determine, I hope fans yell and we get that turned into

1261
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,280
the beast.

1262
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,160
She's in the dress from the dance.

1263
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,140
That's not when he's a human.

1264
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,360
It'd be cool to see both.

1265
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,540
It'd be cool if they could transform it.

1266
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:36,560
Sure.

1267
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,200
I mean, I'm sure they can.

1268
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,480
Oh, now here we go.

1269
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,060
Oh, it's a party.

1270
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,620
Now this I know is up Lindsay's alley.

1271
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,900
I'm more of a recent party convert.

1272
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,560
She's going to get home from work in a second, but she knows one of which, what's the member

1273
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,000
that she?

1274
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,240
She's the one on the far right.

1275
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,100
I forget her name.

1276
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,020
Yeah, the one who does voices on Cartoon Network.

1277
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,720
Was the party on Disney 3D?

1278
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,920
She's hung out with one fifth of the party.

1279
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,400
This is a perfectly mediocre.

1280
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,500
Oh, that weasely red hair guy on the end.

1281
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:14,240
He's like Bobby Budnick and like all the, a lot of the McAllister's who aren't Kevin

1282
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:14,940
and all the run.

1283
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:18,180
This was quite a time to be a red haired weasel.

1284
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,600
It was, yes, that was in at this point.

1285
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,440
Yeah, there hasn't been a good one of those in the movie in a while.

1286
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,240
I saw one of the kid who used to do that.

1287
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,080
He's been in many prominent movies and he don't remember his name, but I saw him at

1288
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:35,520
like a couple of commercial auditions and I was like, it's not one of the red haired

1289
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,500
weasels of the era.

1290
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:36,940
Yeah.

1291
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:42,100
And I forget who it was, but I was like, Oh no, man, you're at the same pizza audition

1292
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,340
that that was.

1293
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,600
Everybody's got to work.

1294
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:46,480
Sure.

1295
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:51,580
No, I mean all the guys we know who look the same, you know, the big stocky guys are always

1296
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:56,140
on auditions with the who's the from the Mighty Ducks.

1297
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,560
Oh, right.

1298
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:57,920
Yes.

1299
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:58,220
Oh, wait.

1300
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,500
Or am I thinking of the salute your shorts, dude?

1301
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,160
Yeah.

1302
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:02,580
Donkey.

1303
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,180
Yeah.

1304
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:03,820
Yeah.

1305
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:04,220
Yeah.

1306
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:04,460
Yeah.

1307
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:08,820
I think the Mondays of the world are donkey lips.

1308
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,960
Just flashed a 71 degrees bug in the corner also said live.

1309
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,920
So again, I don't know if that's kayfabe live or live live.

1310
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,380
So maybe elements of it.

1311
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:22,760
Yeah.

1312
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:27,280
Like some because they why would you include those shaky shots if not?

1313
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,120
That's true.

1314
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,600
Yeah.

1315
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:36,180
So our fruits that fell off of Minnie's float that they picked up and are following.

1316
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:41,260
It looks like Chip is controlling that car.

1317
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,360
Yeah.

1318
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,820
A lot of these are kind of like marvels of mechanics.

1319
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:50,700
Yeah.

1320
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,120
Like if you watch specials where you see like somebody having to crouch in the bottom of

1321
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,740
an electrical parade, you drive around the bugs.

1322
00:59:59,400 --> 00:59:59,900
That's yes.

1323
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:00,320
Yeah.

1324
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:00,480
Yeah.

1325
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:00,660
Yeah.

1326
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,340
That's really crazy.

1327
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,880
The way they can do more shaky as more shaky Pluto.

1328
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,260
The Pluto is a helicopter.

1329
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,880
This has to be a helicopter.

1330
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,480
There's nothing that tall right there.

1331
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:16,820
And the well, they could have set up a temporary scaffolding and looks high though to be a

1332
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,300
scaffold.

1333
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:24,040
And also, kids in matching sweatsuits and fanny packs and Plutus, they're going nuts

1334
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:24,740
for Pluto.

1335
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,120
They love Pluto.

1336
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,360
Country bears are in there too.

1337
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:28,800
Oh yeah.

1338
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,360
Holy shit.

1339
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,220
That's something.

1340
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,040
I would like those variants, those plush.

1341
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:39,500
But there's no there should be a Mardi Gras country bear special in Tokyo.

1342
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:44,800
They should bring back these like inflatable, not these exact ones, but no reason they couldn't

1343
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,780
do like inflatable floats again.

1344
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:52,000
They should do every they should keep as soon as a holiday becomes like newly popular, like

1345
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Day of the Dead.

1346
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:53,860
Oh yeah.

1347
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,520
The country bears should hit it.

1348
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,260
There should be.

1349
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,160
There should be a different show every month for the country bears in Tokyo.

1350
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,680
How about like CGI movie or show of country bears?

1351
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:15,880
Like using those designs, like making sure it feels like and if you did it where they

1352
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:20,860
or this way that the Spider-Man, the Spider-Verse moves.

1353
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:25,500
If you did like a cool new type of animation for country bears.

1354
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:26,760
Sure that's great.

1355
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,660
Potentially a strong.

1356
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,600
My pitch, I guess my my legit pitch is Prairie Home Companion, but country bears.

1357
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:40,060
So like a live concert event where they kind of read scenes off of music stands.

1358
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,680
But I like that.

1359
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,900
I like it animated too.

1360
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:47,600
As opposed to being a radio show for four hours.

1361
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,380
I mean, like the movie country movie Prairie Home Companion.

1362
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,300
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1363
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,400
Because it is what it is.

1364
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,140
It's just a better show than Prairie Home Companion.

1365
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:55,840
No offense, Jason.

1366
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,260
I don't care.

1367
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,940
Well, they only have 17 minutes to fill out with.

1368
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,560
I forget what the name is now with Chris Thiele.

1369
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,600
Yeah, it's still going right.

1370
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:09,460
Garrison Keeler was Garrison Keeler was bid adieu.

1371
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:10,980
Um.

1372
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:16,200
This has to be a helicopter because it's shaky and that's such a high point.

1373
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,200
My go.

1374
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,440
How you doing, goof?

1375
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:25,260
But you got to admire the use of the goofy cam.

1376
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,460
Yeah, yeah.

1377
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,860
That's how you'd see it there hanging off of.

1378
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,520
This was not a GoPro era.

1379
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,960
That was a hard shot to get.

1380
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:32,240
Yeah.

1381
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,620
In 1991, who were my favorite character was goofy.

1382
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:39,000
Well, who were your favorites of the main cast?

1383
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,820
I guess I would say goofy to.

1384
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,120
Yeah, it was good.

1385
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,200
OK, because I was obsessed with goofy.

1386
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,680
He's like, you know, everybody loved Michelangelo.

1387
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,100
Yes, it's an easy kid thing.

1388
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,000
Yeah, just the funny one.

1389
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:57,900
I like the more Amsterdam on the Dick Van Dyke show, the best.

1390
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:58,560
Sure, sure.

1391
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:02,500
And it's probably why I loved Mike Love.

1392
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,660
He was the funny one of the funny one of the boys.

1393
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,100
Oh, baby.

1394
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,680
This is Disney Girls.

1395
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,020
Now I understand.

1396
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:15,540
Which is because there is a Beach Boys song called Disney Girls, confusingly.

1397
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:16,740
But that's not this.

1398
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,000
Different hotels.

1399
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,000
This is made in a lab for for you.

1400
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,100
Yeah, yeah.

1401
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,020
The difference between the Dixie Landings girl.

1402
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,060
This is like a parody.

1403
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,800
I would write and perform to no response.

1404
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,020
Saratoga Springs is.

1405
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:45,248
Imagine that, that there were enough hotels at this time to do every all the verses of California girls.

1406
01:03:45,268 --> 01:03:47,188
Typhoon Lagoon.

1407
01:03:47,348 --> 01:03:50,328
And this is more produced than anything on the special so far.

1408
01:03:50,608 --> 01:03:51,008
Yeah.

1409
01:03:51,408 --> 01:03:54,128
A lot of money was spent. Yeah, so many dancers.

1410
01:03:57,408 --> 01:03:58,388
A lot of stress.

1411
01:03:58,988 --> 01:03:59,408
Yeah.

1412
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:01,208
Characters in hot suits.

1413
01:04:01,468 --> 01:04:05,088
And like, they had to recruit a lot of like, women in bathing suits.

1414
01:04:05,568 --> 01:04:11,448
Like, there's a whole, like, do you want to be in this non-union Disney special for no money?

1415
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:12,388
We don't know that.

1416
01:04:12,668 --> 01:04:12,928
What do you mean?

1417
01:04:12,928 --> 01:04:14,528
Maybe they treated these people right.

1418
01:04:14,828 --> 01:04:15,388
I bet they did.

1419
01:04:15,388 --> 01:04:17,488
Or maybe they were just like, well, yeah, yeah.

1420
01:04:19,028 --> 01:04:21,028
I'm trying to get a lot of money for the dad.

1421
01:04:21,288 --> 01:04:25,408
There's too many people in this for them to have been paid what they deserve.

1422
01:04:27,348 --> 01:04:27,748
Yeah.

1423
01:04:28,428 --> 01:04:28,748
Damn.

1424
01:04:29,328 --> 01:04:33,668
I'm seeing a Brian Wilson Christmas concert very soon.

1425
01:04:33,668 --> 01:04:35,488
It will have happened by the time this comes out.

1426
01:04:35,988 --> 01:04:37,808
Performing the Christmas album in full.

1427
01:04:38,288 --> 01:04:39,988
So, you know, Frosty the Snowman.

1428
01:04:41,648 --> 01:04:42,708
All playing sign.

1429
01:04:42,968 --> 01:04:44,088
Oh, there's some hunks.

1430
01:04:44,188 --> 01:04:45,628
There's a little hunt right at the end.

1431
01:04:46,468 --> 01:04:47,768
A little something for the ladies.

1432
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,856
Girls, girls, girls.

1433
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:57,496
Elk Grove, California.

1434
01:04:57,956 --> 01:05:00,116
I did like when they would show like,

1435
01:05:00,116 --> 01:05:01,656
hi, we're regular people,

1436
01:05:01,876 --> 01:05:03,976
regular folks in the clothes we wore to the park

1437
01:05:03,976 --> 01:05:04,736
and we're here.

1438
01:05:04,796 --> 01:05:07,156
Nowadays, I feel like everyone's pretty looking.

1439
01:05:08,036 --> 01:05:10,236
What a dream it would have been to have been in this space.

1440
01:05:10,436 --> 01:05:12,236
We'd all be showing that to everyone.

1441
01:05:12,236 --> 01:05:13,636
Oh yeah, here we go.

1442
01:05:13,656 --> 01:05:14,596
Here we go.

1443
01:05:17,616 --> 01:05:18,536
Euro Disney.

1444
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:19,356
Euro.

1445
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,456
You who are whole.

1446
01:05:22,936 --> 01:05:23,476
Okay.

1447
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:26,936
As we've said before,

1448
01:05:27,276 --> 01:05:29,936
the idea of Euro,

1449
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:33,596
like it may as well have been on another planet to me.

1450
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:34,456
Yeah, yeah.

1451
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:36,756
I mean Disneyland, we said that about Disneyland

1452
01:05:36,756 --> 01:05:37,976
and Anaheim growing up.

1453
01:05:38,536 --> 01:05:40,336
Well, as I said, we only went to Florida

1454
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,796
and that was the only place I would ever go in my whole life.

1455
01:05:42,796 --> 01:05:44,996
I was gonna be in Illinois or Florida,

1456
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,956
Florida every four years and live in Illinois

1457
01:05:48,036 --> 01:05:49,296
and that would be it.

1458
01:05:49,476 --> 01:05:50,796
But you added a third place.

1459
01:05:51,136 --> 01:05:52,036
Yeah, this is what I did.

1460
01:05:52,056 --> 01:05:55,796
We walked to this, basically this formation, I think,

1461
01:05:55,816 --> 01:05:57,156
like this path is what I meant.

1462
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:57,856
I see.

1463
01:05:59,036 --> 01:05:59,576
And what'd you play?

1464
01:05:59,576 --> 01:06:00,476
There's a video trumpet.

1465
01:06:00,636 --> 01:06:01,556
I was in the front.

1466
01:06:01,896 --> 01:06:02,916
I was in the front line.

1467
01:06:03,896 --> 01:06:07,096
And my mom was there and she was taking a video

1468
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,816
and she got caught in the middle of the marching band.

1469
01:06:10,076 --> 01:06:12,736
There's a video of her like realizing she's like

1470
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:16,496
in the path and then the video camera drops and like runs.

1471
01:06:17,216 --> 01:06:18,876
Did she lose the camera?

1472
01:06:18,876 --> 01:06:21,076
No, I think the footage exists,

1473
01:06:21,396 --> 01:06:23,736
so we'll find that at a certain point.

1474
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:24,336
That's movie hijinks.

1475
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:26,476
That's what happens in the Sesame Street movie,

1476
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:27,476
Follow That Bird.

1477
01:06:27,576 --> 01:06:28,596
Oh yeah, yeah.

1478
01:06:29,336 --> 01:06:32,376
That's a good way to create tension in any situation.

1479
01:06:32,396 --> 01:06:33,576
If you're writing a movie,

1480
01:06:34,216 --> 01:06:36,676
set it, get people mixed up in a marching band.

1481
01:06:36,696 --> 01:06:39,256
That's a great way to delay things.

1482
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:41,976
Physical gags present themselves.

1483
01:06:42,116 --> 01:06:43,076
Somebody gets stuck in a tuba.

1484
01:06:43,096 --> 01:06:44,936
There's a really perplexed older couple.

1485
01:06:44,936 --> 01:06:45,696
Yeah, that was great.

1486
01:06:45,696 --> 01:06:47,936
That woman in the red who would just like walk in

1487
01:06:47,936 --> 01:06:49,096
was like, what are they doing here?

1488
01:06:49,396 --> 01:06:51,076
Everyone looks confused and mad

1489
01:06:51,076 --> 01:06:52,796
at this TV production happening.

1490
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:59,764
Maybe somebody just said like, hey, can you stand in the background for a sec?

1491
01:06:59,804 --> 01:07:04,364
And then like, you know, hour and a half later, they're not letting them leave.

1492
01:07:04,444 --> 01:07:07,024
Is that that little girl Flower from the TV show Flower?

1493
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:11,144
I would like to share, can I share a text I just got from my mom?

1494
01:07:11,984 --> 01:07:15,084
Colorized I love Lucy and Dick Van Dyke on CBS tonight.

1495
01:07:15,444 --> 01:07:18,104
On here now, almost forgot, tape or watch it.

1496
01:07:19,664 --> 01:07:21,304
That's not dissimilar.

1497
01:07:22,124 --> 01:07:27,084
I don't think I've said on the podcast how my dad does an impression of Robert Wagner

1498
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:31,344
in whatever show Robert Wagner was on in the 60s.

1499
01:07:31,344 --> 01:07:32,664
Yeah, yeah.

1500
01:07:32,664 --> 01:07:35,024
Let's take the boat out.

1501
01:07:35,024 --> 01:07:35,904
I'm not sure.

1502
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:37,864
It's not heart to heart? Is it heart to heart?

1503
01:07:38,044 --> 01:07:39,284
No, I forget what it is.

1504
01:07:39,284 --> 01:07:39,964
Who is heart to heart?

1505
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:41,324
My daughter is in love with Mickey.

1506
01:07:41,944 --> 01:07:45,884
But no, but he, yeah, this is like a party trick my dad pulls out is saying,

1507
01:07:46,244 --> 01:07:47,904
no, let me get this straight.

1508
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,784
And I'm and like you can watch, I've watched as the years have gone on,

1509
01:07:51,804 --> 01:07:54,224
people lose recognition of now let me get this.

1510
01:07:54,224 --> 01:07:55,944
Heart to heart was Robert Wagner, but this is later.

1511
01:07:56,284 --> 01:07:56,664
60 shows.

1512
01:07:56,804 --> 01:07:58,804
Yeah, it was like to catch a thief or something.

1513
01:07:58,904 --> 01:07:59,284
Okay.

1514
01:07:59,764 --> 01:08:04,644
But my dad's real confident about now let me get this straight being like the hook of

1515
01:08:04,644 --> 01:08:05,284
Robert Wagner.

1516
01:08:05,604 --> 01:08:09,984
And I love that as I'm not sure I've ever seen this performed by him in reality.

1517
01:08:10,324 --> 01:08:12,824
I don't know where it comes from, but he still does it all the time.

1518
01:08:13,284 --> 01:08:14,364
I do like it.

1519
01:08:14,404 --> 01:08:14,724
Sure.

1520
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,064
Now let me get this straight.

1521
01:08:17,004 --> 01:08:19,944
This is very smart on their part.

1522
01:08:20,084 --> 01:08:25,884
I mean, I don't know about the construction progress and everything, but like that,

1523
01:08:26,404 --> 01:08:30,824
there's still a lot of work clearly need to be done, but the castle's camera ready.

1524
01:08:31,664 --> 01:08:31,944
Yeah.

1525
01:08:32,144 --> 01:08:32,724
Oh, good point.

1526
01:08:32,944 --> 01:08:33,744
Get that one.

1527
01:08:34,104 --> 01:08:38,344
Get that set as opposed to I was just watching early footage of Disneyland where it's,

1528
01:08:38,344 --> 01:08:41,724
you know, six months to go and it's like scaffolding.

1529
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:42,564
Oh, it's crazy.

1530
01:08:42,684 --> 01:08:44,204
The Disney stuff is so crazy.

1531
01:08:44,224 --> 01:08:44,864
Apparently got it.

1532
01:08:44,864 --> 01:08:45,744
I don't know how they got it done.

1533
01:08:46,684 --> 01:08:47,964
Paths that lead nowhere.

1534
01:08:47,984 --> 01:08:50,924
You could just walk into the park.

1535
01:08:51,064 --> 01:08:52,284
Various places.

1536
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:54,024
People counterfeited the tickets.

1537
01:08:54,644 --> 01:08:56,084
I heard that was fake.

1538
01:08:56,404 --> 01:08:56,604
Really?

1539
01:08:56,604 --> 01:08:57,964
I heard that's been overblown.

1540
01:08:58,144 --> 01:08:59,204
Although I don't know where I heard that.

1541
01:08:59,204 --> 01:08:59,964
That could be fake.

1542
01:09:00,064 --> 01:09:00,784
So what do I know?

1543
01:09:02,664 --> 01:09:03,644
But that is the story.

1544
01:09:03,964 --> 01:09:06,024
It seems like chaos that opening.

1545
01:09:06,444 --> 01:09:09,704
Speaking of paths that lead nowhere, like when I was there a couple years ago,

1546
01:09:09,844 --> 01:09:13,644
the Arabian nights, like kind of Arabian inspired adventure land.

1547
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:15,304
Pretty like bare.

1548
01:09:15,304 --> 01:09:19,724
There's all these weird Disney Paris has all these like mazes and little like paths

1549
01:09:19,724 --> 01:09:23,264
and gardens that there's like no one is in Wonderland maze of some kind.

1550
01:09:23,264 --> 01:09:23,784
Yeah.

1551
01:09:23,904 --> 01:09:24,704
And they're all cool.

1552
01:09:24,704 --> 01:09:25,424
It's all neat.

1553
01:09:25,464 --> 01:09:26,884
But you do really go.

1554
01:09:26,924 --> 01:09:28,564
But where are the rides though?

1555
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:32,704
I mean, you hear Tony and other imagineers talk about being inspired by like Tivoli

1556
01:09:32,704 --> 01:09:34,864
gardens and public spaces in Europe.

1557
01:09:34,984 --> 01:09:36,224
So I guess that makes sense.

1558
01:09:36,724 --> 01:09:42,524
But yeah, no, that else in Wonderland garden is nice and big thunder is very nice.

1559
01:09:42,544 --> 01:09:42,944
There's a lot.

1560
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:49,104
I mean, like the construction of this place and that hotel is crazy, even though there's

1561
01:09:49,104 --> 01:09:50,864
like shit restaurants in it.

1562
01:09:51,264 --> 01:09:55,524
But I remember watching this and thinking like I like I'll never go there.

1563
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,284
I will never experience.

1564
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:58,924
I will never experience the grandeur of this.

1565
01:09:59,144 --> 01:10:02,324
And then I went and we were like so upset.

1566
01:10:02,564 --> 01:10:05,044
It was so cold and strange.

1567
01:10:06,064 --> 01:10:07,344
Oh, there's my beloved.

1568
01:10:07,764 --> 01:10:08,044
There it is.

1569
01:10:08,064 --> 01:10:12,924
Oh, and they're loading the buffalo into this to be trapped in a stage show.

1570
01:10:12,944 --> 01:10:17,064
For years, they haven't even finished some of the sidewalks, but they got the buffalo

1571
01:10:17,064 --> 01:10:18,704
in get them in their cages.

1572
01:10:18,704 --> 01:10:21,624
They're trapped.

1573
01:10:22,004 --> 01:10:27,404
The government will make us make a set them free if we don't cage them now.

1574
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:28,944
I fought in the wars.

1575
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:31,404
This whimsy disgusts me.

1576
01:10:31,904 --> 01:10:34,564
I like the old of hard hats on though.

1577
01:10:38,392 --> 01:10:39,972
Can you imagine...

1578
01:10:39,972 --> 01:10:41,592
Not confident in the pronunciation.

1579
01:10:41,592 --> 01:10:42,152
Yeah.

1580
01:10:42,812 --> 01:10:44,092
Sabine Marcon.

1581
01:10:44,592 --> 01:10:45,532
I mean, she wasn't.

1582
01:10:46,192 --> 01:10:47,612
I...

1583
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:50,072
Can you imagine if there had not been Disney Paris,

1584
01:10:50,892 --> 01:10:53,312
if Weissner hadn't had to flex his muscle there,

1585
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:57,172
what we would have still here in the States on all fronts.

1586
01:10:57,792 --> 01:11:00,172
Well, and that's, you could say the same thing about Shanghai,

1587
01:11:00,352 --> 01:11:02,932
because Shanghai sucked our budget for a while,

1588
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:06,252
because it was over budget and laid out, here are my guys.

1589
01:11:06,592 --> 01:11:07,052
Yeah.

1590
01:11:07,892 --> 01:11:10,252
There's not been a lot of Darkwing Duck talk.

1591
01:11:10,472 --> 01:11:12,692
Yeah, I was obsessed with, of all the Disney afternoon,

1592
01:11:12,712 --> 01:11:14,052
Darkwing Duck was my favorite.

1593
01:11:14,632 --> 01:11:16,012
Probably the superhero element.

1594
01:11:16,392 --> 01:11:18,112
Like, it was essentially Batman.

1595
01:11:18,512 --> 01:11:20,172
Like, it was a parody of Batman.

1596
01:11:20,432 --> 01:11:22,552
But it's also very like, Get Smart.

1597
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:23,412
Yeah.

1598
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:24,072
Because he's an idiot.

1599
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:26,592
Kind of the Shadow influence.

1600
01:11:26,612 --> 01:11:29,292
Yeah, all those are, yeah, for sure influence, but I think I...

1601
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:33,872
I don't know that I've ever sat down and watched the whole Herbie the Lovebug movie.

1602
01:11:34,232 --> 01:11:35,832
But as a kid, I knew Herbie.

1603
01:11:35,832 --> 01:11:38,372
Like, I feel like they probably aired it on the Disney Channel a lot,

1604
01:11:38,372 --> 01:11:39,812
and I would watch little bits and pieces.

1605
01:11:39,812 --> 01:11:42,112
When was the Herbie...

1606
01:11:42,112 --> 01:11:43,292
The Lindsay Lohan one?

1607
01:11:43,392 --> 01:11:45,912
Well, I know that was after this, but why is Herbie in here?

1608
01:11:45,912 --> 01:11:48,652
How many years had it been since a Herbie movie had come out?

1609
01:11:48,692 --> 01:11:50,352
I don't...

1610
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:52,912
Oh, why? It must have been, because there were a lot of sequels.

1611
01:11:52,952 --> 01:11:55,192
Like, I feel like they would just bring it back every now and then,

1612
01:11:55,232 --> 01:11:56,452
or do meet, they were definitely made for TV.

1613
01:11:56,452 --> 01:11:56,972
Oh, baby.

1614
01:11:57,312 --> 01:11:58,152
There's the turtles.

1615
01:11:58,712 --> 01:11:59,592
There are my boys.

1616
01:12:00,552 --> 01:12:05,812
Now, what we're going to get here...

1617
01:12:06,232 --> 01:12:06,752
...is a song from the Disney Channel.

1618
01:12:06,752 --> 01:12:07,052
It's called, like, The

1619
01:12:07,052 --> 01:12:07,932
Trolls of the Town.

1620
01:12:08,552 --> 01:12:13,472
If you're not properly synced, I shouldn't rap along, but...

1621
01:12:13,472 --> 01:12:14,072
You can't help me.

1622
01:12:14,072 --> 01:12:16,512
I like the role. Michael Angel almost fell over on that role.

1623
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:19,092
Dude, I'm talking about...

1624
01:12:19,092 --> 01:12:19,572
Better watch out.

1625
01:12:19,672 --> 01:12:20,092
Don't...

1626
01:12:20,092 --> 01:12:21,072
Vout, freak out!

1627
01:12:21,412 --> 01:12:23,272
Santa Claus is coming to town!

1628
01:12:24,692 --> 01:12:25,812
And there's a...

1629
01:12:25,812 --> 01:12:29,912
This song is left over from a previous year when Alan Thicke performed it.

1630
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:30,312
Right.

1631
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:34,632
Which is maybe the best thing in any Disney Christmas crib.

1632
01:12:34,632 --> 01:12:34,812
That was also The Turtles?

1633
01:12:35,092 --> 01:12:35,692
Yes, yes.

1634
01:12:35,712 --> 01:12:37,852
Yeah, they did have The Turtles for a few years.

1635
01:12:38,552 --> 01:12:39,352
There needs to...

1636
01:12:39,352 --> 01:12:39,752
Maybe...

1637
01:12:39,752 --> 01:12:43,972
Look, I'm the one to do it, I guess, but there needs to be a big, massive hit,

1638
01:12:43,972 --> 01:12:46,012
movie or TV of The Turtles.

1639
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:47,992
They're going to keep rebooting it every two or three years.

1640
01:12:47,992 --> 01:12:51,072
Yeah, because Nickelodeon owns it now, so they'll just air it on Nickelodeon,

1641
01:12:51,432 --> 01:12:53,152
and on their website, and they'll just...

1642
01:12:53,152 --> 01:12:54,532
Yeah, you're right. Reboot it every now and then.

1643
01:12:54,552 --> 01:12:57,532
But I just mean, like, one of these things needs to be a massive hit to convince

1644
01:12:57,532 --> 01:13:01,752
whoever has the rights to finally put these guys in a theme park.

1645
01:13:01,872 --> 01:13:05,212
A permanent theme park attraction. I don't know who's going to do it.

1646
01:13:05,552 --> 01:13:09,212
Clearly, they're okay with the weird, like, mediocre...

1647
01:13:09,212 --> 01:13:11,812
They keep existing, kids like them.

1648
01:13:12,112 --> 01:13:14,052
Nothing's broken, sadly.

1649
01:13:14,272 --> 01:13:16,692
Right. Nothing has, like, been a runaway hit.

1650
01:13:17,372 --> 01:13:22,932
There's no new character lands as strong as Keno or...

1651
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:23,592
Right.

1652
01:13:24,272 --> 01:13:24,752
Keno.

1653
01:13:24,752 --> 01:13:25,572
Who is Keno?

1654
01:13:26,392 --> 01:13:28,052
The pizza boy from...

1655
01:13:28,052 --> 01:13:28,772
The pizza man from Turtles 2.

1656
01:13:29,152 --> 01:13:30,052
Oh, yeah, sorry.

1657
01:13:30,412 --> 01:13:31,732
He's green and he looks fantastic.

1658
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:35,932
Who are the reptile and the werewolf from 2?

1659
01:13:36,152 --> 01:13:36,672
Betty White.

1660
01:13:36,672 --> 01:13:37,152
Right.

1661
01:13:37,472 --> 01:13:40,072
God bless her. Oh, Tocan Razor.

1662
01:13:40,132 --> 01:13:40,672
Okay.

1663
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:42,632
Who should have been Bebop and Rocksteady.

1664
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:43,152
Yeah.

1665
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:44,092
That was confusing.

1666
01:13:44,092 --> 01:13:46,192
But Tocan Razor are still good on their own.

1667
01:13:46,192 --> 01:13:50,992
I remember people saying, like, well, you know, I know number one of that Michael Bay

1668
01:13:50,992 --> 01:13:53,512
one was not so good, but 2 is going to have Bebop and Rocksteady.

1669
01:13:53,832 --> 01:13:55,252
2 is...

1670
01:13:55,252 --> 01:13:57,352
Why did anyone think that would be any better?

1671
01:13:57,832 --> 01:13:58,712
2 is better.

1672
01:13:58,912 --> 01:13:59,392
Okay.

1673
01:13:59,612 --> 01:14:00,352
Because of that?

1674
01:14:00,612 --> 01:14:04,432
Well, it's partly because of that, but I would say that 2 is better because

1675
01:14:04,432 --> 01:14:09,112
it doesn't have an hour at the start of it where just Megan Fox goes up to people

1676
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:10,312
and goes, the Ninja Turtles is this.

1677
01:14:10,332 --> 01:14:12,872
And everybody goes, what are you talking about?

1678
01:14:12,972 --> 01:14:13,672
No, they don't.

1679
01:14:13,752 --> 01:14:14,552
You're crazy.

1680
01:14:14,932 --> 01:14:16,752
And it's like, she's the star of the movie.

1681
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:20,272
And it's like, well, the Ninja Turtles are the star of the movie.

1682
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:21,612
What are we doing here?

1683
01:14:21,992 --> 01:14:24,172
And at the very least, 2 is like from the get-go.

1684
01:14:24,172 --> 01:14:25,652
It's like it's the Turtles movie.

1685
01:14:26,232 --> 01:14:30,612
I would argue that they're like pretty well cast and kind of fun, the Turtles themselves.

1686
01:14:31,072 --> 01:14:31,212
Okay.

1687
01:14:31,212 --> 01:14:32,752
I do think the movie is better.

1688
01:14:32,972 --> 01:14:35,072
But Corey Feldman is no longer one of them.

1689
01:14:35,152 --> 01:14:36,832
I wish Corey Feldman was still.

1690
01:14:36,832 --> 01:14:38,172
Yeah, they're keeping him in the fold.

1691
01:14:38,312 --> 01:14:42,372
Am I the only one who thinks Fallen Kingdom is better than Jurassic World?

1692
01:14:42,372 --> 01:14:43,412
I haven't seen it yet.

1693
01:14:43,632 --> 01:14:44,692
That's kind of a...

1694
01:14:44,692 --> 01:14:45,612
Jurassic Park or Jurassic World?

1695
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:46,512
Jurassic World.

1696
01:14:46,652 --> 01:14:47,092
Okay.

1697
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:49,572
No, nothing's better than the first Jurassic Park.

1698
01:14:49,572 --> 01:14:52,052
I thought you said Jurassic Park and I was like, oh, no.

1699
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:56,612
That was the exact tone of when you said, did you tell Mazani to go to Disneyland and not Disney Sea?

1700
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,212
Didn't I text you about that?

1701
01:14:58,332 --> 01:14:58,792
Or no?

1702
01:14:58,972 --> 01:15:01,072
No, you said it in person and it was...

1703
01:15:01,072 --> 01:15:01,712
I was so confused.

1704
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,792
Like it was accusatory.

1705
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:07,172
Oh, I guess, because I honestly, I thought you was a mistake.

1706
01:15:07,512 --> 01:15:08,852
I was just so confused by it.

1707
01:15:08,932 --> 01:15:11,092
You knew you smelled a rat in there.

1708
01:15:11,112 --> 01:15:11,752
Yeah.

1709
01:15:11,812 --> 01:15:12,472
Because something was mis-deserved.

1710
01:15:12,472 --> 01:15:13,792
Because it wouldn't make any sense.

1711
01:15:13,852 --> 01:15:21,812
On screen now, we are seeing the portmanteau, the combination of the Mardi Gras people and mutant horses.

1712
01:15:22,252 --> 01:15:23,752
Now they're on stilts.

1713
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:28,952
So we've mushed together two earlier things we've seen so far into one monster.

1714
01:15:29,172 --> 01:15:32,132
What is crazy is how many people on stilts in this parade.

1715
01:15:32,272 --> 01:15:39,372
Because stilts, I think you have to get a different skill set, obviously, than just lazily twirling these streamers or whatever.

1716
01:15:39,832 --> 01:15:41,832
So that seems like I've never seen a parade with something still walker.

1717
01:15:41,832 --> 01:15:44,712
Did you guys do ribbon dancing in gym class as kids?

1718
01:15:45,432 --> 01:15:45,992
Like this?

1719
01:15:46,772 --> 01:15:47,212
What?

1720
01:15:47,432 --> 01:15:47,792
No.

1721
01:15:48,732 --> 01:15:49,852
We did square dance.

1722
01:15:49,892 --> 01:15:51,052
Did you do square dancing?

1723
01:15:51,212 --> 01:15:53,512
In elementary school, we had a little square dancing.

1724
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:53,912
A little square dancing.

1725
01:15:54,072 --> 01:15:54,612
We also did a little ribbon dancing.

1726
01:15:54,612 --> 01:15:56,872
But are you telling me you all ribbon danced?

1727
01:15:57,632 --> 01:15:59,172
Yeah, it wasn't often.

1728
01:15:59,192 --> 01:15:59,832
Oh my God.

1729
01:15:59,992 --> 01:16:00,452
Do you remember this too?

1730
01:16:00,452 --> 01:16:03,412
Ribbon dancing and floor hockey happened only once or twice.

1731
01:16:03,412 --> 01:16:04,292
We played floor hockey.

1732
01:16:04,292 --> 01:16:06,952
And I was always like, let's go back to those were more fun.

1733
01:16:07,512 --> 01:16:10,052
How old, what age were you when you were ribbon dancing?

1734
01:16:10,192 --> 01:16:11,612
Like elementary school.

1735
01:16:12,112 --> 01:16:12,592
Okay.

1736
01:16:12,832 --> 01:16:17,192
Elementary school gym, they always figured out, they always had the fun, odd stuff.

1737
01:16:17,732 --> 01:16:17,732


1738
01:16:19,212 --> 01:16:21,952
I remember this Mickey very well.

1739
01:16:22,152 --> 01:16:22,692
King Mickey.

1740
01:16:22,952 --> 01:16:24,952
King Mickey lording over his kingdom.

1741
01:16:25,432 --> 01:16:28,772
Will you be the first to merge tap and ribbon?

1742
01:16:30,492 --> 01:16:33,012
Will finally there be a portmanteau as you say.

1743
01:16:34,252 --> 01:16:37,772
Oh, you tapping and ribbon dancing, please.

1744
01:16:38,672 --> 01:16:41,352
That'd be a way to have an angle out of the gate.

1745
01:16:41,792 --> 01:16:44,832
The Patreon will be Doughboy's Patreon if you do that.

1746
01:16:44,832 --> 01:16:48,612
And we set the goal for people can come see you tap and ribbon dance.

1747
01:16:49,852 --> 01:16:51,132
Please just agree to it.

1748
01:16:52,252 --> 01:16:54,312
You know, I just want to beat those Doughboys.

1749
01:16:54,472 --> 01:16:55,912
Yeah, we have to beat them.

1750
01:17:01,848 --> 01:17:02,888
Is that right?

1751
01:17:03,928 --> 01:17:08,048
He's less prepared for this than we are. Yeah, he's on the air.

1752
01:17:09,348 --> 01:17:14,048
Oh, now you saw a blimp up there. So I think this is a blimp shot, not an helicopter.

1753
01:17:15,188 --> 01:17:20,108
But I guess blimps are no steadier, which doesn't seem right to me. Don't you have more of a surface there?

1754
01:17:20,388 --> 01:17:23,788
Yeah, I also think that the part of it was they were so zoomed in,

1755
01:17:24,528 --> 01:17:28,168
the slightest movement was making it shake. That's a good point, yes.

1756
01:17:28,468 --> 01:17:36,308
I think anytime they cut to blimp so much in these sorts of things, or football games as a kid,

1757
01:17:36,948 --> 01:17:42,108
even now if I see a blimp, I'm like, oh, must be an event going on. There's a blimp about.

1758
01:17:44,588 --> 01:17:51,468
There were a lot of minion blimps going around for a little while. Oh, I love this. Oh, yeah.

1759
01:17:51,728 --> 01:17:53,588
Wow, where's that balloon today?

1760
01:17:54,668 --> 01:17:58,028
Can I buy it? The park hasn't been the same since the balloon.

1761
01:17:58,248 --> 01:18:03,928
Oh, man. Everyone's favorite prehistoric family's coming up.

1762
01:18:04,308 --> 01:18:08,188
Turtles and dinosaurs all dancing. Everyone loves to dance.

1763
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:12,828
Ike was just like a pig and shit when we were down there at MGM Studios,

1764
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:19,228
old movies, dinosaurs, turtles. Yeah. Muppets. Muppets. Yeah.

1765
01:18:20,428 --> 01:18:25,428
All the kids' favorite properties. Muppets, turtles, footlight parade.

1766
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:26,028
Footlight parade.

1767
01:18:28,888 --> 01:18:33,608
Yeah, that's, I think, the issue. I think it was like the greatest park

1768
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:36,948
for a couple year period. It could not have been better.

1769
01:18:37,228 --> 01:18:40,588
Honey, I strength the kids too. Like they were in a lot of big Roger Rabbit presents.

1770
01:18:40,748 --> 01:18:41,428
Yeah, yeah.

1771
01:18:42,148 --> 01:18:47,208
Oh, boy. And wow, the land where sea would go.

1772
01:18:49,568 --> 01:18:51,928
Mm hmm. Looks like that. No.

1773
01:18:52,308 --> 01:18:55,348
No, man. This is too much of a spoiler.

1774
01:18:56,548 --> 01:19:03,128
That looks the same. There's a roof on Main Street.

1775
01:19:03,248 --> 01:19:06,468
I did not see that. I didn't want to know that.

1776
01:19:08,688 --> 01:19:08,948
Well.

1777
01:19:13,472 --> 01:19:15,172
Oh, soon a month's away.

1778
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:17,212
Yeah, how many? What's the countdown?

1779
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:18,552
It's two, I'm in there.

1780
01:19:18,572 --> 01:19:19,072
Four months.

1781
01:19:19,352 --> 01:19:22,392
Well, I guess the second week of April is when I'm in Disney.

1782
01:19:22,392 --> 01:19:23,072
Three and a half.

1783
01:19:23,612 --> 01:19:23,832
Yep.

1784
01:19:24,152 --> 01:19:26,372
I loved We Need a Little Christmas as a Kid.

1785
01:19:26,632 --> 01:19:29,372
So here in the Japanese, it's such a delight.

1786
01:19:30,992 --> 01:19:34,432
They play this in that Muppet special, the Muppets with the Sesame Street characters,

1787
01:19:34,492 --> 01:19:36,352
which is like the greatest special of all time.

1788
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:37,232
Yes, indeed.

1789
01:19:37,232 --> 01:19:39,212
And I got that on tape with the commercials.

1790
01:19:39,412 --> 01:19:40,652
I have that on tape somewhere.

1791
01:19:40,652 --> 01:19:42,952
I think I like that more than a lot of films.

1792
01:19:43,952 --> 01:19:47,452
That's like one of my top 10 films of all time is a Muppet Family Christmas.

1793
01:19:47,852 --> 01:19:50,812
That delivers in a weird, like that delivers.

1794
01:19:51,432 --> 01:19:56,192
Well, like now all these goddamn greatest crossover events of all time

1795
01:19:56,192 --> 01:20:01,612
that are murky and awful, like the, the that, like, what would it be like

1796
01:20:01,612 --> 01:20:04,092
if Big Bird met the sweetest chef?

1797
01:20:04,172 --> 01:20:07,992
And it's great and really fun and funny in these moments you remember.

1798
01:20:08,112 --> 01:20:11,772
Yeah, every character is always meeting the thing that we always wanted.

1799
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:13,032
And it's never fun.

1800
01:20:13,052 --> 01:20:14,632
Yeah, it doesn't fulfill the promise.

1801
01:20:14,712 --> 01:20:17,032
Were you guys Emmett Otter fans as a kid?

1802
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:18,972
Emmett Otter's joke? No, I did not.

1803
01:20:19,172 --> 01:20:19,452
I know it.

1804
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:22,812
You either watched it to death or you never saw it.

1805
01:20:22,992 --> 01:20:24,512
It's OK. I never really saw it.

1806
01:20:24,552 --> 01:20:25,672
I think I have it.

1807
01:20:26,252 --> 01:20:27,212
Here they are.

1808
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:30,232
Family of the day.

1809
01:20:31,852 --> 01:20:36,372
You know, like they had a leg up on winning that family for the day.

1810
01:20:36,372 --> 01:20:38,472
Are these you're always a family.

1811
01:20:38,632 --> 01:20:39,572
Those aren't the out.

1812
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:42,432
Could those be the actual outfits or do they look cheaper?

1813
01:20:42,512 --> 01:20:43,872
I know they're cheaper.

1814
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,072
They had them in the park.

1815
01:20:45,292 --> 01:20:49,032
My Facebook photo for a little while was the park.

1816
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:53,812
Earl, who kind of has no park, no like mouth functionality.

1817
01:20:54,112 --> 01:20:54,712
OK, yeah.

1818
01:20:55,012 --> 01:20:57,792
And is the just the default of park.

1819
01:20:57,852 --> 01:20:59,272
Earl is very frightening.

1820
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:00,872
That has to be.

1821
01:21:01,212 --> 01:21:02,752
Why hasn't that come back yet?

1822
01:21:02,812 --> 01:21:04,112
Dinosaurs.

1823
01:21:04,452 --> 01:21:07,672
I feel like I remember it and realize it was bad.

1824
01:21:07,812 --> 01:21:10,712
It was bad, but that doesn't that shouldn't stop it.

1825
01:21:11,052 --> 01:21:11,872
That's a good point. Yes.

1826
01:21:11,892 --> 01:21:13,272
Why would that stop spinning?

1827
01:21:15,272 --> 01:21:16,952
I'm the baby, got to love me was fun.

1828
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:27,656
Yes, that was good. It's funny because that was like as big as Bart at the time

1829
01:21:27,656 --> 01:21:33,616
and now is gone. Also had like a novelty song I want to say. Yeah, yeah, I'm the

1830
01:21:33,616 --> 01:21:40,536
baby guy. Gotta love me. Great big eyes and I'm really cuddly. Something like that, yeah. Another character you related.

1831
01:21:40,816 --> 01:21:46,356
I love the baby. I'd say, I probably said not the mom. Like I think my parents had to be like, you gotta knock it off.

1832
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:48,536
Really? Some new little shit.

1833
01:21:52,596 --> 01:21:57,376
Yeah, like the equal of Simpsons. You know what I like is that the Simpsons like distem.

1834
01:21:57,576 --> 01:22:03,676
There's that one episode where, yeah, they kind of jab them. Which I like, I want that kind of stuff today.

1835
01:22:03,736 --> 01:22:10,096
That's like how I want Kanye Taylor Swift moments at all award shows. Yeah. And shaky helicopter shots in all parades.

1836
01:22:10,616 --> 01:22:16,656
I want problems, issues, conflicts. The late night hosts should be sniping at each other.

1837
01:22:16,776 --> 01:22:22,716
Yeah, because the greatest thing that ever happened is when they all were. When the Conan Leno debacle.

1838
01:22:22,936 --> 01:22:29,256
Every single show was so funny every night. Even Leno, because Kimmel came on it.

1839
01:22:29,256 --> 01:22:38,316
We have bigger problems right now, gentlemen. And his name is Forty-Five. You see, I won't say his name.

1840
01:22:39,536 --> 01:22:42,576
I just call him him. The orange one.

1841
01:22:42,776 --> 01:22:47,516
You know, the late night hosts are kind of the generals in the resistance.

1842
01:22:52,396 --> 01:22:56,276
Yeah, Baldwin's fighting the fight one punch at a time.

1843
01:22:57,096 --> 01:22:58,216
We're gonna win the war.

1844
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:10,024
Our Harry Leslie Smith, the late war hero who passed away at 95, is Pete Davidson.

1845
01:23:11,424 --> 01:23:14,304
He's the brightest point of light.

1846
01:23:16,384 --> 01:23:18,004
These toy soldiers, there's so many of them.

1847
01:23:18,004 --> 01:23:20,284
I wasn't gonna vote and then Pete told me to vote.

1848
01:23:20,504 --> 01:23:25,244
And then I did. I was literally, I made big plans that day at a trip booked to Cabo,

1849
01:23:25,284 --> 01:23:27,384
and then Pete Davidson told me to vote, and then I voted.

1850
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:32,564
I voted for all Republicans, but I vote.

1851
01:23:32,564 --> 01:23:34,484
Yeah, but that's important that you voted though.

1852
01:23:34,484 --> 01:23:36,784
Yeah, they didn't say what to vote for.

1853
01:23:37,224 --> 01:23:39,604
Sickly blue-haired man, sickly.

1854
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,144
They just say to vote.

1855
01:23:43,964 --> 01:23:45,584
This is the through the years.

1856
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:48,624
I can't remember.

1857
01:23:48,884 --> 01:23:50,184
Well, I'm not supposed to sing it.

1858
01:23:50,684 --> 01:23:51,084
Yeah.

1859
01:23:51,404 --> 01:23:54,184
If Mike Newell gets in trouble for posting this.

1860
01:23:54,644 --> 01:23:55,444
But here it is though.

1861
01:23:55,444 --> 01:23:55,964
Wait, what?

1862
01:23:57,384 --> 01:24:00,364
Maybe the rights were restored to Mike Newell.

1863
01:24:00,624 --> 01:24:02,144
He wrote a letter to Kenny Rogers.

1864
01:24:02,384 --> 01:24:04,504
Or he put that in the text to trick him.

1865
01:24:04,744 --> 01:24:05,904
Oh yeah, good point.

1866
01:24:07,244 --> 01:24:08,544
What are the levels of legality?

1867
01:24:08,724 --> 01:24:10,984
Is Mike gonna have a problem with us or is Disney?

1868
01:24:11,524 --> 01:24:13,544
No, because we're just talking over this.

1869
01:24:13,784 --> 01:24:14,444
And you can't.

1870
01:24:14,444 --> 01:24:18,064
It's up to the lousy listener to marry this to the video.

1871
01:24:18,104 --> 01:24:18,344
Right.

1872
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:23,984
If they wanna inflict copyright issues in their own home, that's not up to us.

1873
01:24:23,984 --> 01:24:25,084
We didn't tell them to do that.

1874
01:24:25,244 --> 01:24:25,764
Yeah.

1875
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:30,464
Bring back Life magazine, I say.

1876
01:24:31,284 --> 01:24:33,424
Your favorite publication is a five-year-old.

1877
01:24:34,204 --> 01:24:37,664
Actually, you should sync this, what we're doing, up to the Wizard of Oz.

1878
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:40,584
Yeah, that would be a fucking trip, man.

1879
01:24:42,384 --> 01:24:43,204
The gun.

1880
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:45,024
The gunshot.

1881
01:24:45,024 --> 01:24:50,104
People reacting, horrified at a gunshot is a little more innocent.

1882
01:24:50,184 --> 01:24:51,544
Contemporary shot.

1883
01:24:53,064 --> 01:24:54,044
Oh, Goofy's bashful.

1884
01:24:54,484 --> 01:24:55,564
There's bashful for real.

1885
01:24:56,144 --> 01:24:58,164
Oh, it's Roy Orbison.

1886
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:15,840
This made me feel like a reflective 70 year old at six.

1887
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,540
It's such effective propaganda.

1888
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,120
Yeah, look what we're doing.

1889
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,660
Look what we do all the time.

1890
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:24,640
Bicentennial Mickey Goofy and Donald.

1891
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,500
We're all nostalgic for the bicentennial.

1892
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,480
The shit like this.

1893
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,400
Main Street Electrical Parade, zero doll people.

1894
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,100
The big problem with it.

1895
01:25:38,664 --> 01:25:39,444
Oh, ew.

1896
01:25:40,144 --> 01:25:40,404
Ew, what?

1897
01:25:40,424 --> 01:25:41,324
What is this big belly?

1898
01:25:41,564 --> 01:25:42,984
He's shaking his fluff like the Caballero is.

1899
01:25:42,984 --> 01:25:43,824
Yeah, weird.

1900
01:25:44,984 --> 01:25:47,684
With you, through the years.

1901
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:50,284
Who's that?

1902
01:25:50,524 --> 01:25:50,844
Yeah, who is that?

1903
01:25:50,844 --> 01:25:53,004
Oh, it's the construction guy, yeah.

1904
01:25:53,944 --> 01:25:57,184
You kissed my tears away.

1905
01:25:57,904 --> 01:25:58,804
You ever think about it in that,

1906
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:01,164
I don't want to miss a thing, how the line is,

1907
01:26:01,304 --> 01:26:03,044
and then I kiss your eyes.

1908
01:26:03,524 --> 01:26:04,484
Oh yeah, and thank God.

1909
01:26:04,484 --> 01:26:05,364
Kiss your eyes.

1910
01:26:06,984 --> 01:26:07,744
That is weird.

1911
01:26:08,704 --> 01:26:09,144
Definitely.

1912
01:26:09,144 --> 01:26:09,904
Keep them open.

1913
01:26:10,444 --> 01:26:11,264
Family memories.

1914
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,524
I like that.

1915
01:26:12,724 --> 01:26:14,664
Nikki's got the high waist going there.

1916
01:26:15,024 --> 01:26:15,724
High waisted pants.

1917
01:26:20,948 --> 01:26:25,448
Has anyone ever kissed tears? Like you drink someone's tears essentially?

1918
01:26:27,088 --> 01:26:30,588
Kenny Rogers is. Was that not relatable to everyone else?

1919
01:26:32,328 --> 01:26:34,888
You never drank the tears of your wife or girlfriend?

1920
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:36,988
I have.

1921
01:26:37,228 --> 01:26:39,768
I'll drink your tears away.

1922
01:26:40,288 --> 01:26:41,948
Cry into a cup.

1923
01:26:43,748 --> 01:26:44,148
Ugh.

1924
01:26:45,068 --> 01:26:46,648
Yeah, that's a little weird.

1925
01:26:48,188 --> 01:26:50,008
That was the culmination.

1926
01:26:50,428 --> 01:26:51,948
Massive hand grabbing.

1927
01:26:52,068 --> 01:26:53,168
You'll never let it go.

1928
01:26:54,528 --> 01:26:57,448
That's a metaphor for their nice grip on our brains.

1929
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:04,148
Of course, the grand finale. Always Santa. The one person who outweighs Mickey Mouse.

1930
01:27:04,888 --> 01:27:07,608
It is weird though because I do feel like Santa should start the parade.

1931
01:27:07,888 --> 01:27:11,848
Even now we were just down there and Santa ended the parade and I feel like it is kind of a down.

1932
01:27:11,848 --> 01:27:19,468
I know you only see him once a year but I'd rather see Darkwing Duck at the end of the parade in a Santa outfit than Santa himself.

1933
01:27:20,308 --> 01:27:21,548
Or one of their Mickey in a Santa outfit.

1934
01:27:21,748 --> 01:27:25,288
Sure, Mickey in a Santa outfit I think is a much bigger thrill for me.

1935
01:27:25,508 --> 01:27:29,268
The surprise that it's Mickey as Santa.

1936
01:27:29,648 --> 01:27:36,128
A lot more regis in the booth. A lot less regis like screaming at people like on the street.

1937
01:27:36,228 --> 01:27:41,708
Well you know, he was not the primary host. He was the man on the street for a while.

1938
01:27:41,848 --> 01:27:43,448
Then they upped him to the booth.

1939
01:27:44,168 --> 01:27:47,748
I forget who was in here with maybe I think Willard Scott sometimes.

1940
01:27:48,268 --> 01:27:48,948
Oh yeah.

1941
01:27:49,448 --> 01:27:51,788
There's a summer one with Mark Summers.

1942
01:27:52,228 --> 01:27:53,928
Who I don't know why they didn't bring back more.

1943
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,948
I'm a noted Mark Summers fan.

1944
01:27:56,088 --> 01:27:56,708
Great host.

1945
01:27:58,628 --> 01:28:02,508
He thinks that his OCD stopped him from getting hired.

1946
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:09,308
He's got rumors being difficult when it never came up. He was on a sloppy show all the time.

1947
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:12,768
I never miss a Disney parade with a regis in that man's shirt.

1948
01:28:14,008 --> 01:28:17,848
It was hard to make a t-shirt back then. They didn't have t-public back then.

1949
01:28:17,868 --> 01:28:19,468
And back the regis walk around character.

1950
01:28:20,848 --> 01:28:23,748
Can we sell a shirt of that guy's shirt?

1951
01:28:24,128 --> 01:28:25,168
Taken off a TV.

1952
01:28:25,428 --> 01:28:25,928
I never.

1953
01:28:28,048 --> 01:28:29,588
We should get regis on the show.

1954
01:28:30,008 --> 01:28:30,508
Yeah.

1955
01:28:30,508 --> 01:28:32,648
We really haven't talked about that but we should get regis.

1956
01:28:32,748 --> 01:28:34,748
Is he in New York still? I think he lives in New York.

1957
01:28:34,948 --> 01:28:36,188
At least Connecticut maybe.

1958
01:28:36,888 --> 01:28:38,548
He loves to do shit though.

1959
01:28:39,228 --> 01:28:40,428
I'm sure he could get regis.

1960
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,700
We're all just imagining talking to Reed just now.

1961
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:54,060
We're all distracted.

1962
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:57,580
I wonder how he smells.

1963
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,020
Like cinnamon.

1964
01:29:05,016 --> 01:29:07,556
That's a great story, I love saying it.

1965
01:29:14,508 --> 01:29:16,088
Barbara Bush is back.

1966
01:29:18,368 --> 01:29:21,688
If George HW Bush was playing Santa that would be really good too.

1967
01:29:22,588 --> 01:29:25,488
If he looks at the camera goes, don't ask.

1968
01:29:26,688 --> 01:29:29,048
How'd this happen? You don't want to know.

1969
01:29:33,624 --> 01:29:35,304
The character is behind that house.

1970
01:29:35,604 --> 01:29:36,284
Does Wendy have a jacket on?

1971
01:29:36,284 --> 01:29:37,764
It's Wendie in a robe.

1972
01:29:37,944 --> 01:29:38,824
I guess it's a robe.

1973
01:29:39,084 --> 01:29:40,164
Yeah, she wears a robe.

1974
01:29:40,844 --> 01:29:41,484
Yeah, it's just weird.

1975
01:29:41,664 --> 01:29:42,264
I don't know why she's wearing it.

1976
01:29:42,264 --> 01:29:43,744
Is that a canonical robe to you?

1977
01:29:43,864 --> 01:29:44,544
I think so.

1978
01:29:44,964 --> 01:29:45,504
Is it?

1979
01:29:46,084 --> 01:29:49,484
I don't think that king's robe is...

1980
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:50,764
That's a little different color,

1981
01:29:50,764 --> 01:29:52,164
but I think he does wear that.

1982
01:29:52,364 --> 01:29:54,844
I remember, was that Prince John?

1983
01:29:55,544 --> 01:29:56,204
What's his name?

1984
01:29:56,304 --> 01:29:57,244
They're all John to me.

1985
01:29:57,244 --> 01:29:58,204
I can't remember their names.

1986
01:29:59,024 --> 01:30:00,464
Are there any weird girls out there

1987
01:30:00,464 --> 01:30:02,844
who didn't have the young crush on Robin Hood,

1988
01:30:02,844 --> 01:30:05,884
but who had a crush on him sucking his thumb?

1989
01:30:06,784 --> 01:30:08,284
What's wrong with me?

1990
01:30:08,404 --> 01:30:11,224
My friends were talking about Robin Hood, but I am weird.

1991
01:30:12,024 --> 01:30:13,664
The Pooh bear of this era

1992
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:17,224
always looks like he has a five o'clock nose shadow to me.

1993
01:30:17,224 --> 01:30:19,664
It looks bizarre like he's been drinking or something.

1994
01:30:19,784 --> 01:30:21,424
Something's wrong with his snout.

1995
01:30:22,604 --> 01:30:23,144
It's a dark-

1996
01:30:23,144 --> 01:30:24,164
It's like Homer's face.

1997
01:30:24,284 --> 01:30:25,104
Yeah, exactly.

1998
01:30:25,284 --> 01:30:27,824
That weird shade that is meant to be a beard shadow.

1999
01:30:27,884 --> 01:30:28,784
But I don't know why,

2000
01:30:28,844 --> 01:30:31,344
I don't think of Pooh having a different color snout.

2001
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,964
But in this era, he had a dark snout.

2002
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:37,924
This is a big crossover between Homer and Pooh.

2003
01:30:38,104 --> 01:30:40,284
Oh, multiple, multiple snowmen.

2004
01:30:41,004 --> 01:30:42,184
All doing the shrink trick.

2005
01:30:42,444 --> 01:30:46,104
They have weird shade and they're all in a similar color.

2006
01:30:46,364 --> 01:30:47,184
Uh-huh, that's true.

2007
01:30:47,244 --> 01:30:51,744
And I think Homer's duff looks as delicious as Pooh's honey.

2008
01:30:52,284 --> 01:30:52,984
I think that's right.

2009
01:30:54,164 --> 01:30:56,424
And real beer and honey are not as good

2010
01:30:56,424 --> 01:30:59,144
as what those cartoon characters drink, and I know it.

2011
01:31:00,164 --> 01:31:01,004
I feel gypped.

2012
01:31:13,344 --> 01:31:14,304
In 1917.

2013
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,824
I always think of the gingerbread as children's toys.

2014
01:31:19,784 --> 01:31:21,024
Since I was a baby.

2015
01:31:22,244 --> 01:31:23,464
My first words were that.

2016
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:25,024
Normal human anecdote.

2017
01:31:27,004 --> 01:31:28,744
These are more holiday characters.

2018
01:31:28,964 --> 01:31:32,264
They're like the tilting trees, the snowmen, and here's the reindeer.

2019
01:31:32,524 --> 01:31:35,464
There's like 50 people in between Mrs. Claus and Mr. Claus.

2020
01:31:36,344 --> 01:31:39,644
And then he's like a letdown because he's not as cool as the trees.

2021
01:31:39,864 --> 01:31:42,024
Yeah, no, he's just sitting in a stupid sleigh.

2022
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:43,404
Windy in a robe.

2023
01:31:45,944 --> 01:31:48,204
Or that guy checking his audio pack.

2024
01:31:49,424 --> 01:31:50,744
Those tongues are unnerving.

2025
01:31:51,184 --> 01:31:52,484
Are we out in half an hour?

2026
01:31:52,584 --> 01:31:53,044
Okay.

2027
01:31:54,784 --> 01:31:55,924
I need another D88.

2028
01:31:57,544 --> 01:31:58,204
Can I get a runner?

2029
01:31:59,624 --> 01:32:00,824
Can I get a runner for a D88?

2030
01:32:06,072 --> 01:32:07,212
Who's got phones on?

2031
01:32:10,052 --> 01:32:13,472
The reindeer, I have one of the Park Star reindeer.

2032
01:32:13,852 --> 01:32:14,072
Yeah.

2033
01:32:14,092 --> 01:32:14,712
Like these.

2034
01:32:15,512 --> 01:32:16,552
There's Park Stars of this?

2035
01:32:16,812 --> 01:32:17,692
I believe so, yeah.

2036
01:32:17,772 --> 01:32:19,112
You gotta get these Park Stars.

2037
01:32:19,412 --> 01:32:19,952
What am I doing?

2038
01:32:19,952 --> 01:32:21,832
There's some real-lifey, the Wally Vogue.

2039
01:32:22,552 --> 01:32:22,772
Oh!

2040
01:32:23,632 --> 01:32:24,792
There's a balloon of him!

2041
01:32:24,812 --> 01:32:25,832
Yeah, I don't remember that.

2042
01:32:26,572 --> 01:32:31,012
You can get a full box of a couple of the later series for very discounted,

2043
01:32:31,052 --> 01:32:33,432
and get them all and don't have to like worry about the blind box.

2044
01:32:34,532 --> 01:32:36,172
Very, you really should do it.

2045
01:32:36,172 --> 01:32:36,752
You should do it right now.

2046
01:32:36,752 --> 01:32:37,712
What am I doing?

2047
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:40,272
I just want to rest!

2048
01:32:46,008 --> 01:32:51,708
Yeah, I know you have a big night, but report to Disney World for the parade, 7am.

2049
01:32:53,148 --> 01:32:56,328
Our Disney, or the Disney Corporation is never working with you again.

2050
01:32:58,468 --> 01:33:03,068
Yeah, they wouldn't give him a license for Disney twice if he didn't do this.

2051
01:33:06,188 --> 01:33:07,088
You will be on our June on Celllist.

2052
01:33:07,088 --> 01:33:09,988
The sleigh is really rocking and it's making me nervous.

2053
01:33:10,328 --> 01:33:15,988
Yeah, the one they have now in Disneyland is not looking like it's flying as much as just sitting on top of

2054
01:33:16,888 --> 01:33:17,368
something.

2055
01:33:17,708 --> 01:33:20,188
And alternate takes of the footage, this footage.

2056
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:22,648
Oh my God, why would you keep going back to it?

2057
01:33:22,988 --> 01:33:24,188
It's so shaky.

2058
01:33:26,328 --> 01:33:28,808
We paid for that fucking blimp.

2059
01:33:29,048 --> 01:33:29,788
We're using it.

2060
01:33:29,948 --> 01:33:31,488
That might be it's a sponsor issue.

2061
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:39,412
I love being here with you.

2062
01:33:39,852 --> 01:33:40,412
TAB!

2063
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,652
TAB, now with even more saccharin.

2064
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,420
You guys like Fresca?

2065
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:53,720
You're asking that legit?

2066
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:54,560
Yeah.

2067
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,580
I don't think I've had a Fresca.

2068
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,580
It's pretty good.

2069
01:33:59,100 --> 01:33:59,760
What is it like?

2070
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:01,500
It's like a grapefruit kind of soda.

2071
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,560
Or was it like, what's it called, that other one?

2072
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:06,720
I can't think of the other grapefruit soda.

2073
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:07,820
Who gives a shit?

2074
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:13,640
When songs start in a concert, everyone starts applauding.

2075
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:20,540
When people are cut to everybody sells in a parade, everybody screams, yay.

2076
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:24,880
Mickey's got a good outfit on there.

2077
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,500
Why isn't he putting them?

2078
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:28,460
Why is he off to the side?

2079
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,780
Okay, this would have had to have been pre-tates because there's no way they would have had to like, all right, let's stop the float.

2080
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:35,380
Now everyone get in front of the float and we got 30 seconds.

2081
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,040
Not live.

2082
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:42,540
And in one of the takes, Santa's sleigh snapped off and fell on Regis.

2083
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:47,740
And he had to recoup and learn how to walk again for, took eight weeks.

2084
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:51,220
And then they, it's a good thing they filmed it all in August.

2085
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,640
Casimil spent so much money on promotion.

2086
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:55,380
Tylenol and Casimil Sinclair.

2087
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:58,480
Tylenol probably, wasn't Tylenol coming out of a scandal?

2088
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:01,420
Like, didn't they have like a bad batch or something in the 80s?

2089
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:05,380
Because people, some guy poisoned several bottles of Tylenol, I believe.

2090
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:05,760
Okay.

2091
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:10,060
So it was like, people died from him poisoning bottles.

2092
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,040
Tylenol, it's not poison anymore.

2093
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,000
That was the campaign.

2094
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,960
Oh, God, I forgot all these hotels were built by 91.

2095
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,160
Praise be Michael Eisner.

2096
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:24,620
And thus they all look like 91 still.

2097
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:26,100
All right.

2098
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:30,360
And then a lot of Comic Sans, or no, that's kind of like full house font a little.

2099
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:30,980
It's not Comic Sans.

2100
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:31,880
And then next to the room font.

2101
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,960
Comic Sans hadn't been invented yet.

2102
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,340
Chico Fernandez.

2103
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,660
Let's read the credits in a funny way, like the British Who's Line is it anyway?

2104
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:43,700
Oh, yeah.

2105
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,340
Do look up credits in the style of my choosing.

2106
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:54,020
If you haven't seen it, the Kissimmee Sinclair arrow commercial, it's like a target with arrows being shot at it.

2107
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,360
And it's like in the center of everything.

2108
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:01,860
And it lists all the parks and attractions and stuff.

2109
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:03,560
Swoop.

2110
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:04,900
There's Sea World.

2111
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:05,880
Swoop.

2112
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:07,020
There's Disney World.

2113
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,820
There's the world's largest McDonald's.

2114
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:14,980
There's a TGF Fridays where somebody got stabbed on iDrive.

2115
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,860
Somebody just posted on Facebook group an article about the McDonald's and what it looks like now.

2116
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,040
And it serves pizza in Orlando.

2117
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,280
Well, it did when I was there.

2118
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,680
So it's one of the attractions.

2119
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,940
So it's still.

2120
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:30,940
You got like waffles and pizza and there's like full dessert bar.

2121
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:32,960
So burritos, I believe.

2122
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:37,320
There's a Spider-Verse commercial.

2123
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,280
I'm very excited about Spider-Verse.

2124
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:40,360
At this point, everyone's entered the Spider-Verse.

2125
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,120
I'm very excited to enter the Spider-Verse.

2126
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,880
Or maybe doing so as a Christmas activity with their parents.

2127
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:54,520
But if you're not all entertained out by this commentary, then, you know, head to the theater and support your local Spider-Man.

2128
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:57,360
Re-regional Spider-Man.

2129
01:36:57,900 --> 01:36:59,620
Well, that was something.

2130
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:07,220
And now, now that's the last podcast, the ride content of 2018.

2131
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:14,800
But in 2019, there will be presumably, you know, 97 episodes.

2132
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:18,000
I can only assume the rate we're going.

2133
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,520
That seems right.

2134
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:20,300
Yeah, probably.

2135
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:25,980
If there's a parade that you would like to see us comment on, please let us know.

2136
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:31,140
I'm not a beloved crisp, except for that goddamned Jerry Van Dyke one that's out.

2137
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:32,320
Yeah, don't do that.

2138
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,060
It's not canon.

2139
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,620
If there's no Regis, then I'm not interested.

2140
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:38,840
And maybe we'll get Regis to do one of these with us.

2141
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:39,480
Oh, man.

2142
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,100
The promise for 2019.

2143
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:41,520
That would be something.

2144
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,180
Regis Philbin's debut.

2145
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:46,160
We only need you for two hours.

2146
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:46,920
Sure.

2147
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:48,780
What's he doing?

2148
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:50,580
Yeah, that's true.

2149
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:53,220
He misses the K. Mrs. The Sparkle, baby.

2150
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:54,560
I got a podcast.

2151
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,120
He was ousted from that show.

2152
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,520
They kicked him off of live with Regis and Kelly.

2153
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:04,720
He's the only television host who was popular before 1995 who hasn't been me too.

2154
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:07,180
So we need him now.

2155
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:07,940
Now more than ever.

2156
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:08,420
We need it now.

2157
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,780
85 year old Regis Philbin.

2158
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:15,140
I mean, if I can give a David, who gives a shit about a David Gregory podcast?

2159
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,760
Jesus, who cares?

2160
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,020
I want a Regis.

2161
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:20,040
More stern political way.

2162
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:20,980
Which one's David Gregory?

2163
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,000
The NBC?

2164
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,160
He's so stern, but I guess he's a little dry.

2165
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:27,780
Yeah, that's more what I was.

2166
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:30,540
Yeah, it was just very dry and didn't really have a personality.

2167
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,500
You would rather have a Chuck Todd?

2168
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:33,180
Huh?

2169
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:36,560
No, I don't want any of the or the Katie Kirk.

2170
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:39,420
I don't want any of those, but I want Regis yelling at me.

2171
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:39,780
Sure.

2172
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,880
Why hasn't Regis done a podcast?

2173
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:43,520
Yeah, of anybody.

2174
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:44,740
What's going on, Regis?

2175
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:48,600
And he's the guy whose friends, all these celebrities, I'll do the podcast where they

2176
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,320
interview their friends.

2177
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:52,320
I know I've heard Seinfeld talk about Seinfeld.

2178
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,760
I don't need to hear this again.

2179
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,420
Yeah, I want to hear from Regis's buddies.

2180
01:38:56,420 --> 01:39:00,560
Except a lot of them are probably the issue potentially.

2181
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,860
But get Joey Bishop's son on there.

2182
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:03,220
Sure.

2183
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:04,380
Who might be dead as well?

2184
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:06,980
Or hates Joey Bishop and doesn't want to talk about her.

2185
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,420
I don't think the Lewis kids are not so into Jerry.

2186
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:11,700
Oh, yeah.

2187
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:14,220
I think he cut some of them out of his will.

2188
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,280
I believe that was the story after Jerry died is that he cut some of the kids out of the

2189
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,100
will.

2190
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:20,560
Like God.

2191
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,280
But he like took the time to write a lot of false pages in which he details all these

2192
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:27,540
grand items they'll be getting.

2193
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,980
And then they just turned to page 12 and like, just kidding.

2194
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,720
It was a joke.

2195
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:34,020
I'm a jokester.

2196
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:35,300
Oh, my God.

2197
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:37,900
Turn the page to find out what you really get.

2198
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:39,440
And then a big zero.

2199
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:43,500
He was an unpleasant man by all accounts.

2200
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:44,080
Seemingly.

2201
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:45,800
That doesn't seem like slander.

2202
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,320
No, please.

2203
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:50,260
I was not like accusing someone of something bad.

2204
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,640
No, and he's on record being unpleasant.

2205
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:53,280
Yeah.

2206
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:53,820
All the time.

2207
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:57,520
You can go watch plenty of video of him being unpleasant right now.

2208
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:06,700
And also, if you slander at the end of a commentary within a Patreon paywall.

2209
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:07,640
What are the chances?

2210
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:08,920
Listening to this.

2211
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,740
There's no such thing as slander on Christmas.

2212
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,520
Peace on Earth.

2213
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,840
Goodwill to.

2214
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:17,680
The lander.

2215
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,140
Those are loose and.

2216
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:25,680
Well, that's on that note on this 2018.

2217
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:29,100
Happy 2019 to you all.

2218
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:30,200
Merry Christmas, guys.

2219
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,060
I love being here with you.

2220
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:33,880
Blow me a kiss like Cinderella.

2221
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:41,120
Jason Jason doing the kissing is so unnerving to watch him.

2222
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,320
Scott has a good view of it.

2223
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,960
Oh, do it toward Scott.

2224
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:47,180
No, no, thanks.

2225
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:48,320
You go like me.

2226
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:51,820
Like he puts his lips really tiny and it's really unnerving.

2227
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:54,540
But I don't love it.

2228
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:55,480
But the tap dance.

2229
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,480
This is the promise for 2019.

2230
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:59,600
Regis and tap and tap.

2231
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,620
So let's tap our way into 2019.

2232
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:05,840
And can we do real quick?

2233
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:12,580
I know we're ending, but can we just sub in the Tom Jerry is the mouse.

2234
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:18,400
You and Jerry from Tom and Jerry tap dancing like he did with Gene Kelly in

2235
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,180
an anchors away anchors away.

2236
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:23,420
You like trading off taps with a cartoon mouse.

2237
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:26,840
I mean, maybe the greatest piece of entertainment of all time.

2238
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:27,080
All right.

2239
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:28,720
We'll promise that to some.

2240
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:31,260
We'll wrote we're rotoscoping out.

2241
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,280
And Kelly, we have to do our own.

2242
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:35,400
It's movie.

2243
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,260
Can I do the vacuum cleaner?

2244
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:40,400
Can I take the place of the vacuum cleaner?

2245
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:44,400
I like that, but I like you and the mouse.

2246
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:51,280
Or Kelly stays and Jason is just shrunk digitally to the size of Jerry.

2247
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:53,740
OK, maybe that's the way to go about it.

2248
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:54,920
One foot tall, Jason.

2249
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:56,440
Maybe that's the way to do it.

2250
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,020
Was that Fred Astaire, though?

2251
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,720
Yeah, it's not a Fred Astaire kid.

2252
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:01,980
I was a Gene Kelly kid.

2253
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:03,820
Well, Gene was cooler than Fred.

2254
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:05,160
Who are you guys?

2255
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,340
Who are your childhood guys?

2256
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,460
Gene Kelly, the time to make the doughnuts guy and the Michelin man.

2257
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,540
My God, what a childhood.

2258
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,400
What? You so lucky.

2259
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:22,300
All right.

2260
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:22,600
All right.

2261
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:26,400
Well, the fuck is the first comment?

2262
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,760
I was right. Second gate. First commentary.

2263
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:30,420
Yeah. More to come.

2264
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:32,400
Have a merry Christmas.

2265
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:34,720
Thank you for all your support.
