1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,640
Forever.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,400
Dawg.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,800
The happy hosts have received your sympathetic vibrations

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,340
and are assembling for an extremely cordial podcast.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,000
A podcast that contains a weird video-screen face,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,360
the cool-sounding phrase, celebrity scientists,

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,760
and extreme attic intimacy.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,900
Join us as we continue to crawl through this ride

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,460
at a snail's pace. I'll see you all a little later in the year 2025 when we get to the end of the

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,380
graveyard. It's Haunted Mansion Part 4 on Hauntcast The Fright.

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:01:06,060
Whoever knows what to do, do it. One, two, three, pick wick. It's only me after all,

12
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,700
after this studious run of episodes, I'm the only one who went back to find out what we're

13
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,540
supposed to do. We've been doing these cold opens of yelling that we did it last time.

14
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,540
I crammed like I was on a test, but you're right. I have in previous years gone back and listened.

15
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,300
I did not do it. You're right. In the end, I listened to all the other intros because I

16
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,780
wrote a potential intro and I didn't want to try to copy it. God, we've been shamed. I am the one

17
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,660
who brought up pick wick in a recent segment that came up this year. Yes. There was an animatronic

18
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:47,740
contest, I think for the dormant animatronics who were just sitting around during the long

19
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:55,100
pandemic. I feel like shit. We have started things. Pick wick in the morning after that party,

20
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:07,500
you know? Man. Wow. Okay. But now I'm suddenly I'm feeling like a real, I don't know. I feel like my

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,980
relationship to these episodes has been at odds before, but now I'm feeling like an A plus student.

22
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,500
I did the homework. That's true. I've been stressed about the episode all day just because there's so

23
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,660
much information to learn and just because these episodes are probably the most tense of all the

24
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,260
episodes we ever do. The most book reporting. I've been feeling, but I mean, no, like just. But that's

25
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:35,500
what I'm saying. There's no, of course you have an actual book. This is my point every year. Who is

26
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,060
making it be that way? Well, not me. I'm as chill as Pickwick here. It's a regular episode where we

27
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,980
can have all the fun that we'd usually have on our show, which is called Haunt Cast the Fright. We

28
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:52,700
haven't said the name with this cold open construct. Oh, and also here, see, this is the kind of fun

29
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,020
we can have. We've kind of, we kind of haven't made good on the Halloween names. We sort of bailed on

30
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,620
it. And I thought we should bring, we did it a little bit, but why not? Let's make it Haunted

31
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:08,860
Mansion specific. And that's why I'm your ghost host, Scott Grimm, Grinn and Gardner. And then I'm

32
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:17,660
joined by Mike Cadaverous-Palerson. And then of course also Jason Shrouded in a deaf disguise it

33
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:25,740
in. Oh, I like that. Yeah, that is good. Yeah. So there we did that. And that's what I'm saying.

34
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,420
It's fun. We can have some fun. Here's what I'd say. And if the audience is what we're talking

35
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,140
about, so we've sort of stepped through the Haunted Mansion and it's sort of a point of contention

36
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,140
because Scott's initial idea was to do Haunted Mansion every year. I believe the way you envisioned

37
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,780
it was, eh, we'll goof around every year about the Haunted Mansion. Maybe as if it's the first time,

38
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,860
we'll obviously not try to repeat things, but what do you know? We'll just do a new episode every

39
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,980
week. Cover different aspects of it because there's a lot there. I don't deny there's a lot of this.

40
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,180
Why I thought of doing it. And then what happened was we started stepping through the Haunted Mansion

41
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,860
as if we were doing sort of, yeah, like a book report and then sort of the game, if you were,

42
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:11,180
if you will, is sort of like pulling us off course on the Haunted Mansion while Scott says like,

43
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,340
uh, is that it? Is that we done? Are we done talking about the chair? Like that sort of become

44
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,060
the game of it. Well, I don't think I sound that snippy, but, uh, that's, but maybe that's how you

45
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:26,860
hear it. That's how I would say it. If I was, if I was playing a character, um, following a lot of

46
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,180
when, what I usually encounter with that is a lot of no, no, no, no, no. Right. So that's if you were

47
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,780
playing our character, you would be doing that. You would say, no, no, no, we have to talk about

48
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,060
the material of the chair in the hallway. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe that's not as loud as you guys get.

49
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,340
There was just, was one time it happened and I was like, sure God. Well, if it was over Zoom last

50
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,260
year, I don't know. The fall of 2020 is such a fog. That's true. But it becomes, see, this is what

51
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,900
happens. This is what's happening in the country right now. When two sides just end up on different,

52
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,700
like completely separate, they're polarized, you know? And I believe it actually makes it stronger.

53
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,540
It makes the polarization stronger. So your interest in getting us off course and, and, and into a sort

54
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,420
of a more fun, freewheeling thing gets stronger. Our desire, and especially Jason's, I still think

55
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,380
I'm sort of the theme park moderate here, but Jason, especially he gets stronger to want to make sure

56
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:25,180
to just, you know, to read the full Jason Searle book to us each year. Yes. It's important. You

57
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,540
have to read us the book. Or what else are we doing? It gets stronger. The two sides get stronger,

58
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,660
you know, as we go along. So I think here's what I think. I was thinking about this earlier today.

59
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,900
I think because this year we've sort of set a limit, I actually think this will give us some more

60
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,700
room, some more freedom. Oh, this is how I felt. By the way, now we've started on this note, but

61
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,580
I've been thinking all day. This is a, this is, I have not been dreading the haunted mansion this

62
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,100
year. Last year, big time dread. There was, as you said, Jason, there's a dread about a lot of things,

63
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,820
but, uh, but I think. Stronger than the haunted mansion episode. No, no. In October 2020, the

64
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,780
biggest thing that I was worried about was doing the haunted mansion episode. I think what it starts

65
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,700
to feel sort of, uh, like my parents taking me to church. That's sort of the tone that I feel like

66
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,140
I encounter where it's like, we're going to sit, it's going to be nice. They're going to do the

67
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,500
homily. And it was, it wasn't that a nice homily. It was very good. Okay. We're going to learn about

68
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,500
the foyer. We're going to learn about the history of porches. We're going to learn about railings.

69
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,780
It wasn't that nice. It's been very nice. I see what you're saying. I do think, and I just had a

70
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,820
mutual friend who I won't say who, uh, people love these episodes. I do think sadly the format

71
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,780
of you being tortured is popular. I think, no, I recognize that it's part of it. Yeah.

72
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,500
So it is unfortunately now become part of it. Now, maybe again, I don't need to force it. We don't

73
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,300
need to do the same thing every year. I don't want it to be contentious. So I, again, I think

74
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,900
this putting a limit sort of on today's episode, I think it's great even now of, you know, and you

75
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,900
say that because there's a little, there's kind of a plan because there's sort of like a stop point

76
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,980
where we think we're, we know we're not going to get to that this year. And, uh, I think that that's,

77
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,020
I don't know. I think that that's going to help things. We'll see, but yes. And now I do recognize

78
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,500
and I'll, you know, if you're going to do it, just do, I'll just call it out. Now I understand

79
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,180
that we're probably going to have to do the thing where there were like, there's like a new ribbon

80
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,260
that got installed this year. So there's an air filtration system that's new in the mansion.

81
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,100
Well, that's not true. That's gotta be the same. That's the pumping right into our lungs. That's

82
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,140
never, that's never changed. That's the Legionnaire disease. That's what, that's how that's. They

83
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:43,100
touched it. They banged on the tin. They fixed the leak in the roof of like a backstage area

84
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,860
that wouldn't even be where you go. You're walking us right into the new loading area of Disneyland.

85
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,020
That's why I think that's what I'm saying. Let's get it out of the way. I, what I'm saying,

86
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,300
what I, I don't think I'm not expressing enough positivity here. I appreciate that when I asked

87
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,980
you guys when what are, all right. And I was nervous about doing that. I think I played it cool.

88
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,820
When we talked about it, I was like, all right, now we've agreed that we're going to do the ballroom

89
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,940
and we're going to do the attic. And that you said, yes. So it was like, oh, you're kidding.

90
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,540
You mean it's not, the intention is not to only do the ballroom. Now I'm already delaying things by

91
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:22,380
saying anything, but right. But I just, I want to say to both of you, I appreciate that you said yes.

92
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,220
And that even as we talk about whatever we have to talk about now, that the intention was there

93
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:35,340
to keep things moving forward. Right. Progress you see, there's a lot going on in both of these rooms.

94
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,860
And I was more surprised. I think that there is more ambiguity in the attic than the ballroom.

95
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,260
The ballroom has like a lot of, a lot going on. Maybe one of the most substantial, if not the most

96
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,100
substantial audio animatronic based scene in any ride. Yes. There's almost like eight little,

97
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,700
seven or eight little different scenelets happening. Different stories happening.

98
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,900
Animatronics all doing extremely different things. It's not, because when you said that, I was like,

99
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,420
oh wait, okay, what else is there has more animatronics? Well, there's like,

100
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,220
now there's the stormtrooper room, but they're all essentially doing the same thing. The presidents

101
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,980
of America and all the presidents are all essentially doing the same thing. But here you've

102
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,740
got dancing, you've got duelers, you've got pick wick up on the, up on the chandelier. There's like

103
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,620
so many types of actions going on. So here, let me, I'm going to go, let me, quick negotiation here.

104
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,060
Yeah. You know, I don't know, it seems like Jason wanted to talk about the ballroom so we could just

105
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,380
start talking about the ballroom. I want to just make sure that Jason's on the same page. Okay.

106
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,100
Yes. Again, again, polarization. Pretend you're president Biden and I'm Kristen Sinema and Joe

107
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:43,260
Manchin. Hey, that's topical. How that puts us in 2020. That locks us in to, you're both?

108
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,940
I'm stacking my money from every like corporate baron that's giving me donations. You're both of

109
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,420
them basically? Both of them. Yeah. I love that you're willing to be, you're them. I'm the rest of

110
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,700
Congress that's trying to do something. It's trying to get us out of this mess. Okay. And I'm wearing

111
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:05,820
cat eye glasses and I got a funky sweater on and I'm a piece of shit. So when I say, can we move

112
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:12,380
past the ballroom? You'll do a big, big thumbs down. Yeah. I, by the way, we do these things where we

113
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,140
like, let's date stamp things the year that they are happening. I hope to fucking God, we don't

114
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,500
remember who the fuck Kristen Sinema is a year from now. Boy, would I be thrilled if that name

115
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,100
wasn't rattling around our social media unless you mute it, which I should. We'll see. Uh, is it,

116
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,140
it's Kirsten, right? I don't want, that's not a thing we need to know. I don't care.

117
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,500
I think it's for KYR. I just want to be accurate so we know which person we're talking about in a year.

118
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,260
And now I, for sure now I can't be shamed again next year. So I have to bring her up and we have

119
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,700
to, we have to of course check in now. That's now part of the haunted mansion is checking out.

120
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,900
Senator Sinema. Uh, okay. Let me, okay. Let me throw this out. This negotiation real quick.

121
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:03,740
Okay. Okay. So in the past we have done it on the rails. Jason, will you submit, will you allow us

122
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:10,700
to bounce back and forth from the attic and the ballroom as, as with, you know, uh, discussion

123
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,940
and jokes and humor and a little bit, maybe taking pokes at each other, like we generally do in a

124
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,140
fun way on podcast, the ride. Don't you think that's going to take longer than just knocking out the

125
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,140
ballroom and knocking out the attic? I don't know. I'm just saying for Scott, I think it'll be a more

126
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:29,420
pleasurable episode if we sort of bounce around in a way normally that we do. There's not, there's

127
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,340
not the seeking of permission to move from run, but again, I feel better on this issue already.

128
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,900
So I'm not so concerned as in previous years where maybe the intent was to get through three or four.

129
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,980
I think we're going to do it. All right. Okay. Well, if Scott, if you're, that's not a big problem.

130
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:54,060
I was drawing my negotiation. My, uh, I was just attempting to, uh, make peace early, but okay,

131
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,780
let's just proceed. If we all feel comfortable, is there any other rule we would like to lay down

132
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:04,380
now? Look, I'm just always trying to avoid being, uh, having no stop yelled at me, which I, which I

133
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,740
think, which I think has happened in the past with you as well, Mike. So if you'll, as the mediator,

134
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,780
sure. If everyone will try to not yell no stop. Is there a different command that I could politely

135
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,500
say? Like just a second. Oh, one second, one second. Please. One moment, please. One moment,

136
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:27,740
please. That sounds fine. Yeah. There's a better one moment, please. I'll say, uh, yes, we're going

137
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,820
to stately manner. Let's be polite here. Stately Wayne manners where I think of that phrase from

138
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,260
the sixties, Batman show. Okay, great. So, uh, one moment please is what we'll be using. We'll be

139
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,620
saying, okay, love it. Uh, that's good. Okay. So I, as far as that, I have no other thoughts on the

140
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,020
actual, uh, follow through. I think we're, I think we're off to a great start. I think this is, this

141
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,580
is very civil. It would be funny if this was like doughboys doing this and she's fucking idiot.

142
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:03,180
What the fuck? We're on the chair. Um, did you have anything on the, the new additions or did you

143
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,780
want to talk about so hard? So they added, um, yeah, they added the May, December portrait in

144
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,620
the loading area and they had, they added, uh, they just basically dress the area, but it's not

145
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:19,580
some crazy elaborate, um, um, overhaul or anything, but I do think it makes everything look a little

146
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:25,580
nicer in that load area. Um, I didn't really notice it. I gotta be honest. Really? Not so much. The

147
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,580
dressing screens, their dressing screens and extra candelabra. What does the dressing screen mean?

148
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,780
Like, um, like a folding screen you would see like, and, um, like to if somebody's somebody's

149
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,260
getting dressed behind it, if Austin Powers was getting dressed and like he had a cucumber and

150
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,220
like a silhouette potential for high jinx. It's not quite like that. Cause I think you can kind of

151
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,740
see through it at the way that they have them laid out, but it is kind of like that size and kind of

152
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,420
like laid out like that. Um, excuse me, right by the loading area. And then they have this portrait

153
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,620
that Jason just referred to, um, that changes. So it's like kind of little stuff. It's not like that

154
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,740
big Tony Baxter overhaul where he talked about how they were going to maybe use the scene from the

155
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,340
haunted mansion movie and load it into the Disneyland haunted mansion. But all I really have to say,

156
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,900
still open for that one. Obviously I am still open for that one. We're still open. You know,

157
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,900
maybe DeVito can pull some strings recently announced to the cast for the new movie.

158
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:27,900
In the new movie. I think as we record this. Uh, that's fun. Um, so honestly, I don't have a ton

159
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,860
of thoughts on the new stuff. I just think it's a nice little addition to the loading area, which

160
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,740
still is a little spare a little bit. Uh, it could be, it could be a little more lively, but they're

161
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,820
doing, they, they obviously recognize that, you know, it needs a little something. So what Jason,

162
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,220
what do you think? Uh, I liked it. There's a little cat statue whose eyes glow. I don't know

163
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,740
if that was new or I just hadn't noticed it before. Oh, that's a good question. I call it one or two

164
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,540
in the video walkthroughs. A lot of the haunted mansion heads are going to be,

165
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,900
or I have to be mad at some of these episodes when we go, was that there the whole time?

166
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:05,580
Cause that always happens to me on rides. Yeah. I mean, some of the stuff in the, and now one moment,

167
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,540
please, if I can transition us into the ballroom discussion. Oh, wow. Oh, you're just doing it.

168
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:16,140
You're, wait, you used one moment to move forward branch. This is an olive branch. I take it. I

169
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,180
accept. I'd shake the branch with you. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. I honestly can't think of

170
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,340
anything new besides the loading area. I'm sure I'm missing something. Okay. Great. I feel like

171
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,580
everybody would have pushed it. Would I hit the throttle harder if we hadn't all talked about

172
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,620
then done this little treaty at the beginning. That's good. We got everything. That's the,

173
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,940
see, that's what so many of the, again, in this country, you know, that's really the sit down and

174
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,700
talk about it and go over rules and make proposals. And that's what, that's what Ted

175
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,380
Sarandos is saying. Let's just like all get together and, and let's not let content get in

176
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:59,900
the way of our general understanding. That's what he's saying. And then that's what I don't know.

177
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,140
I was going to make, try to figure out a Bezos joke where he just popped champagne in the middle

178
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,500
of William Shatner tearfully talking about going to space. Did that happen? Yeah. Yeah. Shatner was

179
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,820
like really moved to tears that he went in because he came down from the spaceship with Jeff Bezos.

180
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,420
And Bezos was very bored by Shatner crying and telling him how wonderful that trip had been. And

181
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,100
and a person just like, it was like, Hey, champagne. And Bezos was like, yeah, yeah. Like

182
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,780
in cut him off right in the middle of it. Billy boy. Really cold, really cold. Look, dude, I've

183
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,820
done this like four times or something. I think I don't even know anymore. That was a, yeah. And

184
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:42,060
Shatner looks real upset, real, real mad to be cut off anyway. So, well, Jason, Jason, yes. Well,

185
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,300
the ballroom scene, I, I mean, my pitch is just moving from sequentially through the scene.

186
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,020
Oh yeah. Okay. We'll see where it takes us. We'll see where it takes us. But that's the intent

187
00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:01,420
to start. Because I think that first, you know, the very first like gag, the, the fireplace,

188
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,940
if you're not watching closely when you transition from the sounds room and then there's kind of a

189
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:13,980
black, you know, transition hallway, and then you rotate around to the ballroom, you might not

190
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,460
notice that there was a fireplace at all. And there's a little guy on it. There's a little ghost

191
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:23,660
on it. You're saying it's so quick in the ballroom scene. You kind of miss that too, right? Because

192
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,020
he's like hanging on the bus, like the bus, there's a bus next to him, right? That's the one you're

193
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,020
talking about. Yeah. He's hanging on a bus, which is one of, between these two rooms,

194
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:37,980
one of a few callbacks to earlier scenes in the mansion. I believe the bust is the same bust

195
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:46,140
from the end of the portrait gallery of the like stern looking woman. Right. And this is one of the

196
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,780
characters, cause there's many characters here that aren't like officially Walt Disney company named.

197
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,580
And this is one of those characters that's nameless. Yeah, that is nameless. That what I

198
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:02,380
saw was that Pickwick and Lyoda are the two main ones named. And then later on, uh, retcon, the

199
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,380
bride is named Constance. Yes. And there's other characters that are retcon named later, Victor

200
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,940
Geist, who is the organist in the ballroom, which again, uh, one moment please. Excuse me. I just

201
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,460
getting ahead of myself, but Victor Geist is the organist on the other side of the room. Let's be

202
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,740
careful here. Being very careful. Victor Geist, polite to the water. He was named later. He was

203
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:28,220
named later as well. Um, so yeah, so Victor Geist, Victor Geist. I did not come across the name

204
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,540
Victor Geist. Now you're making me second guess, but I'm pretty sure it's Victor Geist. I'm pretty

205
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,540
sure. So the characters in the haunted mansion are Madame Leota, Pickwick and Victor Geist,

206
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:48,540
just a very like character actor from 1968. Uh, yes, Victor Geist is the name of the organist and

207
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:56,220
he is, uh, and I know that because I have a Funko pop of him. Oh, uh, and he is, but he has had a

208
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,340
different name. Okay. Um, excuse me. Uh, just getting a little ahead of myself, but he had a

209
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:09,900
different name as well. Uh, alternate version Wolfgang Elias Furlong. Uh, so he also, it's Eddie,

210
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:17,820
Eddie's grandfather. Uh, but I, but yeah, so, so I'm actually impressed that Disney hasn't tried to

211
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,260
name like what you're talking about. These like little, little known ghosts, cause there are some

212
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,140
really memorable ghosts in the ballroom. Like what you're saying, like if you look and see the guy

213
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,860
on top of the fireplace, I was like, Hey, cause I was trying to do my best today to identify all

214
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,740
the ghosts. I wrote as many as I could see down and I was like, Oh, fireplace ghosts. Real fun.

215
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:42,620
I'm surprised he's not named a P Jordan Wanderfoot or something like that. Sounds like a native

216
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,100
American character. So I won't know. Don't name him. That's got an E at the end. So now

217
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:55,340
it's Britishy. Okay, good. Yeah. It is, it is like in the peripheral vision of like you as the

218
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,980
rider seeing it and even just in like the sweeping like panorama of this sequence. Yeah. You know,

219
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,940
I really think so. I've heard some people criticize like frozen cause frozen, the ride and Epcot feels

220
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,620
very spare and there's not a ton going on, but for instance, like secret life of pets, which I think

221
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,900
we all really liked that ride. There's so much going on in the periphery, which is really what

222
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:26,380
you want. You want like really like cool things that are very easily overlooked on a ride. That's

223
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:32,700
like too much. Too many characters is great. Yes. Too many characters. Something like what Jason's

224
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,060
pointing out is good on a ride. Something you can easily miss a big character or a fun thing

225
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:44,460
that you basically just like, huh? Oh, okay. That's a good ride. You know, that's a hallmark of a good

226
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:51,500
ride. Yeah. Well, you'll never catch everything. Yes. Yeah. Absolutely. So that's this room too.

227
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,380
I mean, what is this room? Like I am excited to be talking about the ballroom in general.

228
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,420
I do need to cut it. I forgot looking. One moment, please. One moment, please. You know,

229
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,500
can we change also? Can you also say, Oh, may I cut in? May I cut in an old time dance? Like a

230
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,380
dance? Like a ballroom dance? If I could cut in, please. Okay, great. Instead of interrupting,

231
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:19,260
that's what we'll do. And to go back, you'll say one moment, please. Uh, uh, this, I always just

232
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,380
called it the ballroom scene, but the official name in the surreal book labels this room, the grand

233
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:31,420
hall and on doom buggies labels this grand hall. I saw grand hall as well. Yeah. I looked up grand

234
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:38,460
hall and in old banner has houses and castles. These rooms referred to as great halls, not grand

235
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:46,060
halls. Well, well, well, but they were used for multiple purposes. Dining, uh, that's that makes

236
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:52,060
sense. The household, uh, entertaining guests, uh, one, uh, in cyclopedia, Brutatica, uh, casually

237
00:21:52,060 --> 00:22:03,500
dropped in often where justice was served. Um, uh, yeah. And the, um, so guests dining, uh,

238
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,380
the one thing I thought was interesting that I hadn't seen a lot of places, but I think does

239
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,580
work for this ride, but the balcony, you are essentially on a balcony and great halls often

240
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:19,260
had what were called minstrels, uh, galleries. Uh, and that's Hey, nanny, nanny minstrels,

241
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:27,100
not America sings minstrels, you know? Uh, so we are, Hey, nanny, nanny, meaning what era and

242
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:33,980
place like literal, uh, minstrel, the tiny guitar, like medieval time, you know, like gesture,

243
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,460
gesture clothing. I'm just, I didn't, I'm nowhere in Sorkin. I didn't understand the,

244
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,500
I don't understand some of these, uh, Renaissance, uh, play kinds of old timey, you know, uh, uh,

245
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:52,220
like mead and a little guitar and, uh, mead, you know, and so like often little guitars are

246
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,420
always full of mead. When you were done with the song, you'd tip them over, glug from it.

247
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,380
You know what I'm talking about. What am I talking about? Cause I can't remember.

248
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,020
I think you're conflating Renaissance fair. Well, I don't know. Maybe it's not. I said the word

249
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:11,020
Renaissance. Who knows? It all just flattens flattening of history. My old favorite topic.

250
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,500
There's a guy with a little guitar and he's got me in the guitar and it's from a Disney cartoon,

251
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:22,300
right? Is it like Robin Hood? Am I, that's what I'm thinking of? Yeah. Hmm. Okay. Um, so the idea is

252
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,140
you're in your little car and you're elevated. So that's what, that's what I, the connection that

253
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,580
I made, although ironically we are being entertained by the guests. The guests are not, maybe they're

254
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,300
being entertained by us. They don't seem like they give a shit about us in that room. They don't know.

255
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,540
They're not being bothersome. They're not. Yeah. Like once you get in the attic, stuff's happening,

256
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:48,300
but like they don't care. The people in the ballroom are reacting to us. Although you know what? Um,

257
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:53,500
one moment please. Um, I'd like to go back real quick and I don't have a verbatim, but what's

258
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,540
interesting is the ghost host narration before you go in, it's like, says like the spirits are your

259
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:05,180
sympathetic vibrations. Like they're receiving them. Yeah. So it almost like says like, they feel you

260
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:12,060
coming. They're like into your vibe. They kind of like, like what you're putting out there and

261
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,900
they're willing to show up now and make themselves visible. That's sort of the read. I get from it.

262
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:25,900
Am I wrong? Well, these are the first like human, uh, shaped ghosts. There's other, there's like up

263
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,660
until this point, it's the knocking on the doors and eerie eyes on the wallpaper and a guy trying

264
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:39,740
to get out of a, uh, out of a coffin, but there's not, we don't see a bunch of ghosts per se full

265
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,220
on transparent translucent. Right. So, but so they're really like, you know, you have really like,

266
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,500
you guys have a really good energy. We're really feeling good about you. So like we will allow you

267
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:56,700
to watch us frolic. We will allow you all the stuff we do nightly. We'll give you a little peek

268
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:04,300
if you want. Cause long way for the ghosts to say they're cool. Let them be. They're cool. So the

269
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:11,020
ghost really should be like, they're cool. Don't worry. No, no, no, no, no. Well, you can have an

270
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:19,260
eternal duel in front of these people. Don't worry. They're cool. They won't freak. He said, he also

271
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,660
says they'll be assembling for a swinging wake. They'll be expecting me. I'll see you all a little

272
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:29,260
later. So he has to make an appearance. He's like, sorry, man. Sorry. I had to cut out somewhere to

273
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:37,340
go. Yeah. Sorry to bail. You're going to be on your own for a bit. Don't worry. Hang out. Right.

274
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:44,300
You're cool. Do you need anything? It would be nice. Is there, I don't know if there's, um, uh,

275
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:50,380
protocol for jumping way ahead for referencing something many rooms from now. Like, um, if you'll

276
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:59,500
excuse the, um, what's jumping, like if you'll excuse the, um, uh, like it's like being very

277
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,220
forward. If you'll excuse my forwardness. Okay. That's good. Yeah. Well, if you'll excuse my

278
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,740
forwardness, one thing that I like is that then way you really do lose the ghost house for a while.

279
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:16,140
And then it's, you're, it's many scenes without him until that, well, he almost forgot about him.

280
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:22,140
And then I really like the tone of that. Um, you know, that conveys it's, it's been a while,

281
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,060
but he's still happy to see, but like, but the connection I made with him towards the beginning

282
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,100
of the ride hasn't gone away. And he's kind of trying to soft scare you in that point. Um,

283
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:37,100
it's a little scary, but it's soft. It's soft scare. Um, um, so yeah, yeah. He, he gets out of

284
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,780
there. He gets out of there for two of the best scenes in the ride. So I think they were like,

285
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,460
well, these things can stand on their own. We don't need, you know, it's kind of like ultimately

286
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:56,460
rise of the resistance and Lieutenant Beck, who we love so much and is always mainly just in audio

287
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,500
for quite a while. Uh, and then we lose track of them. And then at the end he comes back and

288
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,500
you're so happy to see him again, you don't really see the ghost host per se, although that's in

289
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,860
question, I guess, what is the ghost host or not, but it's, I guess a similar format. Like they,

290
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,740
they're willing to say like, you were going to narrate you through this part, but if you're for

291
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,220
a couple of scenes, you could just enjoy it for a while. Yeah. So yeah, it is a similar thing.

292
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:24,460
Those might be by the way, those are my two favorite, um, theme park character. I mean,

293
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,580
I guess I'd have to put Rex at the top, but like, um, in terms of narration, I mean,

294
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,460
I think I have similar fondness for ghost host and Lieutenant Beck. Oh, interesting. It just

295
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,940
makes me happy to say the names, to think of them as a pair, to think of them hanging out.

296
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:45,980
Yeah, that's a good question. Um, I mean, like, would you put, um, old prospector from big thunder,

297
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,900
even though he doesn't have as much to do, nearly as much to do. I wouldn't for that reason. I don't

298
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,460
think I get a good picture of them, although I like that voiceover very much. So he needs, okay. So

299
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:01,420
for in this category, you'd have to have, you know, a decent lengthy amount where you're featured.

300
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:07,660
There's some, either some shaping the story or a very genuine, you're, you're a guide through it

301
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:14,460
with an, with an arc and, uh, surprising appearances and reappearances. Hondo and Naka,

302
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,420
does he fit in the same category? Cause he's featured fairly heavily. I like him a lot,

303
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:25,420
but what I don't like is that then the taste that I go out on the taste that is left in my mouth is

304
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:33,740
him saying, like, and you did badly here and here and here and after my cut, uh, you did quite

305
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,020
to now enter a hallway that is a, with flickering lights because of what you did. And that's also,

306
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,780
maybe he's faked you out thinking there's another fun adventure when he goes, something is out there

307
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:50,460
and you go, oh, moments in any ride ever. Is that the oddest moment in ride? You think like a fourth

308
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,260
act is starting and then there is not one. Like an alien is going to go, oh, something's out there.

309
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:01,260
It's an employee and they're ushering you away. And then I guess, so it's not, I wouldn't put him

310
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,660
in the top three. I think my number three would be Gary Sinise in space guides. I think I'm talking

311
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:13,340
about guides. Maybe is it right? Is that a different category? Is Rex a guide? I don't know.

312
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Yeah, he's a guide, even though he is like flying a plane, but he's also sort of your guide as well.

313
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:25,180
He's, he's doing both. He's like, Rex is like a skipper on the jungle cruise, but it's a spaceship.

314
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,060
So yeah, I think I see what you're saying. Yeah. Good guides. So

315
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:35,100
a great guide. Ghost host leaves. I will say this as a criticism, I've talked about this before,

316
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,660
the sexy and we've talked, I forget the gentleman's name, the sexy ghost host, who is the Spanish

317
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,460
speaking. Oh, Marcos Brazos. Yes. Yeah. And his ghost. That's what we shouted last year. Yeah.

318
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,460
And now I'm sorry, the information's out of my brain. The information's out of my brain.

319
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:54,620
Listened to last year's episode. He's great. I almost wish he was a little bit more involved too,

320
00:29:54,620 --> 00:30:01,100
because I kind of miss the sexy ghost, sexy Spanish ghost host as well. Yeah. On the ride.

321
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:08,220
And the guy, I, well, I don't have to say anything if I'm staying where we are essentially,

322
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,140
but I did, you know, this was alluded to in the Muppets Haunted Mansion episode.

323
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,620
And I knew it would be a pause here, but I think it is a good place to say in terms of

324
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,860
voices in the attraction. I do really like the safety warning when the ride has to stop,

325
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:28,380
which you hear almost every time you go that you get stuck somewhere briefly. I'd say in

326
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,220
almost every ride or at least every other time you go on the Haunted Mansion. Is that

327
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:39,100
a correct assessment? Yeah. And probably the most specific, like narrow Haunted Mansion reference in

328
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:45,260
that Muppets Haunted Mansion movie. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That was a good old nerdy little like,

329
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,100
and a nod to the theme parkiness of it. And that's just the narrative.

330
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,660
Um, you know what I realized? I don't think we really touched on, on that

331
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,340
cameo in that special from Kim Irvine. We did not mention that. Yeah. Because it,

332
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,460
I think I was writing something down when she first came on screen and I heard Piggy go like,

333
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,340
come on, Kim or thanks, Kim. And I was like, what is this? What is this scene? What is this

334
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,700
Kim character? And Shane was like, it's Kim Irvine. What are you talking about? Like, and I was like,

335
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:23,420
Oh, I, yeah, of course. I like that being said. I like that that is a thing said, uh, sort of annoyed

336
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:31,420
Jason it's Kim Irvine. Yeah. I mean, she, she has her waning tolerance sometimes for like, I don't,

337
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:36,620
I don't want to hear about theme parks anymore. Uh, for a little, for today, for today. Oh, I got

338
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:42,540
to see that declared at your birthday, which did delight me. Her declaration. We are no longer

339
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:49,340
talking about theme parks tonight. I was, I'm, if you can imagine before that sometimes,

340
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,660
sometimes I had to, I think I'd been talking about Disney Genie too much. We just launched today.

341
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:01,500
But I, I, I'm glad it was nice of them to, you know, get Kim Irvine in there. Of course,

342
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,780
her connection to Matt and Leota and everything with her mother and her long time imagineer. And,

343
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,180
um, she's always, she's, she's in, she was in charge of like the snow or one of the people in

344
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,980
charge of the Snow White overhaul at Disneyland and the castle when they were like repainting the

345
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,020
castle and stuff. And anytime she does an article, she's like, so like, she really cares about the

346
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,900
history of Disneyland. And she also seems like she's terrified of all the fans being mad at a change.

347
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,660
That's true. But my thing with her cameo is I thought it was nice, but I was like, well,

348
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:35,100
they didn't really give her anything to do. You wanted a full, more of a full thing. Cause sometimes

349
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,940
they do that like cute thing where it's like a little nod and it just like, it's a brief mention.

350
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,900
I, you know what I am sometimes underwhelmed by cameos like that. And I'd be like, give them a

351
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:50,140
little more to do. Even just like an, it's a living kind of gag. So you want, she needs to say,

352
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:59,580
it's a living. She has to say, she has to do the joke from the Flintstones in the haunted mansion,

353
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,220
the muppets, we're already two properties deep, but now we're putting the, now it's the Flintstones

354
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,940
muppets, the haunted mansion. Sure. Jason's walked me into trying to like have to disagree with him

355
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,860
now about what I just agree. And I'm like, yes, they should do more. So she should look at the

356
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,780
screen. I mean, in the ballpark of it. She should, she should, or could she like, you know what she

357
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:27,580
should, okay, here we go. Let's brainstorm on this. Okay. She should be like changing something

358
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:33,020
around in the room. A real inside baseball. She should be trying to think of a new way to like

359
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,540
sort of showcase a scene or a room in the mansion. And then she turns to the camera and she says,

360
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:44,220
please don't be mad at me. And she's talking to all the Disney fans in that moment. Or Ms. Piggy

361
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:51,900
says, oh, watch out for this Twitter. There's certain Twitter accounts that are going to be

362
00:33:51,900 --> 00:34:03,420
very upset. Are you, does this too, was this changed to woke? Kim, is this too woke? Kim. Kim's just

363
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:08,380
like close above her, like stressed out. That's kind of what's insane about people being mad at

364
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:14,140
Kim Irvine. This was even pre those kinds of, to the like wokeness changes. If she, boy, if she

365
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:23,420
thought discourse was crazy in 2005, like boy buckle up for everything. You'll be making people

366
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:30,860
yelling at you from changing it from Helvetica to Helvetica bold. If you were, if you thought

367
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:37,260
people screamed at you when you put other different kinds of little dolls in the ride full of little

368
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:45,900
dolls. Yeah. Guess what? The internet has only gotten more insane. Kim, we're all mad now.

369
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:52,300
That one really is like, I like to go to Disneyland and I like to see Mickey Mouse and I like to go

370
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,860
on the ride with the little dolls. Oh, well, you know what? They put Mickey Mouse on the ride with

371
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:02,380
the little dolls and he looks like a little doll. No, get the fuck out of here. I want to find out

372
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:10,540
who thought of that and I want to harass them for doing it for months. Well, I am packing my bags

373
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:17,580
and getting my copy of catcher in the ride and going right to that ride. The little doll, we did

374
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:22,620
touch on the little doll controversy. I think forever ago. I'm not sure we did, but yeah, if

375
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,740
you don't know, we're talking about insane small world, what 15 years ago, just added tiny little

376
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,020
doll versions of the Disney characters and a certain section of the audience was furious

377
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:39,820
because they don't belong there. I guess. I don't know. I'm not sure. I think they were maybe

378
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:45,340
thinking it would be like full size Mickey Mouse just on small world, but I don't know. They added

379
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,180
I don't think I care about that either. Yeah. It's pretty, you know what? That would be awesome.

380
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,220
Yeah. Now also was just hanging out and like a giant Mickey. Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah. He's on one

381
00:35:54,220 --> 00:36:00,060
of the little carousels with him. Is there a ride where they could add a giant Mickey and you'd be

382
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:07,020
upset? Not me. No. Well, maybe this maybe haunted mansion. I don't think I'd be upset. That might take me out of it a little.

383
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,340
Hmm. Where would we, where did you put them? In the haunted mansion? Maybe up on a chandelier.

384
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,860
Maybe I'm just thinking it because we're in that room, but huh. You know, in the spirit of

385
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,940
compromise, I'll say it's one of the very old kind of creepy looking original Mickey Mouse dolls.

386
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:28,220
Oh, with the nightmare mice? Well, with all the shapes are all weird. Everything's like,

387
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:33,180
like holes or like, like, well, the dolls they used to sell where he's a little more oval shaped

388
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,420
and kind of like, like, is it oval, but it's pointed. Big black eyes of death. Yeah. And it was like the

389
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,980
great depression. So it was like, ah, this is as good as we're getting, you know, he was like

390
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,180
malnourished Mickey. Yeah. Kind of like beat up. That I think, okay, that would be creepy. Then we're

391
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,140
getting into the haunted doll territory. And I like that. Yeah, I'm with you there. A scary Mickey

392
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,380
Mouse doll somewhere in the haunted. I'm not saying they should actively go do this, but if it

393
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,060
happened, if you went on the Haunted Mansion sometime and there was a Mickey there, how mad would

394
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:09,340
you be? I would love it. Yeah. What if Mickey's hand is reaching up through the dirt and a grave

395
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,180
and it's a glove. Yeah. Yeah. Comes up through the dirt. It's kind of beaten up like he's been

396
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,340
down there for decades. And the glove is a really ripped and it's a little bloody.

397
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:26,460
So like, you know, something bad happened. Maybe. No, you know what? Not decades. It's fresh. He

398
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,860
just got buried alive. Whoa. Something just happened. That's like art in a magazine. That's

399
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:38,220
like art in the Atlantic or the economist of like, oh, is the Disney company floundering? And it's

400
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,700
like Mickey coming out of the. They would have done that if the corporate raiders had bought up

401
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:48,300
the company in the 80s. Yeah. More like a dismal land pitch, perhaps. Or just like there was a

402
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,420
Kim Masters article in the Hollywood Reporter recently where it's like, all right, the Eiger

403
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:59,340
lieutenants and the JPEC lieutenants are all off the record talking shit about the other ones.

404
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,860
Oh, I love that article. Yeah. I read that whole thing. Do you read that, Scott? No.

405
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:11,980
You got to read the article. Okay. You'll you'll thrill at the dozen people who gave, you know,

406
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:20,540
rumors and gossip on background. If you like hearing or reading phrases like Bob JPEC's lieutenants,

407
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:28,620
Bob JPEC installs his loyal lieutenants, then you're going to love this article. You like the

408
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:36,220
phrase data driven. Well, this is your this is your Friday night, man. They forget getting is he

409
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:43,020
taking on like Scientology tactics? Maybe. Yeah. Making people dress in nautical uniforms. My

410
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,180
lieutenants, you see. That's right. Yeah. Yes. He's yeah, it's all boat. It's all boat based now at

411
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,940
the Walt Disney Company. That's why they're moving all the imagineers to a lake because it's going

412
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:00,140
to be a big boat. Lake Nona, Jason's least favorite place on planet Earth, Lake Nona. I

413
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:07,580
will be a big boat. I apologize. I told you like we discussed it off air and I came to the conclusion

414
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,380
like, oh, Lake Nona is a neighborhood, not just the name of this weird prefab development.

415
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,100
You thought it was like an office park. It is. Well, I mean, what they're building is like a mixed

416
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:23,180
use living work office park. But the area, Lake Nona, that's a town that people that probably

417
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:29,740
listeners of the show I have known with Lake Nona now that I have learned the full. I well, OK, so

418
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,740
how can I politely was there a polite way to apologize, Jason, for that little jab? I just

419
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:40,860
look at him at me. Yeah, just I just kneels you there. Apologies for the needling, sir. Oh, no,

420
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:47,020
that's OK. OK. All is forgiven. Thank you. I appreciate that. Water under the lake. All right.

421
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:56,620
Next to the next to the tarmac. Understood. OK. Where were we? Where were we? Where there's

422
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:02,540
the fireplace? I mean, do we do we let's talk about Pickwick probably? Well, yeah, let's move.

423
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:09,740
Sure, we can. We can move up. Yeah, we'll go into the up and then we'll maybe later come back.

424
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,980
We'll talk about John Henry. Too many plans for me. OK, just pick.

425
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:22,060
Let's talk about the north side. Pickwick and the their their sheet goes up there next to him, too.

426
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:26,380
Yeah, there's multiple beings up on the chandeliers. I don't know why they don't have names.

427
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:32,060
They don't have names. Somebody described them was like an ancient Roman soldier. Is that correct?

428
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:38,300
Yeah, they're kind of this is like a promotional images from when it first opened. And they look a

429
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,940
little he looks a little Roman. He looks kind of like a generic soldier. They're, of course,

430
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:48,700
paint a blue. You forget. I forget, at least, that a lot of these animatronics are painted the sort of

431
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:54,700
ghostly fluorescent colors. Yes. And then lights, specific lights are shined on them to give.

432
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:02,060
Right. But they're up there next to Pickwick. And Pickwick is I feel like Pickwick just because of

433
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:09,260
his placement doesn't get the play that other jovial fun characters in theme park lore get.

434
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,900
Obviously, the hard chords know Pickwick, but I think it's easy to miss Pickwick. Yeah, because

435
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:19,020
of his placement. And you can't he's also blue and he's being projected off so you don't get a clear

436
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:23,340
vision of him. He's not as close as the hat box goes. So Pickwick, you don't necessarily know.

437
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:28,700
Oh, that's a fun loving guy that I should have a lot of affection for unless you're maybe even just

438
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,940
looking on the Internet and you know the mansion lore. I think it took looking into this more. I

439
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:41,100
can't say that I specifically knew about Pickwick. Yeah. Previously, the I like when you look them

440
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:47,340
up and the basic synopsis you get is that he is a plump Dickensian ghost. Yes. A delightful

441
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:53,900
description of a character. Yes. Yeah, I saw that as well. I delighted in it. What's his real his

442
00:41:53,900 --> 00:42:01,420
full name Erasmus Cromwell Pickwick. It is. That's what it's Erasmus. I think is how you pronounce it.

443
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:08,620
And Pickwick, it's debated is Pickwick a nod to the Pickwick papers, the first Dickens novel.

444
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:14,620
There's people also mentioned that Pickwick Gardens here in Burbank, a combination banquet halls,

445
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:19,580
bowling alley, ice rink in between Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney Imagineering and Glendale

446
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,420
may also have been an inspiration. Yeah, they call it Pickwick Center. I saw it called Pickwick Center.

447
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:32,060
But the Pickwick Bowl, I think over here just sold. Am I correct? Oh, no, really? I think so.

448
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:39,420
For townhouses, it seems like no. No, no, no. Everything. Everything has to be like you heard

449
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,340
sold and that you didn't immediately assume townhouses, which is what everything gets turned

450
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:50,220
into. Yeah, yeah, I know. Also, you know, it's cool is already filled with listener townhouses.

451
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,620
Yeah, it was not like, oh, we're building there. You know, our bowling alley. Yeah, they're building

452
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:03,180
what's it called? The place in downtown Disney, Splitsville. Thank you. Yeah. No, no, it's

453
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:08,460
townhouses in that cool old bowling alley with like it's there's a ton of stuff in there and

454
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:14,060
people have parties there. And well, it's where I was trying to plan a nice, fun baby shower back

455
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:22,300
in March of 2020. That was my personal the thing that had to go away when everything went away.

456
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,740
And then there was the so there's the email to everybody like, all right, we're just going to

457
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,420
push this two weeks and then two weeks passed. And I didn't feel the need to send another email.

458
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:40,940
I think everyone understood the code by then. So I now I'm very sad that Pickwick, this is a

459
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:47,660
character who's the epitome of fun. I assume from the very little information about him.

460
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,660
Now he makes me think of a baby shower that couldn't happen and boring townhouses that are

461
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,860
getting built. So yeah, you will see when you every time you go through the mansion and you

462
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:02,140
see him on the chandelier, you'll think of COVID. I think I might. Yeah. The early day, the beginnings

463
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:09,340
of the pandemic. Well, that's not fair to poor Esmeth's pick. What is the name? Esmeth's Cromwell

464
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,220
Pickwick. It's an update they should do. There's people, there's ghosts of all eras in the mansion

465
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:20,700
and maybe they should throw in a couple of COVID ghosts in there too. Okay. Modern looking people

466
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:27,340
tied in the 2020s. They've got a phone with them. Kim is in charge of some of this stuff. So maybe

467
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:31,740
we just, yeah, talk to her. It just is a nod to what we've all been through. I think people

468
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,820
would appreciate it. Some COVID ghosts. Yeah. I think we've talked about before, yeah, where

469
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,940
these ghosts are from and exactly. They don't really tell you exactly. Like it's, it's two in

470
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:46,300
the past, you know, that's why you can enjoy ghosts. You can only enjoy past ghosts. There's

471
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:51,420
like a hundred year, like a hundred ish years where you go, oh, now it's a ghost and that's fun. And

472
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:57,500
you don't get depressed. There's not like a, I'm trying to think how to like pin a ghost to an era.

473
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:03,580
There's not a ghost with like Gordon Gekko's slicked back hair and a big cell phone. There's

474
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:10,220
not a ghost or you know the era. Now you're actually talking, now you're making a better

475
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:15,260
case for more recent ghosts. Yeah. I think that'd be cool. Just throw in like five, like a ghost

476
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:24,460
from each decade. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So one of them, somebody who was on the plane with all the rock

477
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:30,460
stars, the day the music guy, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,700
Have all of like Richie Valens, a big bopper and. Yeah. Why doesn't it be them? I was thinking like

479
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,500
to not pin and make it like one of their publicists or something. Am I, although is that even such a

480
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,220
thing? Did other people die? I don't know. I forget. I think, didn't I say that that would be a good

481
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:54,780
ride at a hard rock park? Oh yeah. Oh, that's great. Well, wait, did you say the plane ride or did you

482
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:00,940
say someone trying to get to the levy to find the levy was dry from the song, the music guy? No,

483
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:05,740
no. I think that was your pitch was just the Don McLean. You mean what you're saying? Yeah.

484
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:11,580
American pie. American pie. That's American pie. The ride. Yeah. American pie. The ride.

485
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,620
The secret to actually see the going to the levy, but the levy was dry. The levy was dry.

486
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:22,540
And then you flip on like, all right, well, time to drive home. Let me flip on the radio. Oh no.

487
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,580
You get the news. Yeah. And then the ride, and then it just kind of ends on a solemn note.

488
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:32,620
Uh huh. It's a long ride though. Yeah. It's a long ride. There's some God stuff in there too.

489
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:39,740
Yeah. Have you, uh, you've found faith in the God above something like that? Yeah. Okay. That's

490
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:45,900
a good idea too. When we get Binkowski on here, so much to pitch him. So much rock and roll stuff.

491
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:51,260
And then he'll pitch to us that we finance the new hard rock park and we'll all be so starstruck

492
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,900
that we're with the founder of hard rock park. We'll say, yes, anything, Mr. Binkowski, sir.

493
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:02,860
Then we're now we're like all the money we have in the tank. One month of Patreon, sir. Here it is.

494
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:12,060
Is that enough? Okay. At least to build it out of boxes or something. Yeah. Um, anyway, he's look,

495
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:17,740
Pickwick's fun. Um, this is a general thing about the room, I think to acknowledge about the grand

496
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:24,460
hall. I really love this particular, uh, part of the movement of like, I don't know what the,

497
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:30,060
the correct music terminology, but like this little section of the grim grinning goes sweet

498
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:35,580
that now we've, we've heard the song, uh, you know, like creepy and meandering in Oregon.

499
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:42,380
And now we're hearing it as this creepy waltz, which has such like discordant, like as that

500
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:48,860
verse goes on, some of those notes are like crazy atonal, right? It's a little, it's like sounding a

501
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:53,580
little experimental. That's some like, that's some kooky music for sure. It's the atonal. And then

502
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:58,780
sometimes we're like the original melody, you know, the note, it goes like a step down or a full

503
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,860
step down. Uh, it goes up, you know, they take, do different, there's different sort of notes

504
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,740
plugged in a little bit, which is very unsettling as you describe that. That's part of the feel of

505
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:15,500
like just being like tossed around in this creepy carnival atmosphere. Um, that's cool. Um, so yeah,

506
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:22,300
I had that thought as well, listening to this buddy Baker did the music, but not the, like the,

507
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,940
the lyrics of the song were exitentia, but the instrumental, and I think the arrangements was

508
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:33,100
buddy Baker. Um, it's just great music through, and maybe this is my favorite iteration, although

509
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:39,100
of course the ending, um, sorry to be so forward, but the, the, the like true part with lyrics is

510
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:45,820
a lot of fun. Uh, yeah, no, I think, I think if it's any part, I don't know, it's hard to beat

511
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:53,580
the first time you hear it, the slow version. Uh, if, if I may go back backward, uh, when it,

512
00:48:53,580 --> 00:49:00,860
when you come into the mansion, when you first hear it, I think maybe that's the number one version

513
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:07,500
of, or the, yeah, the number one way I like to hear the song number two, probably full grim,

514
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:15,980
grinning ghosts, like jig, but the waltz is, the waltz is up there. Third, maybe third. If I had to

515
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:22,220
rank the ways I hear grim, grinning ghost sections of grim, grinning ghost. Yeah. And then upon

516
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:29,580
Wikipedia for the song and there's a buddy Baker asked a film organist named Gaylord Carter to,

517
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:35,180
uh, he'd done, he did the other organ tracks as well. Uh, like, so that first one that you're

518
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:40,460
describing, the organ was played by this guy. And then he, he basically described what you're

519
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:44,060
saying. This sort of like a tonal all over the place. You don't know where it's going, just like

520
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:52,300
improvise over this, uh, this carnival, this waltz, not beat, whatever this music bed that I made.

521
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:59,260
And he did one and it was too like, uh, simple or like not cracked out enough. Like he, he had to

522
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:05,020
go to a different organist who was less a perfect by the rules organist and say, just go crazy

523
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:10,380
on this. It should be so unsettling and avant-garde. Um, that's pretty cool. I never,

524
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:16,780
I've not thought about this music being composed and to like sort of the, the wild swings they had

525
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,540
to take somebody was more of a tradition. They should have gone to like, and I'm trying to think

526
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:26,460
who today they would have gone to like Trey Anastasio from fish or something. You know,

527
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,500
somebody really a noodler, a real noodler, like that type of musician. If they ever play,

528
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:36,060
are they the kind of band that would play grim grinning ghosts have bands played?

529
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:41,100
Oh yeah. 100%. Yeah. I mean, buck, we know bucket head. We've brought bucket head up on the show

530
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:46,140
before a bucket had a solo musician who wears a KFC bucket on his head. Uh, he has played,

531
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,620
I think the house of blues at downtown Disney and done groom grinning ghosts and a couple other

532
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:55,580
things. He was also briefly in guns and roses when Axel had the rest of the band kicked out.

533
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,060
Um, but yeah, he's played it for sure. It looks like fish has played groom grinning ghosts.

534
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:04,140
Yeah, that makes sense to me. Yeah. The very good ladies have covered groom grinning ghosts as well.

535
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,820
Ah, there's a bare naked ladies cover. That's pretty like, that's the kind of the end version

536
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:13,580
of it. Uh, very bouncy. Ska bands for sure. Most of, especially those orange county ones

537
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:19,500
we talk about with Jordan Morris. Have to imagine. Yeah. So there's probably so many covers of it.

538
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:27,020
Um, but yeah, I like the, obviously the haunt cast, the fright theme and stuff is all based

539
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:32,540
on this thing. Uh, our own buddy, Mike Carlson, our own buddy, buddy,

540
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:38,860
Baker, I guess the Roddy Baker. I think that's good. Right? Yeah, I think so. Um, obviously

541
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:43,580
musically it's good. I'm just, you know, I don't know past that. Yeah. Maybe was he nice? I just

542
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:48,380
want to make sure that's your say. Well, I don't, that's not on the Wikipedia. I'm concerned if I'm

543
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,260
being, yeah, they really, that should be one of the things controversy section. That should just be

544
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:57,500
on Wikipedia when it lists like age and where they're from and like, which is to say like nice.

545
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:03,660
And then it'll say yes or no. I just would like, it would be good to know. Well, he was the musical

546
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:09,180
director on Bob Hope's radio show. So if you get along well with Bob Hope, you gotta be a very nice

547
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:14,700
guy. That's a good point. Uh, okay. So great. Great. You know, he did the music for, you know,

548
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:20,220
that scary when Disney started putting out VHS is and there's that like laser Mickey,

549
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:25,020
do you know what I'm talking about? It's like a neon outline that is so frightening. Although I'm

550
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,940
just one of those people who is scared of every VHS logo that ever existed. I know what you're

551
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:35,020
talking. But he did the music for that. Definitely anything like that. Those, those just frightening

552
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:43,660
company logos always, which were often would have some just weird sounds like, and I, and I was,

553
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:47,260
I just didn't know. I was three years old and I didn't know what they were. Like, why, how

554
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:51,260
can I watch a movie and then there's all these things? So, huh? Yeah. I know. I know what you're

555
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:57,100
saying. It's just like the, yeah, what if we Google that? I want to see to know exactly what

556
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:03,020
you're talking about. Well, I'm sure you that Googling laser Mickey gives you a lot of Etsy

557
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:08,300
results for engraved and etched. All right. Well, we'll do that off air. We'll figure that out.

558
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:16,700
If I may cut in, if we could take a step back, not chronologically, but a step, but the bigger

559
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:23,980
picture and talk about this room as the world's largest peppers ghost insulation. Yeah. Yes.

560
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:30,300
John Henry Pepper invented, uh, uh, was a professor, a scientist. Yes. Uh, may I cut

561
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,700
in immediately? Uh, cause John, he, of course is, do we talk about this before where he kind of like

562
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:41,980
stole the idea? He's taken sole credit. Well, he's taken credit. Oh yeah. There's like five other

563
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:47,500
people who are also doing ghosts, the actual effects around this time. Uh huh. Um, but like

564
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:53,020
it was pepper and then what guy's name is Henry Dirks. Yeah. Uh, Henry Dirks was kind of the guy

565
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:58,060
who kind of came up with the idea. And then from what I was reading, John Henry Pepper was more

566
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:04,540
of like a entertainment scientist, someone who cared more about theatricality and thought that

567
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:11,100
was a better way to teach people on, you know, like a Bill Nye of his day or a Beakman of his day,

568
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:16,860
if you will. So Mr. Pepper was like, he, he liked to, you know, he was a science guy, I guess we call

569
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:23,260
him. Um, but he's more of a science guy. And, uh, I think that at a certain point they had both,

570
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,900
they had both like were, uh, uh, involved with, you know, I think they both thought whatever you

571
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,700
would do patent or whatever this idea, but then at a certain point it kind of became solely credited

572
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:39,420
to pepper and then Henry was pissed. Ah, he was mad. He felt like he got shot, like shut out of

573
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,380
the credit. And I guess to this day, he's right. Yeah. If he had a lot to do with it named after

574
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,260
the guy after a guy, then the guy who maybe didn't come up with the fundamental idea of it.

575
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:56,380
No. And, uh, to add insult to injury, he didn't get payments for like the patent because so many

576
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:02,700
other people have been like, Hey, I've been doing a traveling show, Fantasmagoria show for 10 years

577
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:08,300
with a ghost man. Like everyone went, no, no, I'm not using your technology. I'm using their

578
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:16,300
technology. Yeah. So there was a lot of traveling ghost shows this, this era, this is so confusing

579
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:26,300
to me or just hard to picture that like it's like optical pre digital, pre like, like largely not

580
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,300
pre electricity, but pretty like lots of electricity. You know what I'm saying?

581
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:36,380
Lantern shows and mysticism is the rise of mysticism falls right around this,

582
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:42,060
this time period because everyone was curious about the afterlife and like modern medicine,

583
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:48,460
still a little down the road. So everyone just like, Oh, you can stub your toe. Oh, you're fucked.

584
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:54,220
It was nice knowing you. Gangrene is coming for your ingrown toe ass.

585
00:55:55,100 --> 00:56:00,540
Well, so yeah, I was looking up, can I find some pepper stuff? I didn't know. And he was like,

586
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:06,700
he did start to, I think people were going, all right, that we've seen the pepper's ghost. Yes,

587
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:11,820
we know about it. Right. You need some other tricks up your sleeve or not tricks, but you know,

588
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:17,820
serious science demonstrations up your sleeve. I somewhere saw that he, one of the things that he

589
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:22,460
did in his show, this, I don't think it was the closer, but along the way he would, he would

590
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:32,860
he would turn a dog into a string of sausages. Not sure how I don't like to see it. Jason's here.

591
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:41,260
That's what you do mentally to us. If you're bored by what we're saying,

592
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:51,820
if I'm just getting real hungry, but that's weird. But then he, he had a big stint of

593
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:57,660
convincing, trying to convince people that he could do a rainmaking. Like he was touring

594
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:03,740
Australia a lot. A lot of his act was done in Australia and he did a big rainmaking demonstration

595
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:10,780
in a town that was suffering an immense drought. And so people did genuinely turn their hopes

596
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:18,220
to the man who invented this ghost effect. Maybe he can make rain come to our town. That's so

597
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:24,780
sorely needed. And he'll do it using this big science kite. It was like, it was referred to

598
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:31,180
in a real book. I was looking at as a scientific kite, but the scientific kite was too heavy and

599
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:38,780
it didn't even get off the ground, much less create rain from the sky. So this was a bit,

600
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:45,980
and people just booed him immediately. And this was, and I think this was part of like a,

601
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:53,260
maybe a bigger collapse for Mr. Pepper because he also, there was another guy touring, as you were

602
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:59,100
alluding, there's, they had competitors, these kinds of optical magic guys. And there was another

603
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:06,540
guy named professor Anderson, the great wizard of the North. And he started attracting audience away

604
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:12,620
from professor Pepper and Brisbane. The Brisbane or is there more interested in seeing the great

605
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:20,780
wizard of the North because his tricks included beheading ladies, great turning boys into pumps.

606
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:27,580
I don't know what that means. Like a water pump, I guess. Okay. Like dogs and sausage. I understand.

607
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:33,740
That's like a thing in a cartoon, but a boy in a pump, those like shoes. Maybe I don't think they

608
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:41,500
were calling shoes pumps in those days. Possibly. Couldn't tell you. And now I will change a boy

609
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,180
into shoes. Marcus is now a Manolo.

610
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:54,860
But then also like what's Pepper supposed to do? Cause professor Anderson would give people gifts

611
00:58:54,860 --> 00:59:02,620
for coming to the show. Like sweets of furniture, horses, coffee sets and gold watches. I now

612
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:07,340
question whoever wrote what I just read. Why wouldn't a horse be the end? You're saying all

613
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:14,300
you have to do is come to this magic show and you will get a horse. You own a horse now to say

614
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,940
nothing of the gold watch or like the couch. I don't know how you're getting the couch back on

615
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,980
horseback. That's as desperate as Six Flags giving away that crazy meal plan where you get three

616
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:29,820
square meals a day. If you buy an annual pass. Did you see that viral tweet about the, somebody

617
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:35,980
running into a woman who went to Six Flags every day, having gotten that pass and ate all her

618
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,620
meals at the Six Flags. It's not a bad idea if you live right there and you're on a budget.

619
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:47,180
It's crazy. But if you work at the Sunkist building, like you're set, like pop over,

620
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:52,460
swing by for breakfast. It's assuming that Sunkist headquarters that are next to Magic Mountain,

621
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:58,940
that's assuming that there aren't immense Sunkist perks or where they might be so loaded up on juice.

622
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:04,780
Oh yeah. There's so much said as it is. Well, there's not a lot of other options

623
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,940
outside of that office park. I mean, maybe they have a cafeteria, but there's the Wendy's and

624
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:14,780
the Six Flags and you kind of got to go a little farther. I think though nothing like the only way

625
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:20,300
that would be, I think better. That's like, it would have to be closer than my kitchen.

626
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:27,100
Like if the amusement park is closer. Yeah. I don't know what would make that or I would

627
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:31,020
have to not have a kitchen maybe. Yeah. That's a good point. I mean, it's still like, I'm trying

628
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:38,060
to think like if Universal had, we live very, very close to Universal right now, but it's still like,

629
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:43,900
is it worth like, say they had the same deal. You can get three meals at Universal every day.

630
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:50,620
Jason, okay. Let's ask Jason this. Well, I have to say when I was living at the Oakwoods in college,

631
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:55,100
the apartment buildings right down the street from Universal and I had a Universal badge,

632
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:00,540
because I was an intern at a production company on the back lot. I would go over Tuesday nights,

633
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:04,940
almost every Tuesday night for dollar fish taco night at City Walk at Rubio's when there was a

634
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:10,700
Rubio's fish tacos up there. You were right there though, but it was only once a week. Say your annual

635
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,940
Are you paying for, what was the parking? You didn't have to pay you out of badge. Okay. All right.

636
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,100
Well, that's pretty good. That's a good deal. All right. Let me quickly, quickly do this. Okay.

637
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:23,900
You live where you live now, which is very close to Universal. Sure. Very close. Will I give the

638
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:28,860
address or street? I wish it went in. Okay. I won't. But it's very close. You say you have an

639
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:34,620
annual pass, $250 a year, let's say. Parking included. So you can get pretty close up there.

640
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:40,620
You get, let's say 300 and every day, every day a year, you could go up there and have three meals.

641
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:45,580
There's three hours between meals. You can't get them immediately back to back and like take them

642
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:52,860
back. How often do you think you would utilize this pass with a free meal? Be like really just

643
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:58,140
like think about it. How do you think two to three times a week? Okay. For one meal or would you hang

644
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:04,140
out up there? I think some days I would hang out between meals and work on my laptop. If I'm just

645
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:10,780
researching in this scenario, I'm working on the podcast. If I'm just pulling pictures and professional

646
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:20,460
podcast, the Serle book. Yeah. Okay. So two to three times a week. Okay. That's like, that makes

647
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:27,500
sense. What if there was like a really very good filling sensible breakfast, but you had to go all

648
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:33,500
the way down. It's next to transformers. You're all the way, you're down all the escalators.

649
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,820
I really hate doing that track sometimes. Yeah. Okay. I know you wouldn't do breakfast. This time

650
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:43,180
of year when the weather's mild, it's fine. Oh, for the heat, that's your issue. Well, the heat and

651
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:50,060
yeah, the crowds. I think. Yeah. It's a little gnarly. I just did it for the first time successfully

652
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:56,860
with my son having to hold him. Oh wow. I had not taken him to universal, but not that not to the

653
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:02,220
lower lot because that is a two parent operation because one has to have the stroller and one has

654
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:08,860
to have the child and he boy, he got so squirmy on every flight. Like no, no, no, no, but he made it

655
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:14,780
great. It ended up working out. I can't say I'm going to do it super regularly, but as we talk

656
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:22,300
about food and I guess beverage at that park, here's a declaration that me and everybody I was with,

657
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:27,820
my friends, Tyler and Kia, they have this at Florida as well. I had it down in Florida. They

658
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:35,100
have it in Hollywood. The wait, is it the Island new bar? It's the Island new bar is the place,

659
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:41,420
but the Island new blar still spelled the full way IPA Island new bar IPA. We all declared it

660
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:47,820
the best beer in theme parks in any of them. All of them go give it a try. It's a big haul. You

661
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:52,140
got to get down to the bottom, uh, you know, and it's on the fruitier end. You might dig it Mike,

662
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:56,700
but not like so crazily. Uh, we were, we were all in agreement on this point. So there's a take that

663
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:01,660
I'm going to, I'm going to lock in. They might not have it forever. So I'm just, uh, to any

664
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:05,420
listeners, very enthusiastic, whether it loves it in Florida, loves it here. How do you feel about

665
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:12,380
IPAs in general? Cause they got very overexposed in the 2010s. I think not to, not to me. I think

666
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:17,660
I've only recently been drinking that. And I think it's a very like drinkable, but fruity, as I said,

667
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:24,460
like, um, I, I almost wouldn't even think about what kind it was. So it's not overpoweringly IPA

668
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:31,100
ish. I like, I like a little fruity. I like the two ends of this session. IPA, which is a lot less

669
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:37,100
alcohol or double IPA, which is a lot more alcohol, but very herbally and very earthy. This is like

670
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:41,900
almost, I think it's 7% or something. Okay. That's about average. I think. Yeah. Yeah. So they can

671
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:47,980
like thicken it for you, like thicken the, well, no, I'll drink regular IPA. Sure. But it was like

672
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:52,540
a double you're saying, I guess I don't really have much experience with double. I actually like IPA

673
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:57,820
a lot. Yeah. Like you got to go try it. And I'm immediately like my like taste budget, like, yeah,

674
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:02,940
give me that. I like, for some reason, IPA specifically not beer. Right. He does something

675
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:07,660
to my taste buds. I don't know. Some people get down there. Let's all go down there. Sure. I lost

676
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:15,900
my annual pass at Hornet. Oh no. I lost it. Yeah. That didn't service. You were already being, you

677
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,380
had so much shame coming into that episode with you didn't want to throw that one out. Yeah. No,

678
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:26,380
I lost. I think on the exorcist line, I lost it. Oh boy. First of all, okay. Well, yeah, I was gonna

679
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:31,020
end up being now pretty by loosening the rules. Now we're this is going to end up being three.

680
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:34,540
It's gonna be. Yeah, we're three hours. We're real quick. Real quick. That shitty little piece

681
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:41,180
of shitty paper. Oh yeah. Universal annual pass. What at this point in 2021, is this still in paper?

682
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:47,020
It's not plastic. It's insane. Wow. Yeah. It fades like after like two uses, you've like take it out

683
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,620
of your pocket. You're like, you can barely read anything on this thing. You have it on your phone.

684
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:57,500
It's crazy. I don't think so. Maybe you can. Maybe I'm behind, but it's crazy. It's the flimsiest

685
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:02,780
thing in my wallet. Of course it's gonna, it's like, I'm trying to think like what it was.

686
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:06,780
It's like you're carrying your social security card on you that you've had since you were a child,

687
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:13,340
baby. Yes. It's like that flimsy basically. I mean, the paper is a little bit more sturdy,

688
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:18,860
but the ink is rubbing off constantly. Like I've only had it for like two months and I could barely

689
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:23,900
even see it at that point. And then I just lost it because it gets too fun. I don't know what I was

690
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:28,300
doing. That's insane. That's the same. Anyway, I'm annoyed by that. I don't think I have a hard Disney

691
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:32,700
pass. The magic key. I think it is only on my phone. Yeah. Yeah. They not even give you one.

692
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,700
I don't think so. I don't think that. I mean, did you get your box yet? Did you get a box?

693
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:43,260
Your welcome box? Was that in the lounge? Uh, no, they mail it to you. You're a, you know,

694
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:48,780
if you, if you register within the first 66 days, you get a box. I don't have a box. What do you mean?

695
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,900
Shipping out. They'd still wait. So you don't have your box. I don't have a box. Okay. Few.

696
01:06:53,900 --> 01:07:02,220
We're Mickey's little key kids. Yeah. We want our boxes. Mickey. Mickey boxes. Okay. Let's,

697
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:06,700
all right. Let's keep, let's keep going. Let's move forward. The hearst, I guess would be the

698
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:12,540
next thing. The hearst bursting through the door. The, uh, what little scene let's in the room in

699
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:17,260
the, in the hearst hall, the hearse. You mean that William Randolph? I'm sorry. I'm saying

700
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:23,100
the William Randolph. I wrote it down wrong. I wrote it. I did write that wrong. The hearse.

701
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:30,540
Shut this down. Shut this party down. No fun will be had here. Cool aid manning its way into the

702
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:37,020
room. William Randolph first as the cool aid man. Thank you for bursting into the room. Uh,

703
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:42,700
anyway, sorry. The hearse. The hearse. Yes. Bursting into the room. There is an early Mark Davis

704
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:49,900
concept art of ghosts arriving to the event out of a hearse, but this is a little more like,

705
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:55,580
yeah, the hearse is bursting into the room and ghosts are getting out of it. That is a real quick

706
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:03,260
transition though, from hearse, from dead in the hearse to party. Don't you feel like there's a

707
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:08,300
longer transition you have to make in the afterlife? Apparently not. Great. Let's get right to it. I

708
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:13,100
think you're right. I could die and go right to that ballroom party. You don't even have to get

709
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:17,340
like processed through, I guess if you ghost, you're not in heaven or hell. You're in, you have

710
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:22,780
unfinished business because it's a Casper rule. Oh yeah. So I guess their unfinished business was

711
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:29,180
we haven't partied enough. Yeah. Which I guess is fucking cool. Go eat, they need to eat more cake.

712
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:34,780
Yeah. So I like that. I like the idea of it, but it is funny because it's like driver,

713
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:42,620
take us back to where we were hanging out before. She's like, okay, dead, huh? Let's find some ghost

714
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:49,500
parties. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I'm on board with that. Has Andrew WK covered Grim Grinning Ghosts?

715
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:56,220
What do we think? I don't know. I can look it up. All right. Jason, you have more thoughts about

716
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,980
the hearse? No, I just think it's, it's nice. There's ghosts in between that and the big

717
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:07,660
table, the big table. If we want to talk quickly, move into the table. Well, may I cut in? Yes. And

718
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:12,940
I want to talk, there's, there's a, they have this, the gag, I would have, you'd call it, I keep calling

719
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:17,100
things gags. The effect to where like, you know, the ballroom dancers are kind of spinning in a

720
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:22,860
circle and then they're basically just, you know, dummies on a circular like mechanism that's

721
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:27,980
twirling them around. Lazy Susan. A lazy, big lazy Susan. Probably not accurate, but sure. But kind of.

722
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:35,260
I mean, similar. But there is that same effect going on over with a couple of different characters

723
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:42,300
that are nameless over by the, by the fireplace. And one of the characters has a giant like Captain

724
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:47,180
Crunch style hat on. Do you know what I'm talking about? I, I, yeah, I kind of know what you're

725
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:51,020
talking about. Again, this is like right in the periphery of your vision. Right, Scott, do you know

726
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,980
what I'm talking about? I can't quite picture it. There's Captain, I should have gotten a good

727
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:59,420
picture of him, but there's a Captain Crunch ghost. Basically. And I'm fascinated by him because he's

728
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:04,380
got that big like old time general's hat on and I'll show, I should find a picture of it here.

729
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:10,620
There's a lot of military kind of ghosts. A lot of various eras. The Roman soldier on the chandelier.

730
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:17,260
Yeah, the captain down there. Well, you know, I didn't say about in the Pepper's Ghost effect,

731
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:24,140
the set that you are seeing is also replicated off stage where the actual physical animatronics are

732
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:30,540
in matte black and it matches exactly. Yeah. So basically there's a, there's a big piece of glass,

733
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:37,900
which to this day I go through that room and I don't see the glass. Yeah. Yeah. I never say,

734
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:43,020
I, I know my brain knows all glad there's glass there and that's what you're seeing a reflection.

735
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:48,060
The ghost appearing, it's a reflection, but I don't see the glass. I don't never see it.

736
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:54,780
Someone shot it once. Was that true? Someone brought a small caliber rifle into the park

737
01:10:54,780 --> 01:11:00,860
and shot it like the snowflakes in the inner space. And then they shot the glass, like crack the glass

738
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:05,100
that happened in inner space too. They, they, they fired at those snow at the like snowflake

739
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:11,580
atomized kind of things. Yeah. Whoa. And then, which that's crazy. You could just get a gun in there

740
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:16,860
at that time. And then in Florida a few years ago. Oh really? Like the guy's gun fell out on

741
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:23,100
like a dinosaur, I think something like that. Yeah. You probably wouldn't have been like,

742
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:27,180
you get scared on that ride. If you had a gun with you, you might be, you might feel a little

743
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:32,140
more secure. Oh, you're saying I should bring a gun. Yeah. Yeah. The picture of how terrified I

744
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:36,700
still am. That thing yells at you. Yeah. Maybe, no, maybe I don't need, it doesn't even have to be

745
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:43,900
loaded. Just like I hold it for confidence. You'd feel so confident, I think, and not way more

746
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:49,180
nervous about the gun going off. Not like Barney Fife on an episode of Andy Griffin where his hands

747
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:55,740
are just nervously shaking. Oh, Andy. Yeah, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be like that at all.

748
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:03,500
This is one of those weird like Snoopy, like it is a real thing and that they didn't, it was like,

749
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:09,740
like they, you would have to airlift in a new pane of glass. It is so massive. Yeah. So how could they

750
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:15,100
possibly, it's like that rides down for years if they wanted to replace it entirely. And then

751
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:20,860
somebody said, why don't you just drape a cobweb over it. And that's what happened. And that, now I

752
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:26,780
don't know where that is. I, I, I don't have any sense of where the bullet hole hiding cobweb is

753
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:31,020
in the ride. It was there for a while. Who knows if it's still there. I mean, at this day and age,

754
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:37,900
they could have figured out a way to seal it like a little cleanly. I, are you still, are you looking

755
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:42,380
up Andrew W. Where are you at? Oh, I know he has not done Grim Grin Ghost. I'm trying to find a

756
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:48,220
picture of this Captain Crunch. But this, this version, they only showed there's a lady with like

757
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:52,620
kind of an umbrella that floats around in that same loop. And then there's another guy kind of

758
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:57,740
has a bowler hat as well, who I like the look of him, but Captain Crunch Ghost is not there.

759
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:03,340
So we're saying, are you saying that there's, in terms, when you're saying that there's a matching

760
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:08,940
set, so all the, like you're up on the second level of the scene and all the ghost animatronics

761
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:14,780
are under you. So are you saying that there's like, oh, like in the case of the one in the chair,

762
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:17,980
the old room in the chair. Yeah, so like the rocking chair, this is like the, her,

763
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:26,700
sitting in a matte black rocking chair. And so that, so then that, from your point of view,

764
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:32,380
it looks like she's sitting in a real rocking chair. And I think it's so that the gleam of the

765
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:40,380
object doesn't like upstage her. So like, there's like, it kind of replaces it in the,

766
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:48,220
a lot of this is like how the mind processes these reflections. Wow. Wow. And then, so how does it

767
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:55,660
work when, because there's characters at a, at a table. So, but there's not a table over there,

768
01:13:55,660 --> 01:14:00,940
but is there any, is there like a black facsimile of a table? Yeah, sort of a facsimile of it.

769
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:05,420
There's actually a good video, I should find the link to it, that kind of shows off these,

770
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:10,460
what look like really like underground pictures. Like we shouldn't be looking at this. Like,

771
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:15,420
yeah. Like, cause it looks. Oh, I found one here. Oh, this is crazy. Yeah. It's like,

772
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:20,780
it is like black box theater decor. Yeah. But it looks like they're at a big, they're,

773
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:25,420
they're involved in front of a big black box. It looks grimy. Yeah.

774
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:32,300
Yeah. Cause the stuff on the plates, like I, I, the, the woman at the head of the table is

775
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:39,180
blowing out the candles on the cake and the ghosts appear and reappear, but the stuff on their plates

776
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:43,900
also appear and reappear. Oh, is that right? Items on the plate? I think. I'm being shown.

777
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:48,220
I think some stuff appears and reappears. Some stuff is just there permanently. I'm trying to

778
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:53,100
show you Captain Crunch Ghost, it's not a possible screenshot. It's like down in this corner here.

779
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:58,940
There he is. Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. So I mean, it's like a, it's a Napoleon sort of,

780
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:02,700
yeah, that's a good, that's a good, better way to put it. I suppose if you want to go with like a

781
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:08,700
famous guy and not a cereal box mascot, I'm still not getting the name of the hat, right?

782
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:14,380
Yeah, no. Does anyone know yet the name of, of Captain Crunch's and Napoleon's hat?

783
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:20,460
We don't need to know these kinds of things anymore. There he is. Oh, sure. Yeah. Jason,

784
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:25,180
you don't kind of have that in there? I know that. Is that like what a, like a general would wear

785
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:32,060
or something back in the, in the day? What was Napoleon's rank? Seeing it as a bicorn hat or a

786
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:39,420
bicorn? A bicorn maybe or a naval cocked hat. Might be a naval cocked hat. Oh boy, both of those

787
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:46,780
things are good. It's a cocked bicorn. It's a cocked, it's a cocked bicorn. Got it. Even,

788
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:52,220
even the footage you just showed, I forget that that's where the old lady in the rocking chair is

789
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:57,260
because again, there's so much going on in here. She's like right next to the fireplace. Yes. And

790
01:15:57,260 --> 01:16:01,660
then as I said, there's like a lady with an umbrella, there's a bowler hat guy all in that

791
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:12,460
little loop with the corn, bike, bike horn, cocked, bike horn hat. Yeah. Is that even right already?

792
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:16,780
If I lost it or anything, we've lost it already. Uh, yeah. No, I think, yeah, it's a cocked bike horn.

793
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:22,300
Um, lady in the rocking chair is from carousel of progress. Yes. That is a re-create. And,

794
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:27,900
and it's not the only reuse because, and now I don't remember which rumor if we, well, no,

795
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:33,420
we want to, wouldn't have come across it already. The, the pirate auctioneer or the one of the dual,

796
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:40,140
one of the dualers is the, I think the other dualer is also a pirate. Wow. Wow. Which is pretty

797
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:46,620
clever because it is reuse. Sure. But it's an extremely different context. And maybe if you're

798
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:53,100
tying it all together, it's a ghosts of those characters or their descendants or something.

799
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:58,700
Maybe. I mean, you, you set dress on the, the, the costuming, the facial hair, the hat,

800
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:05,180
like all the accoutrements are different. That helps hide it. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Um, I,

801
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:09,900
in this neck of the woods, here's something that I think has not come up in any of the haunted

802
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:14,300
mansion years prior, although who knows. So if you're somehow listening to this as a series,

803
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,500
or if you're waiting to, I'd like to think that there's a listener out there who's waiting to

804
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:23,900
binge it until it's done. Like the way week to week, you'll kind of like, Oh, I'm going to let

805
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:29,980
all of succession air and then I'll watch all 10 in a row. Uh, maybe, maybe there's people who are,

806
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:33,740
in that case, you're not hearing this. Uh, let them know if you have a friend,

807
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:38,460
who's waiting to binge them all. Let them know I'm thinking about them. Uh, but I apologize if I

808
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:45,180
brought this up before, but, um, okay. So there's a couple, I mean, there's a lot of good specials,

809
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:49,020
I guess, where you get to see haunted mansion stuff up close and get closer to the ghosts.

810
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:54,380
Uh, there's this early, right when it opened, there was this thing with Kurt Russell and the Osmonds.

811
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:59,980
That's a pretty good ride through of the mansion as it looked in the sixties when it opened. Um,

812
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:05,980
but one of the, one of the best ones, I think where you get the most detail is the, the 35th

813
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:15,180
anniversary special in which it's a star studded special, Ernest is in it, Tony Danza hosts it.

814
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:21,740
Uh, the Muppets are in it. And there is this long sequence with a kid who goes on the haunted

815
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:27,340
mansion, who is scared as friends kind of peer pressure him, but there is, there's a pretty girl,

816
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:31,980
a pretty young girl who says, here, come along, I'll do it with you. This won't be so scary.

817
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,300
And if you guys watch this thing, do you know what I'm talking about?

818
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:44,780
I, I feel like that, that setup they used, I feel like I've seen that setup before and it

819
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:48,620
could have just been a rear of the special like recycled on Disney channel.

820
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:55,580
Like, I mean, yeah, it's a very stock where like, uh, uh, spoiler, the girl who he goes to the

821
01:18:55,580 --> 01:19:01,340
ride with at some point he turns and looks away and then looks back and the girl is gone. Uh, she

822
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:08,300
was a ghost. Um, but I, I bring it up because, um, these, these actors who were in the sequence got

823
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:14,540
to dance on the floor of the ball. Like they're doing the ride from the doom buggies, but then

824
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:19,500
she kind of like snaps her fingers and then they're down there on the ballroom floor next to the

825
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:24,700
ghosts. So everybody involved in making this thing got to know how, how to do it. And then

826
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:29,980
got to know how it worked and got to be next to the ghost. Uh, this, this, this whole sequence

827
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:35,180
is fun. Charlie Fleischer is in it. Uh, the voice of Roger Rabbit playing a scary haunted

828
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:40,780
mansion guy. The crazy thing about it though, that I'm leaving out is the bookends to this

829
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:45,340
because it's this long, just like a six minute journey through the haunted mansion, uh, where

830
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:50,300
you see every scene and follow this young kid. Uh, to the point where when it loops back around

831
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:55,260
at the end, you forgot the initial bookend was this character is Woody from cheers.

832
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:02,380
In this all star special. And this is the cold open. There's not even a title card saying the

833
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:09,500
35 years of it just starts like an episode of cheers and all the characters except for, uh, Sam

834
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:15,740
and either Diane or Rebecca, probably Rebecca at that point. Uh, they're all there and like,

835
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:21,660
they're talking about Disneyland Disneyland memories. And then Woody like, Oh yeah, I went

836
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:28,140
there one time and he, and he flashes to this story and that's all on multicam cheers set.

837
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:32,140
And then this is shot like a film. That's one of the best things about this special to me.

838
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:38,940
Wow. Uh, you know, looks at all these rides. Um, but then this, so you're watching this random kid

839
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:43,660
actor and then at the end he takes the, all that's left of the girl is her ribbon and he's like

840
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:49,900
rubbing it on her on his face lovingly. And then it flashes to Woody from cheers shot

841
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:56,860
multicam style, rubbing up like a bar towel on his face and fondly recalling this ghost girl.

842
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:03,260
He met, which just combining the film and the video is crazy to me to begin with. Then also like,

843
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:10,060
I don't think cheers has supernatural stuff in the mythology. Otherwise, um, I don't think so,

844
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:15,420
but if you're, I mean, it's all the characters though, you have to count this as cannon. Yeah.

845
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:24,380
Yeah. Young Woody met a ghost girl and then told Norm about it. Wow. I have not seen this.

846
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:30,700
This is, I mean, the whole special, I think it is the best special, uh, filmed at the parks.

847
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:35,900
And it is, it's very unfortunate that it's directed by John Landis, but he did, he did a good job.

848
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,980
He set up the cameras. Good. Look, I watched American werewolf for the first time a couple

849
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:46,860
weeks ago. It's good. Yeah. My problems are not so much with the films he makes, but rather with the

850
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:59,900
people he makes anyway, moving on and the people he unmakes. Oh no. Oh no. Check out, uh, check out

851
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:05,980
the goat. What are you dancing with the ghost? One of the strangest short films ever made. Um, and

852
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:10,220
that I bring that up cause that's kind of in the middle between the, you know, there's the table

853
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:15,500
and then there's the ballroom dancing over here. Does anyone, do any particular dancers catch your

854
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:19,260
eye or they all just kind of say it's sort of a, it's hard to catch any details there. They have

855
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:25,180
like different colored hair. Yeah. There's like blue hair. There's like regular hair. There's like

856
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:29,980
yellow. Well, one moment please. One moment. I have more table stuff. Oh, please. Of course.

857
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:37,100
Yes. But all right, you may proceed. I have more tables. Oh, one moment please. I also have a few

858
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:41,660
more, uh, pick quick pieces of information, but Jason, please proceed with the table at the other

859
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:47,020
end of the table. Um, you know, the, the candles being blown out correspond with ghosts appearing

860
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:52,380
and reappearing the other end of the table. There is literally, this was pointed out in numerous

861
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:59,100
places, a great Caesar's ghost. Like there is a ghost of a Caesar of like a, of an effort,

862
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:06,220
like as in the phrase great Caesar's ghost. Um, uh, uh, another, uh, if you look closely

863
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:12,300
under the table, a ghost is sleeping under the table is sticking out from underneath the table.

864
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:17,980
Now I've never caught that, but when I was looking up what Mike was describing, this black box table.

865
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:22,220
Yeah. I clearly see these legs sticking out. That's really funny. I never noticed that either.

866
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:29,180
I'm wondering if that is again in great halls, sometimes very far in the past, some servants

867
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:34,780
at night would roll out little, you know, pads would sleep in the great hall.

868
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:39,900
Hmm. Under the table. Well, just on the floor in the great hall. I was thinking you were going to

869
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:43,740
say like, sometimes people would drink too much. That's what I'm assuming. And go under the table.

870
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:48,620
That could be the other that he, he had a little. I would think that's the gag. Yeah. I would think

871
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:53,020
they wouldn't like just sleeping in the middle of a party. Yeah. That would seem inappropriate. No,

872
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:58,460
they'd be working the party. Yeah. So I think drunk. Yeah. Too much mead. Too much mead.

873
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:02,140
That's probably what happened. And the plates, it seems like there's, um,

874
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:08,300
people would rearrange the dinner plates to make a hidden Mickey at one of the place settings.

875
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:15,580
Uh, debated whether the imagineers cared for that. Although in recent years, it seems like

876
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:21,820
they've loosened up a little. They were mad. They were like, please don't fuss with the ride

877
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:26,460
to like operation. Like, please don't. You mean like operation, not the imagineers in Glendale

878
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:33,580
or in future, like, no, no, they would be upset if the people that are day to day keeping maintenance

879
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:38,700
would do little things like that. Yeah. There's story. There are stories too of people like

880
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:45,740
someone found, uh, photos under the plates, like a photo of, of a person at the park. And it said,

881
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:49,580
on the back, it said, this is my mother. She died of cancer. And we always had nice memories here.

882
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:55,580
Please leave this photo. And they snuck it to an operations person and left it because in a lot of

883
01:24:55,580 --> 01:25:00,940
those place settings, there's a picture under there of what it should look like in case it needs to

884
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:05,660
get cleaned or stuff. Right, right, right. So you could like pay, if like you see like a janitor

885
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:10,620
outside the mansion, you go, Hey buddy, come over here. I got 50 bucks for you. I got something to

886
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:15,820
slip into the mansion and they would go like, Oh, okay. Maybe that's maybe what happened. There's

887
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:21,580
a transactional thing. That's what I mean. Uh, of course the ride filled with ghosts is going to be

888
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:27,580
filled with stories. We hear the stories of happenstance, the ashes, of course. Yeah. Um,

889
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:30,700
but that's interesting. Somebody like slipped a foot. What would you want to leave in there

890
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:36,620
if you had to leave, if you were to pay off a janitor to leave something in there, what would

891
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:41,900
you choose to go to know like, Oh, there's something will be hidden in the haunted mansion forever.

892
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:48,860
Something of mine. Hmm. Well, photo is probably pretty good. You can probably slip a watch. If

893
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:53,820
you had a watch or some piece of jewelry, you could probably slip that on and an animatronic.

894
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:57,020
Oh, that's interesting. At first I was, I'll be honest with you. I'll walk you through my thought

895
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:02,780
process. I went, watch is stupid. And then he said, I'm the robot. And I went, Ooh, really good.

896
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:07,580
Or a ring. No, no, I think you were right. I'm wrong for initially poo pooing the idea in my brain.

897
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:12,380
That's actually pretty good. What about just like a, an X-Men shirt?

898
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:17,820
So when robots could wear it, you slip that on the old Mickey doll, but they placed in the

899
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:27,820
mansion like a gambit shirt. Yeah. Quick is wearing an XXL Rob Liefeld exports. Yeah. Yeah.

900
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:34,380
Cable cable pointing a gun goes for $300 on Depop. Yeah. Well, it's vintage. Yeah. Now

901
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:39,180
Pickwick's wearing it. That would be worth it. Honestly, for just like a couple hours before

902
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:43,820
somebody noticed one of the robots is wearing a retro comic book t-shirt carnage t-shirt.

903
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:49,660
That even doesn't have to be retro. That could just be a Woody Harrelson carnage.

904
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:56,540
One of the freebie Mr. Mercedes shirts. We got multiple years in a row at Comic Con.

905
01:26:56,540 --> 01:27:01,260
Your freebie shirt game is so like, you still have that. It's a menace now. You still have a

906
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:07,580
thing we got 10 years ago, a free mega mind sweatshirt that you sleep in. When it turns cold in LA,

907
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:15,740
I'm putting on that XXL mega mind. I was not paying the daily. I was giving up promotional.

908
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:20,540
Ashton Kutcher screwed all of us and didn't pay us. Ashton Kutcher screwed us. Yeah. We got a

909
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:26,700
kisser David to a now defunct beverage place. We got, we basically, we, we participated in something

910
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:32,780
online called an idea jam where we did improv. We've talked about this before. And it was a

911
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:37,500
bunch of people we know run UCB and none of us got paid. And we got a gift bag at the end that

912
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:44,700
included a mega mind sweatshirt. It was in a star track. This is the original JJ Abrams star track

913
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:50,220
messenger bag. Marissa Strickland and I like quickly got rid of ours. I used mine and it broke

914
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:57,260
within a month. Like it was pretty, like the, these claps like snapped. Like didn't Marissa give hers

915
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:03,580
to you the messenger bag? No, mega mine sweatshirt. Oh, didn't you have two? I didn't have to. I,

916
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:08,540
I don't believe I've ever had to. I think I had the one. No, I remember Marissa got a message from

917
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:13,100
someone. She either went to high school or college with who was editing the videos and was like,

918
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:18,300
Hey, did you do something called an idea jam? She's like, yeah, this is the first I've wanted

919
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:24,540
to move forward on non haunted mansion material. As much as I'm curious how many mega mine sweaters

920
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:30,940
were in play sweatshirts. But if you want to ask, if you want to text Marissa and we'll wait for the

921
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:35,180
answer, I'm good. I'm good. I just imagine that the hat box goes with wearing a mega mine sweatshirt

922
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:41,820
for a couple hours and you got to see it. That would be fucking awesome. I did, I did get like

923
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:46,380
a bubble tea like three years later with that gift card. Yeah. I never used mine. I never,

924
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:50,380
you threw it in the garbage. It was at Hollywood and Highland. So it was a real pain in the ass.

925
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:55,420
Yeah. Not the best, not the easiest place. Anyway, so I'm done with dinner stuff. You had more

926
01:28:55,420 --> 01:29:00,060
pick quick stuff. They've, they've expanded a little pick wick legend and like comics and stuff.

927
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:04,060
And I think this is from the comics. So there's a little more backstory. They called pick wick a

928
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:11,740
comic mole burglar. So they fleshed him out to be kind of a thief guy and he was very afraid of heights.

929
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:18,220
Yeah. And in the lore, he dies in the stretching room. And then when he's dead now, he is no longer

930
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:23,420
afraid of heights. Hence him on the chandelier. Now he's so excited because he's gotten over his

931
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:28,860
fear and he's drinking and having a good time. It was very complicated. So that's a little lore.

932
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:34,540
I don't know. It's one of those things where like there's like different canon that no one really

933
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:40,620
probably follows. Like does the big thunder comic really, do the imaginers really consider that part

934
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:47,900
of canon? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I, the, I, the haunted mansion really is the, it is the king of

935
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:56,380
attractions where the, all the info about the plot and characters and story are not in the ride

936
01:29:56,380 --> 01:30:01,820
whatsoever. You know what I mean? Like all this, well, which like now I, I was sort of alluding to

937
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:07,740
this in a previous episode. I, now I kind of know some of the story and what the characters are

938
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:16,460
because of these exhaustive podcasts that we've done. Before that I went on this ride 70 times

939
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:22,300
with no knowledge of what any of it is. Well, the genesis of it, it was so long from when

940
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:26,540
Kenny Anderson was first looking, you know, working with, well to build a haunted house in

941
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:32,060
the Mickey Mouse park, the small park they were going to build in Burbank. And then finally getting

942
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:38,620
it built and open in Disneyland. That was like over a decade. Well, we covered that. And yeah,

943
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:42,780
that took the whole first year. Maybe we should refresh, should we all listen? Oh, that's fine.

944
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:51,580
If I may be so forward. So yeah, there's so much concept art. There's so many potential threads and

945
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:58,620
storylines and stuff got revisited or put back in. I think continuity, the idea, and correct me if

946
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:05,020
I'm wrong, listener or you too. I would imagine most of the people that put this together didn't

947
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:11,740
even like think of the concept of like continuity and even maybe like backstory. They were obviously

948
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:17,500
thinking of story, but they were thinking more of like, isn't it funny to have a big hat on a ghost?

949
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:22,940
Yeah. Like that was more about it. Okay. Like we're alluding obviously to there was a bride and there

950
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:28,380
was this and a little bit of that, but mostly it's like, isn't it funny? Great Caesar's ghost.

951
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:32,220
That would be funny. And they all chuckled and they all coughed cause they were smoking. And there's a

952
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:39,740
bunch of like Tom Collins. Come tell him, tell him, tell him what you said. It's a modern brain thing.

953
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:47,100
I don't know what maybe the last 20, 30 years to really like desire hard facts and tying things

954
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:53,820
together. I need to know why he's on the chandelier story. Oh, he was in the stretching room and a

955
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:59,580
fear of heights. Right. That makes perfect sense. Yeah. It's like, cause it gets, yeah, a newer,

956
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:04,780
a newer person that had a brain like that was like, I don't know why he fucking pick wick is

957
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:10,460
high up. Why is he high up? Well, how would he get, why would he even do that? He'd be on the ground

958
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:17,100
drinking. Doesn't make any sense. I must think of a reason for it. Uh, and then they came up with that.

959
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:23,100
He was a burglar. So now we know, and now you can rest comfortably. So enhanced going through the room.

960
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:27,900
Now that we know a pick book is a burglar is afraid of heights, a comic mold burglar.

961
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:33,500
Is that what I said? Yeah. And they've also changed publishers on the haunted mansion stuff. Who knows

962
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:39,580
how much is in prints right now today. We can name a couple of these carrot. We can name the

963
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:48,220
captain crunch guy. Yeah. General what? General general. Great. He's general ghost. And, uh,

964
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:53,980
why is he, why is he walking around in that circle? Do you know what I mean? Cause he only could walk,

965
01:32:53,980 --> 01:33:00,380
uh, in like square shapes his whole life. And now he's walking around in a circle because he has the

966
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:06,060
full freedom to from being a ghost, general ghost. There you go. That's a, wow, that's a moving. Wow.

967
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:12,460
Okay. Next one. Next one. But they get that on the Wiki. Get it on the Wiki. Um, where do we go? I

968
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:18,540
feel like Jason is still, yeah. Uh, yeah, I, well, do you have all the hair colors listed? I don't

969
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:23,580
have all the hair colors listed. No. I mean, the big anecdote about the dancers is that due to the

970
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:30,620
reflection in it is, it is an inadvertently more modern, uh, dance because the women are leading

971
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:37,020
the men. Yes. It was a mistake is what I read. I assume that as well. Yeah. Um, if they, if, if

972
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:42,620
you were just looking at the animatronics, but pre ghostified the men are leading the women, but

973
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:51,100
the other way around, which it's, if you, like, if we said that this was a change that Disney made

974
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:57,820
this year, they would talk about it on Fox news for five days. If you suddenly, if you made up

975
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:03,900
that this was brand new, this would be a time. And I guess the women are leading the men now.

976
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:11,020
And at Disneyland now, even the ghost men are emasculated. Could we like Harry, like Prince

977
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:20,060
Harry standing behind his wife, his rotten. I think some of the ghosts are in tan suits too.

978
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:27,180
Like Obama, who I wish were the ghosts. Pierce Morgan is just blood vessels bursting.

979
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:34,060
Okay. We could really get this going. No problem. We could be on Fox news with the day after this

980
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:39,900
comes out. Yeah, we could be on Gutfeld and here are the three Patriots who have revealed that

981
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:46,540
Disney has quietly reversed the dancing position because of the woke mob. Here they are, uh, Scott,

982
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:51,820
Jason and Mike. Thank you. Three, three Patriots. Yeah, that's our, well, the tagline of our show

983
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:57,660
is three fearless men in their thirties and we're not afraid to stand up for our liberties,

984
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:01,900
especially within the theme park sector. Uh, Craig, I'd like to interject real quickly. I

985
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:06,860
just want to say fantastic monologue tonight. Okay. We were cracking up in the back. Anyway,

986
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:10,620
sorry. I shouldn't come on here and kiss your ass, but I couldn't know that you're Gutfeld.

987
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:15,020
You're the king of late night. I wish that was a joke. Actually, you're the highest rated

988
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:19,180
good. You're the highest rated show. That's true. What are you drinking there, Greg? Uh,

989
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:27,180
in your coffee mug, Ivermectin. Jason gets tired. Pretty good. Pretty good. This is where you'll be,

990
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:31,740
there'll be egg on your face in 2022. And we learned that Ivermectin is a complete,

991
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:38,140
was the cure for COVID. We've all been drinking cup after cup of it. Oh no. And it got rid of my

992
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:52,620
parasites. You ate so many hot dogs that were made from horses that needed to be dewormed.

993
01:35:55,900 --> 01:36:01,820
Not the worms right out of the horse meat in my hot dogs and took away my COVID. I know it'll be

994
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:07,900
healthier, but you're going to miss those worms. They really, they give you that kind of sweet

995
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:14,460
bite. You say hello to them every morning. Hello worms. Morning my little horse. Hey Jason,

996
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:21,820
can't wait to be in you. Any more hot dogs today? What are the most famous ghost stories? It's a

997
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:27,500
wonderful life. That's what the inscription in the book says. No man, no man is a failure. Who is

998
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:34,700
friends? The friends are worms. Inside hot dogs. Inside hot dogs. They cut all those scenes where

999
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:42,620
he eats all those hot dogs. That's right. That's right. George Bailey, the man who eats the most

1000
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:50,780
hot dogs in the world. It's like dipping it, like he's in the contest, dipping it in the water,

1001
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:57,740
shoving it in his face. The Kobayashi. Jimmy Stewart pioneered that. Oh yeah. Dip it in the water

1002
01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:04,460
first. Or having me eat so many for the scenes. So I dip it in water so I could keep doing it

1003
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:10,940
tick after take. Jimmy Stewart invented dipping a hot dog in water to be able to eat over 50 in an

1004
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:17,900
hour. Oh yeah. It goes down so smooth. You're attributed to him. It's like you forget what the

1005
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:21,820
weird hat is called. You forget that it's cocked and you forget that Jimmy Stewart

1006
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:27,500
beat Kobayashi to the bun soaking. That's right. He was doing it in his late 80s too on the Carson

1007
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:32,780
Tonight Show. Oh yeah. He showed everyone in the sound booth recordings for an American tail.

1008
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:37,420
Fievel goes west. He's like, well you probably won't want to see this you youngins. Oh, dial

1009
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:43,340
around. Fievel should eat hot dogs in the movie. Don't you think? All right, Jimmy.

1010
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:53,020
If I may be so forward. Go ahead. If we, let's go north. I think my favorite thing in the ride

1011
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:58,220
is the dueling portraits. I think it has been since I was a kid, or at least it was when I was a kid.

1012
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:05,580
I thought that was so neat, so funny, so clever. I love that they glow red on the tips.

1013
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,980
Yeah, you know, the red tip. I wouldn't have laughed if we didn't, if we were punchy from the

1014
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:16,220
last bit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would have been fine. I would have been immature. No, I laughed.

1015
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:22,460
Red tips. Anyway, go ahead. Bright red tips. The two men face each other with the bright red tips.

1016
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:31,740
Like a dog. Like a very excited dog. Yeah, yeah, we got it. We got it. Yeah. No, I just, I don't know.

1017
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:36,140
I don't have anything super intellectual to say about it. I just look forward to seeing that

1018
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:40,140
so much and I, and it's the last kind of last thing in the room. So when you're leaving the room,

1019
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:44,460
I keep like a kind of crane bat. Like, let me see if I can get one more shot in there.

1020
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:51,340
How many can I see? Yeah, that's fun. I mean, this is really, this obviously, this room,

1021
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:55,740
this room takes the ride up a notch. You get a little more adrenaline going when you're on it.

1022
01:38:56,620 --> 01:39:00,460
I don't know if that's really the way to describe it. Watching, yeah, you're watching the ghost

1023
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:04,940
ballroom dancers and you get so much adrenaline. But it does. It's another level. You got to go

1024
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:11,180
up another level. And I'm trying to think in this room, I like the duel. I'm trying to think, I mean,

1025
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:15,580
I think now Pickwick might be my favorite, but only because now we've really spent time talking

1026
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:22,300
about him and he's so fun. But I don't know. I like, I really like the organ and I, and I,

1027
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:27,660
if you'll excuse me for being so forward, I love the piano and the next scene too. Yeah. So much.

1028
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:36,620
So I think I always focus on Victor Geist, the organ player. Yes. The, the duelists, the painting

1029
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:43,660
based on Mark Davis illustrations. Yes. Mark Davis originally. And this I think is where you start to

1030
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:49,340
see the melding of the Claude Coats, the more sinister, uh, mansion ideas from Claude Coats.

1031
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:53,900
It is. It's the transition. The transition into the more whimsical Mark Davis. You go back and forth

1032
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:58,300
though, cause this is more whimsical, I would say. And the next scene is a little scarier and then

1033
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:03,900
more scary. Back to whimsical. Yeah. Um, but Victor Geist, the organ, of course the 20,000 leaks

1034
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:09,900
under the sea organ. Initially, is it still that organ though? Well, I read that it was,

1035
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:14,620
it was the organ used in the movie that went to that walkthrough they used to have in tomorrowland

1036
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:19,340
when they real quick needed to put some more stuff into Marland. Then they used it for the mansion

1037
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:24,700
and then it was duplicated for all the other mansions around the world. So I think it's the

1038
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:30,140
original. No, I think this is the original. I think I feel like so. Okay. Maybe I read,

1039
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:35,900
maybe I was reading about Disney world then. Um, I also didn't realize until reading today is that

1040
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:41,340
little ghosts, those are little ghosts flying out of the organ. Those skulls. Yeah. Yeah. Which they

1041
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:46,700
did. Well, I think they recreated that effect very well in the Muppets haunted mansion. Yes.

1042
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:52,780
Yeah. So on Patreon, um, the bat music stand, the music stand is large or Nate fat. Yes. And I also

1043
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:59,980
didn't realize that either, which is a real nice fun detail. Um, so Victor and I like, I, again,

1044
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:03,660
I told you, I like the organ. I'm always focused on it. I'm stupid and didn't realize it was for

1045
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:08,940
ghosts. I thought it was like a cool, like glowing effect, but you didn't see it. Like they have faces.

1046
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:14,460
Right. I didn't know that. Yeah. I feel like an idiot. Where Victor got, where did this name come

1047
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:22,780
from? This seems like the most recent Victor Geist as we're, we're inching towards it. I only on fandom

1048
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:29,500
found the name Constance Hatchaway. Constance, the black widow bride I saw come up a lot. Yeah. But

1049
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:36,940
Hatchaway, I didn't see that often. It'd be a newer invention. Yeah. Potentially. Are you saying you

1050
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:41,580
didn't see Victor Geist at all doing research, Scott? Uh, no, no, I didn't really. Cause I feel

1051
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:46,540
like that was pretty common in the thing. Cause I was looking up like who has names basically,

1052
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:53,660
which ghosts have names and he would come up pretty regularly. Um, it's just so like the name. I think

1053
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:59,660
I know I actually do like it. I think it's just as I was saying is we are, we've named almost no one

1054
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:06,300
in the ride except for Victor Geist, the organist, the Victor. And you feel like it's too like maybe

1055
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:11,020
normal sounding almost. No, I just wanted the name all of it. I like, uh, if, like if we're going to

1056
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:16,940
start there, then just like, we just named another captain ghost. Yeah. Yeah. Or, or general ghost,

1057
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:21,340
general ghost, whatever his name was, alliteration. Yeah. But then I would just want to keep going,

1058
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:29,740
like, uh, you know, like, all right. So the dualers, one's Sam Norton and uh, great. The other one's,

1059
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:37,420
uh, Graham Carson. Yeah. Great. Yep. Done. I like, I kinda, I think I like Victor Geist for that

1060
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:43,260
reason. Just not even scary or anything. It's just the name that somebody would have. Uh, uh,

1061
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:51,420
and then the guy, the ghost under the table is a Louis Johnson. Great. Now we know. Okay. Um, and

1062
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:57,420
he's drunk. He's not sleeping. He's drunk. Okay. Let's be clear. Louis Johnson is drunk. Yes.

1063
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:04,060
There's ghost vomit gurgling out of his mouth and he might ghost choke on it. I, I saw that Rolly

1064
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:09,740
Crump, uh, thought that this illusion he's criticized the illusion that's going on in here

1065
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:15,260
as too obvious with like the, like the ghosts on the circle and everything. Like he thinks it's too,

1066
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:19,740
a little too obvious. They should be, I don't know. I don't think so. Cause we don't like,

1067
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:24,300
we're still sort of like finding new stuff. I feel like as a kid, I was, I never knew what I

1068
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:30,140
was looking at or I forget if I've said this in a prior one, but I think I thought that it was like

1069
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:35,020
translucent robots with nothing inside that they managed to build. You know how they've like,

1070
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:40,540
there were those, uh, innovation, interventions, robots that were with no skin or anything.

1071
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:46,220
I thought that they managed to do that. Or it was just like, he's a really ornate, uh, dolls or

1072
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:50,700
not doll, but they're really ornate animatronics that are dummies that don't move with nothing

1073
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:54,860
inside. Like that's what I thought for a long time when I was a kid, I'd never before the pepper's

1074
01:43:54,860 --> 01:44:00,620
ghost that it's a reflection occurred to me. So I was always, I really, I never had any idea what

1075
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:05,340
it was for years. I think I thought it was some sort of projection. Sure. Like a straight

1076
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:10,940
projection. Yeah. I think it's so I think when I was like old enough to know it wasn't real,

1077
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:17,180
which I'm sure felt took too long. Uh, I thought it was some sort of like,

1078
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:21,580
I probably wasn't sophisticated enough to think of like, Oh, glass and it's projected on it down

1079
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:26,300
there. But I definitely thought, Oh, there's some sort of projector that's making me see it as three

1080
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:30,780
dimensions. Well, there's a clip of Tony Baxter giving a tour and he says, everyone says it's

1081
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:36,300
holograms because they just don't know how it's done. And it's just got, I guess, like a hologram.

1082
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:40,460
Yeah. Because that's the other thing that you think of when it's like, Oh, a thing changes from

1083
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:45,420
like one thing to another. Yeah. There's the, is that the same, like Tony does a full like walk

1084
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:50,300
through kind of a fun? I think that's, that's what it is. The Roly Crumb thing though, there, he also

1085
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:55,820
has a story about like, we had professional magicians come out and we did the pepper's

1086
01:44:55,820 --> 01:45:00,300
ghost for them and we fooled them because they had never seen a sheet of glass that big.

1087
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:05,180
Right. Oh, huh. That's how they got, they just, it had never been done at that scale.

1088
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:11,260
Yes. Interesting. Um, and then I would be interested to talk, hopefully eventually talk Tony,

1089
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:15,740
cause Tony's also mentioned before, like wanting to like spruce up some of the effects in the

1090
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:22,300
mansion. Oh, sure. And I wonder what he thinks, if he thinks this holds up. Um, yeah, maybe,

1091
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:27,180
maybe just the sort of like circular nature. If I was plussing up, cause we, we, I like the mansion,

1092
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:31,340
but we don't talk about improvements all that often. I guess maybe there could be a way to

1093
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:37,180
just make the movements in the same way that like pirate, uh, pirates, the chasing is very like

1094
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:42,460
circular. Like it's, it looks very mechanical. Oh yeah. Part of its charm. I mean, I don't really

1095
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:48,860
care, but there might be a way to do it to make it look not so more fluid. Yeah. A little bit.

1096
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:53,020
Oh, like to have maybe there's some like height variants or some of this a little like up and

1097
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:59,180
down to it. Yeah. Cause like they have Bell and the beast dancing. Yeah. Like crazy in Japan.

1098
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:04,940
Yeah. So if you could, if you can maintain the same kind of illusion, even in the same kind of,

1099
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:08,460
I'm not even saying they should use like something that would make the ghosts even necessarily more

1100
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:15,340
clear, even though I am, excuse me for being so forward. Uh, I do, I do think it would make sense

1101
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:21,100
to like hat box ghostify a lot of the ghosts in the graveyard. That is my eventual opinion. When

1102
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:25,820
we get there is that I kind of feel like you could overhaul all the ghosts to make them a little more

1103
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:32,380
distinct in the graveyard. Yeah. Yeah. Or even just like per this, uh, there's like one that's

1104
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:37,660
kind of fancy. Sure. Yeah. Oh yeah. Cause you miss so many and that's going to be, I mean,

1105
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:43,340
we have to negotiate exactly how many episodes the graveyard is because there's so many, I am,

1106
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:49,180
I strained to see new ghosts every time and I can never tell if it's something I'm just

1107
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:53,740
misguessing for the first time or if it's a new thing, but there's fun stuff in the way back

1108
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:58,540
of that graveyard. Yeah. And I would love to just be able to see some of it better.

1109
01:46:58,540 --> 01:47:04,540
But imagine if you're the, the waltzing ghosts, you're so used to seeing them waltzing in circles.

1110
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:09,740
Imagine if you could program them to waltz in a circle, but then every now and then one of them

1111
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:16,060
broke out and like, you would just be like, so a nerve. That's cool. It would be cool. I,

1112
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:19,740
I really, there are, cause there's the people that are like really nothing should change,

1113
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:23,900
but there's a way to maintain kind of the old feeling of even that effect. Cause the effect

1114
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:29,260
itself feels classic. So I think there's gotta be a way to maintain even that kind of old feeling

1115
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:34,220
effect, but doing what you're saying and scare the shit out of people, there's gotta be a way

1116
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:39,820
to do it. I'm sure plenty of imagineers have thought about it, but I'm all for that kind of thing

1117
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:45,820
too. As long as it doesn't completely feel like you're modernizing the ride. Sure. Like there is

1118
01:47:45,820 --> 01:47:51,100
probably a way where you do some insane technology and you go, well, that feels way off the haunted

1119
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:55,900
mansion, which now like, like that doesn't feel like the tone of the ride anymore. Well, if I

1120
01:47:55,900 --> 01:48:02,620
may be so forward, isn't this a perfect bridge into the next room, the attic? Sure. Uh, let me

1121
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:06,940
just check my notes. Go ahead. Sure. Sure. Sure. Well, y'all said we could go backwards, but

1122
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:12,540
I think we've alluded to this take in the past. I might as well come in hot with it.

1123
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:21,020
Least favorite room in the ride. Two digital, two digitally. Yes. Yeah. I agree with you about the

1124
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:25,900
bride, but as far as the room, no, I, I've been one of my favorite rooms. I think the room is

1125
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:32,380
very interesting. I think the, I like the story of the bride a lot. I do think that face something

1126
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:39,580
needs to be done because that is the most 2006 ass. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And that's a, but do you

1127
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:47,980
not also include in that the portraits? Because I don't like the portraits and let me, let me just

1128
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:54,300
say why, uh, you know, like I'm reading, I, I, I get this, this Searle book as well and I'm reading

1129
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:58,940
it and it says at some point, like, uh, uh, you know, if you, and just to, just to refresh your

1130
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:05,100
memory. Uh, so there's, there's a ghostly bride at the end of the room. Uh, and along the way you

1131
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:12,380
see these portraits where her various, uh, grooms over the years, like as you shift perspective,

1132
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:19,660
you see them beheaded. Uh, so she's like killed a number of husbands. Um, and in the book it says,

1133
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:24,060
uh, you know, actually all of the, uh, the husbands were played by imagineers and I'm like,

1134
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:31,260
yeah, no shit. These guys can't act in still photos. You can tell that these are pictures

1135
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:37,900
from 2005 and they're all like smirking. They're all like, it's me. I'm an old timey guy, even

1136
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:45,020
though I'm a man from now. I do. I, I, and now the rest of the room, I dig, I like, I, I, I, I'm not

1137
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:53,100
anything pre the makeover I'm cool with, but this is, I think is a bad example of adding newer stuff

1138
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:56,940
that doesn't totally work. That's interesting because I never struck you guys. I don't like

1139
01:49:56,940 --> 01:50:02,380
these portraits struck me, but value you're saying it. I've never actually focused on their faces.

1140
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:08,940
Yeah. Cause I think, well, I think the bride in the, in the portraits and I believe in the motion

1141
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:15,020
capture on the projection played by the actress Julia Lee, the voice is done by a voice actor

1142
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:22,460
named Kat Kresslada. Um, but I think I am always the bride never changes except she adds a string

1143
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:30,380
of pearls every time. Uh, uh, she, with the groom and I think I'm, my eye is largely drawn to the

1144
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:36,460
heads being removed. Yeah. And that's cool. I have no problem, but I just, I think I just feel the

1145
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:42,780
modern of this room. Uh, I, now see, I thought we were all, I thought we'd sort of alluded to this

1146
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:47,660
before and I guess you guys agree with me on the bride that the bride's a little too current shiny

1147
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:53,020
projection. I don't like shiny projection bride. What do you think about doll face 1990s upgrade?

1148
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:57,820
Because this is, I don't know that they've ever gotten this, this bride, right? Chilling. I mean,

1149
01:50:57,820 --> 01:51:04,300
I, the interesting, the thing that's interesting to me about the attic is there is just so much

1150
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:10,140
documentation of the attic. Like it's changed multiple times. There was always some sort of

1151
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:16,620
attic. There was a lot of the spectral women, ghostly women, they weren't always brides. In fact,

1152
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:21,180
a lot of them drew emphasis to the beating heart. As you come into this room, you can hear the

1153
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:26,700
thumping sound of a beating heart and it just gets louder as you go through the room. Very loud.

1154
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:32,860
Yeah. It's very loud, but I don't pick up on it when I'm writing the rep, but on video, you can't

1155
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:37,900
not hear it. You're saying you don't notice it. I think I don't notice it as much because of the

1156
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:44,860
transition from, uh, the grand hall into the attic. And you start hearing the piano, the, the

1157
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:49,500
wedding vaults. Yeah. So that's pretty cool. Like that. Yeah. Like that's so interesting.

1158
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:52,700
On the piano. Cause I don't think you can, I don't think, and maybe I'll watch it when I get home.

1159
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:58,860
I don't, I don't, this, the faces don't stick out to me as being imagineer faces. Every time I'm on

1160
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:05,660
I'm like, yeah, I know, I know you guys are so happy that you're dressed in old timey clothes and

1161
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:12,940
I'm Thaddeus old timey. So you can just, they have that thing of like, you just know that it's not,

1162
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:18,620
there's a smirk when you haven't been on camera a ton. And I feel it in these guys. They should

1163
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:25,260
have gotten like more character actory. The first thing that they should have gotten grizzled as

1164
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:32,060
Joe Crespeckler, the guy who played like that old man on those old onion videos. Do you remember him?

1165
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:36,860
Oh yeah. The guy in the woods. And then they hired him to do like a Fox news style show. Oh,

1166
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:41,740
I can remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like a very grizzled older character. It seemed like he could

1167
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:48,620
be from like a different time. You know how in, I mean, I think of the master, there will be blood.

1168
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:55,260
I guess those are the main, the, the old, the oldest set, VT Anderson movies, like, like every

1169
01:52:55,260 --> 01:53:00,540
person you see looks like they're from the past. Right. And then there's other period dramas that

1170
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:06,860
are like Hugh Jackman, like, all right. He'd like, he's got us. He has the flare of this for sure,

1171
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:12,060
but like he does, he seems like a current guy. You know what I mean? He would, uh, I, there's just

1172
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:18,060
something of, and it's, it's hard to, uh, I find it hard to articulate where I doing this casting,

1173
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:22,780
but it's, uh, you, I don't know. These people don't look like they're from the past. Less so

1174
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:27,820
the bride. I think she's fine. Yeah. But these, these guys, I probably, you've probably now

1175
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:33,980
ruined it for me. Good. Cause I think I will focus on it now. This is also going to be one of those

1176
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:38,460
what there's, we're going to see, there's only be like two of them. They're going to be so fucking

1177
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:44,540
mad at me. Uh, but I don't know. I, maybe people are the bride. Most people I would get bet the

1178
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:52,460
bride is most people agree that it looks weird. That like shimmery act. It just feels like hat boxes.

1179
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:58,220
I think people universally love, I'm sure people have some feelings sort of modern, but it feels

1180
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:03,500
like it's in between the spirit of the older. Like, I think that you hit the nail in the head.

1181
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:09,020
I think it's in the spirit correctly. It does feel very modern. I think the pictures never

1182
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:14,140
drew my attention because there is so much going on. I think they did a good job putting in the

1183
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:19,580
story of like, well, and each husband is progressively wealthier. So like the, uh, stuff,

1184
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:25,820
the wedding gifts around each portrait just gets more and more elaborate as the time goes on.

1185
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:31,340
And there's another thing I like in the mansion is that like, as the ride has grown and been

1186
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:37,820
added to over the years, there are contradictions because it seems like the last husband is named

1187
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:44,700
George and they've alluded to that. Like, Oh, that's the same George is on a headstone in the

1188
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:52,140
stretching room, but the widow there is very old and the bride here dot clearly died very young

1189
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:56,860
because as a ghost is appearing as very young. So that's like a weird contradiction, but in the

1190
01:54:56,860 --> 01:55:02,460
world of ghost stories and urban legends, there's often contradictions and often additions later on.

1191
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:09,260
Dave Korsunsky If I, uh, if I could cut in what you said about clearly like she's going up in

1192
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:14,620
social stature, this is something I wrote down in the notes that as I saw this quote, the bride

1193
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:20,460
clearly gains in wealth and social stature with each wedding. Mike, do you, have you ever caught

1194
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:25,260
this before? I have not. Thank you. I don't think that's clear. Did you know this before you read

1195
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:31,260
any of this? Again, what we were saying earlier, it's good to have like extra extra stuff that

1196
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:35,580
you never pick up on themselves out. I like it in the sense of, all right, go ahead, Mike.

1197
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:39,260
No, I was just going to say, uh, I was just gonna say, I agree with you that there's a lot of stuff

1198
01:55:39,260 --> 01:55:42,940
and I'm looking at all the stuff at once. So I think you're right in the sense that there's

1199
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:46,860
a bunch of stuff. Yeah, I did not put it in contact. I did not realize, ah, she's richer.

1200
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:51,820
I didn't know that, but you're right in the sense that I go, ah, the face disappeared onto looking

1201
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:57,180
at that box over there, that like wardrobe or whatever. Sure. The piano player like, so I am,

1202
01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:04,540
my eye is darting all over the place, not looking at a grinning Imagineer from 2005. I like it in

1203
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:09,420
the sense, as you say, is I like it in the sense of like a, like the kind of thing Pixar would have

1204
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:15,260
as a backstory for, there's a thing Pat and Oswald talked about, about how he learned how Monster Zink

1205
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:19,820
is done in this kind of sixties mod style, because that was like, it was the boomer era and there were

1206
01:56:19,820 --> 01:56:25,500
a lot of babies. So that's where Monstropolis made their most money was in the city. So like, so that's

1207
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:29,980
all their architecture was put up then. And that's why there's that vibe to Monstropolis.

1208
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:34,140
You never would know that from watching the movie, but it's interesting once you hear it. This is

1209
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:38,060
interesting once you hear it. But if it's supposed to be a story I'm following, I don't follow the

1210
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:45,180
story. Well, I think the, the story that you could grasp just looking at it is like, oh man, she just

1211
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:51,580
keeps getting stuff as she gets married. Like she's killing them and she's like getting, like she,

1212
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:58,620
she is a gold digger. She's like a black widow. That's cool. I like it now that I hear it. I just

1213
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:03,740
don't know that it ever communicated. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. I like, I like it. And now I

1214
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:07,740
will pay attention to that. Now I got to pay attention. I got to pay attention to how rich

1215
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:13,100
she's getting. And I got to figure out who all these Imagineers are. I do. It's like, this one,

1216
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:18,540
I feel like I have the most homework now is the attic. Pay close attention. And I like the attic

1217
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:24,060
and I look, it's an overused word on this show coming out of my mouth, but I like the attic cause

1218
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:30,540
of say with me, the intimacy of the room. I like it because it's a cozy feeling room. And I've said

1219
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:35,980
this before, I've said this on the horror nights about the us house from the movie us, you walk

1220
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:42,380
into a room that feels kind of realish. It feels small. And I almost like, I want to hang out in

1221
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:49,020
this area longer because of just that feeling like the most, like a real room I could sit in.

1222
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:55,340
I guess, yeah, yeah. Maybe if we're supposed to be in a real house, a real mansion, maybe not all of

1223
01:57:55,340 --> 01:58:00,540
it seems like a place that's lived in or that somebody lives in this area for sure. A lot of

1224
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:05,180
the, yeah, a lot of the mansion is like an abstraction of a house, you know, the sands room,

1225
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:09,260
like what exactly, what is this room? What's actually this room look like when the lights are

1226
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:13,980
on? Who would have this? And the hallway is like, it's really cool, but like the hallway

1227
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:19,580
also feels kind of like an abstraction of a house. Yeah. Yeah. In the sense that we don't get a real

1228
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:24,940
strong sense of where any of the doors go. We're not going through the doors. We just know they're

1229
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:30,380
there and we know it's suggesting this, but the attic is like, ah, yeah, it's an attic. And we're

1230
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:36,300
like low to the ground. Stuff is close by and large. There's a lot of crap in it. It's very dirty.

1231
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:41,500
It's very dirty. It's a lot of crap. Are there collectibles in here? Are there action figures?

1232
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:48,060
Are there Mike's little friends? My little friends in a box? There used to be very early on cobweb

1233
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:52,300
effects, but it seemed like there were too much of a pain in the eye or people would fuck with them.

1234
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:58,700
Like that would graze you. Yeah. I never heard this that you, yeah, you would pass the doomba,

1235
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:05,180
you would pass through it and the cobwebs would like brush against your face. That's nuts. They

1236
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:13,660
would do really great. They have like, they do it at knots still in the mazes where there will be

1237
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:19,340
like kind of strings or something with a little like just to kind of graze you to make whatever

1238
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:25,180
the effect is. And they also do a lot. They do a lot like in the wax works maze at knots

1239
01:59:25,180 --> 01:59:30,460
as you're leaving through like these crazy, you know, the giant barrels of wax, you get little

1240
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:36,780
drips of water to make you feel like the waxes is hitting you. That's good. Which is good. I mean,

1241
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:41,580
it's a very effective thing. It's just tough to do on like on a mass scale year round in a ride.

1242
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:50,220
These little, these like very subtle touches. And it's not Disney 2021 to do that. I feel like.

1243
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:57,340
No, no. It's like, I wonder even if the, you know, getting poked in the back is Disney 2021.

1244
01:59:57,340 --> 02:00:00,940
Is there, what's the most recent poking in the back that Disney's even done?

1245
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:06,380
I feel like they don't like doing that anymore. Tough to be a bug. It might be tough to be a bug.

1246
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:11,340
Yeah. The two thousands in California adventure putting it tough to be a bug had the poking,

1247
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:15,980
right? Right. But have they poked anyone lately? Have they poked, are they poking us?

1248
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:22,300
They're not poking us. They're not, there's not the universal water effects. Slight of passage

1249
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:28,780
strapping you into that. It's very kind of odd and intimate. It is, but it's not, you're not getting

1250
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:34,380
poked. You're not feeling, it doesn't have a story. The Akron, the mighty Akron isn't poking you all

1251
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:39,820
year. It's breathing. You're not feeling it's teeth against your face. Yeah. It's not, you're not

1252
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:50,140
feeling it. It's red. I'm sorry. Wow. I'm sorry. So sorry. You want the brush of the mind, the,

1253
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:57,740
cause you know that Akron's red tip is quite mighty. They cut that scene. The mightiest you've ever

1254
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:01,420
there's been. One of the new sequels is called the red tip.

1255
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:12,300
Avatar chapter four, the red tip. You know what's going to be interesting with the yearly nature of

1256
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:18,460
these? Will there ever be, and maybe we can make the guess. Will there ever be a year where there

1257
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:24,300
is a haunted mansion podcast, the ride and a new avatar film. Well, when's the one we beat it?

1258
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:29,100
Will we be done? Oh, that's a good question. Is it 2022? I think it is supposed to be next year.

1259
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:34,700
Is it scheduled for winter next year? But we know what happens with this guy. But they have shot them.

1260
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:39,580
They've shot the footage. I know they've shot them. Multiple of them. Not all of them, but I think

1261
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:45,340
at least one, if not two, I've seen the pictures of Sigourney in the tank. I've seen pictures.

1262
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:49,420
I've seen the pictures in the tank. I haven't seen the pictures in the tank. So you can look up tank

1263
02:01:49,420 --> 02:01:54,940
pictures of Sigourney in the tank. Look up Sigourney Weaver tank. Sigourney in the tank.

1264
02:01:56,940 --> 02:02:01,820
You're going to get pictures of her in a tank top in alien. That's all I'm getting. That's 100%.

1265
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:07,500
And I'm getting tank tops that you can buy with her on it. So I'm getting nothing. None of this

1266
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:13,340
is what I need. Water tank is what I think you have to add now. Oh, she's not a military tank.

1267
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:20,700
Oh, I guess I've seen this. Yeah. So they've shot it. There's a bunch of balls in it.

1268
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:25,980
Yeah, the motion capture. She's not the same Navi. I think she's new characters. Oh,

1269
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:34,620
we're a new character. So I think maybe next year we will be anticipating Avatar 2.

1270
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:39,340
Maybe. I guess I'll feel. The water? The seed bearer? The seed? Which one is it?

1271
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:45,100
Looking it up. Which one is it? Let me look it up. Yeah, Avatar 2. And we'll know the names of the

1272
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:51,980
children by then. That's right. I don't know. I guess they're pretty specific here. I don't know.

1273
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:59,100
I think it's getting like a six month bump. I will say I don't think next October that we will be

1274
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:04,380
two months away from Avatar 2. I don't believe that. Well, they just delayed almost every Marvel

1275
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:09,580
movie three or four months. Yeah, that's what I think it's going to be like that. Like at least a little kick.

1276
02:03:09,580 --> 02:03:15,660
And Indiana Jones got delayed another year. Everyone's excited to meet Kingo.

1277
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:20,300
Oh, yeah. They're trying to get Kingo. I've seen this name. I don't know. People talk about Kingo.

1278
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:23,420
I don't know. What is the name? Who is that? What is that from? Is that Kumail?

1279
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:28,140
Oh, Kingo is in the Eternal. Kingo is one of the Eternals. Ah, okay. They were making jokes because

1280
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:33,900
they all got silly names. And when they were like crazy Jack Kirby drawn comic characters,

1281
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:38,460
like, yeah, you expect them that silly names. But when it's just a bunch of actors on a gray

1282
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:44,380
brown beach. Oh, okay. I see. I see. Well, that's what's locked this in when it's Kingo mania next

1283
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:49,980
year. We've all now lived through two Halloweens with just nothing like every child that came to

1284
02:03:49,980 --> 02:03:57,820
my door was Kingo. That's right. So mark that down. Is that what year is it? 2021? Yeah. Haunted Mansion episode.

1285
02:03:57,820 --> 02:04:04,860
Should we? This is this is good. The first sequel, which could be the Way of Water,

1286
02:04:04,860 --> 02:04:10,060
opens in theaters December 18th, 2020. Well, that's your shit in an app. Okay. So should we

1287
02:04:10,060 --> 02:04:15,820
start the next year's episode by declaring how many weeks it is until Avatar 2? Oh, that's good. Oh,

1288
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:23,340
okay. A weeks. Okay. Okay. Because if he keeps his word, then we will know the Way of Water

1289
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:30,540
in. This is tough to calculate. It's like a month and a half. Right. So six weeks. I mean, yeah,

1290
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:34,780
wait, whatever it is then we actually don't even have to calculate it now. If it is six weeks when

1291
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:40,060
we start doing if you're if you believe he's correct now, then next year we will be six weeks away from

1292
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:47,020
Avatar 2, the Way of Water. And then after that, the Seed Bearer and then the Tolkien Rider and

1293
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:57,340
then the quest for Ewa. So yeah, next year we'll say Avatar 2, the what is it? The Way of Water

1294
02:04:57,340 --> 02:05:04,620
is six weeks away. But I'm going to say maybe I'll give him some credit and say it's not I'm going to

1295
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:12,060
say four months. We will start it by saying it's sort of a spring. No, I'm five, five, it's five

1296
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:18,060
months away. But no, but then they'll but then they'll do it may. I think it is may 2023,

1297
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:25,020
kicking off the summer blockbuster season. Yeah, I guess that makes it five and then add it in that

1298
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:29,820
six weeks, six, six and a half months away. That's my okay. All right. No, I'm lying. They kick off

1299
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:37,020
that summer blockbusters like March 30th now. I believe it will release on time. You might be

1300
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:42,220
right. I believe that's just that's what I'll guess. I don't have any hard evidence. I will make a pledge. I will

1301
02:05:42,220 --> 02:05:48,460
sit down and finally watch the first Avatar before the second one comes out. All this time, all this time.

1302
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:55,180
It's the Kron talk. You've never watched the movie. It's all this time. Mighty Akron. I can't wait to meet

1303
02:05:55,180 --> 02:06:03,820
Colonel Miles Quaritch. Mm hmm. The Unumtaniom. We'll see it all. Oh, Kate Winslet is Ronal.

1304
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:13,900
That must be new. Yeah, that's right on the first results page. Dr. Max Patel coming our way.

1305
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:19,820
I don't know Edie Falco is in it. Hmm. All right. Look, we're not here to read the Wikipedia. We're here to read

1306
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:07,020
stuff we learned from other Wikipedia. Yeah, from Honam

1307
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:29,180
Mansion Wikipedia. Okay, so here's part of what's feeling my take on the attic. I do. I before I ever

1308
02:06:29,180 --> 02:06:34,860
like looked into it specifically, I just remember having the feeling of I liked this room and then I

1309
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:41,900
stopped liking this room and it became once I did the math and realized oh in 2006 there was this

1310
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:46,780
update and there's some digital stuff. I guess that's but I also had the memory of like weren't there

1311
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:53,660
scary jumping heads in this room? Weren't there more like loud screechy jump scares in here? I had

1312
02:06:53,660 --> 02:06:59,180
that odd saying I was always scared by those so I was almost relieved to not have those anymore but I

1313
02:06:59,180 --> 02:07:03,500
remembered like I think this room is a little scarier and a little darker because there wasn't

1314
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:10,060
this glowy stuff like the portraits and the and the bride was done differently. And then I

1315
02:07:10,940 --> 02:07:20,060
then we went to Japan a couple years ago. In Japan the room never changed and I think if you guys go

1316
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:24,860
in the future, if you remember going, if you watch a ride through Mike, it's what it was because

1317
02:07:24,860 --> 02:07:29,900
they're on a mansion essentially Orlando for the most part without some of the

1318
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:35,660
except for this because they redid it in Orlando and not until you know I just think it's better.

1319
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:40,060
There's less going on, it's more minimal, it's just the creepiness of the room.

1320
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:47,500
It's scarier, you've got guys jumping out at you, there's it's pretty like cruddy and on strings but

1321
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:51,660
there's a bunch of bats flying around, there's a big bat circle that used to be in this room and

1322
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:57,740
it's not anymore. I just like got off with Aaron and immediately we're like that's that one room

1323
02:07:57,740 --> 02:08:04,380
we don't really like is they didn't redo it in Japan. Well I'll say I think the this might be a

1324
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:08,940
case of the story behind this story might be more interesting because if you read online

1325
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:17,500
the upgrade was supposed to be done for the what would 2005 be the 50th anniversary of Disneyland.

1326
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:23,900
It did not get done in time due to shifting priorities and management changes so eventually

1327
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:32,060
they get a management person who was very friendly to Imagineering and they very quickly got this

1328
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:39,900
implemented and in there and done and so this seems like oh I want to hear this behind the scenes

1329
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:47,100
because you always I have always heard I would have first been to Disneyland in August of 2006

1330
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:57,900
so this was my first experience with this mansion was seeing that upgraded bride but like I think

1331
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:05,180
I think this coincided with the outing the ousting of Paul Pressler. But you're saying that the story

1332
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:11,180
of a bride with an axe is less interesting than the story of management changes in the theme park.

1333
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:17,180
I think in our interest the management changes are often very interesting. Was there any mention of

1334
02:09:17,180 --> 02:09:23,180
anyone's lieutenants in that story? Well I'm sure there were lieutenants fast and furious on all

1335
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:28,060
sides. That's true I'm looking at this now and I was like oh why why is Scott telling saying this

1336
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:32,460
and I can't I have a memory and I remember it's because Haunted Mansion Holiday was happening when

1337
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:38,140
we were there. Oh right yes that was something you found before we were I wasn't there at the same

1338
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:43,100
time but you were you were basically surprised when you got there that it was Haunted Mansion Holiday

1339
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:48,540
because they don't do it in Florida. Right. They do do it in there and there's more Sally representation

1340
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:53,820
in that version too there's like a better Sally animatronic. Wow. And yeah because it's the because

1341
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:58,700
it's a little like there's a little more like the longer there's there's more to the like first few

1342
02:09:58,700 --> 02:10:04,860
rooms there like in Florida. Yes yeah yeah. The first section I should say. Yeah which I love those

1343
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:09,980
rooms are. And I just I just took a look and you're right so so basically yeah in Tokyo it's the attic

1344
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:15,740
is the lighting is much lower and there is that like head popping out gag that you get at the

1345
02:10:15,740 --> 02:10:21,900
end of the graveyard scene. Yeah. Are they in evening wear? Do they make them look like tuxedo

1346
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:28,860
cop because I saw pictures of like ghosts screaming I that would scream I do and kind of had like

1347
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:33,900
tuxedo cops if they were ghosts. They're so dark it's hard to tell. Yeah. And then the but the bride

1348
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:39,180
is a like an old or animatronic but the bride looks way better it is a much creepier even

1349
02:10:39,180 --> 02:10:45,180
it's like less analog but it's cool and the big beating hall is like a little bit more like

1350
02:10:45,180 --> 02:10:50,220
beating heart. Yeah I think it's scarier. And I have seen that I've seen like that with the classic

1351
02:10:50,220 --> 02:10:56,140
looking bride from the Disneyland version it's interesting because because I could see it I could

1352
02:10:56,140 --> 02:11:01,500
see a better version of the attic for sure than the way it is now that maybe even marries the two

1353
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:08,700
marries it like because I like the idea that it's like kind of uh bridging the gap into the

1354
02:11:08,700 --> 02:11:13,340
graveyard and then you get because it's not as scary I would like it to be a little scarier

1355
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:17,580
it isn't that scary now. No. Yeah I don't think that yeah that digital bride is not

1356
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:21,740
scary it's interesting it's not the worst thing in the world and in a ride that was more full of

1357
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:26,380
stuff like that maybe I wouldn't completely but I think it fights with things that were done 40

1358
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:31,180
years prior and don't feel the same. Yeah but I bet there's a way to tonally make the room

1359
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:35,980
even without the heads I like the heads jumping out but it's kind of the same thing at the end of

1360
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:40,620
the graveyard so I think there's a way to do it I think there's a way to like darken the room a

1361
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:48,300
little bit and add some like maybe like mystic manner style special effects that are creepy

1362
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:51,980
because I love I am I'm a sucker I said this probably before maybe I'm a sucker for

1363
02:11:52,540 --> 02:11:58,540
the stupid player piano thing with a ghost like shadow and they do the similar thing they don't

1364
02:11:58,540 --> 02:12:03,420
really have a shadow on um pirates but it's similar there's a ghost playing a piano yeah

1365
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:08,620
essentially on pirates love it we watched the ghost of Mr. Chicken the Don Knotts classic to

1366
02:12:08,620 --> 02:12:14,940
bring Mr. Knotts up again on the show uh you already did Barney Fife in this episode I did

1367
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:20,380
not plan to talk about Don Knotts twice um but as you wear a Grandpa Monster shirt I'm wearing a

1368
02:12:20,380 --> 02:12:25,580
Grandpa Monster shirt in honor of one of the craziest things to ever happen to podcast the ride

1369
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:34,060
oh man yeah wow and we should have talked about it up top but oh my god Daniel Roebuck, Jay Leno from

1370
02:12:34,060 --> 02:12:39,420
the Late Shift is playing Grandpa Monster in case you didn't get the Google alert that you all had

1371
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:45,500
set for both of those things Grandpa Monster and Daniel Roebuck uh my goodness what news I thought

1372
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:50,780
somebody was joking I saw it on our social media somewhere I thought someone was joking how how

1373
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:56,860
something so perfect to cur right and the house looks all beat up and they all look a little

1374
02:12:56,860 --> 02:13:02,140
weird and grungy like it's not super slick and it's like oh man this is gonna be great

1375
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:09,660
this is now I'm not so sure about that I'm not sure about the filmography of Rob Zombie but I

1376
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:16,540
how did he land Sherry Moon Zombie I don't know how he got that one the casting coup in the century

1377
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:25,100
but man Roebuck is grandpa what a time to be a lot yeah yeah will it come out before Avatar 2

1378
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:30,060
yes I think so yeah I think we see that first I think they're gonna turn that around pretty

1379
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:35,420
quickly is it going to theaters or did people say it was speculate was going to peacock or

1380
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:43,340
I think we'll be the city walk opening night IMAX well we will I think I don't know I actually

1381
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:49,900
don't know it's going to Zomber Rob Zombie's personal streaming service ZOMBRR yeah yeah

1382
02:13:49,900 --> 02:13:56,060
Zomber yeah we'll be reactivating our AMC A-list memberships so we can hit up Monsters and The

1383
02:13:56,060 --> 02:14:04,140
Way of Water you know so we can you know punch the cinema's finest year not since 1999 the

1384
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:10,860
the best movie year has there been such a strong um um I've lost my complete adictory and thought

1385
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:18,060
but yeah I the I I do agree with you that that vibe is better overall that's my I hope this is

1386
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:24,220
not a snooty opinion well in Japan actually it's but I just like I don't know that's it's uh I

1387
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:28,780
swear I'm not putting on airs here I just I do remember liking the room and then I stopped

1388
02:14:28,780 --> 02:14:33,260
liking the room and then I went to Japan and I liked the room again yeah I think I part of

1389
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:40,540
the attic with me is just like the desire to go in the middle of the space because like you're

1390
02:14:40,540 --> 02:14:43,500
going through the yeah the hallway and stuff so I guess you're in more in the middle of the action

1391
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:47,740
there but but the rest a lot of the ride you're on the periphery you're on you're looking in and

1392
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:52,300
the attic you're going right through it so like you imagine I know there's not as many ghosts they

1393
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:58,220
added a couple ghosts I get maybe it would it would diminish the bride reveal at the end of the room

1394
02:14:58,220 --> 02:15:04,060
ghost count but I love going through the room as opposed to because even like the the um

1395
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:09,740
Madame Leota room you're going on the outskirts of the room you're not kind of going I know you

1396
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:14,140
it's not easy to do that but you're not going up right by the ball you're going like on the corner

1397
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:18,140
you're like yeah scraping the wall as you go through so like there's something fun with the

1398
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:23,740
attic about you're going you're going right in the middle of it yeah which I think that's very true

1399
02:15:23,740 --> 02:15:30,460
ultimately is really why I like the room but yes I think the vibe could change and put the old bride

1400
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:37,420
in or put a new yeah a new hat box ghost ish turn her brightness down yeah that's all I gotta do

1401
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:43,580
too bright you wanted a little diver uh you know what I saw and I don't know if it's where the

1402
02:15:43,580 --> 02:15:49,180
bride is now or the bride used to be there is a room there's a tiny room that they used to use

1403
02:15:49,180 --> 02:15:56,460
as a break room right behind it it was also the room where they would service the organ pipes or

1404
02:15:56,460 --> 02:16:01,580
clean the organ pipes they could access them um but it was the break room for people working a

1405
02:16:01,580 --> 02:16:07,660
position called utility and that was the person whose job it was to kind of like hide in parts of

1406
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:11,740
the ride and make sure people weren't fucking around like people weren't getting out of their

1407
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:17,660
doom buggies or getting too fresh in their doom buggies and so they they would hang out in this

1408
02:16:17,660 --> 02:16:24,380
room that overlooks the graveyard like this is where they would take their breaks at wow and so

1409
02:16:24,380 --> 02:16:31,740
next year we're going to cover the evolution of that break room uh when they got a microwave

1410
02:16:31,740 --> 02:16:36,620
install when they were the kinds of coffee machines they had when they went from a coffee

1411
02:16:36,620 --> 02:16:42,140
made to a puree what was the bulletin board like oh how would they list things like as far as like

1412
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:46,460
you know employee like hangouts or something hey i need a shift covered i need a shift cover

1413
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:50,540
were you allowed to list personal things like your band is is playing in fullerton

1414
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:58,860
would you uh would were you allowed to like pass a note about how you could make some money on the

1415
02:16:58,860 --> 02:17:03,660
side by allowing guests to give you a picture of their loved one and sneaking into the mansion

1416
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:11,020
or a shirt of an x-men character management catch on to the bribery scheme the bride is wearing a

1417
02:17:11,580 --> 02:17:19,820
uh tod mcfarland spider-man spider-man shirt and victor geist is wearing a shirt featuring the

1418
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:28,620
x-men character forge did the wood on the bulletin board did they take bets on when avatar 2 was

1419
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:33,820
going to come out has it been has the bulletin board been around that long right yeah all this

1420
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:40,540
2012 it's a hell of a tease for the next next episode yeah there's a note saying like hey did

1421
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:48,300
anyone catch leota the spiel kind of glitched and she started talking about avatars something

1422
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:55,020
something about avatars and miles quarrich and the way of water did anyone catch that or was

1423
02:17:55,020 --> 02:18:00,700
that or was it just me is that one day leota had a premonition and everything that we know about

1424
02:18:00,700 --> 02:18:07,100
avatar 2 comes from she got possessed the hides of march or march kuri and retrograde it would just

1425
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:13,660
happen that face looks like you could easily program new faces i could be wrong and technology

1426
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:17,900
might not be that that way but like it feels like you could maybe like give her an avi face for a

1427
02:18:17,900 --> 02:18:25,260
couple months so you're talking okay so your idea is haunted mansion if we're getting tired of

1428
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:31,260
haunted mansion holiday night for christmas overlay haunted mansion avatar holiday the way of

1429
02:18:32,940 --> 02:18:40,300
haunting or may have spookiness haunt mansion colon rise to the challenge right right yes rise

1430
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:47,580
to the civaco yes uh uh yeah so so maybe make her like have a navi face and then you could just get

1431
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:52,780
a little tie in there but it looks you can redo that bri the bride easily reprojects and the bride

1432
02:18:52,780 --> 02:19:01,340
is naffy the bride is navi wearing a like 1800s human wedding veil that's right yes you have to

1433
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:06,220
make all the people in the ballroom taller because the navi obviously famously very tall like nine

1434
02:19:06,220 --> 02:19:12,700
feet tall oh yeah oh and then old like navi pickwick is gonna bump his head navi pickwick

1435
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:16,700
okay ceiling there's a hole in the ceiling then you have to make a hole and navi pickwick's head

1436
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:21,900
is like through it or whatever and i think the easy way to do it i think is get get a gun back

1437
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:27,660
in there and start firing okay fire a giant bullet hole in and now navi pickwick has somewhere to go

1438
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:32,060
he has somewhere to go navi pickwick you know what you know what might solve the problem we go the

1439
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:40,220
other direction prequel this man human man used to be much shorter and the human did navi used to be

1440
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:46,860
much shorter prequel james prequel another five what do you think so they evolved they uh grew

1441
02:19:46,860 --> 02:19:53,260
yeah they got taller they got taller okay well i'm for that too maybe they're short no we have to

1442
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:59,340
make the human shorter though they started out at three feet okay that's what our shrink so we still

1443
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:06,060
need new robots shorter shorter pickwick navi were the shortest species in the galaxy take out their

1444
02:20:06,060 --> 02:20:11,260
chest they're all leg and head take the chest of the robot out and put the head on the legs

1445
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:19,420
i think that solves the problem okay so we got it okay well then we've called it in advance of

1446
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:27,580
maybe this film will come out in 2022 and then in 2023 following the success we'll do the haunted

1447
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:32,380
mansion avatar holiday and we'll review that and then that's going to set us way off course we're

1448
02:20:32,380 --> 02:20:38,300
gonna have to do all that yeah we'll have to do all that um but that's okay um we still have

1449
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:46,780
hatbox ghosts graveyard maybe two parts maybe one um and then what are the names of the three follow

1450
02:20:46,780 --> 02:20:51,820
you home ghosts they have names too right they do have names they have to wait and see yeah oh they

1451
02:20:51,820 --> 02:20:57,500
oh they yeah i think those have retcon names they have like new names yeah yeah so you'll find out

1452
02:20:57,500 --> 02:21:04,860
their names in two to three years that's right three years put it on the line we'll negotiate

1453
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:14,620
that later yeah um but for now you survived haunt cast the fright i think a very genteel

1454
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:22,540
addition yes of this of the of the site and i'm glad we talked about it we we we were very well

1455
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:29,020
mannered very well mannered yes um yeah i i mean i think that that couldn't have gone better

1456
02:21:29,020 --> 02:21:34,460
all right so we'll see where the mood's at next year and the mood i think it all depends on

referencing celebrity scientists yeah a great lineup uh all right well hey what a what a

1483
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:23,020
haunt cast the fright it was um i'll cut this if you don't want to talk about it i i think it's

1484
02:24:23,020 --> 02:24:29,020
amazing that at the start of haunt cast the fright you weren't engaged oh yeah sure and now you're

1485
02:24:29,020 --> 02:24:36,140
engaged to a guest from the haunt cast the yeah uh and i will i don't want to doubt anybody is that

1486
02:24:36,140 --> 02:24:44,380
griffin is it uh uh is it jakey's is it jakey's i don't but a guest from this month of podcast

1488
02:24:57,660 --> 02:25:01,260
does honk has the fright have to do that i think honestly you know lindsey was really on the fence

1489
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:06,300
about it until i said that she was the lily to my herman and that's maybe the greatest expression

1490
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:13,260
of love a person could give another person so if you at home are like sort of like i need to

1491
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:19,020
express my love to my partner put it in terms of the monsters and the monsters characters

1492
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:25,820
because i think that could really like kind of tip it over so that's yeah that's what we also to

1493
02:25:25,820 --> 02:25:31,180
kind of put a a little you know because we started the month with lindsey and she was telling us this

1494
02:25:31,180 --> 02:25:38,540
thing about that you she she has to she if she like divines that a final destination three type

1495
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:44,140
accident might happen oh yeah yeah and she has to say i love you yes she has to like grab you say

1496
02:25:44,140 --> 02:25:49,900
i love you before the ride begins right it stresses the hell out of me because she does it like all

1497
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:55,500
out of the blue i'm like yeah hey we're going on this fun thing and all of a sudden the tone shifts

1498
02:25:55,500 --> 02:26:01,900
and i go oh my god because like i try to fight that oh my god urge every day of my life about

1499
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:05,740
a number of things but all of a sudden that hits me anyway as you so that's not what happened it

1500
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:10,380
wasn't that you were like it wasn't that you were like waiting for ghost rider and it was looking

1501
02:26:10,380 --> 02:26:15,260
especially rickety up on the lift hill and then she grabbed you and this time said i love you

1502
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:20,140
let's get married this time i'm married yeah please ghost rider let's get married uh no it was not

1503
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:26,940
that that had nothing to do with it uh no no you did propose that the freedom center though

1504
02:26:26,940 --> 02:26:32,460
because you both love free enterprise that yes that we sort of were just imagining yeah put money

1505
02:26:32,460 --> 02:26:37,580
into the economy with a wedding we were just sort of thinking about our shared libertarian beliefs

1506
02:26:38,300 --> 02:26:43,660
and uh you have to cling together in this world that's coming apart at the seams we were just

1507
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:49,020
thinking about how you really want everyone to be allowed to carry a gun on a plane and on a and on

1508
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:55,260
we don't like all this regulation mansion ride exactly yeah so that's yeah i mean i'll look all

1509
02:26:55,260 --> 02:27:01,420
of it plays a part for sure so i don't want to discount anything there's not one thing but

1510
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:08,140
sure um yes uh engaged how about it engaged how about that such an adult thing to do for now for

1511
02:27:08,140 --> 02:27:13,580
scott i'm getting i'm trying to gain on scott here you know he's the most adult of the three of us

1512
02:27:13,580 --> 02:27:19,820
i entered at mary i entered the podcast married then then child midway right then child after what

1513
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:26,540
haunted mansion part two right i mean i'm sure these are real distance markers of which and yeah

1514
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:34,780
boy so a haunted mansion right at the the cut right before haunted mansion four engaged um it'd be

1515
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:39,660
i'm not saying there's plenty of time for it to fall apart before haunted mansion five i don't

1516
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:45,260
i don't want that to happen well it would be a story if it did well yeah i mean if yeah if

1517
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:50,460
lindsay hears me maybe at once ever like hears me on an old podcast say to jason like you know jason

1518
02:27:50,460 --> 02:27:56,140
you're like my the count grandpa monster to my hermit or something she'll get jealous and feels

1519
02:27:56,140 --> 02:28:01,100
like i use the monsters thing a lot and maybe not as special as she thinks it is then yeah it could

1520
02:28:01,100 --> 02:28:06,380
be over by next haunted mansion yeah it's possible kind of 50 50 whether i was going to be eddie or

1521
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:14,540
grandpa so i mean i want i think i've called you uh eddie monster before on the podcast uh so i went

1522
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:20,300
with grandpa yeah uh what would you prefer honestly i mean either works look like my adult development

1523
02:28:20,300 --> 02:28:26,380
lately is that my lower back hurts like hell the last 10 days was that true yeah that's a new

1524
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:31,100
development my knee has loosened up with uh stretches and physical therapy as my knee has

1525
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:36,460
gotten better my lower back feels like shit your lower back that is the most old man is a real old

1526
02:28:36,460 --> 02:28:40,700
man that is the most old man place for something to hurt i know it's awful because then you'll have

1527
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:46,140
to like lean over and hold it while you're walking terrible watching he's watching aw rampage the

1528
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:52,540
other night lying on an ice pack oh man yeah we've grown up a little bit while doing the podcasting

1529
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:58,140
these next phases of our lives and jason has grown up 60 years who are it's getting a lot of good

1530
02:29:00,380 --> 02:29:10,540
from 25 to 65 oh grandpa is right yeah uh well let's keep with the the the monster metaphors where i

1531
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:15,420
uh we're we're i'm so excited for you i don't speak for jason's excited for you as well

1532
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:22,460
congratulations mike congratulations lindsay and let's in monster's metaphor you are to our eddie

1533
02:29:22,460 --> 02:29:29,900
monster you are our widow's peak because what's eddie without the the famous widow's peak

1534
02:29:29,900 --> 02:29:35,660
nothing yeah that's his trademark uh now although you know a good argument for jason being eddie is

1535
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:39,980
that many times over the years jason would come up to lindsay and they'd go hello my me and daddy

1536
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:45,260
and that's a fact that's not a joke he would do that it's a real thing and we go oh god

1537
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:50,380
in a while in the old day a couple of years ago you know it's hard when all your family's back
