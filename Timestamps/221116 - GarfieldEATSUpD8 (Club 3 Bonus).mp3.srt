1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,120
Welcome to Club Three, Emergency Update Edition.

3
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,280
This is something that my two co-hosts are not aware of.

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,120
And I'm not, there's Scott Gardner, Jason Sheridan here,

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,040
but you know we're on Club Three.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,560
I wanna give a quick update on the Garfield Eats episode.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,640
Oh, no kidding. Okay.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,800
So something that happened a couple of days ago

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,600
that I was involved in that I need to tell everybody about.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,080
And I made a little video to show what happened.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,680
We all remember the character, the main guy, of course,

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,840
Nathan Masri. Yeah.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,160
Yeah. He is-

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,040
Masri? Masri, yes, Masri.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,160
I've got his name wrong.

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,800
I really should know it.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,960
Because- Reversed.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,920
Yes. So he is an eccentric character

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,160
that sort of got the rights to Garfield,

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,480
but didn't make a Garfield restaurant.

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,200
You probably know all this if you're a Club Three listener.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,680
Scooby-Doo after the fact.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,280
After the fact, got a Scooby-Doo restaurant going,

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,360
we think. We're not sure.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,680
Maybe- Frozen food.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,160
Frozen food. Maybe I know something about this.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,800
So what happened was a couple of days ago,

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,600
I'm taking care of the baby.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,360
Lindsay is napping.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,160
And I see someone has gone live on Instagram.

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,720
Someone is doing a live something on Instagram,

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,920
and it is Nathan.

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,600
Oh. And I go, oh my God.

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,960
So I click on it.

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,160
He is in a bookstore.

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,360
He is signing books.

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,320
And he is taking questions.

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,600
From Instagram users.

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,560
Oh. Oh my God.

40
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,400
Now, at first I go, oh shoot, is he going to see my questions?

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,760
I noticed that there are seven people watching this.

42
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,080
So- Twitter likes are always extremely low.

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,400
Yeah. So I have a little bit of a cut of this,

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,040
because I was on with him for about 40 minutes.

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,560
Oh my God.

46
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,920
Now- Oh, I love the surprise in that.

47
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,880
Not as many questions as you would think,

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,720
but I've cut it into like a five minute video here,

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
and we're going to play some of the highlights.

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,800
And we can skip through this.

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,200
It's not all that interesting,

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,360
but I want to set the stage here and I'll show you guys.

53
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,680
He is wearing his Garfield orange jacket,

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,200
because he had made like a Garfield clothing line, basically.

55
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,240
Well, this tailored suit, that was the main-

56
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,600
Yes.

57
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,440
His main credibility was owning a suit.

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,240
Right. He owned a suit.

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,880
And then in the side, like in the jacket inside,

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,000
it would say like Garfield or something.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,800
Like he said it's some sort of authentic Garfield merchandise,

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,120
basically. That's the way he had presented it.

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,920
And he's wearing this and he's in like somewhere in Canada,

64
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,880
in like a Barnes and Noble, and he's got his new book,

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,680
and he is sitting there signing copies of it for no one.

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,240
Yeah.

67
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,720
He's at a table and he's signing copies of it.

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,960
And you'll see, I have a few of these moments left in where

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
he just like, got to sign more books.

70
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,240
I got more books to sign.

71
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,200
And you're like, do you?

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,080
What are you talking about?

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,520
Oh, does he frame it to where you could not?

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,400
Does he have, does somebody keep putting in like mannequin

75
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,440
hands to simulate?

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,760
There's a woman who shows up and I'm not sure if she's a plant or not.

77
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,200
It's possible she's a plant.

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,520
Never, what should you say?

79
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,600
What should we say?

80
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,040
Never let anyone suppress you.

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,080
OK, so Nathan is signing these books and the thing he keeps saying

82
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,680
is never let anyone suppress you.

83
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
This is the, this is the like mission statement of his book or something.

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,960
And he kind of just keeps repeating it periodically, which is odd.

85
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,120
But I don't know.

86
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,720
Yeah, it's like a kind of a like,

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,120
I don't know how it applies to Garfield necessarily, but he's got a lot of.

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,560
Never let anyone suppress you.

89
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,360
Anyone suppress you.

90
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,720
Nathan Masri.

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,840
So yeah, Nathan Masri.

92
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,320
And he's showing you the books that he's writing this in.

93
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,360
OK, so he's writing this in many books.

94
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,640
Now, I know authors do sign things and leave books behind.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,760
So it's not unprecedented, but he'll say periodically,

96
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,400
like, I love meeting the fans.

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,360
Well, it's going to be some more time for the fans to come out.

98
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,000
So here we go.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,280
Never let anyone suppress you.

100
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,880
George, thank you so much, Mr. Masri in town.

101
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,840
Look up your sons and daughters.

102
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,920
Looked up here like you, you're nasty.

103
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,760
Good luck.

104
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,840
So someone named George has now said, hey, lock up your sons and daughters.

105
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,800
Nathan's in town.

106
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,440
He's very tickled by this.

107
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,040
He's the he like I know that people don't like me and I play into it.

108
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,960
We're going to get there.

109
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,520
We're going to get there with what he thinks about other people,

110
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,800
because there's a lot of information he reveals in this to seven.

111
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,000
Or now it's 10 people, I see.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,760
Thank you, George. Long time.

113
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,200
Hi, how are you?

114
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,360
I'm good. Are you Nathan Masri?

115
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,600
You Nathan Masri?

116
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Plan. Plan.

117
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,720
So this seems like a plant for sure.

118
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,640
Yeah.

119
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,120
Because he talks to a different person later, but I cut it out

120
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,560
because it's clearly just somebody walking by.

121
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,640
They got roped into a conversation with him.

122
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,960
Yes, I did.

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,040
Oh my God.

124
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
How are you, Nathan?

125
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
Do you like YouTube videos?

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,880
Oh, yeah.

127
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,840
Don't tell. What's your name?

128
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,800
Strange Aeons.

129
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,520
Yeah, Strange Aeons.

130
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,360
Now they're discussing Strange Aeons,

131
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,880
which is one of the main videos about Garfield Eats,

132
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,920
who is one of the YouTubers who made sort of a comedy.

133
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,880
We watched the video.

134
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,760
We watched her. Yeah.

135
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,520
So he was about to reveal something about this.

136
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,400
He's very aware of this YouTuber.

137
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Of course.

138
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,960
Do you think she hates me?

139
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,240
So he has seen the video.

140
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,680
So this is one of the big questions we were asking about,

141
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,760
like how self where is he?

142
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,320
Does he know this stuff is happening?

143
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,680
And the insecurity, which seems so strong.

144
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,360
And now he's about to reveal something about this YouTuber.

145
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,160
I think it's just everyone wants to.

146
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
I love her.

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,360
Do you know there's a secret that she doesn't even know?

148
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,920
OK, I don't know if you are you a fan of her?

149
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,320
Of hers? OK, well, she ordered so much from Garfield Eats

150
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,880
that I delivered it myself to her.

151
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,320
She has a big house.

152
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,120
She has a big house in Mississauga.

153
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,440
I think it's her parents.

154
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,680
No, never. She wasn't there.

155
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,960
She was in New York. I think.

156
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,760
I don't know.

157
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,720
So Nathan has revealed that he is the one who went to this person's house.

158
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:42,080
He also like imagine that that I personally do something involving Garfield Eats,

159
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,080
which I have made everyone believe is a company that 70 people were involved in.

160
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,600
Right. Not one, not just one.

161
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Ramshackle.

162
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,400
One suit owner.

163
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,320
So I may have to cut a little bit because I went back too far.

164
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Terminated and then six feet on the.

165
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,720
What's official?

166
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,800
It's the official.

167
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,560
Oh, take a break.

168
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,480
And then they gave me Scooby Doo.

169
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,760
And I did.

170
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,520
There's an Instagram.

171
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,240
I did frozen burgers for hot dogs.

172
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,680
And it was a little terminated.

173
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,400
Terminated. Oh, interesting.

174
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,080
It's just terminated. That's over.

175
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,640
Yeah, I never saw that line about that.

176
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,680
All right. We had that info.

177
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
So that's a good update that Scooby Doo Eats is gone.

178
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,760
It's great.

179
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,920
I want nothing to do with licensing anymore.

180
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,520
And that's what brought me to Iggy's, the app Iggy's that's coming out in six months.

181
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,480
OK, so here's the update. I got this.

182
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,800
There's a new app called Iggy's that is coming out in six months

183
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
and it does not have any licensing.

184
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,400
Whoa, great.

185
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
I need no further information.

186
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,040
I would like to give Nathan as much money as possible.

187
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,720
Yeah. So Iggy.

188
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,400
So this is the new thing that has to be on our radar is Iggy's.

189
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,240
OK, because he's done with this as far as licensing, although he doesn't say

190
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,600
he's done with Garfield.

191
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,760
Also, you would think he might be done with Garfield.

192
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,560
Incorrect.

193
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,400
All your licensing stuff worldwide, whatever you want on this app,

194
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
it's like the Amazon official licensing.

195
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,360
No licensing.

196
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,600
So he keeps he says, OK, sorry to step back.

197
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,560
He says Iggy's is not about licensing,

198
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,120
but it's also the place like Amazon for licensing.

199
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm not sure.

200
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,880
It's that it isn't that he didn't have to make a license.

201
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,960
It's a marketplace.

202
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,200
I guess it's a more like license and licensees.

203
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,040
So we should see if we can license some of our original podcast

204
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,120
to write characters to Nathan, maybe.

205
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,560
Oh, yeah. Or other people on Iggy's.

206
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
Yes, we could get a deal.

207
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,960
There could people could eat shitty lasagna.

208
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
That's sector keepers.

209
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
Yes. Right. Yeah.

210
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
Or even one of the other sector keepers.

211
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,040
Lil Tillman for Tida.

212
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,200
Yeah.

213
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,760
Lil Tillman.

214
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,520
By the way, I just learned he's from a family of gangsters.

215
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,680
He's like, so a little scared now.

216
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
All right. Well, that's fair.

217
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,160
Three generations.

218
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,880
This is buying the paywall.

219
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,920
This is buying the paywall.

220
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,840
The paywall protects us from the villains of this world.

221
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,320
OK, so here we go.

222
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,200
There's a lot more news to break.

223
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,560
And come on Iggy's and sell their stuff.

224
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,000
If we don't have, if we don't see a contract with them in Walt Disney

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
So, yeah, it's exciting.

226
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
I'm excited.

227
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,760
He also I think I skipped by this.

228
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,200
He tells her that he's doing the Garfield documentary.

229
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,800
The Garfield.

230
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,680
Netflix. Jim is he says Jim is involved.

231
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,400
And then he says and he said, I'll say this again, Paramount knows about it.

232
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,160
Instead of saying they're making it, he will say Paramount knows about it.

233
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,840
It's like I've let them know I'm doing it.

234
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,240
So anyway, it's a priority with all this shuffling of corporate

235
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,680
mergers and streamers and what do we they're

236
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,680
they're trying to prop up Paramount Plus, but also thinking,

237
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,840
how do we keep Nathan happy?

238
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,880
Yeah, this documentary work.

239
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,640
So I started asking questions and I first make an error.

240
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,560
I call he we've talked about on the episode that he has his own version

241
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,840
of Garfield called Nath Feld.

242
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,200
Oh, yeah. And I accidentally called him Nate Field.

243
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
But I asked, when is Nate Field cartoon coming?

244
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,440
And he sees my question and he's going to answer it. Whoa.

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,480
Nath and Cartoon coming soon, soon, soon.

246
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm raising the funds for Nath Field Animation Series, and I'm not going to quit.

247
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,240
You're going to see the first pilot very soon.

248
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,320
Here we signed the first one.

249
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,760
So that's the update on that.

250
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,640
And he goes right back to the signing books.

251
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,960
If you guess, we're definitely know that's been happening.

252
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,360
Know that for sure. It's not Trump like at all.

253
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,760
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

254
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,200
We're doing that. Of course.

255
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,640
No, I was I knew you're going to ask that. And yes, he didn't ding you

256
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
know, forgetting the name wrong.

257
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,080
He did not. Yes, he was.

258
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,000
He was nice, even though I did get the name wrong.

259
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,520
And I apologize.

260
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,720
Your heart was in the right place.

261
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,840
I'm just thinking about Nath Field, which he is.

262
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,560
He lost the Garfield license, but should be fine to make a cartoon

263
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,440
about a half Garfield, half Nathan hybrid.

264
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Well, that's fine.

265
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,880
I think I skipped through the part where he tells the woman

266
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,200
that he doesn't want to just be one and done with Garfield.

267
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,080
He wants to actually go out on a good note with Garfield.

268
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,360
So I think this is all part of it. Yeah. He needs redemption. Yes.

269
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,880
So, OK, so I asked some more questions.

270
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,760
You find this work, this is after he's

271
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,840
he's making a kissy face also.

272
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,760
Cool.

273
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,960
Well, anyone suppress your

274
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,000
Nathan do the reading from the book.

275
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,440
OK, OK, I'll do a reading from the book.

276
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,200
This I did not ask for the reading from the book.

277
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,840
This is someone else.

278
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,480
I was also likely a plant.

279
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,400
He never gets to the reading in the book.

280
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,560
He never does it.

281
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,640
I'll do it. I'll do it just in a bit because there was a window

282
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,240
for fans to come in and followers to come in and customers.

283
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,280
There's a window.

284
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,880
So I'm going to do that and then I'm going to do a read.

285
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,200
Oh, you got to use the window.

286
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,760
Yeah, the window came and went.

287
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,080
Never let anyone suppress you.

288
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,720
The piece of advice, Jim Davis.

289
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,920
So now I have asked him, what is the one piece of advice

290
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Jim Davis gave you that you'll never forget?

291
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,720
Oh, cool. OK.

292
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,560
Gave me. He said, Nathan, take it.

293
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,120
It's time to take care of Nathan and let go the cat.

294
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,480
And when I had Garfield, he said, Nathan,

295
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,840
take care of the cat and the cat will take care of you.

296
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,280
So that was nice.

297
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,360
So he said that apparently he had a conversation

298
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,600
I've been recording him in a conversation where Jim Davis said,

299
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,840
you have to let go of the cat.

300
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,160
That might have been, yeah, but that might have been out loud, said more like

301
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,120
you have to let go of the cat. Right.

302
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,000
It might have been angry. Oh, that's so nice.

303
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,240
No, no, it's not.

304
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,080
OK, so then I ask, does Jim Davis like lasagna?

305
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,480
So that was nice.

306
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,480
Does Jim Davis like lasagna? Yes, he does.

307
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,720
Yeah, he does.

308
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,480
And his wife, Jill, lovely, lovely in Muncie, Indianapolis.

309
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,360
And nothing to do with Garfield.

310
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,640
Jim does still draw the comic comics for Nickelodeon under Paramount.

311
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,720
Now it was called Viacom.

312
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,840
The executive, the documentary Garfield by 2023.

313
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,440
And Jim Davis knows all about it.

314
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,680
Again, another thing where he says, and Jim knows about it.

315
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm doing a documentary. Jim knows about it.

316
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,080
It's regular stuff, normal stuff to say. Right.

317
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,240
So he does, yeah, roll again, just rolls through like three talking points.

318
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,920
Yes, Jim likes lasagna.

319
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,040
And it's like and he's set up like, all right, if I'm not talking to you,

320
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,560
then I'm talking to a plant over here.

321
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,240
And if not, I'm talking to an off camera person.

322
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,200
And do we have time for? Yeah, I think we OK.

323
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
But this fans in the window. Right, right.

324
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,600
So I then ask him,

325
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,680
would Jim Davis let you dress him in your Garfield suit?

326
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,280
And could you give him a makeover?

327
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,600
You're getting bold.

328
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,800
Would Jim Davis let you dress him in your new Garfield suit?

329
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,960
No shade, but Jim Davis use a fashion upgrade.

330
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
I would love to do a makeover on Jim.

331
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,440
No shade, but oh, my God.

332
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,680
So, yeah, he would love to. That's the answer.

333
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,920
He said love. Oh, but he liked the question.

334
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,040
So then I ask or then I say,

335
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,880
I think you should run for president and Jim Davis should be VP.

336
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,840
And he's not alarmed.

337
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,640
This is all coming from one. Of course, this is how he does.

338
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,360
Everyone is to me.

339
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,920
You'll see he makes a little he's a little he's wondering why there's a lot of this.

340
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,200
OK, so another batch to sign.

341
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,880
I think you should run for president and should be VP.

342
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,440
Imagine Jim Davis.

343
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,080
And I know that Mary Lynn and my oh, the problem is Jim, not.

344
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,720
Yeah. Imagine Jim Davis.

345
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,040
Uh huh. We can.

346
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,200
Of course, we can readily imagine what Nathan.

347
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
What citizen is he?

348
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,800
What country is he a citizen of Canada?

349
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,360
I don't know. It's a good question.

350
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,880
I guess Canada. Maybe.

351
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,840
Uh, there's also a part where I cut out where he was talking about running.

352
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,760
He doesn't want to get into politics because, you know,

353
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,800
he wants to actually do real change like Oprah doesn't want to sit in chairs

354
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,240
like Oprah, like hot Oprah, right in his book. Right.

355
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,000
So, OK, I forget what I asked next.

356
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,480
I asked something, though.

357
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,920
Oh, that Mary Lynn and my always were.

358
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,200
Now I'm just focused on Iggy's, you know.

359
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,120
OK, so I say here I say, what do you think of Heathcliff?

360
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,360
Oh, interesting.

361
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,840
And Iggy's, that's all I'm doing. Iggy's, Iggy's, Iggy's.

362
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,120
Go follow Iggy's app, you guys will follow Iggy's app.

363
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,920
I contacted Heathcliff.

364
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,520
They never they never responded.

365
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,400
You're so hot. Thank you.

366
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,240
You're so I did not say you're so hot.

367
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,840
I don't need proof of that.

368
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,040
You know, that's the whole thing.

369
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,880
So I asked about Heathcliff and he tried to get Heathcliff.

370
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,120
This is that feels so shitty to me.

371
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,920
That's like you view like you just you put like that.

372
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,040
That's, you know, how we if you make an offer to an actor for something,

373
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,000
they're not supposed to know that they were the runner up.

374
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,200
Or you're not supposed to know who else was in consideration.

375
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,760
That sucks. That's I love Jim and his advice. Right.

376
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,600
And then look how he's he would shank him in a second for Heathcliff.

377
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,840
He can make some Heathcliff lasagna.

378
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,960
I'll switch to ham.

379
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,200
I'll throw the lasagna pans in the trash.

380
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,240
I'll switch to ham.

381
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,680
So these are these are big breaking stories.

382
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,120
So in a lab, boy.

383
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, there's only a little bit left, a little bit left here.

384
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,440
And I forget what's next.

385
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,680
This and you guys asked me a lot of awfully a lot about Jim Davis.

386
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,160
Oh, he's now noticed

387
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,200
that my questions have turned exclusively to Jim Davis.

388
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,840
Nathan time, not Jim time.

389
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,200
But I do have time for one more question, because I was at this point,

390
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,440
I was like gearing up for another 30 minutes.

391
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,040
Yeah, because I thought I was all you know, the nonsense.

392
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,440
And I go, OK, we're really going to hit it hard.

393
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,280
And I got time for I think one more question here.

394
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,840
And you're doing this one hand while holding a baby.

395
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,480
Yes, I have the baby on my lap.

396
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm one handed trying to calm the baby from crying.

397
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,840
I have this in my ear.

398
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm recording the screen.

399
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,560
It's glitching out sometimes.

400
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,320
So I had to restart the video.

401
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,520
So I had to put two couple of videos together and I had to cut out

402
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,120
some like dead space.

403
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,640
You're taking Kate, you're soothing the baby and you're soothing

404
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,440
the club three members. Yes, exactly.

405
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,200
I asked the questions I asked that he did not respond to.

406
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,280
Like, do you think Jim Davis has a dark side?

407
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,960
He did not respond to that.

408
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,000
And I think there was one other one that he didn't.

409
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,440
I can't remember what it was. Oh, he hit me.

410
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,840
He hit me a number of times.

411
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,200
But he had but I learned from them.

412
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,800
Oh, I think there's a good maybe there's a good thing coming up here

413
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,480
unless I skipped it.

414
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,360
Jim Davis is good.

415
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,440
He wants to he wants to rest.

416
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,520
He's much, much, much older.

417
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,840
Yeah, Jeff Davis is old and wants to rest.

418
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,120
That's what he says to me.

419
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,600
He also says and I think I accidentally skipped through it here

420
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,280
and unless it's about to happen right now,

421
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,760
he says something along the lines of Jim Davis should have left Garfield to me.

422
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,920
I should have been the protege, he says. Jesus.

423
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,680
Yeah, he says a very dark thing there.

424
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,480
But did not elaborate, like elaborate, like I want to draw it or I wanted to.

425
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,520
He's trying to black widow. Yes. Yes.

426
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes, he left everything to me because we were such close friends.

427
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,440
Right, right.

428
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,520
So I have time for one more here.

429
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,760
He should have given me

430
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,360
I should have been the next

431
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,480
part of J.R. Garfield, sadly.

432
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,840
I should have the next protege of Garfield, sadly.

433
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Did I say in the episode that there was in one of those interviews with him,

434
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,280
one of the food and wine or something, I don't remember, but that he

435
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,560
responding to no questions said, where will I be in five years producing,

436
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,520
producing the next Garfield movie with Viacom perhaps?

437
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,400
He just would know with no prompting.

438
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,400
He thought he was going to turn the that he makes like he that he sells

439
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,760
eight lasagnas a day, maybe on a good day to into he's Garfield's film producer.

440
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,440
Well, he had he had the blessing of Jim Davis, who does like lasagna.

441
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,640
OK, so here we go. Here's the last question.

442
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,040
And I ask, will the Natfield cartoon be all ages for all ages?

443
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Whoa.

444
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,720
Yes. No, no, no, it won't be appropriate for all ages.

445
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,760
And that was it.

446
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,880
I don't like that laugh.

447
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,560
So Natfield is going to be R rated, I think it's going to be a dirty cartoon.

448
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,480
It's going to be a sausage party.

449
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,000
It's going to be a sausage party.

450
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,440
So characters who cuss now, Harley Quinn, Velma, Natfield.

451
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,200
Yeah. So you got it wrong again.

452
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,320
It's Natfield.

453
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,080
Natfield, Natfield.

454
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,680
I can understand the confusion.

455
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,320
It's OK. So it's Nathan.

456
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,280
Natfield.

457
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,400
I got his last name wrong, too.

458
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,680
But then Nathan. Yeah, I was like, OK, wait, maz.

459
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,520
But Nathan is just Nathan.

460
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,080
So there should be Nathan Field.

461
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,040
Oh, I thought it was Nate Field.

462
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,680
Yeah, that's better because Nate is like Nathan.

463
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,920
Nath, but it's Nath Field.

464
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,840
Nath Field, I think. I think so.

465
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,880
Nath like math. That's the update on things.

466
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,840
What do we think R rated Nath Field is all about?

467
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,080
I think we have to reckon with this.

468
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,600
That's a good question.

469
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,680
Does he?

470
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,080
Does Nath Field stick his dick in the lasagna?

471
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,960
You know, I think that's too body for Nathan, but I could be wrong.

472
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,800
I think it's going to be like

473
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,640
I think it's going to be like Nath Field looks in and like there's a cat

474
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,480
changing or something like he's like at a pool and it's the glasses down

475
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,920
because there's a sexy lady cat.

476
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,440
Yeah, that's what I think.

477
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,400
That's my instinct.

478
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,960
But I could be wrong. You know, you're right.

479
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,520
You might have sex with a lasagna.

480
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,880
You know how sometimes Garfield would get in his little box

481
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,320
and put his blanket on?

482
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,240
I do know that just his head would be sticking out.

483
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,160
But sometimes he'd put it all the way over.

484
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,840
So he was all the way over under the blanket.

485
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,400
If it starts rocking when that happens,

486
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,040
like the box starts shaking a little or maybe as company under there.

487
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,320
OK, like a little mouse.

488
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,040
Mousefield, yeah, his name.

489
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,600
This is a good audition friend with benefit.

490
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,000
It's kind of f buddy, you know.

491
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,480
Hey, I think we're all we'll all take a job in the writers room.

492
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,600
I mean, I think a lot of it is so if we have it's a look at the WGA,

493
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,520
I'm I'm in WGA is trying to unionize Nath Field.

494
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,720
Yeah, it's like I don't want to be good news.

495
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,040
Everyone we got an F.

496
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,280
I mean, I'll take animation guild if that's the guild.

497
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,680
That's that's what it's covered under.

498
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,320
But well, yeah, it's going to be I think I think it's going to be covered by the

499
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,000
the the the Nathers Guild.

500
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,920
OK, that sounds seems respectful.

501
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,840
I don't know what that word means, but I'm sure I can trust this.

502
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,760
The Mounties might shut this down

503
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,040
just in their traditional red garb with the big hats and they're like

504
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
kicking in doors.

505
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,240
Yeah.

506
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,720
But like the in the Untouchables, where they do a bust at the border

507
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,680
and the mountains go to just them kicking down doors, riding horses.

508
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,280
You know, on the up and up, a

509
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,440
yeah, they enforce union stuff in Canada.

510
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,320
The Mounties. What's all this about?

511
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,280
We've already shut down the Iggy app.

512
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,640
We're shutting you down now.

513
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,840
Followed the paper trail.

514
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,960
Iggy's gets going to be based out of the Cayman Islands.

515
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,360
Yeah. Right. And there's a big paper trail because you're doing animation.

516
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,360
So there's one cell and then another cell slightly different and then another

517
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,920
lift all the papers trailing through the forest from here to South.

518
